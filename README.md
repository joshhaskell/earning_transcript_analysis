# earning_transcript_analysis

1. Data Collection
First, we need to collect the earning call transcripts for airline companies over the past 10 years. You'll use the Financial Modeling Prep API for this. Modify your existing script to focus on this task. Key points to consider:

Ensure the script can handle fetching data across multiple years.
Implement error handling and logging for robustness.
Save the fetched data in a suitable format (like JSON or CSV) in the data/raw directory.
2. Data Exploration and Cleaning
Once you have the raw data:

Load and explore this data using a Jupyter notebook (notebooks/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb).
Identify any missing, inconsistent, or anomalous data.
Clean the data as needed. This might include handling missing values, standardizing formats, and parsing dates.
3. Sentiment Analysis
For the main analysis:

Implement sentiment analysis on the earning call transcripts. Libraries like NLTK or TextBlob can be handy here.
Calculate sentiment scores for each transcript.
4. Fetch Financial Data
You'll also need financial performance data for these airlines:

Use the Financial Modeling Prep API to fetch relevant financial data, such as stock prices, earnings, etc.
Align this financial data with the corresponding earning call transcripts by date.
5. Data Integration
Combine the sentiment data with the financial data:

This integrated dataset will form the basis of your analysis.
Ensure the data is aligned correctly by company and date.
6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Deep dive into the combined dataset:

Look for trends, patterns, and correlations.
Use visualizations to explore the relationship between sentiment and financial performance.
7. Statistical Analysis/Modeling
Depending on your findings from EDA:

You might apply statistical tests to ascertain the strength and significance of correlations.
If viable, consider building predictive models to see if transcript sentiment can predict financial outcomes.
8. Documentation and Reporting
As you go through these steps:

Document your findings, code, and thoughts in Jupyter notebooks.
Prepare a final report or a presentation summarizing your key findings and insights.
