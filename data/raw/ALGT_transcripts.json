And with that, I'll turn it over to Maurice.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you, Sherry, and well, hello again. Some of you may recognize my voice. I hope you've all been well the past 1.5 years. It's good to be back. As you saw in our release, Allegiant Airlines generated an operating profit in Q3 after adjustments of our 11th quarter in a row of airline operating profits beginning in Q1 of '21. Our year-to-date 2023, 13% airline operating margin leads the industry for those that have reported. And we have achieved these results while continuing to invest for the future. During the past quarter, we've installed two substantial management systems, SAP and Navitaire, both are operating as I write this. As you saw at the top of our release Sunseeker will open December 15. It's been a five-year effort, almost three years longer than planned, but the wait will be worth it. Micah Richins, our Sunseeker President and his cohorts, Jason Shkorupa and Paul Berry, all MGM Las Vegas veterans are putting the final touches on this magnificent project. The critical reason I endorsed Sunseeker was the quality of this management group. Our ability to attract these gentlemen to convince them to work for a startup, move their families to Florida, speaks volumes of their belief in this project. And Micah is here with us today, I'm happy to announce to answer any questions. Our first MAX 8200 is scheduled for delivery in early 2024. Our MAX fleet will have a premium seating of just over 50 of our 190 seats. And we'll improve our economics in the coming years, besides the benefits from the quality and number of seats that will have a substantially improved fuel burn compared to the Airbus, improved reliability, maintenance time, while maintaining a comparable Airbus ownership expense. We're excited about onboarding the MAX in coming years and beyond. During the past few months, there have been discussions concerning the structural shift in our industry, particularly as it pertains to the ULCCs. We stirred in Frontier invented this industry segment during the past 20 years, focusing on low cost and high growth for our leisure customers. There's been and still are differences between our business model and the Frankie-centric model. At the end of the day, you judge us on our profitability. Costs are a part of the equation, but having the lowest cost does not guarantee success. We at Allegiant have a flexible model focused on flying when the customers want to fly. Or said differently, we minimize our flying in off-peak periods and peak up for the peak periods. That has been our model for over 20 years. In addition, our direct-to-customer sales approach is less expensive and allows us to capture important customer information. I might add we have over 18 million names in our customer database at this point. It also allows us to capture more of a leisure customers wallet with our third-party revenue program. During the past five years, we have prioritized enhancing our brand as well. These efforts include adding Allegiant Stadium, our soon to be open Sunseeker Resort, our best in show completion percentage, and our number one ranked credit card program. All are difference makers. These investments have allowed us to maintain unit revenues that have been consistently higher than the high utilization ULCCs. Today, as much as 40% higher. As we all know, revenue production is the issue of the day. Our revenue production is one of the critical differences that separates us from the ULCC crowd. Our network structure is also different. We have operated in an out and back schedule since our earliest days. It's much simpler to manage than the traditional hub and spoke. Each route stands alone. We monitor what we believe its capacity should be and hence its profitability. We are diligent in managing individual route earnings. We have had a 22-year history of consistent profits and growth with this scheduling approach, industry-leading profits, I might add. Additionally, with our focus on smaller cities to sun and find destinations, we've been able to own the majority of our markets. 75% of our routes have no direct competition. As I said, we own these markets. This contrasts with the 90% overlap the high utilization ULCC is having in our networks. Lastly, we have identified as many as 1,400 new domestic routes that we could add in the coming years, plus the addition of our international partnership with Viva. More subtle difference has been the pace of growth. During our 22 years, we've grown to 127 aircraft or an average of 5.7 per year. Others in this space have grown at a much faster pace. To date, adding aircraft almost 3x faster per year than we have. Still others have planned deliveries in the coming years that have double digit yearly ads with a three handle if you do the math. Fast growth while attractive to the audience on the phone here creates potential operational problems including a concentrated fleet of the same aircraft type which has historically been desired but today has become a burden with the Pratt Motor problem. Operational size and complexity that most likely outpaces management experience, and lastly a pronounced competitive response given the network overlap with the larger incumbent carriers. We are built for the long haul for consistency. We have a bright future. I understand there's a new label as well for ULCC circulating LMAs or low margin airlines. That description does not define nor fit our model. At this time, given the names seem to be involved, given new names, I'm proposing a new label for us. No more ULCC and certainly no LMA. Our new label is PLFC, Profitable Leisure Focus Carrier. That's what we're going to be called from now on. We are in a class of our own. Lastly, let me thank our team members. There's been a difficult 3 to 4 years. They have been supporting our passengers with safe, reliable, and friendly service during this time. They have run the best airline this year, an industry leading 99.8% completion factor. In today's era of poor service and canceled flights, they have put us back where we belong, at the top of the pack. Thank you very much. Greg?\nGreg Anderson: Maury, thank you. Great to have you back. As we experience broader macro uncertainty around geopolitical risk inflation and high interest rates there also appear to be signs of structural changes happening in our industry. In the face of these uncertainties, Allegiant is uniquely set up to continue to reshape the leisure travel sector. We have been strengthening our foundation to do just that. Operational excellence underpins everything we do and our year-to-date controllable completion of 99.8% demonstrates that also resulting in a staggering reduction of nearly $100 million or 75% in total IROP costs year-over-year. Our disciplined approach to costs and particularly our variable cost model gives us a competitive advantage as we adjust capacity to the environment. Whether day of week month of year or route by route, our planning teams are expertly matching capacity with leisure demand. As leisure demand seasonality has more normalized we are working towards a measured approach to take utilization higher during the peak demand periods or in other words peak the peaks. For instance, average aircraft utilization was seven hours during this past summer increasing that by one hour would drive roughly $50 million more in earnings. The composition of our mix fleet balanced with both low per seat and low per trip costs will further benefit us by deploying the right gauge aircraft in the right markets at the right time. Our 737 MAX aircraft will strengthen our fleet flexibility. It's nearly 20% fuel burn advantage yet similar ownership cost profile translates into incremental earnings power of more than two million more per Max aircraft when compared to our existing fleet. Furthermore, we are excited to expand premium sittings for our customers. Every MAX aircraft delivered will enter into service in the Allegiant extra configuration while the retrofit of the in-service A320 has already begun and will complete over time. Our Allegiant Extra product continues to deliver as it is in high demand with our customers and driving meaningful value. During 2023, we expect to fly nearly 18 million customers. Notably, we were the most convenient and only nonstop option available on approximately 75% of the routes from the communities we serve. Our direct distribution strategy coupled with our continued ascension of our brand is unlocking deep and long-standing relationships with our customers. On an annual basis nearly two-thirds of our customers are repeating their experience with us 12 million of whom are members of our award-winning Allways rewards fueling the amazing growth of our aspirational loyalty program that Scott will discuss momentarily. Our continued investments in technological upgrades to our foundational systems such as SAP Navitaire, Trax and NAVBLUE not only optimize scale and provide new capabilities they also free up development resources for strategic differentiated products to drive more revenue or reduce costs. Furthermore Navitaire will unlock international expansion for us into coveted beach destinations in Mexico alongside our joint venture partner Viva Aerobus once we can secure the necessary government approvals. Each of these initiatives mentioned have or should provide significant long-term benefits for the company. However, none have near as creative impact as Team Allegiant. As we listen and learn from our team members across the system, I am constantly energized by their commitment and their passion. They are dedicated to taking care of our customers and each other. And while earlier this year we ratified and extended two of our four labor agreements we still have two to go one with flight attendants and one with pilots. I want to reiterate management's commitment to getting agreements in place that our flight crews will be proud to support. What Team Allegiant has accomplished this year is truly remarkable. While today our broad footprint serves 125 cities with over 550 routes throughout the United States we are positioning to grow our airline profitably as the environment allows. Allegiant's business model and the role we play in the communities we serve has netted us into the fabric of the nation's leisure travel industry. We have identified 1400 plus incremental routes that fit beautifully into the Allegiant network. As we expand in those markets we further solidify the important and necessary part we play in the travel industry throughout the US. And in closing I want to extend my sincere thanks to all of our team members. Together we are running a great airline. Together we have meaningfully strengthened our foundation and together Team Allegiant has proven to be unstoppable. Thank you. Scott?\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, Greg. Third quarter saw a continued post-pandemic normalization of domestic leisure travel demand. We saw peak demand levels during July when we top bookings and load factor versus last year's historic highs we saw slight demand decline during August versus prior year as back to school came mid-month for many of the cities we serve and summer vacation season came to an end. And we saw further modest demand decline in September versus prior year as we officially entered the off-peak leisure travel season. As you all know our business model has always focused on the domestic leisure traveler and these peak versus off-peak ebbs and flows in domestic leisure travel demand regularly existed before the pandemic and a year removed from unprecedented levels of pent-up revenge travel demand in 2022 the same familiar ebbs and flows have returned this year. That said, there are two areas of potential domestic leisure travel demand headwinds that are being talked about a lot in the industry and that I'd like to address based on what we're seeing and hearing from our customers at Allegiant. The first is the economy. We conduct a weekly customer sentiment tracking survey where we ask our customers how they feel about the state of the economy. At the beginning of the third quarter about 50% said they felt the economy was getting somewhat or much worse. In the past several weeks, that number has grown to nearly 70%. However, during that same time span as captured within the same survey the portion of customers saying they intend to book air travel in the next 90 days has remained virtually unchanged. We believe this seeming contradiction can be easily explained by the majority of our customers who say they are traveling to visit friends or family as well as by the material portion of our customers who say they are traveling between a primary residence and a second vacation home. As we've stated in the past, it's been our experience that these remain the most reliable and resilient forms of leisure travel during economic downturns. The second area is international travel. For the past quarter, we've also surveyed our customers weekly on this topic. Consistently, up to 20% of our customers do say that they either had traveled or planning to travel abroad this year. However, the vast majority of those nearly 90% said that their international travel is in addition to not in substitution of their domestic leisure travel plans. While these observations may be different than what other airlines are seeing or saying it likely speaks to Allegiant's differentiated low-utilization business model with a focus on selling our all-nonstop route network direct to consumers under a surging brand and winning loyalty programs that are unique and their ability to engage and reward the domestic leisure traveler. Speaking of our loyalty programs, our most lot and engage segment within the Allways Rewards program is of course our co-brand credit card holders. Third quarter year-to-date these cardholders have exhibited 11% greater spend on the card on a per cardholder basis versus last year. In addition, our co-brand cardholders continue to exhibit strong travel frequency and spend with net revenue burped up 10% versus prior year. Through third quarter total co-brand credit card program compensation has been $88 million which is 14% higher than last year and puts us well on our way to surpassing $100 million in total program compensation for the full year. Our Allways Rewards noncredit card program also continues to show strong positive impact on customer behavior. Third quarter year-to-date nearly 13 million Allways Rewards member passenger segments have been booked that' 17% more than last year and for the same time period spend per member is about 5% greater than last year. Finally as Maurice mentioned completion of enterprise-wide systems implementations that provide a modern technology foundation for all areas of our business will free up technology development capacity for smaller but nonetheless critical strategic enhancements to our website mobile app and loyalty programs helping us supercharge our ability to drive greater revenue outside the aircraft and high-margin third-party products and loyalty program partnerships. We believe that these enhancements enable us to further differentiate Allegiant and further diversify the ways we drive revenue. And with that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Revenue Officer, Drew Wells.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm extremely pleased with the record third quarter performance of $565 million in total revenue, growth of nearly 1% on system ASM reduction of 0.4%. This combination produced a TRASM of $12.78, which vested any previous third quarter and grew year-over-year by 1.4%. Our commitment to matching capacity and demand set us up for success in the third quarter with nearly 45% of our scheduled ASMs coming in July and in September having just more than half of July flying. However, we are still meaningfully constrained in the best demand period, limiting our ability to truly match with appropriate capacity. Despite the relatively outweighted July level of flying, our utilization is almost 2.5 hours per aircraft per day lower than 2019, lower than any years since 2015 when MD-80s grew over 60% of our ASMs. We have proven the ability to achieve peak line and as we will always schedule peak periods to the first operational constraint, either aircraft or crew, expect to restore utilization alongside the release of those constraints. As we continue to learn what the new normal means for the travel industry, one component of pre-pandemic travel has firmly returned, the gap between peak and off-peak performance. By way of example, Saturdays and post Labor Day, September 2023 were approximately 30% worse than July Saturdays in terms of unit revenue and in line with 2019's peak trough variance. Last year, that figure was just 15% worse. And as one would expect, the combination of outperforming off-peak periods in late 2022 and current year demand normalizing creates a tough environment for year-over-year figures. This makes me even prouder of the results we generated. A significant part of this was continued success of our air ancillary products, which grew approximately 10% on a per passenger basis year-over-year. First and foremost, our learning and experimenting with bundled ancillaries continue to show incredible strides. Additionally, Allegiant extra contribution on a per flight basis has improved year-over-year in every quarter despite increasing the number of configured aircraft. We will end the year with roughly 11% of the fleet configured for Allegiant Extra and expect that to grow to nearly 30%, of the year-end 2024 fleet. Underscoring both in air ancillary at large are the expected improvements of Navitaire, one of the ramifications of specific use case internal development is some mismatch of existing capabilities versus the off-the-shelf products. I truly believe this is a significant signal of strength for our internal capabilities that will become supercharged in the future state. So while we still have immense confidence in the upside to come with Navitaire, we actually expect to see some slight headwinds into the fourth quarter due to a short-term small loss of functionality. I believe it's worth reminding that the entire leisure demand ecosystem remains well above pre-pandemic levels with July roughly flat with 2022 and high teen percent above 2019. In fact among carriers reporting thus far Allegiant is the only carrier of double digits in both capacity and unit revenue year-over-year both in the third quarter and year-to-date through the third quarter. We are also seeing some normalcy as we shift into 4Q and expect a TRASM reasonably in line with pre-pandemic historic median sequential change while certainly off from the extraordinary 4Q 2022 comp it should still produce a better 4Q TRASM than any pre-pandemic fourth quarter and the last nine months 2023 TRASM higher than the last nine months 2022. Additionally, there is some growth through the fourth quarter around 5%. This should put full year scheduled service capacity up approximately 1.5% versus full year 2022 while system capacity should be approximately plus 1.8%. The growth in the quarter is focused in two areas: weeks with large forecasted cost per gallon decline like in October and holiday weeks which will extend into early January 2024 as well. As I mentioned even with the growth holiday flying will still be lower than we can ultimately desire. However, we believe we struck the right balance of profitability potential and operations within the limitations present particularly after 2022's weather impacted holiday operations across the industry. Further we are treading carefully with capacity in early 2024 with so many moving parts Boeing deliveries crew polls for transition training and persistent elevated fuel among others. I expect the first half of the year to be fairly flat with a full year target of up mid-single digits. The holiday weeks as with all peaks have shown incredible resilience. Even Labor Day in September was a record. I maintain high expectations for holiday performance while expecting normal leisure softness around them. And with that, I'd lie to turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Neal: Thanks, Drew, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported our third quarter 2023 financial results which included an adjusted consolidated net income of $2.7 million and an adjusted earnings per share of $0.09. Included in that number is approximately $6 million in costs related to, resort operations ahead of opening our Sunseeker property later this year. Adjusted net income for the airline was $7.9 million yielding an adjusted airline earnings per share of $0.31. Total operating revenue during the quarter was $565 million up approximately 1% over the same quarter last year and the highest of any third quarter in our history. This was on a slight capacity reduction of 0.8% resulting in TRASM of $0.1278 which was 1.4% higher as compared to the same quarter last year. Fuel costs increased sharply beginning mid-August driving a September cost per gallon 27.5% above July. This brought our third quarter cost per gallon to $3.09 15% above the prior quarter and brings our estimated full year cost per gallon to $3.12 an increase of $0.22 from the prior guide of $2.90. Adjusted non-fuel unit costs were just under $0.085 which was an increase of 9.5% over the third quarter of 2022. Our non-fuel unit cost increase was driven by approximately seven points in wage increases for frontline employees inclusive of our pilot payroll accrual which was in place for all three months during the quarter. Other drivers of the unit cost increase were 1.7 points from lower asset utilization and approximately 0.5 point related to inflationary cost in aircraft maintenance and stations and the rest from a handful of other items. Assuming an estimated fuel cost of $3.12 per gallon for the full year we are expecting an adjusted airline earnings per share of approximately $8.15 at the midpoint down from $11.75 at the midpoint of prior guidance. Fuel costs drive a reduction of $2.40 per share and the reduced off-peak revenue makes up most of the remaining $1.20. As Maury noted, opening of Sunseeker has shifted by about two months. And as a result, we are now expecting only about two weeks of revenue production during the year, which would take our full year Sunseeker guidance to the loss per share of $1.75 as compared to our prior estimate of $1.20. Although I'm pleased to see significant improvement in 2023 over the prior year with respect to financial performance, we still have work to do to return to sustained industry-leading margins. With the introduction of a new fleet type alongside a volatile fuel environment and the normalization of leisure demand patterns, we expect to take a conservative and measured approach to growth during next year. We've made significant investments in the business this year, and we remain confident these investments will deliver expanding margins in the coming years. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net debt of $1.3 billion and just under $1.3 billion in available liquidity, which included $1 billion in cash and investments and $280 million in undrawn revolvers. In addition, we are pleased to have more than $400 million in committed financing for upcoming aircraft deliveries and pre-delivery deposits. We refinanced seven A320 aircraft during the quarter and used proceeds towards this morning's prepayment of a $150 million bond, which was scheduled to mature in 2024. With committed financing covering the vast majority of our CapEx obligations up to the second quarter of next year and our largest 2024 maturity now repaid, we expect to maintain liquidity at the greater of two times our air traffic liability or $850 million at year-end. Third quarter airline capital expenditures were $157.6 million, which included $112 million in aircraft inductions and pre-delivery deposits, $45.5 million in other airline CapEx and deferred heavy maintenance spend of $14 million. Capital expenditures related to Sunseeker were $71.6 million. Our guidance today reduces our full year 2023 estimated airline CapEx, excluding heavy maintenance to approximately $590 million largely due to the timing of aircraft deliveries shifting some of this spend into 2024 and 2025. Turning to fleet. We inducted one A320 aircraft during the quarter, which was owned on property at the end of the second quarter. We expect two additional A320 purchases during the fourth quarter before we begin taking deliveries of our 737 MAX order book in early 2024. During the quarter, we reached agreement with Boeing on an amendment to our order for 50 737 MAX aircraft, whereby, the firm aircraft are now scheduled to deliver through the fourth quarter of 2025. We've converted six of our MAX seven positions to the MAX A200 variant, and we're pleased to now have 80 options in our MAX order book, securing opportunities for fleet growth through 2029 and providing tremendous flexibility, allowing us to evaluate the results of a new fleet type in our business prior to making further commitments. I'm pleased with our year-to-date financial performance, yielding an adjusted airline operating margin of roughly 13%, notwithstanding, the continued heightened fuel. Our loan utilization model sets us up nicely to expertly deploy capacity to meet seasonal demand trends, and we will enhance this with the introduction of more efficient aircraft next year. By the time of our next earnings call, we expect to have opened Sunseeker, taking delivery of our first MAX aircraft and starting to see the benefits of Navitaire and the systems investments we've made in 2023. Certainly, we're not out of the woods on execution risk yet, but we are excited about the positive momentum we have on these initiatives heading into 2024. Thank you, Lisa, and we can now begin taking analyst questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will be coming from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open \nQ \u2013 Shannon Doherty: Hi, everyone this is actually Shannon Doherty on for Mike. Maury, congratulations and welcome back. If I may you guys first half results were much better than the second half. It was actually quite a meaningful deceleration in earnings into the second half. So, how does that impact your decision-making for 2024 when you think about capacity, which markets to serve fleet planning if you can give us anything -- any more color here that would be helpful.\nGreg Anderson: Hi, Shannon this is Greg. Why don't I kick it off. There are some components in the first half of the year. Obviously, demand strength in the off-peak fuel that helped fuel that the higher profitability versus the second half of the year. But as we think about 2024, we're not coming out and to give a guide this year, but I think BJ hit on it really nicely in his remarks where we should think about 2024 of unlocking a lot of the benefits and the investments that we've made. First and foremost from my perspective, we want to continue to work hard and get labor deals complete for our flight crews. That's a key component systems. Both Maury and I alluded to this, as it's Scott DeAngelo, in our opening remarks that we've made massive investments in new kind of next generational type systems. And when I say investments I mean these are hundreds of thousands of man hours that we've been putting in on each one of these systems SAP Trax. We've cut those two over. We have two more to go. And what we're going to do with those systems, now is we're going to get better. We're going to learn how to use them properly. We're going to become more efficient; we can scale better. So that's an important element as well. Obviously, Sunseeker opening bringing on the Boeing aircraft. So there's just been a lot of investments in the business, that I think truly believe will strengthen us. The one thing I want to say is you think about capacity next year and balancing that with the environment and the normalization that we've seen it's how do we get back to peak in those peaks. And we've been constrained for various reasons, whether that be the broader ecosystem ATC whether that be labor. But really, if you think about 2023 and if you remember a year ago when we talked about entering 2023 we said, we needed to level set operations. We need to make sure we ran an integrity -- operational excellence and integrity and we've done that. And now it's how do we balance and build that back. And as we think about peaking the peaks I'm not sure if Drew or anyone wants to add any commentary there for next year or anything else on 2024 .\nDrew Wells: Yes. I hit on this a little bit in my remarks, but the peaks are subject to any operational constraint all of the time, right? And right now it's a bit more constraining than typical. We earn a significant amount of our annual earnings through those periods. There will come a time that we get some relief on those constraints and then we will be able to peak. We've been kept relatively similar in terms of departures per peak day in the summer for the last several years, which is not something we've experienced in the past. Beyond that, we've taken a lot of strides to maintain operational integrity and we kind of throw a lot of things at that. And now we can start to claw those back in a meaningful way we start to understand how each of those components build up to the whole. So I think what you're seeing is something that's on the more conservative side relative to what we've thrown out before. We've proven that we can do peak close to 10 hours a day and then I have every bit of confidence we'll get back there.\nMaurice Gallagher: Well, one other comment. The third quarter is always our weakest quarter. And what we've got going on now is our fourth quarter just hasn't shown up, because we've got a resetting of going back to traditional network types of things and people are trying to get back into a form factor that they're used to. And so Drew and Greg's point we need to now --2024 will be the first time I think when we can really look and reinstitute the 2019 model that we so well ran back then. And that we may not be hitting on all similars in 2024, but we'll be well on our way through our typical very good first quarter very good second quarter third quarter breakeven week fourth quarter start getting ready for the next year and do the same thing.\nQ \u2013 Shannon Doherty: Thank you. And did I hear you guys correctly that we should think first quarter capacity somewhat flat and still targeting mid-single digits next year capacity for the full year?\nScott DeAngelo: Generally, yes first half of the year probably roughly flat with mid-singles but full year target.\nQ \u2013 Shannon Doherty: Okay. Great. And if I can squeeze one more in really quickly. Greg and you guys thank you for all the remarks on utilization, but I was intrigued by the one-hour increase in utilization that could have possibly increased profits by $50 million. If you were to just pinpoint what is limiting you the most right now on increasing your aircraft regulation? I know you guys listed a bunch of things like ETC labor. Where is the biggest pain point currently?\nGreg Anderson: No, thanks for the question, Shannon. And that would be just in the summer period. So if you think about it on a full year the summers are -- so longest peak period. But if you add March and you end the winter of the holidays, it's probably more like $100 million in total if you're able to take an hour up to utilization. I'd say, it just depends on the stuff on the as we were more aircraft constrained. In the summer it's been more labor constraints, but also trying to balance what we're seeing with some of the disruptions around airports or ATC. But kind of underpinning all of this Shannon though is operational integrity and we capped our peak period flying this year before we even enter it. We just said we won't do any more than this roughly seven hours per day until we build it back.\nMaurice Gallagher : And I might just add real quick, that's the biggest components to peaking the peaks. But we probably launched between half hour an hour of utilization simply with elevated fuel and kind of the demand versus fuel bake-offs happened in off-peak periods. But there's still value to be had in of piece despite all of this, but it's much harder to find at $3.50 a gallon than it is at $2.15, kind of where we were in 2019. So I don't want to fully lose sight of that either.\nQ \u2013 Shannon Doherty: Yes. Thank you all for your time.\nOperator: Thank you. While we prepare the next question. Our next question will be coming from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. Could I ask you about your 2024 fleet plan, Boeing you said two more Airbus and then kind of is it the rest of Boeing then and hopefully, you'll get to a month?\nRobert Neal: Yes. So Savi, it's BJ. For 2024, we are currently -- we are contracted to take delivery of two airplanes per month throughout 2024. As you know, and I think you're alluding to, there's a lot of moving parts there. So we're staying close to Boeing on that. And it's for that reason that we kept a good amount of flexibility in the used fleet that we'll keep in service for next year. Candidly, there's a few other candidates out there that we would like to retire a little bit more quickly, but we're going to keep those in through next year as a bit of an insurance policy. The two A320s that you're talking about are purchased this year and inducted in, I think, January, February or sometime during the first quarter of next year. And then we have the MAX aircraft entering service late first quarter and building on that throughout the year. On the high end, I would expect the total fleet count around 141, 41, but that's not guidance. That's about as high as we go.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And then if I might, you've heard some of your competitors talking about where a lot of the extra capacity is in some of the kind of bigger markets, crowded markets, and wanting to redeploy the capacity. I'm wondering and on the other hand too you have regional airlines that I think trends are bottoming and maybe starting to as you get into 2024, possibly being able to pick up their utilization as well. Just curious kind of based on the visibility you have what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint in your markets?\nDrew Wells: Yes. Drew here. The relative level of competition has been quite flat for the better part of two years and is relatively in line with what we saw in 2019. Obviously the dynamics change a little bit who it is and where it is, but the overall level has been remarkably consistent.\nSavi Syth: And that's what you're seeing in the forward schedules, Drew here?\nDrew Wells: Correct.\nMaurice Gallagher: So you're just going to -- you can't see capacity grow with the way fuel stays at this level and there's a good argument to suggest, it's been permanently changed given the environmental issues and what's going on in the world. Capacity can't grow that much if people are going to make money. It just doesn't work. Capacity has got to come out to raise pairs to offset the fuel increases. So that's a macro statement.\nSavi Syth: Is that negative for your model too Maurice, isn't it? Because you talk about leisure, travel?\nMaurice Gallagher: I'm not going to sit here and say we're going to grow like a weed but we have better opportunities to grow because we have less competition. I think we're not facing a lot of headwinds that everybody else is with our 75% noncompetitive. And that profile will continue we believe going forward. So it's not a rosy picture for the industry. I'm not going to sit here and say it is but oil has to come down somewhat. It's the big variable we can all face.\nGreg Anderson: And further -- so remember, we can pull our September capacity down to half of what we do in July as a reflection of the broader fuel environment recognizing that demand is thick enough in the peaks to withstand the capacity and we're going to withdraw it where it doesn't make sense for all factors including fuel. So I feel really good about how we think about capacity deployment in the face of persistent high fuel.\nSavi Syth: That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Welcome back. Drew, maybe you could just expand on your RASM commentary. I think you made some statement like normal sequential change or normal seasonal change in RASM. Could you just expand on that?\nDrew Wells: Yes. I mean just look back I think I was leaving even like 2005 to 2019 sequential change in absolute TRASM from 3Q to 4Q seems to be the right barometer as we're looking at 2023. So hopefully that gets to what you're driving at.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes. It just looks like it's up in -- or sorry in 2018 and 2019, it looks like it's up sequentially. So I just want to make sure that's not what you're suggesting there.\nDrew Wells: 2018 and 2019 were definitely on the high end of -- if you look at all, however, many in 14, 15 years there. So I would expect something sequentially less than that, but in line if you take a much bigger sample.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then just taking a step back, I know you've got some of the team on the phone here, but early thoughts on Sunseeker ramp in 2024? What kind of top line and EBITDA margins we should be thinking about? I understand this could be a two to three year ramp, but maybe in year one, how you're thinking about it.\nMaurice Gallagher: Micah, can you comment\nMicah Richins: Yes, I think right now, it's really too early for us to guide. We're happy now to just be announcing the date being able to kick off our bookings and get going on the marketing. The real indicator -- the only real indicator that we have right now is group bookings that are on the books and we've got about 30,000 on the books and another 32,000 that are--\nMaurice Gallagher: 35,000 room nights.\nMicah Richins: Yes. So, that's probably the best leading indicator right now. We're still outside the booking window and we'll know a lot more in about 90 days.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Well, good luck with the launch. Thank you.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you, Duane.\nOperator: Thank you Our next question will be coming from Scott Group of Wolfe. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Yes. Hi. It's -- I think this is me. It's Scott. I think you called me. The -- I just want to -- Maury, you made a comment about -- I get the seasonality in Q3 we see that. You made a comment about like Q4 is a lower margin this year. I wasn't sure I was following your point. Can you just maybe go back to that?\nMaurice Gallagher: Well, it just goes to the theme that we've got more in the way of off-peak flying that we can't peak-up as much as we have historically because of just utilization crews, all the things we've talked about. We're somewhat relearning how to do all this stuff too, I might add. But our first priority this year was to make sure we ran a good operation. So, we didn't -- we got conservative and pulled back being pushy and edgy that we might have been in the past times. If you go back to 2019 versus 2018, we flew eight hours a day, and we came out of -- we only had, I think, like 775 airplanes down from 90 airplanes in 2018 when we moved out of the MDs. And we pushed the edge and that saw dramatic benefits of being able to push the utilization up. So, those are the things we have to relearn and we'll do that. That's one of our top priorities going into 2024 and beyond.\nScott Group: Okay. And then just following up on that last question, can you just maybe be a little bit more explicit with what you're assuming for RASM or at least what that historical 3Q to 4Q, absolute RASM trend should be? I just want to make sure we're all on the same page. And then in an environment where capacity is up mid-single-digits next year, any early thoughts how you're thinking about CASM for next year? thank you.\nRobert Neal: Yes, I'll take the first part and maybe I missed something is the look around the table. Just taking the absolute RASM from third quarter, the absolute RASM from fourth quarter historically, we've tended to step up a little bit, not by a huge amount, low singles. That's generally what I'm expecting. So, not a year-over-year commentary, but simply an metered sequential.\nGreg Anderson: Hey Scott. This is Greg real quick. I know we haven't put out quarterly guide. So, we're getting there, you can kind of back into it with the fourth quarter, but I think it might just be helpful to Maury's comment about the third quarter being the weakest seasonally for us and what you saw in the third quarter airline EPS. I just want to say that fourth quarter airline EPS, the midpoint of our guide, we expect it to be stronger than the third quarter. Sometimes with the weighted average share counts and what's happening on that side of the house and the lower overall share count that we have, kind of, highlights or pronounces the swings, but I just wanted to make sure that, that came across that we expect the fourth quarter airline EPS to be higher than the third quarter. And then sorry, BJ, I didn't mean to jump in there on your 2024 costs.\nRobert Neal: No, no that's great. I mean we're in the middle, Scott, of our budget process for 2024. So not ready to give a guide on CASMx for next year. And I'll just say there are a lot of moving parts around delivery of the Boeing aircraft induction of those airplanes having crew members ready et cetera. But on kind of the capacity guidance that Drew put out there we would expect CASMx to be up a little bit next year. I don't want to give a number yet.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you, guys, appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Daniel McKenzie of [Technical difficulty] Global. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Oh, hey, thanks. Maury, welcome back here. A couple of questions. I guess the first is really a house cleaning question on Sunseeker. I know you don't want to elaborate on 2024, but at least for the fourth quarter here, Does the full year EPS outlook include or exclude Sunseeker revenue? And then once it opens, can you share at least what you're seeing today in terms of occupancy and booked room rates?\nMaurice Gallagher: Hey, Dan. I'll start with the first question. The outlook on Sunseeker for full year 2023 does include some revenue, but it's very, very minimal, assuming that you're only open for two weeks out of the year and you're just kind of barely opening. You're not expected to be at any kind of full run rate. So there's some in there, but I wouldn't run away with that for 2024, or 2023, I'm sorry.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. All right. And then I guess in terms of the occupancy room rates I understand it's in there. And Drew going back to your commentary of peak periods being scheduled to aircraft and crew constraints. I am looking at the back half of December and it looks like Allegiant flying is down 14% year-over-year. And so I guess a couple of questions tied to that. One is that accurate? And then secondly, is that tied to constraints? And I'm just wondering if we should model these constraints extending into peak March 2024 flying as well potentially.\nDrew Wells: I think what you're capturing there is some of the shift in the holiday timing as well. So the, let's call it the third week of December with a pretty meaningful capacity in December of 22 as the travel started a bit sooner. That week comes down, I believe it's about 22%, and then you get a little bit of growth into the more peak, call it last, I don't know, 10 days or so of the month. So I think a competitor called this out as well. But there will be a downshift in the mid-part of December that's kind of captured on the upside at the beginning of January. That I think explains most of what you're seeing. I see.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Very good. Thanks for the time, you guys.\nDrew Wells: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question for today will be coming from Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Your line is open.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. I thank you called me. As you think about load factor versus yields, you're not trying to talk about pricing. Just like from a high level, as you think in the 2024, there seems to be a lot of discounting to fill seats. I'm just curious on what you're viewing as the key priority in building revenue next year? Thank you.\nDrew Wells: Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day, total revenue is the end game. I think you'll see yields be more resilient in the peaks. And then us making sure that we're capitalizing on $70 of total ancillary per passenger through the rest of the year, which is generally driven by load factor build as a general rule of thumb. So, I would kind of separate those two elements like that. But at the end of the day we need to make sure that we're maximizing that ancillary component.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then on the 1,400 route comment that you had all the opportunities going forward I'm just -- you've always had a lot of ad opportunities. So I'm just -- your cost structure is obviously a lot higher. So I'm just trying to understand how that changes with a higher cost base. And then if you could just touch on where you sit with the pilots today and what's going on there that would be helpful. That's world help. Thank you very much.\nDrew Wells: Sure. On 1,400 route I mean we're still extremely confident in that. I think you have to strip it back a little bit into a fixed versus variable type of thought on that cost structure right in fuel we'll see. I mean, that's as variable as it gets. But for the rest of the cost structure it still supports all of these 1,400 routes as the fixed cost portion will kind of take care of itself as we get back to utilization we get back to growing again, but again that's not how we think about new network deployment. It's all on a variable basis.\nGreg Anderson: Hey, Conor it's Greg. I might try to hit on a couple of other parts there. On the cost to Drew's point keep in mind, we're accruing this year at least beginning in May accruing for increased labor agreement with our pilots. But increase in productivity of just a half hour in utilization per aircraft per day is worth like 0.5% of CASMx. So you have that that, I think over time I mentioned that we've invested in this infrastructure where the infrastructure has outpaced ASMs, but we're going to get back there. And when we did the system cutovers everyone has their day job and these are massive system cutovers. And so the philosophy was measure twice cut once get it, done but it's going to allow us to scale and grow more efficiently. And then on the pilot side of the house just the trends are meaningfully improving. Just to put that into perspective in the first half of '23 if you think about net new pilots we were flat whereas in the back half of 2023 we'll have over 100 or we expect over 100 net new pilots. And that's twofold. One attrition is meaningfully down. But two the classes are full and they remain full. And in fact applications over the past couple of months have more than doubled. And I think our the shout out to our Fios team and the focus that they have in their pathway programs and making sure that we're identifying the pilots that want to be here at Allegiant. We have a unique quality of life offering overall which is that out-and-back model, but the most important thing that we need to do and I keep saying this is we're working hard and we're committed to getting a deal done for our pilots for our flight attendants and that's a key focus for us and we'll carry that in and trying to get that done as soon as possible.\nMaurice Gallagher: Conor, let me editorial on top of that. You can't understand the mindset inside of an airline in March February with the pilot issues going on. You just didn't know what was going to happen particularly ,if you're in the middle of the sandwich like we are where a lot of our guys are going up the hill to American Delta and United. And can you -- we literally train 200 pilots in 2022 and kept 10. So a lot of expenses going in just to training these guys but now that you're seeing the world I mean Spirit announced they're not hiring any pilots for 2024. I mean, there's a radical shift in mindset of how you can think about having access to crews. And for us we need to make sure we get -- we need some extra crews certainly for the Boeing as we transition. So we needed to have that type of mindset and it's there. To Greg's point get a contract done. Our pilots are very much on board with growing this business and we're also being much more selective in who we bring into the business. We need to know that they want to be in our model and want to be here long term not to say we weren't selective before but it was much more could you fly an airplane than what are your personal needs. So, those are the kinds of things we've learned from this effort. And not only us, but everybody in this industry is going to be much more comfortable that they can make a forecast on pilots and availability. So you can put a schedule out nine months from now and still operate it.\nConor Cunningham: Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Hey everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Maury, welcome back. Maury or maybe Greg, just on the pilots here. Where are you, kind of where do those negotiations stand right now? And if you can, just what are the sort of the key holdups at this point?\nGreg Anderson: Hey Andrew, it's Greg. So earlier this year, we combined with the union, started remediation process. And while we're progressing, candidly, it's not at the rate I'd like to see. So -- but we're still working through it. And there's a variety of items we're working through, but we understand the important items that we need to get done to get a competitive contract is fair in our view. And I have all the confidence that we'll continue to make progress, and then we'll get a deal done.\nMaurice Gallagher: Yes, Andrew, there is some practical applications. We're both at the table young in our maturity in many ways in doing a contract. This group of pilots has never been involved in negotiating a contract before and so they're, I think, kind of feeling their way forward as to what that they want to see in a contract and you have proper people at the table that know how to do this. So United American and Delta have been 70 years. They have 500 page contracts that they don't have a lot to talk about. We've got a lot of items that are still young and tender and both sides need to feel their way through it. So to Greg's point, it's been slower than we would have liked, but we get the materiality of what we want to do. But I think both sides are getting a better deal candidly, if I had to say, so just to get something done. As we all know, this is not -- these contracts never end. They're just extensions until we sit down and do it again three or four or five years from now.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And then as a follow-up, I know you spoke a little bit about kind of the contracted deliveries for 2024 in that context, how should we be thinking about CapEx for next year?\nRobert Neal: Hey Andrew, it's BJ. We're live in discussing some of this with Boeing. What I'll tell you is in 2023, we were paying large amounts of predelivery deposits substantially focused on aircraft delivering in '24. And so you would see the same thing in '24 for aircraft delivering in '25, given the new schedule. I would expect CapEx to be elevated next year versus 2023, but don't have a guide for you yet.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. Thank you\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Christopher Stathoulopoulos of Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll keep this to one. Maurice, so I want to understand if you could a little bit more on the composition of your 2024 capacity with the idea here that not all capacity is created equal it comes with different margin profiles et cetera. So I think you said 70% 75% of routes non-competitive 1,400 new domestic routes identified and that you have a line of sight or looking to get back to 2019 utilization levels. On the other side of the ledger mid-single digit ASM growth is below what you've typically done. So as we think about the moving pieces, and if you want to frame it departure stage engage or however else is this about frequencies within existing dots, adding dots, a little bit of both? Just want to understand here the moving pieces that makes up and build into that mid-single-digit capacity guide in that soft CASM-X guide that you gave for next year? Thank you.\nDrew Wells: Hey, Christopher Drew here. Probably a little early to get into all of those dynamics today. I think maybe speaking fairly generally, I wouldn't anticipate seeing that utilization rebuild in the first half of the year with the flat ASM that probably goes without saying. As we bring on the Boeing, we will get a little bit of gauge benefit as the 8,200s will come in at 190 seats, which is larger than what we have today by a little bit. I don't foresee massive stage differences through the year although we'll get back to you maybe on that in 90 days. But I think as we think about the overall network, I would foresee a bit more frequency restoration coming earlier than new route announcements than kind of relative to our typical split before probably more on the late 2024 but really more of a 2025 and 2026 story on network expansion would be my guess at this point..\nRobert Neal: Hey, Chris this is BJ. The main thing to think about for CASM-X next year is really just the full year of the pilot payroll cost and the full year of labor agreements that were implemented this year. Other than that, we don't have most of the other buckets moving so much on the capacity that we just outlined.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Helane Becker of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Welcome back, Maury. Just two maybe clarification questions. All your peers are calling out maintenance and you didn't really mention that. Is there something I mean what's different between you and them, anything?\nRobert Neal: Helane, it's BJ here. I think one of the things is potentially that our heavy maintenance is capitalized or we use a deferred method. And so you don't see the immediate impact of it in the period that the cash goes out. So there has been some pressure in heavy maintenance expense, not to the degree that, like we've been hearing from some of the other carriers' calls, but also expecting some pretty nice relief on that as we move through 2024 and 2025 and those aircraft with the most expensive heavy checks would be retired prior to undergoing maintenance.\nHelane Becker: Right. Got it. That's really helpful. And then for my follow-up question, the other thing that some of your competitors, I don't know if they're really competitors, but some of the other airlines have been calling out has spent too much capacity in Las Vegas. And you didn't mention that either. And yet, Las Vegas tends to be one of your larger locations, I don't think it's the largest anymore. I think that's shifted around the network. But maybe can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in Las Vegas? And I guess the Grand Prix is coming pretty soon. So I'm imagining or near to see if the step-up in traffic there in addition to the holidays?\nRobert Neal: Yes. Thanks Helane. Just because Vegas has seen incremental seats, does not necessarily mean that Allegiant has seen incremental seats on top of ourselves into Vegas our route and where we originate customers tend to be pretty differentiated. And the price points haven't leaked into connecting traffic in a way that we saw in like 2015 when you could get to Vegas one stop for $100. So that has not manifested yet. So we still maintain a really solid network differentiation here that I think kind of puts us on an island if you will there. In terms of First quarter, Canada has been a little wrong on this. I went into it saying that it would probably be the worst suite that Allegiant has ever had coming into Vegas. And luckily that has not manifested, you've seen hotel pricing come down here looking at Scott DeAngelo but 50%, 60% in places that I think is catering back towards -- away from the core F1 customer and more towards say Vegas experience and have some fast cars going on around the bend. So it will be fine, but I wouldn't call it out of anything that I believe will be super special for us.\nMaurice Gallagher: Yeah. F1 is -- Vegas is a mid-priced town. It's not a high-end town like Monaco or something like that. And the hotel prices were starting off the stratosphere and you can't blame them they'd start there and then come down. But it's going to be a zoo here that weekend but it's $20,000, $15,000 to get into pad [ph] as they call it. Those are not the usual Vegas prices.\nHelane Becker: Got it. Maury, I'm really disappointed that you haven't done an Investor Day at Allegiant Stadium in conjunction with one of the football teams there.\nMaurice Gallagher: We'll put it on the list. Helane that's a good idea. We can do that.\nHelane Becker: All right. Thanks very much you guys.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One on for our next question. Our next question will be coming from Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone, and welcome back, Maury. Maybe just two quick ones on some of the ancillary revenue buckets, I thought it was great you shared that remuneration year-to-date on the credit card. I guess, is that similar to the revenue impact? I understand there is a bit of a timing difference there. And I guess any thoughts on what the tailwinds are they're going forward? Like how should we think about -- if we're talking mid-single-digit capacity growth are we thinking about credit card remuneration above and beyond that? And I've got one more. Thanks.\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, Catty. This is Scott DeAngelo. I'll take the first couple of parts there. So the way to think about it is a rule of thumb about 75% to 80% of total compensation is recognized in any given year. A portion of what we get paid gets immediately recognized and the other portion is deferred and it's in effect subsidizing a cardholder when they use points to buy air travel and it gets recognized as revenue once those points are redeemed. In terms of tailwinds, there's a couple of things that I'll speak to a high level at. We are aggressively pursuing what's referred to as a second look program. So an augmentation of our credit card program that to the customer looks no different, but it's other issuers who are willing to issue in the subprime and the near prime spaces, which currently are largely unserved by our product and that enabled us to open the aperture if you will on approval rate. And then finally, the other thing we're doing is marketing more aggressively not just in the plane, but through digital and even in some cases traditional advertising to build preference for and drive applications for the card in a way that we've never done before. So all of those things combined we expect to continue to plan tailwinds. Last point, we currently sit at about three percentage of our loyalty program has the card. Mature airlines, Delta and American, I believe bold made this public were more in the 13% to 14% of their loyalty program. So that gives you kind of an idea of what upside is there if these tailwinds above and beyond the traditional ASM growth can drive us down.\nGreg Anderson: And Katie, it's Greg. I just want to add one quick point to what Scott mentioned there. And that's the network that we serve and the communities that we're in so many of them were a really big deal. And our card is aspirational. They want that card. And it's a great I think kind of program that we continue to build on that's unique to Allegiant because again in those markets we are the game in town.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great. And then maybe just one -- sorry.\nMaurice Gallagher: Go ahead, Katie. No, go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: Just on Allegiant Extra, I know you talked about a positive contribution, but could you just put a finer point on that? Like what's the average buy-up on an extra seat or can you talk about how revenue growth is trending on a maybe versus Allegiant extra fee growth? Any help there would be great. Thanks so much.\nRobert Neal: Yes, Kate. I think this is something we continually say, hey we'll dive into more detail at an Investor Day and really provide some good stuff there and we even keep pushing the Investor Day. So I promise we'll get there at a future Investor Day. In terms of occupancy, we tend to get by right around the 50% mark give or take at a pretty meaningful unitized rev over any other seat. So we're -- I think we've stated about $1 per passenger in the past but I think that might be a little bit conservative as we've seen continued growth.\nCatherine O'Brien: Right. Maybe I'll just throw another location into the ring with Helane. I'd love to go see Sunseeker so keep us close on that Investor Day. Thanks, guys.\nRobert Neal: All right. Thanks Katie.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question for today is coming from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. So a, Maury, welcome back and b, I just wanted to follow up on something you said earlier about how high jet fuel prices kind of almost forces capacity -- across the industry. We have seen some indications of that on the 3Q conference calls with some of the low-cost carriers talking about muting their growth plans for next year. Do you think the industry finally gets it on capacity discipline for next year? Or do you think there's kind of still a little bit of proof needed on kind of walking the talk there?\nMaurice Gallagher: We've got what 30 40 years of deregulation history bucking a new 10 trend. If you want to take a comparable one price of oil has gone up dramatically since February '22 but you haven't seen the fracking industry run out and put a lot of new wells in. They've caught a lot of grief from your compatriots about saving investment and make some money. So you're seeing behavioural changes there which have I think affected supply and the U.S. has always been the counterbalance for oil and knocking the price down when it gets to rich from the Middle East and Russia and those guys. So maybe you have new trends there. I think the industry is very focused on making money. The big guys are definitely showing that they like having those numbers. They've got a very well-rounded product they've got a lot of debt on the balance sheet they want to pay down. So making good money the way they have is maybe becomes infectious. But long-term making money is the name of the game. And what you've seen over the last three years four years is we've all been thrown out of our habits and what we've done historically I think American Delta and United have benefited by the kind of the stuff they did pre-pandemic and brought it to home here in the last few months and last year with both international being so rich and with the ability to offer competitive products. When you look at the ULCC market as I said they've got over a 90% overlap in their marketplaces. That's tough competition to go up against if you've got a comparable product that's sitting there with a well-known brand that has a credit card has all the attributes. So we like staying out of people's way in doing those things but as far as capacity growth I think it's you're certainly not going to see kind of a wide-open funnel like we saw in the mid-teens and the like in my mind. Could it get there a couple of years from now? Sure. But right now I think everybody is a bit cautious and wants to bring it back slowly. And sitting on top of all this is ATC. When you're being asked to cut your summer travel into New York City because ATC can't keep up that's a big whack to your operation and your bottom-line.\nRavi Shanker: Always appreciate your thoughts. Thanks, Maury.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no more questions in the queue. And I will now turn the call back over to Maury, for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you all very much for your time. I appreciate your interest. And we'll see you in 90 days. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for joining.

And with that, I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn Redmond: Thank you very much, Sherry, and good morning, everyone. I'm thrilled to report an 18% operating margin and 99.7% controllable completion for the second quarter, among the highest in the industry during the quarter, both operationally and financially. In the face of high demand and operational complexity, the team continues to deliver. It is their exceptional efforts that have allowed us to meet and exceed our customers' expectations.  Over the last year, we have increased our NPS scores by an average of 10 points and are now at the highest scores since the pandemic. I could not be prouder of the work our team members do each and every day. Thank you very much for your continued passion and dedication.  Our commitment to enhancing the travel experience remains a key driver of our success. Over the years, we have invested in our services and our brand, ensuring we not only meet the evolving needs of our customers but also create new opportunities for growth and expansion.  One area that continues to pay dividends is our co-branded credit card. With over 600,000 credit cards issued, the program continues to surpass expectations. Cardholder spend has increased by 220% since 2019 and shows no signs of slowing. We believe the opening of Sunseeker Resort later this year will provide further value propositions for our cardholders and guests and help drive cardholder sign us well into the future.  Last quarter, I spoke about the key strategic initiatives of this management team. I'd like to provide a quick update on our progress. First and foremost, finalizing our outstanding labor contracts remains our top priority. Greg will provide additional detail around our status, but it is of the utmost importance that we continue making progress and deliver contracts that our teams are proud to support.  Secondly, we are committed to continuing to deliver high operational performance. It is our obligation to our guests to strive for industry-leading performance as shown in our Q2 results. It is a necessary pillar in ensuring we protect the investments we've made over the years in our brand.  Finally, I'm happy to report -- we remain on track to open Sunseeker Resort in Port Charlotte, Florida, in mid-October. This has been a long time coming. The project full challenges and delays outside of our control, so to see the end insight is remarkable.  Bookings for Sunseeker continue coming in from all corners of the country, 42 states, all total, which speaks volumes of the breadth of the database. To date, excluding group bookings, we have sold approximately 3,300 transient room nights at an average room rate of $410 per night. This transient room nights booked to date are impressive, in that most people book hotel rooms inside 50 days of arrival.  Regarding group bookings, over 50 groups have contracted or in the process of contracting nearly 40,000 room nights. The team continues to bring in high-quality groups and I fully expect this group room nights booked number to grow to roughly 75,000 by year-end, covering all years booked. These are incredible group numbers for our property and brand that has never existed in the market.  The team in Florida is in full hiring mode looking to onboard a targeted headcount of around 1,200 personnel. We received over 5,700 applications with over 70% of those applicants residing within a 50-mile radius of the resort, demonstrating our commitment to supporting the local economy. Underpinning this influx in applications is a unique retention bonus we announced in early July for our inaugural nonmanagement Sunseeker Resort team members. It provides an annual retention bonus of $10,000 for 10 years after completing 10 years of continuous full-time employment.  Interestingly, we have received applications from people residing in 49 states. Given the early response, we would expect the application pool to exceed 7,000 people. With an application pool that continues to grow, this innovative program should help us attract and retain the very best hospitality professionals, and we already see evidence of this within the pool.  From a financial perspective, the Sunseeker Resort budget remains at $695 million. As indicated in prior calls, costs will ramp in the third quarter due to preopening expenses. We estimate the total cost impact will be roughly $15 million this quarter. Consistent with last quarter, the full year impact to consolidated EPS remains at $1.25 loss.  I continue to be encouraged by the long-term value creation of Sunseeker Resorts. Upon completion of the project, the team will shift focus to begin laying the groundwork for our asset-light growth trajectory. With the opening around the corner, some of you will continue to speculate about our future intentions regarding expansion plans or future projects requiring material capital outlays. We will not pursue any such projects without an equity partner.  In closing, I could not be happier where we sit today. Our upward guidance revisions reflect our conviction about the balance of the year and to continue to deliver strong performance in the coming years. As such, I am pleased to announce that the Allegiant Travel Board of Directors has authorized an annual dividend of $2.40, payable in equal amounts quarterly, beginning September 1, through the second quarter 2023. We remain committed to growing profitably by enhancing our offerings, driving customer satisfaction and delivering increased value to our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn it over to Greg Anderson.\nGregory Anderson: John, thank you. Over the past year, the industry has faced a uniquely challenging operating environment. Despite these many obstacles, Team Allegiant is delivering exceptional results. In our business, everything begins and ends with operations, and here at Allegiant, we are only days away from having the heaviest flying periods of the year behind us, March and summer.  Through July, we are running an impressive 99.8% controllable completion factor and that's year-to-date. In addition, during the month of June, we are amongst the industry leaders in on-time performance. The results we are seeing today represent a significant improvement over where we were a year ago. This improvement has driven our year-to-date irregular operation costs down by $80 million compared to the same period in 2022.  Obviously, an unreliable operation is much more expensive to run. It also leads to unnecessary disruption and frustration for our guests and our frontline team members. Overly ambitious scheduling may lead to higher revenues, but when its results in excessive delays and cancellations, the juice isn't worth the squeeze. We are committed to maintaining a balanced scheduling approach. This approach is executed jointly by our planning and operational teams as together, they expertly manage a schedule to meet the leisure demand environment while maintaining operational integrity. Our unique ability in adjusting capacity is differentiated by our low fixed cost structure.  One of the interesting themes you are hearing from other carriers has been around leisure traffic. Moreover, some carriers are reshaping their network and adjusting their schedules accordingly by lowering off-peak capacity. This leisure focus and focused flying on peak days has been our approach for over 20 years. We are ideally suited for this leisure peak flying approach, and you can see this in our results. And going forward, we believe this approach will continue to pay dividends.  In addition to our operational and financial performances, there is also an incredible amount of work being accomplished behind the scenes to strengthen our foundation and to be able to support a 200-plus aircraft airline in roughly 5 years. Our major system implementations are a key step in getting there, and I'm happy to report SAP went live on July 1, a major milestone along this journey. This once-in-a-generation system changeover will help drive internal efficiencies across our back office teams.  Additionally, we plan to cut over to Navitaire in late August. We delayed its go-live date to move any potential operational disruption to outside of our peak summer travel period. Navitaire is expected to drive incremental ancillary revenue due to its dynamic pricing capabilities. In addition, system will support our expansion into Mexico with our joint venture partner, Viva Aerobus. However, due to recent actions undertaken by Mexico affecting U.S. carrier operations at Mexico City Airport, our ATI application with the DOT has been temporarily put on hold. We want to be clear though, that this does not affect the merits of our application. It's also worth noting that we have readied the areas within our control to be able to launch once ATI is approved.  The execution of the incredible team members at Allegiant truly amazes me. Not only do they continue to strengthen our foundation, but their efforts delivered industry-leading controllable completion and operating margins during the first half of 2023. This triggered a maximum profit share amount, paying out over 12 million to our airline team members. We could not be prouder of the work team Allegiant does and thank you.  We believe we are incredibly well positioned for the future and are uniquely set up to be a destination airline for all of our team members. A key element of this is to ensure we maintain competitive labor contracts.  Last quarter, our dispatchers, who are represented by the IBT, ratified a 2-year contract extension more than a year before the amendable date of their CBA, which included pay rate increases at the higher end of the industry. Similarly, we are happy to have reached a formal tentative agreement with mechanics, also represented by the IBT more than 3 years prior to their amendable date. This TA provides for significant increases in rates and as a 2-year extension to the current contract. The TA is subject to approval by the mechanics in the coming weeks.  In June, we announced a tentative agreement with the TWU, which represent our flight attendants. While this initial TA was unfortunately voted down, we remain focused and committed to reaching a deal with our flight attendants and reengaging at the table with the TWU in short order.  Regarding our pilot group, who are represented by the IBT, we remain in mediation and working towards pathways to a deal. Given the uncertainty around the timing of a deal, we felt it necessary to address pilot compensation outside of bargaining and recognize the importance our pilots play in our ongoing success. As such, in early June, we were pleased to announce a retention bonus for all pilots that remain with the company through ratification of the deal. We began banking a 35% increase to their current rates, except for first year first officers, which accrue at an even higher rate of 82%.  These retention bonuses are intended to bring our pilot pay more in line with the industry, with the understanding final pay rates will continue to be negotiated through the mediation process. We are pleased the IBT supported this retention bonus as we continue to work with them towards a contract that our pilots deserve.  In closing, I want to thank all of team Allegiant. You are the best in the business. We appreciate everything you do.  With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, Greg. Our second quarter saw continued strong domestic leisure travel demand and capture that remain near our historic highs in 2022. Thanks to improved operations, a testament to the strong leadership of our Chief Operating Officer, Keny Wilper, along with his expert leadership team and the great work by all in the Allegiant family, this year's controllable completion rate being far above last year's level, means we're keeping and recognizing a much greater portion of book revenue year-to-date.  Looking forward, while there's no shortage of opinions with regards to macroeconomic conditions and their impact on consumer domestic leisure travel behavior, we spend less time trying to predict the future and more time ensuring we're prepared to succeed in it. It all starts with keeping our fingers on the pulse of customer sentiment and their leisure travel intention.  Just as we did following the past 2 quarters, we surveyed a representative sample from both our most frequent flying repeat customers as well as those who flew us for the first time this past quarter.  The results remain strong and unchanged from the past 2 quarters. Among both groups, about 50% said that economic conditions will have no impact on their flying behavior with Allegiant in the next 12 months and more than 30% said that economic considerations will actually make them more likely to fly with Allegiant in the next 12 months. The market is moving toward us.  For our most frequent flying repeat customers, the rationale for their unchanged sentiment and intention stems from the fact that the vast majority of them are either flying to visit family or relatives more than 40% of the group or are flying between their primary residence and their vacation home, just under 40% of the group. These remain the most resilient forms of leisure travel during any macroeconomic environment.  Quarter rewarding our most frequent flying repeat customers, along with engaging new customers and turning them into repeat customers, is our Allways Rewards loyalty program. Year-to-date, nearly 90% of our customer bookings have come from Allways Rewards members. The number of members with activity year-to-date is up nearly 30% versus last year, and the number of new members with their first activity is up nearly 15% versus last year. Ultimately, having such broad coverage with Allways Rewards enables us to reward the vast majority of our customers with points that can be easily used as currency, in any amount, at any time, for anything sold at allegiant.com.  Year-to-date, on average, Allways Rewards members are 1.5x more valuable than nonmembers. Most notably, this value was largely driven by them spending 60% more on air ancillary products than nonmembers do. Their take rates of core air ancillary products, seats and bags, are 10 to 20 percentage points higher than that of nonmembers.  Our most loyal and engaged segment within the Allways Rewards program is, of course, our co-brand credit card holders who are 3x more valuable than nonmembers. Currently, about 2.5% of our total active customer database of 17 million has the card. As such, we believe there is significant growth potential. In 7 years, we have grown the program into a $100 million business unit, and we expect to double that in the next 3 years.  To that end, I'm excited to announce an upcoming change to our program. Later this month, we will be transitioning our co-brand credit card network partner from Mastercard to Visa. Our Allegiant World MasterCard will be renamed and rebranded as the Allegiant Allways Rewards Visa Card. While Bank of America remains our issuing partner and no cardholder benefits will change. We made the decision to move to Visa, the nation's leading brand in credit card issuance and acceptance because we believe it will enable us to drive higher levels of both new cardholders and cardholder spend, the 2 largest ways that we derive revenue from the program.  We asked Allegiant customers who do not currently have our co-brand credit card, which card they would be most likely to apply for. 60% said Visa, while only 25% said MasterCard. In addition, one of the nation's largest retailers, Costco only accepts Visa and more than 40% of our customers say they regularly shop there.  What's more? Visa will provide stronger financial, technical and analytic support for growing the Allegiant Allways Rewards Visa Card program and in providing additional benefits through their exclusive partnerships and proprietary capabilities.  Wrapping up. Year-to-date, in as much as demand is slightly below last year's historic high levels, we believe this simply represents a continued return to normalized pre-pandemic peak and nonpeak seasonal travel patterns. We continue to view domestic leisure travel in the cities and among the customers we serve as strong, but we remain close to our customers end as it's been the hallmark of our company throughout its history, we stand ready to adapt to any changes in the demand environment.  And with that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Revenue Officer, Drew Wells.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm extremely pleased with the record second quarter performance of $684 million in total revenue, growth of nearly 9% on system ASM growth of 1.3%. This combination produced TRASM of which vested any previous second quarter by $0.005 and grew year-over-year by 7.5%.  As Greg mentioned, we achieved remarkable operational results in the second quarter on top of financial results among the best in the industry.  The current operating environment has proven challenging and we are not immune to this. Three months ago, we talked about trimming about 2.5 points of capacity from the summer schedule, and we believe it was absolutely worth it. I want to reiterate how impressed I am with the planning and operations teams coming together to do an incredible job aligning our schedule with available resources and anticipating risk areas to help mitigate potential issues, both controllable and uncontrollable alike.  The buffer is added into our schedule enable better recovery options when faced with the regular operations, including ATC-related concerns, especially out of Florida. We've done the commercial piece as well or better than anyone else in the world as measured by margins and returns, but candidly, often at the expense of operational excellence. In first half of 2023, we showed that we could do the operational piece while maintaining that industry-leading financial position. Those 2 in harmony is an elite combination.  We still have more work to do to continually improve, but this summer will serve as a great foundation going forward to ensure operational reliability in conjunction with the appropriate deployment of capacity.  Diving into revenue a bit. The strength in the quarter was well balanced as yields and ancillary products each contributed roughly $5 incremental per passenger versus the second quarter in 2022. We exceeded $70 per passenger in ancillary revenue once again, in large part thanks to Allegiant Extra and continued success with our bundled ancillary products as well as the Allegiant co-brand program, which continues to thrive.  Allegiant Extra is now featured on 14 aircraft and continues to exceed expectations. While we don't expect any incremental aircraft with this layout in 2023, all Boeings coming in 2024 will have the Allegiant Extra option.  Additionally, the strength of our operations and diligence from the charter team allowed us to capitalize on additional fixed fee business from both new and current clients to grow fixed fee revenue over 30%. As previously mentioned, we are still maintaining the expectation of TRASM over the last 9 months to be up mid-single digits, though now expected to narrow to the lower side of the mid-single-digit range.  In addition to the continued story of incredible demand, the upside factors for Allegiant remain the same, continued operational stability and an expanded Allegiant Extra product we've talked about. Another upside factor is an historically mature network, but that doesn't mean 0 routes in development. 5 new routes and 3 reintroduced routes started service this summer, including growth in Portland, Oregon, Provo, Utah and Denver, among other cities. I'm extremely happy that all 8 have their own with some even exceeding system average profitability from the start.  Additionally, last month, we announced 6 new routes for the winter season, mainly focused on Florida with one added to our Mesa base. These announcements are booking above average compared to prior announcements, which is continued evidence of a strong leisure demand presence.  Lastly, Navitaire should provide a lift to our ancillary program. However, given the integration delay, we will not see the previously anticipated upside in the third quarter, though we are still baking that lift into the fourth. Furthermore, we did see some yield compression through the heart of the summer booking curve, somewhat offset by atypical close-in demand.  As you all know, Allegiant prides itself on matching capacity with demand. For more than 20 years, our daily and monthly levels of flying have fluctuated meaningfully. We have a great understanding of the leisure customer and when they most want to fly. The third quarter will be no different as roughly 80% of our ASMs will fall on our peak leisure days and September ASMs look to be roughly 55% of July's flying, both generally in line with the third quarter of 2022. Scheduled service ASMs are expected to be very slightly negative in the quarter, while a full year guide remains intact at flat to up 3%.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Neal: Thanks, Drew, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results. Allegiant produced $76.9 million of consolidated adjusted net income for the second quarter, resulting in adjusted EPS of $4.35, in line with 2019 earnings. We recognized record total operating revenue in the quarter of $684 million, up 8.6% over the prior year on 1.3% higher capacity.  Our nonfuel unit cost increased 12.9% year-over-year with 4 points of that increase attributable to pilot payroll accruals and other frontline labor cost increases, which, as Greg noted, we announced in June that were effective beginning May 1. Similar to our last call, unit costs were pressured in comparison to the same period last year by lower productivity, which accounts for about 3 points of the increase. Improved operational performance drove a nice tailwind by reducing a regular operations expense in the quarter, that was largely offset by inflationary cost pressure in stations.  Variable team member compensation related to improved financial performance drove roughly 2.5 points of the increase over the second quarter last year and 2 points of CASM increase in the quarter came from some onetime nonrecurring costs which included the cancellation fee related to the transition of our co-brand credit card for Mastercard to Visa, and the remainder of our ex-fuel unit cost increase was related to various other items. Fuel costs came in below our expectations at $2.69 per gallon, helping to drive an airline operating margin of 18.6%.  Shifting to full year guidance. We are increasing our estimated airline earnings per share by $0.75 at the midpoint to $11.75. The increase in expected full year EPS is fully attributable to a $0.10 decrease in our full year estimated fuel cost per gallon from $3 to $2.90.  As John noted, we continue to expect a full year loss related to Sunseeker Resort of $1.25 per share. We expect preopening costs to ramp during the third quarter at approximately $15 million, ahead of opening the property early in the fourth quarter. When taken in conjunction and using the midpoint of our guide, we expect the consolidated full year adjusted earnings per share of roughly $10.50.  Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the June quarter with $1.4 billion in available liquidity. That's just over $1 billion in cash and investments and $356 million in capacity and undrawn revolvers and PDP financing facilities after a prepayment of $61 million in aircraft secured debt in late June.  Net debt remained consistent with last quarter at $1.1 billion. Our net debt was down to 2.2 turns, a reduction from 3.7 at year-end driven by strong EBITDA production during the first 6 months of the year. We do expect to add some incremental debt leading up to delivery of our first 737 MAX aircraft late in the fourth quarter and would expect net leverage to be up just slightly above the current level at the end of the year.  Second quarter capital expenditures included $147 million related to aircraft purchases, induction, predelivery deposits and other fleet-related costs. We spent an additional $29 million in other airline capital expenditures and deferred heavy maintenance CapEx came in at $21.7 million. CapEx for our Sunseeker Resort property was $92 million during the quarter.  Moving to fleet. We inducted 2 Airbus A320 aircraft into operation and ended the quarter with 91 A320 and 35 A319 aircraft in service. We had one additional A320 aircraft owned and undergoing induction work as of the quarter end and expect to purchase 2 additional A320 aircraft during the remainder of 2023.  And on the 737 fleet. Updates from Boeing indicate that our first 2 MAX aircraft, which were scheduled for delivery at the end of this year, will each be delayed by approximately 4 weeks, leaving one aircraft for delivery to us in 2023 and moving the second into 2024. While the follow-on effect on the remainder of our 2024 delivery schedule is still under discussion, our 2023 capacity plans are not impacted by this delay. As we've shared previously, we expect to begin operating our first 737 aircraft in the first quarter of next year and expect to take delivery of approximately 2 aircraft per month throughout 2024.  Our updated full year CapEx guide today implies just under $500 million in aircraft engine and induction-related spend this year with the reduction from prior guidance related to timing of predelivery deposits and timing of aircraft deliveries. All in, we expect full year airline CapEx to be roughly $640 million.  I'm very pleased with the financial trajectory we've seen in the past few quarters and excited for the earnings potential in our business. We can start to unlock the benefits of the infrastructure investments we've been making. EBITDA in the trailing 12 months is approximately $4.5 million per aircraft on a trailing 12-month fuel cost of $3.38 per gallon. Adjusting for fuel, we would be back to our 2019 level of $6 million in EBITDA per aircraft, notwithstanding some of the added cost pressures I mentioned earlier. While I recognize there are certainly many moving parts here, we expect continued improvement on this metric as our numerous initiatives come online.  Running a reliable operation has been paramount to achieving the results that we're sharing today. We're extremely proud of our team members and the way that they have worked together to schedule and operate the airline during a time that remains challenging. I want to just end by thanking our 5,400 team members for all of their contributions during this busy peak summer travel season.  Michelle, we're ready to begin taking analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: John, what would you envision the segmentation mix for Sunseeker to be? I mean if you had to guess, how much would be group versus transient? And for the groups that you have contracted with, what do those rates look like relative to the transient rate that you cited?\nJohn Redmond: Duane, good questions. I think when you look at that, you have to kind of look at it by year. So in '24, we'll start with the full year of '24, you're probably looking at something in the range of, I'd say, maybe 12 to -- it's going to be a wide range just because we'll be booking into the year, but probably in the range of like 12% to 18%, could get as high as 20%, but probably in that range of 12% to 18%. When you're looking at the out years starting with '25, you're probably looking at 20% to 25% would be more normal as we move forward.  Just to give you some color on that, when you look at the roughly 40,000 group room nights that have already been booked, about 26,300 of those fall into '24. So that's roughly more than 10% -- slightly over 10% of the total room nights that we would have in a given year. So that kind of gives you a good barometer, and that's why I think that's where it's going to fall. But again, we're dealing with a brand and a property that hasn't existed to run these percentages as we are is incredibly impressive, but I think that's kind of like the 25% range would be where it starts to peak in '25.\nGregory Anderson: And John, on the group rates, there are 250 to 300 or thereabouts.\nJohn Redmond: Yes, they've been averaging around 290-ish when you look at all 40,000 room nights. And I would expect those to ramp up to as there's a greater awareness of the property and we're not selling into an unknown. So the rates we're selling into -- I mean, the rates we're getting are more than we expected, again, selling into an unknown property, but those will continue to ramp up in the out years as we get into '25, '26. It's just is another data point. So we have group room nights that have already been booked into '27.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Got it. Appreciate the thoughts. I know it's somewhat hypothetical at this point. And then just on the OpEx run rate, can you give us a little help in the quarter? I know you got some insurance reimbursement. So what was kind of the OpEx run rate for Sunseeker in 2Q? And how do you see that kind of ramping into 3Q and 4Q?\nJohn Redmond: I think the 2Q number -- I think 3Q, we're talking about the $15 million, which was, of course, is all preopening as you're talking about. The 2Q number, I don't have off the top of my head what that was but obviously, it would be probably for sure, less than half that number.\nRobert Neal: Yes. I think we had...\nJohn Redmond: Go ahead, B.J.\nRobert Neal: Like $5 million to $7 million, I want to say, between the first and second quarter, per quarter.\nJohn Redmond: Yes.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And sorry, that $15 million when you're sort of up and running with the full fourth quarter, what does that look like?\nJohn Redmond: Once we're up and operating, we haven't put out any financial data from an operating standpoint. We intend to do that probably, at the same time, provide guidance for the airline, which should be historically we do after Q4. So we would provide operating guidance for the resort at that same time. So right now, we are only providing the OpEx, a piece before opening. So adjust just preopening numbers.  There is public numbers that we put out there a few years ago. Obviously, they're dated, and I would expect results to be significantly better because I think the ADR in those projections was something around the $250 range, $250 a night. And as you can see, we're running much better even when you blend group and transient.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Just if I could talk a little bit about the pilot bonus that you're offering and has that improved kind of the attrition rates that you're seeing there? And if you could talk a little bit about the retention and hiring capabilities today?\nGregory Anderson: Savi, sure. It's Greg. Thanks for the question. And the bonus in general, as we came up and moving forward with it, and just to hit on was the right thing to do. Now we have so many of our pilots that want to be at Allegiant that we were talking to and providing us feedback to say, how is it difficult to want to stay here when the rates are so low. I mean we want to be here, but the rates are low compared to the industry. We felt overall, this was the right thing to do for our pilots because they do want to be here, and they understand the unique setup that Allegiant has in terms of that out and back quality of life.  Don't get me wrong. This is one step. The contract is ultimately where we need to get, and we need to make a lot of improvements in certain areas, including quality of life, pay rates, retirement and so forth.  In terms of staffing, maybe let's just -- I'll break it down to 2 pieces. Let's -- the schoolhouse being one, Savi, and then I'll talk about kind of the net pilots and the attrition that we've been seeing. But schoolhouse, as we've seen over the past couple of months, a terrific increase in the number of pilots coming through the physical house. I mean classes are full. I think beginning the last 3 or 4 classes have been full. So about 20 to 25 per class. Before that perspective in the first part of the year, we were seeing roughly 12 to 14 per class.  So really encouraged by what we're seeing there. Our team, led by Tyler Hollingsworth has really kind of turned that around and focused on a lot of -- several different pathway programs and recruiting the right type of pilots that want to be at Allegiant that sees this, this unique quality of life set up. So -- and as we look forward to the rest of the year, we still remain really encouraged about the classes, those that have signed up and continue to maintain kind of that full class status, if you will.  But in terms of staffing, just to maybe put some guardrails around that and around the attrition or the notices that we were receiving. So I'd say like in April, May, it was roughly -- we were receiving notice about nearly a pilot a day, I mean, just to put it into simple terms.  And since June -- since early June, that number has been cut down to 1/4 of that number. So we've certainly seen some encouraging trends along those lines. Some of that's probably seasonal. Some of it hopefully is due not just to the retention bonus, but us, going out there and trying to make the improvements we can outside of collective bargaining. And also -- but again, I want to reiterate the most important thing we could do in a big step of getting that deal done and then go from there to continue to make this a destination airline, not just for all of our pilots, but all of our team members.\nSavi Syth: That's super helpful color. And if I might, on the MAX deliveries and just early thoughts on 2024 is, is 2024 going to be another year where capacity is somewhat constrained as you kind of make these investments to operate well and kind of the MAX uncertainty? Or how are you thinking about like what type of kind of capacity growth you could target in 2024, recognizing it's still very early?\nDrew Wells: Savi, it's Drew here. First and foremost, one of the biggest components will be timing of getting a CBA done with our flight crews above and beyond the MAX delivery. As we focus on the MAXs though and the constraints we have today, we'll still have training requirements that will drive through all of '24. So I would expect there to be a little bit of a ceiling relative to the fleet we're bringing on in terms of what we're able to produce ASM-wise until maybe the end of the year. I think we can start to get a lot closer to our historic run rate, but I might pull that back a little bit.\nJohn Redmond: Yes. Savi, the only other thing I would mention there is that we haven't yet confirmed our retirement schedule on some of the A320s, we expect to take out of the fleet. And so that just gives us a little bit of flexibility. And so we haven't come out with the 2024 fleet plan specifically as we want to wait and gain some certainty around the MAX delivery schedule.\nGregory Anderson: And Savi, I'm just going to -- this is Greg. I'm going to add one more quick comment. I mentioned in my remarks, over the next 5 years, we're planning to be 200-plus aircraft. So I just want to reorient around that, and that's what we're doing. We're building a strong foundation to support an airline of that size. We're strengthening that foundation. We're looking at long-term growth. We're investing in all the right things and most importantly in our people. And we believe we're going to -- we have a path to get there. It may not be at this -- we don't know the exact cadence, but that's what we're planning on.  And so a lot of the moves we're seeing is us getting prepared for that. And we believe that we're able to continue to grow and grow profitably as we hit that 200-plus aircraft number in the next 5 years.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Just a couple of questions on CASM. I think you had been targeting kind of low double-digit growth this year. Where the new -- were the pilot retention bonuses paid out in June, part of that number? And then I think you were including maybe about from the pilots in that outlook. Any change to that number given all the tentative agreements out there with others in the industry?\nRobert Neal: Andrew, it's B.J. I'll start, and Greg, if you want to jump in on the second part of that. But yes, no, we continue to think about it like around 1/3 of a cent. I will mention, in the second quarter, we only included 2 months of those accruals. And so moving throughout the rest of the year, you'll burden through each of the 3 months in the quarter. But yes, you're right, kind of low double-digit growth year-over-year on unit costs for the back half of the year.\nGregory Anderson: And Andrew, just a couple of maybe clarifying points. It's not paid out in June. It is actually a retention bonus and it's paid out upon ratification of an agreement for those pilots that are still actively employed at that time. We've locked in the rates at that 35% for all pilots with the exceptions of the first year, first officers at . That's locked in over that period. But we'll continue to negotiate final rate through the mediation process, but this is a retention bonus.\nAndrew Didora: Right. Understood. And look, I know there are a lot of moving parts between timing a pilot deal, training requirements for the MAXs. But you mentioned in response to Savi's question about maybe it's suboptimal, lower than historical growth in 2024 in that type of scenario? How should we think about kind of CASM growth next year? Any puts and takes you can provide around that would be helpful?\nGregory Anderson: Yes. Andrew, I'm sorry, I don't have a lot in front of me, but I'll just say it's real early to give kind of CASM guidance on '24. Just there's a lot of moving parts, like you mentioned around the actual delivery schedule of the MAX, which will determine how many pilots are useful in producing ASM at each different period throughout the year? And then what are we doing on retirements of the 320s. I hope by the time of the next call, we've got a little bit more color to share with you. So apologies just a little early to give that kind of guidance.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And maybe I could sneak one more housekeeping one in. I saw in your guidance, interest expense came down a little bit. I think, in your prepared remarks, you said that you're going to take on a bit more debt through year-end as the MAXs were delivered. Just curious what was the driver of the lowest -- lower interest expense there?\nJohn Redmond: The driver of the lower interest expense this year, yes. So a little bit of it is we prepaid $60 million -- $61 million in some aircraft secured debt at the end of the second quarter, which gives us a bit of relief in the final 2 quarters of this year. And then my comment on opening remarks that just year-end leverage was -- I just wanted to set expectations, we still will add a little bit of debt as we continue making PDP payments in the final 2 quarters of the year. And then there's still 1 MAX delivery at the end of the year.\nGregory Anderson: And Andrew, I'm just going to add just piggyback on that. The equity value in those 737 aircraft day 1 it's meaningful, and it gives B.J. and the team the opportunity to put an effective and efficient financing. We're very comfortable being able to go out and finance those aircraft. But something else that I just want to remind our investors in our Street is the opportunistic nature of the 737 deal and the timing and particularly around the tax law and bonus appreciation -- depreciation, excuse me, that we received.  I mean, in essence, we're going to receive -- we estimate roughly $250 million in interest free rate loan from the government by moving forward with this deal. So that will offset cash taxes in the future.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nKatherine Kallergis: This is Katherine Kallergis on for Ravi. I wanted to follow up on a previous comment, in which you said airlines have started to favor peak periods, and that Allegiant has done this for some time. But I was curious if you could provide some color around the competitive dynamics during these periods. And if what you consider peak might be different than industry peers? Also just curious if these dynamics might be different in Florida market specifically.\nDrew Wells: Yes. I mean, Drew here. When we refer to peak, we're exclusively talking about domestic leisure peak, which is traditionally around school holidays, right? So your spring break, summer and holiday time frame, I think most would describe leisure peak as the same. And I think as -- and I'm speculating a bit here, carriers are having a bit more leisure exposure. They're kind of coming around to how those dynamics are working. One of the great things about peak -- so if there is an excess of demand generally. And even in periods thinking pre-pandemic when capacity was quite elevated, particularly in the offpeak capacity -- sorry, peak capacity could soak up that demand pretty well. I don't anticipate competitive dynamics to change meaningfully. The peaks are a peak for a reason. And so in general, I believe it's a good thing, but the demand patterns fit the Allegiant model just exceedingly well and something like we mentioned that we've cater to for 20-plus years. So we're built for exactly this kind of dynamic.\nKatherine Kallergis: And just as a quick follow-up. Your stat about how 50% of those surveyed stated economic conditions will have no impact on flying was interesting. Just curious what inelastic do you think demand really is? And maybe how you've seen the -- you all see it perform in past recessionary environments?\nScott DeAngelo: No, thanks for that question. For those frequent flyers, the answer is it is pretty inelastic because they're traveling to and from family where they're staying and/or doing from their second and vacation homes. So in many of those instances, right, high interest rates, inflation, it's not as meaningful as say, a family vacation to an Orlando theme park or a Las Vegas casino. So amongst our core customers, it's fairly inelastic because they're flying to and from family and/or a second home.\nDrew Wells: Yes. But more broadly, the customer that we serve is generally still a very price-sensitive customer. Less so in summer peaks or peaks in general, when we have a thicker demand pool to choose from. And certainly, in the off-peaks, you still see that. Just by way of example, we're already pricing higher, closer in, taking advantage of relative inelasticity if you will, the ability to pass through more was a bit muted, right, especially in the face of $70 plus ancillary per passenger that we're trying to balance as we build load.  So there's a pretty heavy mix on our aircraft that can be tricky to revenue manage. And I think it's a place where a product like Allegiant Extra can really help differentiate between the customer segments that we have and find that right balance of Allegiant type premium experience versus the main cabin, that's right for all of our customers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Helane Becker with TD Cowen.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Helane. Would you mind providing any color on what you're seeing in Las Vegas, just given some of the runway challenges that have been happening there? And then just any -- any of the drivers of the operational performance just beyond having more of a buffer, some learnings that you're taking with you for next year, that would be great?\nDrew Wells: Yes. Yes, great question. And we called out 3 months ago that Vegas had kind of an outsized portion of that 2.5%. April and May still had pockets of struggles as there were some concentrated days and periods of impact. But that materially turned around in June and July and I think Vegas went exceedingly well -- performed exceedingly well through the summer.  So outside some heat-related concerns but there's not a lot anybody can do there extremely happy with how Vegas panned out. Thinking more broadly, as we think about the schedule moving forward, reviewing things from firebreaks and adding some slack into the schedule that provides that recoverability, especially if you think about Florida and pretty routine thunder storms coming through at 3:30 every afternoon. We were better balanced about viewing that in its entirety, thinking about how a firebreak relates to extended churn times and where those minutes actually matter.  But perhaps, at least to me, one of the most impactful things, think about the overnight touch time for our mechanics and crews in getting that plane to the gate on time every morning so we could start the airline correctly and give ourselves a chance to succeed. So both starting on time and think about how we could recover through the day when things start to go awry. I think we got close to the right answer this year, but there's a lot more work for us to do to continue to refine and maintain our place towards the top of the industry.\nGregory Anderson: Yes. And Drew, I just want to add just a quick comment here, too. And that's where we sit today, we feel really confident about the second half of the year and moving on from the commentary that we talked about, the coordination between planning and ops and the , Keny Wilper heading up. But staffing levels are very solid. In fact, with the exception of pilot that's the best we've seen since 2019. So we're encouraged by that.  As we get out of the -- as we exit the gauntlet of the summer peak flying, the teams all come together and do a postmortem around a summer debrief and they look for process efficiencies and ways to get better, and that will be -- that will be around the corner, and we'll continue to step up our game in any way we can.\nUnidentified Analyst: If I could just squeeze one more in. Just you mentioned a little bit on the outlook for revenue in the rest of the year. I was just wondering if you can unpack that and any color on the cadence for base fares and ancillaries for what you can see from right now.\nJohn Redmond: Yes. I'll probably disappoint you a little bit as we get into kind of cadence related, the 2 things I'll point out. One, I would look towards last year's comp set and kind of ASM cadence to help guide how you think about the third and fourth order. And the second, I'll point out and maybe not one that I communicated well or maybe even appreciated enough as we talked about the last 9 months previously was the second quarter of '22 cadence.  And I think there was still a fair amount of recovery from the variant that we experienced in the first half of that quarter. Not to disparage the 2Q they probably helped bolster the relative TRASM year-over-year there a little bit. So I kind of think of those 2 pieces in concurrent as you think about the last 9 months in totality.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Just a few quick ones here. John, just in response to Duane's question on you talking about Sunseeker where the numbers were better, and you were referring to the rates. How should we think about it just from with all the cost inflation there if we kind of go back to the original plan, I think the guide was EBITDA margins sort of in that 30% range. Is that still a reasonable sort of ballpark profit margin?\nJohn Redmond: Michael, I do. I think those EBITDA margins are still doable. It's kind of like when you see even happen on the air side, right, with the CapEx -- or CASM-X increasing. Well, revenue is outpacing the CASM-X growth. So you're seeing the same thing happen on the -- in the resort world, where the cost increases are way more than offset by the room rate increases in that market. So very encouraging.  And Florida, in particular, it's just been extremely strong. Obviously, the hotel industry throughout the U.S. has been, but Florida, it's a shining star when it comes to what's going on. So I think EBITDA margins that we were looking at early on and we're out there under projections, I think there's a potential for those to be even much stronger.\nMichael Linenberg: Very good. And then just a second one for you, John, and probably Greg as well and maybe the team. We've seen an announcement by Frontier to take up some of the assets of the JetBlue Spirit proposed merger assets that they would potentially divest at this point. It looks like it's still slots. Obviously, there's a lot more that they've already indicated that they would be willing to divest, maybe its runway timings at Newark, Gates in Fort Lauderdale, space in Boston. Is any of that of interest to Allegiant.\nGregory Anderson: Michael, it's Greg. Good to chat with you. As the team continue -- Drew and his team continue to look at all opportunities in airports and certainly aware of the situation. But I think where we sit today, there's nothing really to report on that front.\nMichael Linenberg: Very good. And then just if I could squeeze in one quick last one for Scott. We have heard other carriers talk about this traffic patterns where people are spending a lot more time this summer going to Europe rather than flying domestically and Scott, you do a lot of different surveys and other carriers have said that they've surveyed their own customer base and some percentage are electing to go to Europe. What are you seeing amongst your customer base, which I know you're very close to? Are you seeing something similar where you're just losing a lot of flow because they're going maybe outside of the United States? Any color on that would be great.\nScott DeAngelo: Absolutely. And thank you, Michael, because the last several weeks, we have asked exactly that. So I'm prepared to tell you. First, we ask our customer base to make sure they had the ability to travel internationally. Turns out that about 80% of Allegiant customers have a passport. But we're seeing some very different than what Frontier and others have reported.  When asked, do you plan to travel internationally in the next 6 months or have you traveled both internationally in the last 6 months? The answer is the same between like 16% and 19% say, yes. That means the vast majority of our customers, 80% have no plans and have not traveled internationally in 2023.\nJohn Redmond: And I think maybe, Scott, it's worth elaborating on to the 16% to 19% you're talking about hasn't changed year-over-year.\nScott DeAngelo: That's right. It hasn't been a zero-sum as much as now it's open, and they've taken an additional trip.\nJohn Redmond: Yes. Great point. For us, it's not a displacement argument at all. The percentages are consistent year in and year out.\nOperator: The next question comes from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: On the doubling of the Allways credit card contribution, just trying to understand the cadence there. I assume that's both card growth and spend. But in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the potential of Sunseeker contributing. Just curious about the ramp there going forward.\nScott DeAngelo: Absolutely. So the comment that in the next 3 years will, in effect, double from roughly where we ended last year at $97 million, going to post over $100 million. It's largely based without Sunseeker assumed in it. So it is from the key things you mentioned. Increased cardholder growth, compounded cardholder spend right as that portfolio grows and we achieve at or above the same spend per cardholder. So I think John's comments in the beginning represent upside that could even make it faster. My comments were not based on any additional goodness, which we'll absolutely get from Sunseeker opening.\nJohn Redmond: Yes. I think -- this is John. I think when you look at the -- I think, a huge data point that Scott has pointed out is the channels that were in the past with a MasterCard program not available to a cardholder that are now or will be available to a cardholder, most notably Costco is significant. So that type of increase then doesn't require necessarily an increase in the number of although we are planning on that. But just the channels of use are going to expand significantly with moving to Visa.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. That's helpful. And then on Sunseeker, great commentary on ADRs and bookings. But the question that I get, and maybe this is kind of the Mike's point as well is, just around the inflection point on profitability, like I realize that you're working towards opening. I'm just trying to get some color on your path to profitability there. When we could expect a potential contribution over? Again, I realized that it's still early days, but just any thoughts there would be helpful.\nJohn Redmond: When you talk about a cash contribution or contribution of -- you said turn, now you're talking about EBITDA, we don't intend to ever be negative on a quarterly basis, I mean there's no time, we forecast any period that we would have a negative EBITDA. So I think from a cash standpoint, they're going to be positive throughout the year with the added upside in the out years. So we purposely priced the product that you see out there for '23 and '24 below market. So even when you see these rates, believe it or not, we're below market because we're putting a new brand and a new property into that market.  So when you look at after we've been open for a period of time, and I'm not talking years, I'm talking a month. You're going to start to see that rate -- that -- those rates accelerate up. So we purposely have underpriced. And even with that purposeful underpricing, those ADRs are impressive, but you will see those ramp up significantly for sure, the 25.5%.\nOperator: I would like to turn the call back to John Redmond for closing remarks.\nJohn Redmond: Well, I appreciate everyone's time. We're very proud of our team and the management here and what we've been able to accomplish year-to-date. And we're very excited about the balance of this year. An incredible amount of time and resources have gone into systems over last couple of years. You're starting to see the rollout of all that time and effort will started to happen this year, which really sets the backbone for this company going forward.  So we will have no restrictions, limitations what have you from a system standpoint as we move into the 20 aircraft -- or 200 aircraft environment, I should say that Greg referred to, everything is allowing us to do everything we need to and want to do going forward. So absolutely, no restrictions. And our focus now is just finishing up the last labor agreements. We're very encouraged by where we are today and where we're going to end up tomorrow with those agreements. So again, very bullish about the out years for this company. Very exciting times ahead, and stay tuned. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

And with that, I will turn it over to John.\nJohn Redmond: Thank you very much, Sherry and good afternoon, everyone. We have hit the ground running in 2023 and continued operational strength leading to financial results. We reported earnings per share of $3.09, which compares favorably to our initial expectation and provides us confidence to raise the midpoint of our full-year EPS guidance to roughly $9.75 a share. The leisure customer range remains exceptionally strong as evidenced by total revenue growth of 29% as compared to Q1 prior year coupled with recent company history best Q1 load factors approaching 86%. These results exceeded our expectations and were underpinned by a stellar operational performance with an impressive controllable completion during a quarter of 99.9%. We delivered this operational performance while growing departures 2.3% on a load factor of 85.8% during the quarter. More than 4.1 million guests traveled on our airline helping fuel a record quarter for always credit card acquisitions of 46,000 card holders as we ended the quarter with 435,000 active card holders. A key focus of this management team is improving the experience of our guests and the strengthening of our brand. This is a critical tool for us in expanding our powerful customer database of 16.5 million customers, which is growing on average by 225,000 per month. The continued demand of our product by our customers is key to support the 1400 incremental routes that airline growth our team has identified. Being the employer of choice for our team members is one of our top priorities, we strive to make a positive impact on our employees, thus, I was very pleased to see Allegiant named one of Forbes America's best mid-size employers for 2023 and Newsweek's America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2023. In addition, prioritizing our team members also includes reaching collective bargaining agreements with our flight attendants and pilots. Getting these respective deals done is number one on my priority list. I remain optimistic about reaching agreements with these team members that these team members deserve and are proud to support. Great progress has been made with both CBAs and we would expect these to be finalized in the not too distant future. Turning to Sunseeker Resort, Charlotte Harbor, I'm pleased to report we are currently on track for official opening date of October 16th. The Sunseeker team and construction crews have been working around the clock and the remediation work related to our hurricane and other events is just about finalized. As we have worked through construction delays and repair work related to the hurricane, we have clear line of sight to a final budget. We have updated the capital expenditure budget, which is inclusive of the Aileron Golf Club, including both the golf course renovation and construction of the new clubhouse and entry gate to $695 million. We are well outside of the normal hotel booking curve, yet we remain encouraged by early booking indicators. To-date, we have booked roughly 2000 transient room nights at an ADR of $407 with minimal advertising effort. More importantly, the ADR has been accelerating over the last two-months, coming in at $540 and $460 for business booked in the months of March and April respectively. In addition, we have over six million Sunseeker Resort emails and expect the number to grow to closer to seven million emails by opening date. We continue to attract high quality group bookings as well with over 40 different groups currently contracted for rooms, food and beverage totaling 12.7 million. There are another four groups we are in advanced conversations with on 3000 rooms and 1.9 million in rooms food and beverage. Last month, we unveiled 20 original world-class food and beverage concepts. These unique offerings will truly be one of a kind for the area. Furthermore, we have always looked at the resort as an incubator to launch all the IP being created, so we are excited to reveal these incredible concepts. Touching briefly on Sunseeker financials. Total operating expense during Q1 2023 came in right below our estimated five million for the quarter. We continue to expect a similar run rate in the second quarter before jumping to roughly 15 million during the third quarter, related to pre-opening expenses. All in, we currently anticipate a $1.25 loss per share for 2023 attributable to Sunseeker Resort. This amount does not include insurance recoveries related to business interruption coverage. In closing, I want to thank our employees for a tremendous quarter. Your efforts drove an exceptional operation, which is paramount for our guests, for you our employees and for long-term vision of this company. Many of you I recently visited on my travels to several of our bases and your enthusiasm, dedication and passion is infectious. Thank you. With that, I will turn it over to Greg.\nGregory Anderson: John, thank you and thank you everyone for joining today's call. 2023 is off to a great start as reported in our first quarter results. The team delivered meaningful improvements in operational areas across the Board, most notably a terrific 99.9% controllable completion factor with an industry-leading 99.1% completion factor. This operational excellence was evident in our financial performance as our total irregular operational cost came in just below $9 million, that is down $57 million compared to the same period in 2022. I couldn't be prouder of this team's performance, and I'm happy to report an update on our C-suite and that is the Keny Wilper, who has served as our Interim COO since January, has been appointed as our permanent Chief Operating Officer. Congrats, Keny. You have our full support and confidence. This is one of the most exciting times I have experienced in my history with Allegiant. Our leadership team is strongly aligned and our team members are dedicated to executing and strides and rethinking process to become more productive and to strengthen this organization. For example, our planning, finance and operational teams continue to work together shoulder-to-shoulder on a multi-disciplined approach to drive operational excellence while expertly matching capacity with demand. Recently and to preserve operational reliability, the team trimmed full-year capacity 2.5 points now guiding zero to 3% ASM growth. This is a result of MRO delays for aircraft and heavy maintenance, pilot constraints, but along with airport construction disruption and ATC delays in some key markets, particularly during peak travel days. Even with this reduction in guided capacity, we expect improvement in full-year airline earnings to $11 per share, an increase in our full-year guide of EPS of $4 per share. We believe our measured approach coupled with our differentiated model, sets us up well to deliver industry leading results regardless of the broader macro environment. As mentioned last quarter, we have incorporated within our EPS guide the expected cost increase for our open labor agreements. The actual increases in compensation will vary depending upon economic terms for each and the timing of these agreements. This increased compensation was initially incorporated into our full-year EPS guide beginning in July. However, we have now moved this date up to May 1st as we fully expect to be paying higher rates in the near future once agreements are finalized and approved. In fact, I'm happy to announce we reached a tentative agreement on a contract extension with our dispatchers represented by the IBT. This agreement will modify the final pay rate increases in the CBA and provide a two-year extension on their current CBA. I think it is important to note that this contract did not even become amendable until May 31st of next year, but the parties work together to bring this meaningful improvements to our dispatchers today. And as John mentioned, we are still in active negotiations with our flight attendants represented by TWU and our pilots represented by IBT. Resolving our open labor agreements is our highest priority. Negotiations with our flight attendants opened eight months ago and we are quickly closing in on the outstanding open items. Both sides are very pleased with the progress that has been made, and we look forward to announcing a tentative agreement very soon. On the pilot front, we had our first mediation sessions with the IBT last week with another session taking place next week. After working to highlight and identify the gaps in each side's proposals, all parties left the first sessions encouraged by the possibility of finding a path to an expedited deal. As a result, the mediators have already provided numerous additional dates to continue to work together towards resolution. Touching briefly on our current pilot staffing, our net head count for the year remains roughly flat and consistent with the trends message last quarter. However, within our schoolhouse, the number of new hire pilots are outpacing our initial expectations. With the strong recruiting team and pathway programs in the works, we remain confident in our ability to attract, train, and grow pilots. Allegiant is uniquely set up to be the destination airline for our team members. Our out and back model is built around our flight crews having the opportunity to be home every night and that is something they highly value. We look forward to reaching agreement with our flight attends and pilots, and provide compensation and work rules that they can be proud of and most importantly, they deserve. Turning briefly to our systems transformation, we continue to make significant progress on our four core system integrations, Navitaire, SAP Tracks and NAVBLUE. First up will be Navitaire, which we expect to go live this quarter. It enhanced functionality in our commercial platform is expected to unlock additional features to drive higher ancillaries and bundles. In addition, Navitaire provides the necessary functionality for us to expand internally in New Mexico through our joint venture with Viva Airbus. While we are still awaiting DOT antitrust immunity, we are confident in this outcome. We are fired up about this partnership and its unique ability to provide incredible value to our guests and more growth opportunities for our team members. And in closing, these results cannot be accomplished without the efforts of Team Allegiant over the past 90-days, I have had the amazing opportunity to immerse myself more broadly throughout the organization and in particular with our frontline team members. Each visit has been exceptional for me. I have the privilege of meeting the best team members in the industry, a learning experience that provides me with the insights to continue to assist and help those in the field that everyday provide our guests with a safe, reliable, and convenient product. I want to thank each and every one of them. And with that, I will turn the call over to Scott DeAngelo, our Chief Marketing Officer.\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, Greg. First quarter saw unprecedented demand generation and capture that enabled Drew and his industry leading revenue management team to maximize both load and yield, resulting in record setting revenue results. What is more, our nearly 30% year-over-year increase in revenue was driven by advertising spend that was 10% lower than prior year. This greater marketing efficacy was driven by leveraging data science and enabling technologies, including beginning to leverage artificial intelligence to create more targeted, more personalized and higher impact execution. For example, our major sales events in January and February were executed purely via digital advertising and our owned media assets and they drove four of the top eight book revenue days in our history. In addition to the historic overall base fare and air ancillary revenue performance in Q1 we also, as John mentioned, continue to outperform expectations with our Always Rewards credit card program. Q1 was the strongest to-date, both in terms of new card signups with March being our single best month ever for new card signups and in terms of program compensation. We are closing in on 500,000 card holders and for the year expect to generate more than $100 million in recognized revenue from the Always Rewards credit card, which, as you know, has an EBITDA margin of more than 90% and about 500 million in flown revenue from card holders who still represent fewer than 3% of total customers. So plenty of upside there as we continue to generate new card signups at an ever increasing rate. Beyond that our Always Rewards non-credit card program, which has more than 15 million total members saw one million members booked during Q1. That is up 44% versus last year. And these rewards program members exhibited spend that was 32% higher than non-members driven by greater air ancillary take rates and greater third party hotel and rental car attachment. Our active customer base continues to be a healthy balance of repeat and first time customers. Like last quarter, we surveyed a representative sample from both these most frequent flying rewards program members as well as those who flew us for the first time ever this past quarter. To understand why they traveled with us and what their future travel intentions were, and the results were virtually identical to what they were in January. For these most frequent flyers, nearly 80% traveled for leisure only, and nearly 20% traveled for both business and leisure. More than 40% said they stayed with family or friends, and nearly 40% said they stayed at their second vacation home. That means around 80% fallen into types of travel that are the most resilient during negative economic climate. To further validate this, we again ask these customers the extent to which they expected their travel plans with Allegiant to be impacted, given the prospect of worsening economic conditions, and they told us the same thing they did a quarter ago. Nearly 50% said that economic considerations would have no impact on their flying behavior with Allegiant in the next 12-months and more than 30% said that economic considerations would actually make them more likely to fly with Allegiant in the next 12-months. In addition to this core and growing base of loyal frequent flyers, who drive the majority of our revenue, we continue to add new customers that are defecting from traditional higher fare airlines to Allegiant at record levels. And these customers express similar future travel intention with more than 40% of these first time customers saying that the macroeconomic climate will have no impact and more than 40% saying, it will make them more likely to fly again with Allegiant in this upcoming year. The only meaningful change past quarter among first time customers was at a significantly larger portion versus three-months ago said that, they last flew or regularly flew were one of the top four largest traditional higher fare carriers. All that said, while some customers are expressing concern about the economy and a portion say they do plan to take fewer leisure travel trips than they did last year, we view this simply as a return to normalized pre-pandemic peak and non peak seasonal travel patterns. And the fact that, any downward pressure that might come from macroeconomic factors appears to be only reinforcing our existing customer's decision to keep flying Allegiant as well as driving more new customers to Allegiant has us remaining bullish from a forward look demand perspective. Allegiant is not only fully capable of maximizing peak travel demand capture, we are unique in our ability to capture a greater slide, should there be any temporary shrinking of the leisure travel pie during off peak leisure travel periods through our direct-to-consumer marketing approach that appeals to those seek and relief from sky high fares for flights that connect through crowded hubs and makes them aware of believes in slow fare and all non-stop flights brand. And as our customer research points do, we continue to grow our addressable customer audience by capturing a greater share of those who have usually flown traditional higher fare carriers, but given the current environment are choosing to buy into the ULCC category with Allegiant. As such, we believe Allegiant is well-positioned to weather any challenging macroeconomic conditions, just as we have always done historically. And with that, I will turn it over to our Chief Revenue Officer, Drew Wells.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. I'm extremely pleased with the first quarter performance of 650 million in total revenue, growth of nearly 30% and system ASM growth of just 1.2%. This combination produced a TRASM of 13.89, which beat any previous first quarter by a $0.04 and grew year-over-year by 28.8%. Further, four March weeks landed in the top 12 from an all time TRASM perspective. Could not be happier with the peak spring break season and the quarter as a whole, both financially and operationally. The strength in the quarter was well balanced as both yields and core air ancillary products each contributed one to 1.5 points of outperformance against the expectation of the previous call, providing lift from the expected mid-20%. Encouragingly, the Allegiant extra rollout while still early has continued to exceed expectations and we are thrilled to make this option available to more guests on more routes soon. Additionally, our Charter Group worked incredibly hard to set a first quarter record revenue performance as well. They were opportunistic in filling in scheduled service gaps, through high fuel January and February, with new fixed fee business giving us the incremental lift. As I mentioned three-months ago, we are looking at forward indicators and have not seen anything that causes to incorporate a downturn into our models. While we continue to read and hear the same headlines, we have not seen booking impact from our leisure customer base and have forecasted as such. In the event, macroeconomic pressures become real, our business model is well-positioned to adapt and overcome. Building on Scott's commentary, many of the pieces that have made us resilient to macroeconomic pressures have strengthened overtime. Our total ancillary performance of $75 per passenger in the first quarter provides a very healthy base from which we can optimize airfare to maximize total revenue and historically has shown resilience in all environments. We accomplished that milestone without the expected benefits of Navitaire coming later this year after the upcoming deployment Greg mentioned. Our trip costs has reduced and will continue to reduce drastically since the last non-COVID economic downturn. Thanks to the addition of first used Airbus A320 family aircraft and soon, New Boeing Max technology that continue to lower the threshold required to achieve profitability. On the whole, we still expect chasm over the last nine-months to be up mid single digits in aggregate even in the face of more challenging comps with the most challenging coming in the fourth quarter. Continued operational stability, a historically mature network, expanded Allegiant extra product and the Navitaire integration provide tailwinds that support the revenues fairly through the year. As we continue to work hand-in-hand with our operational groups to best align the future schedule, we have made the decision to trim about 2.5 points of capacity out of our summer schedule, which will push the next two-quarters to around flat year-over-year and the full-year ASM story a bit lower than originally thought. While our original plan schedule already had dialed back Vegas as a percent of the overall system, an outsized portion of the recent summer trims also came here in Vegas as construction work impacts operations. We remain bullish on the demand environment, though factors like completion, operational reliability, both controllable and uncontrollable to Allegiant as well as fuel will continue to play a role in the planning process. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Robert Neal.\nRobert Neal: Thanks Drew. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. We are pleased to report today first quarter consolidated net income of $56.1 million, yielding a consolidated adjusted earnings per share of $3.04 and when excluding Sunseeker, we reported airline only EPS of $3.30 well ahead of our expectations. Drew mentioned that unit revenues increased 28.8% versus the same quarter last year. This was on the back of X fuel airline unit cost of 7.75, which were up 9.8% as compared to the same quarter last year on 1.2% more capacity. Unit cost headwinds in the quarter included elevated airport costs, lower aircraft productivity and higher credit card fees from higher revenue along with a one-time employer retention credit that we had in the 2022 comp. Additionally, fuel costs were elevated through much of the quarter coming in 11.4% higher per gallon versus the first quarter of 2022, but improved operational performance provided a nice tailwind to our unit costs. As noted, we have reduced our full-year 2023 capacity outlook by roughly 2.5 percentage points. So we expect this will leave continued pressure on unit cost metrics throughout the year. However, since our last guidance update, we have seen improvements in our fuel cost outlook driven primarily by a steep reduction in the crack spread of nearly a dollar per gallon from the high point in late January, allowing us to reduce our estimated full-year cost per gallon to be $3 down from $3.60. The reduced fuel forecast coupled with continued strength and peak leisure demand drives an increase to our full-year airline estimated earnings per share of $4 at the midpoint to a new range of $9 to $13. Our full-year earnings guidance incorporates increased costs associated with pilot flight attendant and dispatcher agreements, as well as wage increases for our maintenance technicians all beginning in May. While of course actual increases in these costs will vary depending on the final terms reach, completing these CBAs with major work groups is a top priority for us. We are built to be a larger airline than the one we are running today, and we believe the efficiencies gain from better utilizing our existing infrastructure and fleet will outweigh costs associated with new labor rates. In looking at the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with total available liquidity of $1.5 billion. That includes approximately 400 million in undrawn credit facilities and 1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The business produced roughly 215 million in cash from operations during the quarter, a first quarter company high for Allegiant. As our capital expenditure commitments remain elevated throughout 2023, we will continue to take a conservative approach to liquidity and expect to finance most of this year's CapEx with debt. Now turning to fleet, we inducted three Airbus A320ceo aircraft during the first quarter, bringing the total operating fleet to 124 aircraft with two additional A320 aircraft owned in on property at the end of the quarter, which we expect in operation in the coming weeks. For the remainder of 2023, we expect to take delivery of three midlife A320 series and two 737 MAX 8-200 aircraft. As mentioned on our last call, our first 737 8-200 aircraft are scheduled for delivery to Allegiant very late in the fourth quarter. And so for capacity planning purposes, we are not relying on these airplanes for revenue service until early 2024. We remain in very active dialogue with Boeing regarding the remainder of our 737 MAX delivery schedule. And as of today, still expect to take delivery of all aircraft in the firm order book by late 2025. 2023 is an investment year for Allegiant with approximately one billion in CapEx, and most of this is for assets with earning potential coming in 2024. And so notwithstanding our expected earnings production this year, we would expect to exit 2023 with net debt to EBITDA similar to current levels. In regard to Sunseeker CapEx, our current capitalized expenditures and updated budget in today's release would indicate 124 million remaining to complete the project. The deposit account for our Sunseeker financing facility holds 118 million in cash allocated for completion of resort construction. So to clarify, for the remaining 124 million, we do not expect meaningful use of liquidity sources to cover remaining construction costs. In closing, I would like to add my thanks to all of our hardworking team members, their strong execution during the first quarter, and in particular, improved operational metrics gives me great confidence in our ability to scale this unique business model. With that, Chris, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question. Our first question will come from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. This is [Matt] (Ph) on for Savi. You all provided some color on the capacity and CASM-X impacts. I'm wondering if you could provide maybe a little detail on each one of those buckets and how you are thinking of the contribution there and the cadence from second quarter and the second half as well.\nRobert Neal: Yes, Matt, it is BJ, you know, I think in the 9.8% increase year-over-year, you can think about four points of that being related to the retention credit. That is largely offset by the benefit from, reduced irregular offs costs. And then you have got a couple points for reduced asset utilization. A couple points for credit card fees and then, let's call it, three for stations and airport related costs. I think that covers it, the rest of it should kind of fall onto the other bucket there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate that there. And then also you all spoke on the pilot situation and your net hires for the year. Does that imply that attrition has gotten worse to your prior plan or how are you thinking about attrition relative to when you spoke about it last quarter?\nGregory Anderson: Hey, Matt. It is Greg. No. I mean, attrition is in-line with what the plan is, but where we have seen a lot of upside, particularly as of late as within the schoolhouse, so the new hires coming in. The team there and I think I mentioned this on the last call have some terrific pathway program with the military, with the universities called Alleviate Pilot Pathway and also with Spartan. So to put that into perspective, we were planning on like 12 new pilots per class. We are roughly running in May 20 and in the summer as well, 20 per class. So we are encouraged on that regard. I think in my opening comments, so I mentioned that just overall, it is in-line with what we are expecting and basically net pilot is flat.\nUnidentified Analyst: You did great. Thank you all very much.\nJohn Redmond: Thanks Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg: Good morning everyone. Question for Scott DeAngelo. Scott, you do a lot of survey work, it seems to be fairly granular. I was intrigued by the answer of first time flyers who - the last time they had flown, they had flown one of the legacy carriers. Do you also ask some of these customers first time or even current customers who've flown the bigger carriers? What was the reason and whether if the reason had to do with a loss of service? I think we have seen the big three pull out of about 70 or 80 airports over the last year or so. And some of those airports are airports that you serve. And I'm just curious if that - you are picking up some of that traffic? And I have a second question.\nScott DeAngelo: Yes, absolutely. Thanks Michael for that question. The answer is, yes. The winning reasons still tend to be price and non-stop flight, followed by schedule. But indeed in places where they pulled out as has been kind of our history of growing up market that certainly is a tailwind as well. But I would say, largely these are people actively choosing us versus other options because of price and because of non-stop flights.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And then just in the revised guidance, I guess this is probably for Greg and BJ. You can back into kind of the impact from the reduced fuel price. What sort of assumption are you building in for revenue that you are able to hold on to. I assume you are building in sort of loss of revenue as fuel prices decline, just given the historical correlation, what is the stickiness? I don't know, if you have some sort of correlation or percentage fuel down by a certain amount, you cut revenue by a certain amount to reflect maybe macro weakness and/or pass through in the fair structure. How do you think about that? Thank you.\nDrew Wells: Hey, Mike. Drew here, I will take this one. There is definitely a relationship between the two. But if you think about how Allegiant has historically handled fuel price changes has been through capacity. And as we have kind of become our own worst enemy if you will towards unitized metrics as we add capacity and to take advantage of lower fuel, but is a massive benefit to the bottom line. We are probably a bit more constrained than we have been historically to be able to fully take advantage of a fuel price declines here in the short-term. So I would expect our revenue to remain more intact, it will probably won't be non-impacted, but I wouldn't run away with any sort of materiality on decreases to the rest side.\nScott DeAngelo: Okay, fair that is helpful in allowing us to set the things right and the impact. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Next question will come from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey thanks, good morning to you. So just with respect to the guidance, I think you said the next couple quarters flat, which I assume 2Q is one of those quarters. So if you can hit 2Q flatten 2Q, it is your biggest quarter of the year in terms of absolute ASMs. I assume you feel like you are undersized a bit relative to demand in 2Q. So, just bear with me here. If you can hit flat in 2Q just mathematically, it feels like you could hit low teens growth in 3Q and mid-teens growth in 4Q just mathematically. So what is holding you back or just practically how would you push back on that math?\nJohn Redmond: Yes, Duane, I think the way I would talk about is break down the quarters into the different periods, right. So we think about third quarter will be mostly constrained, obviously in our peaks. And so, there is a ceiling on what we can do in July, which will impact the quarter as a whole. And there probably is room if we wanted to increase September. But I don't think that is something that we are looking to do today. I think - is down 3% again this morning. If that continues to run down, I think you will see some, some additions into September. So it is a lot about breaking out where we are constrained. September being fuel versus demand, if we get goodness there, then you are right. I would expect some run, but otherwise, it is going to be dictated by the peak flying in each of those quarters and where that ceiling hits.\nGregory Anderson: Hey Duane, this is Greg. Maybe let me just add one other comment to that, and at the end of the year, we start to take our Boeing aircraft, so we are going to pull crew. We want to be ready to make sure that we could support that order. And so that is another element to kind of limit the capacity growth in the back half of the year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just to follow-up there, why would ramping on Boeing impact growth on Airbus?\nJohn Redmond: We have to pull the crews to get them trained to be able to fly on the Boeing Max. So we will have a number of pilots that are offline for that training that unable to fly on the Airbus during that time.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, and then maybe just relatedly, just because I wanted to ask you about that. What are the sort of second fleet type costs that you are expecting in the back half of the year that you are not incurring now? I guess I would have thought of that as sort of net new, fresh recruiting of Boeing and pilots, but maybe we are thinking about that the wrong way.\nGregory Anderson: Yes, the way we have it planned Duane, is, the way I think about it is. From a pilot inefficiency perspective in terms of pulling pilots to Drew's point to train on the new aircraft, we think probably this year in 2023 it will be roughly $5 million headwind. And then as we go into 2024 and 2025, that gets up to $15, but it then normalizes kind of back in 2025. So from a DNA perspective, there will be a headwind, we think of the back half of this year with the limited productivity from a CASM perspective. But, you know, I think that is probably two tenths of a cent thereabouts, is what we are expecting. But is that, maybe, let me pause there. Is that kind of where you are going. You just wanted to understand the headwinds from a D&A and a, you know, labor perspective.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. The next question will come from Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Your line is open.\nConor Cunningham: Hi everyone. Thank you. So historically I think you have done like 60% of your net income in the first half. I mean, this year's going to be a little bit different with labor and some of the Sunseeker stuff, but just curious on how you get to the high end and the low end in the back half, if not just, is it all, you know, unit revenue based. Just curious on the swing factors there. Thank you.\nJohn Redmond: Yes. Sorry Conor, we were discussing it. Yes, I think the revenue environment is a pretty big impact there. I would also, as we would like to caution pretty much every quarter, remember our share count is relatively low. So a $4 swing in EPS, is not a lot in absolute terms of bottom line. So you don't have to be a big one, fuel. We will swing a little bit too. I don't know if there is anything else you guys want to talk about.\nGregory Anderson: Yes, I mean, I think Connor, this is Greg just to hit, you know, on that point. And there is kind of like three, the way I think about it, three periods in the year that really, you know, drive the bottom line. That is March or, that is the summer and that is the holiday period. So, you know, first quarter I think, I thought we put out some really good numbers. I think second quarter we will do the same and that that will continue to catapult us into a really strong year as we see it.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. That is helpful. And then just on the MAX, I'm just curious on if there is any language in the contract that can allow you to get out of the seven if the certification continues to be delayed. Have you thought about that at all, as you start to think about like, getting back to this double digit growth rate, I think that you have historically spoke to in 2024 and beyond? Thank you.\nJohn Redmond: Yes. Hey Conor, I mean, we can't talk about language in the contract. I think we have, you know, adequate protection for the company in that agreement with respect to the certification on the MAX, we have been close to Boeing throughout all of this year, as they have been working on getting that aircraft certified. I don't know that at this point we have any interest in getting out of those commitments just given we think those delivery positions are extremely valuable and we are really looking forward to the earnings that those aircraft are going to produce as compared to those that they will replace.\nGregory Anderson: Hey, Connor. This is Greg. I might just add a couple of quick comments to that as well. As we think about longer-term over the next five to six years, at Allegiant, we are planning to be an airline with 200 aircraft. This order with Boeing, this is a big foundational piece of partners to be part of that. And as BJ has talked about in the past, when you get to an airline of our size, having a new order is really important to support those long-term fleet plan targets. But as you said, the economics on the Boeing aircraft, they are 20% more fuel efficient. That is like we talked a lot about EBITDA per aircraft, six million in 2019. If you think about the MAX aircraft, those on average earn two million more in EBITDA per aircraft than our current fleet. So terrific operating metrics there - numbers. There is some inefficiencies that we talked about with having dual fleet type, but obviously those operating economics we believe greatly outweigh those inefficiencies and also we are able to mitigate some of the complexities giving our unique base strategy where we base the different aircraft in various bases on all Airbus fleet of one base and all Boeing fleet in another. So all-in-all, we are still really fired up about the order. We think it could be a game changer long-term for us, bringing that fleet type in. The team has done a really good job of getting ready to bring it on.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question will come from Daniel McKenzie of Seaport Global. Your line is open.\nDaniel McKenzie: Thanks you guys. So a couple questions here. One was just trying to put a finer point on the full-year guide and my question really was just whether it embeds margin expansion in each of the remaining quarters. And if it would tie to revenue conservatism possibly some cost conservatism or perhaps more tied to sub-optimal aircraft utilization. Just, whatever you can share would be great.\nRobert Neal: Hey, Dan, it is BJ, if you can hear me. Look, I mean, we have really tried to stay away from any guidance on the quarterly cadence in particular. Really proud of the on margin that we produced in the first quarter. I will say that, and I think you can kind of back into the off margin on a full-year basis and see about what we produced in the remaining three-quarters. To answer your question, we are not expecting continued expansion throughout the year. On the cost side, I think we feel pretty good about the cost scoring, most of a - lot of our costs are in definitely keeping an eye on fleet utilization and just the drag on asset productivity. But that is in our guide already. And then on the revenue side, Drew, if you have anything to add there?\nDrew Wells: No, I mean we have pretty good insight to the second quarter, and then we are kind of a bit more blind as you go into the back half of the year. So there is certainly some variability that could be there.\nDaniel McKenzie: Yes, I understood. Okay. Fair enough. Second question here, just follows up on that last point kind of a question on the cost of a good operation, and just getting at unpacking the upside from here operationally. So I guess what I'm trying to get at is the buffer that you guys have built into the schedule whatever may year it makes sense to benchmark against so reserves soft times spares today versus where you would like to be once past ATC understaffing, and then just related to the cost of this good operation, how can we think about the cost and revenue penalty that eventually goes away once we get back to the environment where we can operate a little bit more efficiently?\nGregory Anderson: Hey, Dan, why don't I start with and just the - I think the quick takeaway is if you look at our IROPs numbers from last year, I think full-year 2022, it was roughly like 136 million in IROPs. The first quarter of 2022 was like 66 million. We were well below that this quarter, eight or nine million, eight million. So you can see that when you are not completing flights and you are running an operation that is not doing that, it gets really expensive really quickly. And so that is why, and shout out to John Redmond, and Drew and Kenny and team to make sure that we are putting up operational reliability focus, and then we will build on that. And then once you have that in place, you start seeing things across the board improve, for example, like unplanned absences with our, our flight crews are much better now trending in the right direction, because there is a better operations out there. So you get that stability and then you start strengthening on top of that. So I think that gives a good indication on what the upside is and how important it is, particularly for us. We believe to run bid ops. But I think on the revenue side, Drew, did you want to follow-up with anything on that?\nDrew Wells: No, I mean, you are right. We built that a fair amount and then schedule in terms of slack through the day to be able to catch up for be it ATC or things even out of our control, spare count's a little bit higher. I would say we probably were under spared earlier, and we are probably at a healthier number now. We will continue to run heavy maintenance lines through the entire year, which is something that we weren't doing as a smaller airline. So there are some kind of unique things that will persist in terms of lack of productivity, but are the right things overall for the company. So there is a little bit for us to recapture as we get into the next couple of years, particularly taking advantage of the reliability of the Boeing MAX aircraft as that rolls out. But I would say there is a fair amount of those penalties that will remain in place.\nJohn Redmond: And when you look at all that, we obviously, we provide annual guidance because we are long-term thinkers, not short-term. And when you have a bad operation if you will, you denigrate your brand. And so our brand, as you heard me make a comment about is extremely important to us today and long-term. And that is why the operational integrity of the airline is paramount to what we want to do.\nGregory Anderson: And, Dan, just think I might just add one more quick point. Sorry to jump back in. But, we talked about this, I think, on the last call, but just like what an extra half hour productivity does to the bottom-line. Just an extra half hour of flying in today's environment is worth like $50 million to the bottom-line with like an extra half hour worth a quarter of a cent of mix as well. So right now we are running about six hours a little over six hours per day, because that is for reasons we talked about some of the constraints. But as you are able to take that up with productivity, you can see some meaningful upside to the numbers that we provided.\nDaniel McKenzie: Perfect. Thanks, you guys. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody. Thank you for the question. On second quarter CASM, just wanting to know, are you implying 10% year-over-year and then for second and third quarter and then fourth quarter down a little bit?\nJohn Redmond: I don't think we have implied anything at a quarter level. I think you could probably read between the lines a little bit over the last nine-months of aggregate and where the comparisons came in from last year, and maybe run with it from there. But, like Robert mentioned earlier, we are not going to buy too much of the quarterly specifics.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Did you give a full-year CASM guidance number?\nRobert Neal: No. We didn't.\nHelane Becker: Can you?\nRobert Neal: No. I think we decided that we would just guide full-year EPS, Helane and then the other numbers that are there in the guidance table that you can kind of back into what is happening with CASM-ex throughout the year at the big fuel price.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That is fair enough. And then I just have one unrelated question. Is the DOT approval of the Viva code share contingent on Mexico recouping CAT 1 status. And do you anticipate - I know I know the Mexicans, who are thinking they should have it by the fourth quarter. But given that FAA has to be reauthorized this year, are you anticipating any delays?\nGregory Anderson: Hey, Helane. It is Greg. Why don't I take that real quick? The audits take place here in May and the expectation, this is for - I'm sorry that category one status being reinstated. Does that set to take place in May and our counterparts kind of Viva expect a great outcome there would expect the category one data to be reestablished in the summer. That is kind of the timing in that regard. In terms of our antitrust community approval with the DOT, the application is substantially complete. And so we are waiting for the DOT to come back with a ruling on that. There is not a set timeline per say. But I think we have all the information in and they get to it, then we will be looking forward to hearing where we are at with that. But we are optimistic that we will be.\nHelane Becker: Thank you. Thanks\nGregory Anderson: Thanks Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Really helpful to have the Sunseeker outlook that you gave us this quarter, but I was just hoping you could help us part that out a bit further. As we think about the fourth quarter, which is almost a full operating quarter, does that get closer to breakeven or how do we think about a typical ramp up for a new hotel opening to get to breakeven? Thanks.\nGregory Anderson: Hi Catherine. I think the best number we are going to provide at this point in time is the dollar and a quarter negative dollar and a quarter. There is a lot of moving parts we are going to still run into in Q4. You know, we believe the opening date is pretty solid, but anything can happen including another hurricane and you also have BI, interruption insurance. So there is a lot of things that can happen there that I wouldn't want to mislead anyone in that regard. So I think as we stand today, I think we will just stick with the guidance that we gave on the negative UTS of a dollar a quarter for Sunseeker and leave it at that.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay fair enough. And then I apologize, I do want to come back to CASM for this year. I know, you are not providing any formal guidance, but you gave a lot of details last quarter on puts and takes. That got me personally to a high single digit airline only CASM-X increase year-over-year. And understanding council won't be throughout the year, but now capacity is expected to be 2.5 points lower, and we are now assuming the labor step up in May versus July, versus where you were three-months ago is that a couple of extra points or given the capacity cut was a little further out, we shouldn't be doing a one for one capacity versus CASM-X increase. Just on my own high single digit number that would get me into low double digits is, is any of that mask like in the right zip code?\nRobert Neal: Yes actually it BJ. I think that with the guidance that we have put out there, that is about what you would imply or what you could take away on CASM-X for the full-year. You have got the - we took the labor costs, which were previously baked in beginning July 1 and brought them up to May 1, and then you take out a little bit of capacity, so it is slightly above where you were when we spoke last quarter.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Next question will come from Chris Stathoulopoulos of Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Good afternoon everyone. So sorry to beat a dead horse here. But in the absence of some of the kind of more core explicit guidance items here, I just want to understand this. So in your prepared remarks, you talk about EPS growth despite lower capacity, it would seem that this is mostly chasm led, but you are really not giving kind of really much color on the cadence of that. The last question implied, it was sort of a low double digit if I got that for airline only for full-years. So in absence of hard numbers here, qualitatively here could you kind of put a fuller point here is this tram and better utilization and productivity led and also if I caught you right, it sounded like the base case or midpoint of your guide, the economic scenario underpinning that is sort of a steady state, and want to make sure that that is correct. Thank you.\nRobert Neal: Yes, I will start and others can in here. I think, the raise on the guide of course taken into account the benefit of the reduced cool year fuel price. And then you are adding in some of the labor costs that we talked about for a couple of additional months there, and then continued revenue strengths in particular in the peak period. Drew.\nDrew Wells: Yes. On the travel front outperformance in the first quarter relative to what we had communicated, but a reiteration of what we were expecting for the last nine-months. So that steady comment is accurate from that front.\nRobert Neal: And we are not at the moment not forecasting a significant increase in asset utilization between now and the end of the year and that is just because we still have additional A320 aircraft coming on between now and -.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And my follow-up. So when I talk about the trade down, which you referenced in your prepared remark in a recession scenario with clients, it is generally perceived as sort of an academic view and perhaps let's wait and see how that plays out. So, and your customers are generally thought of as different versus the big three and the LCCs, I don't think you gave much car in terms of demographics in your survey work, but there is the perception that it is a different bucket if you will, given really kind of how you run the airline and more variable flying, et cetera. So if you could give some more detail on why you believe that in a slowdown - I realize that it is perhaps ultimately going to just come down to lower fares there, but if you could put a finer point on why you feel so strongly about this trade down effect into cyclical slowing. Thank you.\nScott DeAngelo: You bet. This is Scott, and I'm happy to start there. So first off, the demographic profile of our customers, and let's use CVG as a prime example. Formerly a Delta hub, they largely reduce flying it. We move it is one of our largest origin cities, and we share a bunch of customers with them. And from an income perspective, specifically discretionary from a summer second home ownership perspective, they are virtually the same customers. They often fly Delta when they are doing it on a corporate card, and when they are on their own dime, they don't want to stop the Atlanta and route to their second home in Florida. So they fly us. So I know that is one airport specific example, a big one for us, but we see that play over and over again in the Indianapolis, in the Pittsburgh. Think about places that network carriers traditionally had strong presence, but through consolidation, pulled outers, I like to say orphan in these markets. And what is left now is a former U.S. there - a former Delta and or shared customer that we have. So well, I know the market like to classify us next to the other ULCC. The customers don't see it that way. All they know is what airports flying nonstop at low cost from their airport and cities we serve that is us. And the only other thing I would tell you, we have even, and this is complete back to the envelope, fuzzy mass, but as we extrapolate from the mini surveys we do to our customer base, it suggests anywhere from 1.5 to two to one kind of trade down, if you will. Meaning for every one customer who goes out of the market decides to drive or not fly, we are seeing 1.5 to two come from another carrier, as part of the buy down. And so, we triangulate a bunch of different ways, but as a rule of thumb, that is what we have seen the last several quarters. And that is why we believe that if an app, macroeconomic environment shows deterioration people are still going to go see grandma for the holidays. They are still going to do a summer vacation as we saw. They went on spring break. They are just going to be a little more deliberate about the price they are paying and how quickly they can get there?\nJohn Redmond: I think what it comes down to, this is John, the carrier selection is not indicative of someone's net worth or demographic. The carrier selection is indicative of what someone's willing to pay on the travel as opposed to what they are willing to pay on the experience. So people who want to pay more on the experience and less on travel, they are selecting a lower cost carrier like us because that is the decision they make. So the mistake a lot of people make is associating Allegiant with a different demographic and that is a large mistake, and it is really indicative of a customer deciding to spend less on travel, and more on the experience when they arrive.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. This is [Ryan] (Ph) on for Scott. Just one here. Some of your peers have discussed sort of weaker than normal trough periods given less fill of peak demand. Just wondering if this is something Allegiant is seeing as well.\nDrew Wells: Drew here, I think what a lot of carriers are experiencing is what the leisure seasonality looks like. What we saw in January and February was very typical for what we would expect. We have still elevated relative to pre pandemic kind of performance. But the leisure customer, it generally needs that that catalyst, travel at spring break, that summer, holidays, a lot of things that Scott just mentioned in the last response. And I think maybe as an industry, we got carried away with how good September was, I think folks got priced out of the summer, and we are able to re-accommodate it to September. But I don't think that forward run rate we should expect through the January, February, through September, through the early December that are traditionally quite poor in the leisure space. So everything is elevated, but there is still going to be the peaks and valleys that are supposed to be leisure travel.\nUnidentified Analyst: That is helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. This will end the Q&A session for today's call. I would now like to turn the conference back to John Redmond for closing remarks.\nJohn Redmond: Thank you, operator. I recently had read a analyst report and it kind of reminds me of a comment I made several years ago in a Investor Day, which was, don't bet again Allegiant. This Allegiant team has only gotten better with each negative issue raised in the past from pre-transition risk to management change and course two more recent events such as pandemics and hurricanes. But we have only gotten significantly better as a team with a model that has been refined and transformed for an incredible future. So stay tuned. And again, I look forward to hosting many of you next week in Florida, should be a lot of fun and very informative as well. So thank you all for your time and take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day."}, {"symbol": "ALGT", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2023-02-01 20:28:06", "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2022 Allegiant Travel Company Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sherry Wilson. Please go ahead.\nSherry Wilson: Thank you, Justin. Welcome to the Allegiant Travel Company's full year and fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. On the call with me today are John Redmond, the Company's Chief Executive Officer; Greg Anderson, President; Scott DeAngelo, our EVP and Chief Marketing Officer; Drew Wells, our SVP and Chief Revenue Officer, Robert Neal, SVP and Chief Financial Officer; and a handful of others to help answer questions. We will start the call with commentary and then open it up to questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. The Company's comments today will contain forward-looking statements concerning our future performance and strategic plan. Various risk factors could cause the underlying assumptions of these statements and our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. These risk factors and others are more fully disclosed in our filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements are based on information available to us today. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise. The Company cautions investors not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which may be based on assumptions and events that do not materialize. To view this earnings release as well as the rebroadcast of the call, feel free to visit the Company's Investor Relations site at ir.allegiantair.com. With that, I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn Redmond: Thank you very much, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to begin by taking a moment to thank our team members for all their efforts this past year. 2022 was yet another difficult year. The operation was hit with countless challenges from COVID spikes to hurricanes and most recently, winter storms, but you stepped up and made sure our customers were taken care of. Your commitment to safety and service is remarkable, and I am proud of how you responded to these challenges. You likely heard the news that our COO, Scott Sheldon has made the decision to resign to pursue other opportunities. I want to thank Scott for his many years of service and dedication to our airline, and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors. With Scott's departure, Greg Anderson will continue to serve as President and will assume oversight of the Company's operational teams. As you all know, Greg has been with the Company for more than a decade. There is no better person to take on this role. He is highly respected both internally and within the industry, and I have the utmost phase he will execute on the numerous strategic initiatives we have in store this year. I'm pleased to report that despite the operational difficulties during the first half of the year, the last half of 2022 is a testament to the success of the challenges we implemented. We exited the year with a controllable completion percentage of 99.5%. Earlier this year, I noted we are a margin-focused company, and with operational improvements, margins would grow. This is exactly what happened we saw during the fourth quarter. We recorded an operating margin, excluding employee recognition bonus and Sunseeker special charges, just shy of 16% for the quarter. In addition, we generated more than $140 million in EBITDA during the quarter. Underpinning this strong financial performance is a robust demand environment that shows no signs o slowing. Fourth quarter TRASM of just about $0.14 with the highest quarterly TRASM in company history. This helped contribute to a record-setting total revenue for 2022 of $2.3 billion. We have great momentum heading into 2023. In regards to our ongoing negotiations with our flight attendants and pilots, it is our expectation to have an agreement in principle done with our flight attendants by midyear. To date, we have reached tentative agreements on 2/3 of open sections. The pilot negotiations are progressing as well with tentative agreements reached on about half the open sections. In an effort to expedite the bargaining process and secure an agreement in principle, the Company and the union jointly requested NMD mediation. We look forward to working collaboratively on an agreement that our pilots are proud to support while providing the Company with the ability to continue to fly a safe, reliable operation and remain positioned to grow profitably. It is our expectation to have an agreement in principle done by midyear. Touching on Sunseeker, we continue to make progress towards completion. Construction crews are back in full force. Much of the remediation work related to Hurricane Ian is now behind us. Further investigation necessitated an increase in total estimated damage related to Ian resulting in additional special charges of $5 million in losses. We continue to believe all Hurricane Ian damage will be fully recoverable by insurance. In addition, a significant thunderstorm followed Hurricane Ian in early November prior to Ian damage being fully remediated, resulting in additional damage as well as a small elevator fire in November. Losses related to these events were recorded in the amount of $10 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Both events are covered by insurance. Recorded losses were offset by $18 million insurance proceeds related predominantly to Ian damages. As insurance recoveries are received during the coming months, we will record these special charges offsetting the recorded losses. Also worth pointing out again, we have business interruption insurance, which we believe will cover the period May '26 and the pre-hurricane scheduled opening date to the opening date of the resort. Given the delays caused by Ian in the subsequent storm, we pushed the first accepted reservation date to October 15 of this year. We are still working through remediation time lines related to the recent storms, but intend to provide a firm opening date at our next earnings call in April. We have not provided any guidance in the release on Sunseeker operations due to uncertainty at this early stage on the opening date. In the Q1 2023 earnings call in April, we will provide guidance on preopening expenses leading up to opening the resort, revenue, EBITDA and operating income for the year 2023. We will also update final construction budget numbers and a business interruption update to the extent we have information. We also intend to extend to any of you who are interested, the opportunity to tour the resort in early May. Sherry Wilson will be happy to coordinate with you dates and times in April this year. In regards to our partnership with Viva Aeorbus, we still expect all the necessary approvals will be in place, including category one status in Mexico in the first half of this year. As you saw in the release, we are returning to providing annual guidance as we did in 2019. At the end of each quarter, we will update the annual guidance, if appropriate, given the results to date and future forecasts. As a reminder, we will be segment reporting as it relates to Sunseeker in 2023. In addition, we will be comparing to 2022 and not 2019. We have progressed beyond 2019 results and field moving to prior year or 2022 is a more comparable and relevant going forward. In closing, Allegiant has a strong history of shareholder returns, and I am pleased to report we bought back 377,529 shares during the fourth quarter at an average price of $78.94 a share, totaling $29.8 million. Furthermore, our Board approved increasing our repurchase authority to $100 million. This authorization reaffirms the Board's conviction in both future results and balance sheet strength. With that, I will turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Anderson: John, thank you, and I echo your sentiment around wishing Scott the best of luck in his future endeavors. He and I have worked shoulder to shoulder for nearly 15 years here, which has been an amazing and fun ride. One of the best compliments I can provide, Scott, is the organization is in terrific hands. We have an incredibly strong team with an incredibly bright future. As announced, Keny Wilper will take on the interim COO role. Over the past 20 years, Keny has demonstrated his strength as an operator and as an exceptional leader. Additionally, Tracy Tulle will serve as our Chief Experience Officer. Tracy has vast operations experience overseeing both flight ops and in-flight as well as sharing our customer experience leadership team. In this new role, she will focus on improving the customer-centric experience for our team members while also helping to develop leaders internally and drive organizational alignment. Finally, and I have to admit it's pretty awesome to be able to say, Robert Neal is now our Chief Financial Officer; and Drew Wells is our Chief Revenue Officer. BJ and Drew are both A plus leaders, the best of what they do, and I feel no further introduction is needed, given they are already well known to our investors. I look forward to working even closer with and supporting each of them in their expanded roles. While I have mentioned only a few names, the depth and breadth throughout this organization is the best and strongest it has ever been. As we look forward to the amazing opportunities in front of us, I can speak for the team when I say we are fired up in establishing Allegiant as the most exciting story in the space. While 2022 brought its unique -- its own unique challenges, we achieved a lot during the past year. We added more than 900 team members, bringing our total team member count to more than 5,630. These team members enabled us to grow our fleet by 13 aircraft and fly 14% more ASMs as compared to 2019. The first half of 2022 experienced unique challenges with the Omicron spikes. This resulted in labor constraints and unplanned absences during peak leisure travel periods, which led to elevated cancellations. The operating environment had a significant financial impact. This operating environment had a significant financial impact of over $100 million in IROP costs, including fuel and crew costs, lost revenue and going above and beyond by providing cash compensation to those customers impacted by canceled flights. To combat these challenges, our planning and operational teams worked closely together in refining the schedule to adjust for this environment. While this came at a cost to aircraft productivity, our operations strengthened quickly as the second half of '22 saw a meaningful improvement controllable completion was 99.5%, more than 2 points better than the first half of '22 and near our industry-leading controllable completion results of 2019. I am pleased to report these much improved operational results had a positive impact on our financial results. The impact from our irregular operations in the back half of the year had a total financial impact of $30 million. This is $70 million less than the first six months of '22. These improvements showed up in our financial report as we closed out the December quarter with a 16% adjusted op margin and this is substantially higher than our initial adjusted operating margin guide of 8%. These impressive results were achieved despite the impact to the quarter from the winter storm over the holidays. Another important element of 2022 is a significant progress we made towards our systems transformation. In 2021, we made the decision to move from certain core proprietary software systems to best-in-class systems such as SAP, Navitaire, Trax and NAVBLUE. We remain on track to go live with the first three of these key systems in 2023. NAVBLUE should follow shortly after. Such systems have been key investments to more efficiently scale the organization. In addition, we continue to track ahead of schedule on the incorporation of our new Boeing MAX aircraft as we expect our first delivery near the end of the year. We intend to place these MAX deliveries at these early MAX deliveries at our Orlando Sanford base. And as John touched on, one of our highest priorities remains finalizing labor contracts that our crew members deserve. So far, we have put a great amount of effort into updating our agreements with both our flight attendant and pilot unions. It is our goal to get both of these deals across the finish line as soon as possible. While we are unsure around the exact timing of getting these deals done, we have incorporated the potential cost in the back half of the year within our 2023 guidance. Please realize that the actual increases in cost will depend on the economic terms reached and the timing of the agreements. As a reminder, although these contracts will be cost headwinds, we expect them to increase momentum towards restoring staffing levels and optimizing aircraft utilization, but we are not assuming any improved productivity in our full year '23 capacity guide, BJ will provide more full year guidance detail momentarily. We will continue our focus on strengthening the operation and are excited about what's in front of us in '23. As we've highlighted on prior calls, we have laid the foundation for executing on these items and our teams across the organization are making steady progress on the implementations of the new systems and other initiatives such as labor contracts, Sunseeker, Viva and Boeing. These leadership changes announced will further support these initiatives. As we progress further into '23 and have better vision on the completion time frames, we expect to host an Investor Day to more specifically outline expected contributions from these strategic initiatives. More information will follow on that front. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott DeAngelo, our Chief Marketing Officer.\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, Greg. Fourth quarter saw continued strong leisure travel demand for Allegiant across both web and app traffic to allegiant.com as well as passenger segments bulk, capping off a record-setting year for Allegiant on both measures. Surging awareness and preference for the Allegiant brand, along with our direct-to-consumer distribution approach, continues to give us an advantage in capturing demand by being able to satisfy the two most important buying factors for leisure travelers, low fares and non-stop flights. For full year 2022, 136 million web users came to allegiant.com, up 24% from 2019. And notably, despite the fact that no new route -- that new route grows limited, excuse me, new web users to allegiant.com were up by nearly 40% from 2019. Why? Because as I referenced the past two quarters, our addressable customer audience continues to grow as more new customers enter the ULCC category and consider Allegiant for their leisure travel needs. Their seeking relief from sky high fares and looking to avoid the risk inconvenience and time associated with connecting flights through crowded airport hubs. What's more, 77% of our allegiant.com users came via our most direct and lowest-cost channels. That's direct URL, our app, e-mail marketing or organic search. That's up 37% from 2019. It means we're relying less and less on paid advertising as awareness of and preference for the Allegiant brand continues to grow in a scalable fashion based on our fixed investments like Allegiant Stadium and our Live Nation partnership as well as our Always Rewards loyalty programs, both co-brand credit card and non-card. We continue to outperform expectations with our co-brand card program, ending the year with more than 400,000 active cardholders and more than 150,000 new cardholders acquired in 2022. That's more than 40% higher than we had acquired the previous highest year, which is 2021. As a result, the co-brand card program drove total compensation of more than $100 million in 2022. In addition, our non-card loyalty program, Always Rewards, added 2 million new members last year and now totals 15 million members. In 2022, 3.2 million customers, nearly 70% of our total unique transacting customers were active members of the Always Rewards program. And on average, they exhibited 39% greater booking frequency than non-members and an average spend per booking that was 36 higher -- 36% higher than non-members. This left in average spend was driven by higher take rates in air ancillary products as well as higher attachment of third-party products like hotel and rental car. This customer behavior reinforces the continued opportunity that Allegiant has to sell beyond the aircraft in order to achieve greater revenue per passenger growth that can outpace and is not constrained solely by capacity growth. In terms of our customer makeup, Alecensa elite subset of Always Rewards members and cardholders, just over 0.5 million customers, which is about 15% of our total unique transacting customers for the year, fly three or more times with us and drive roughly 60% of both total passenger segments booked and total revenue for the year. In the past week, we surveyed a representative sample with more than 3,000 respondents from this group of frequent flyers to understand why they traveled with us and what their future and travel intention was. And the news keeps getting better for Allegiant. Of these Allegiant frequent flyers, nearly 80% travel for leisure only and nearly 20% traveled for bleisure, both business and leisure. More than 40% said they stayed with family or friends and nearly 40% said they stayed at their second or vacation home. That means around 80% fall into types of travel that are the most resilient during negative economic climates. To validate this, we ask these customers the extent to which they expected their travel plans with Allegiant to be impacted given the prospect of worsening economic conditions. And here's what they told us. Basically, have said that economic considerations would have no impact on their flying behavior with Allegiant in the next 12 months and nearly one quarter said that they would be more likely to fly with Allegiant in the next 12 months. It's common for many to think that ULCCs have an infrequent and transitory customer base. But that's not the case for Allegiant. We have a core base of loyal frequent flyers who drive a majority of our revenue, while at the same time, we continue to add new customers that are defecting from other airlines, namely Southwest and legacy carriers to our customer base and record numbers. And in looking forward at forward-looking searches for travel at allegiant.com searches for our all-important travel season during spring break and summer are up by 40% to 75% versus last year, which, as we all know, was a historic high year for bookings and revenue. Put simply and in conclusion, Allegiant has a trifecta when it comes to our balanced customer base. We have a solid core of frequent flyers who show no signs of retracting their travel behavior with us in the upcoming year regardless of the economic climate. And at the same time, we are also showing lift across all existing repeat customers that are members of our loyalty programs. And we're seeing a continued surge in new customers that are coming to Allegiant in record numbers from other airlines because they're seeking low fares and non-stop flights along with our strong and growing assortment of asset-light, high-margin third-party leisure products that we make available at allegiant.com. Put another way, all of these customer segments are seeking to live what we at Allegiant refer to as the non-stop life. And with that, I'll turn it over to Drew Wells, our Chief Revenue Officer.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. I'm extremely pleased to close out the year with a record $2.3 billion in total revenue, easily the best number in company history and 25% higher than the previous best in 2019. When accounting for seasonality, nearly all metrics improved sequentially through the year to produce the record results. And while we remain flexible through a lot of the year to find the right capacity levels, the teams continue to optimize incredibly well within shifting constraints to produce great results. The fourth quarter had the most stability throughout the year, and our results reflect that. Fourth quarter revenue came in nicely above the range at $612 million and 32.6% above the fourth quarter of 2019, despite ASMs ending approximately 2.5 points lower at the system level and 3 points lower for scheduled service. We did take a benefit of approximately $9.6 million associated with updated guidance on breakage factors for the co-branded credit card and the initial guidance for the Always Rewards program. Even excluding that benefit, the divergence between revenue and ASMs produced an all-time best TRASM just under $0.14 and nearly 20% higher than 4Q 2019. The yield performance in the quarter was the major upside catalyst, particularly in December. The roughly 75% sequential improvement exceeded our expectations and drove almost 6.5 points of upside to the quarter. Total ancillary per passenger exceeded $70 for the first time at the quarter level and total revenue per passenger of 151 was also an all-time high. On the weather disruption front, Winter Storm Elliott saw a revenue loss of $8 million and nearly 2 points of lost capacity. The close-in demand, some of which was rebooking of impacted customers and some incremental was exceptional around the holidays to round out the year. Further, while the rest of Florida bounced back quickly from Hurricane Ian, Monte Gordo did see continued softness through the quarter and was a headwind of just under the expected 3 points. The impact should temper a bit into the first quarter but we still expect a roughly 1.5 point headwind to total revenue as the region continues to recover. In November, we opened our 24th aircraft, crew and maintenance base in Provo, Utah. Since our entry to the market in 2013, we've been the low-cost option for Provo and the surrounding areas. We began serving our 13th route Nashville on February 15, which is coincidentally our 10-year anniversary in the city. As we turn toward the New Year, we have a somewhat different than usual story. Our midpoint year-over-year ASM growth rate of 4% would be lower than any full year other than 2011. First and foremost, continuing the successes of the second half of 2022 and ensuring a stable and solid operation is paramount to 2023. Second, our EPS guide includes a continued elevated fuel cost per gallon, which will temper the amount of off-peak growth as we continue to balance fuel and demand in non-peak periods. First quarter growth will be close to 1% year-over-year. The second and third quarter should be a bit higher than the first before a high single fourth quarter growth rate. Perhaps worth reminding that the first quarter is still slated to be 20% larger than the first quarter of 2019. The Omicron real comparison of 1Q '22, coupled with a continued robust demand environment and low growth rate should provide some runway for great unit revenue metrics. I'm expecting year-over-year TRASM growth in the mid-20% for the first quarter, and I'm extremely encouraged by the peak spring break outlook. Load factors are higher and the discrepancy between the search volumes Scott and Angela mentioned and available inventory bodes well for yield results. Through the rest of the year, we are not contemplating material changes broadly to the economy. While we read and hear the same headlines, we have not seen any booking impact from our leisure customer base and have forecasted as such. Additionally, the network will be the most mature of any time in Allegiant's history in terms of markets in their first 12 months. Approximately only 4% of the on-sale scheduled for the first half of '23 is in that maturing window. We should also see the rollout of our Navitaire commercial platform and the expansion of our Allegiant Extra program, both providing air ancillary tailwinds weighted more heavily to the second half of the year. Collectively, this leads to expect unit revenues in the positive mid-single-digit percent range over the last nine months as we hit more reasonable and challenging comps. There are significant catalysts for Allegiant's revenue capabilities through 2023 and beyond. We are setting an incredible foundation for us to continue to capitalize on what remains a truly remarkable leisure demand environment. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to BJ.\nRobert Neal: Thanks, Drew, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us today. This afternoon, we reported fourth quarter net income of $52.5 million. Adjusting to exclude the 2022 employee recognition bonus, special charges related to Sunseeker, earnings per share was $3.17 in the quarter, well above our initial guidance. Catalysts behind the strength of our fourth quarter results included, of course, the sustained strong demand environment, operational improvements, which brought decreased irregular ops costs, a favorable -- more favorable fuel cost than we had anticipated and a better-than-expected non-fuel cost performance. Fourth quarter unit costs, excluding fuel, employee recognition bonus and the Sunseeker special charge was 7.56 cents, up 12.2% as compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 on 10.9% more ASM capacity. The cost increase as compared to fourth quarter '19 was primarily comprised of 5.5 points for reduced aircraft utilization, 3.8 points in labor productivity and 1.5 points related to Winter Storm Elliott. As you've seen in our release, we will temper capacity growth in '23 to ensure that operational integrity is prioritized. Even with this reduced capacity, we are forecasting full year airline only earnings per share of approximately $7. On an assumed average fuel cost of $3.60 per gallon and increased labor cost assumptions related to pilot and flight attendant contracts, which for our guidance purposes, would begin midyear. With respect to Sunseeker, we expect to record our normal quarterly operating expense run rate of roughly $5 million to $7 million in each of the first two quarters of the year. We are not prepared today to provide -- to guide full year preopening expenses or operating income associated with the property until we have a firm opening date on our next earnings call. Turning to CapEx. We expect total CapEx for the airline in 2023 to be roughly $700 million, comprised of roughly $560 million related to aircraft, engines, PDPs and induction costs and the remaining $140 million coming from other airline CapEx. In addition, we expect deferred heavy maintenance costs similar to levels observed in 2022 or roughly $55 million. We expect to receive 2737 MAX 8200 aircraft during late 4Q '23. While it's certainly possible for these aircraft to be in service by year-end, we are not -- we are planning conservatively for operational requirements of onboarding a new fleet type at the end of the year and have chosen not to plant ASM capacity for these aircraft until the early weeks of 2024. We remain in discussions with Boeing to finalize our 2024 delivery schedule, but we can share that directionally, we're planning to take roughly two aircraft per month throughout next year based on what we know today. For 2023, we plan to induct 7 A320 aircraft into the operating fleet throughout the year, two of which have already entered revenue service in January and three of which were owned a non-property at the end of 2022. We expect the bulk of our CapEx spend during 2023 to be debt financed and have been pleased with the level of financing support and attractive terms proposed to us thus far. Although 2023 will be a heavy CapEx year for Allegiant, we plan to maintain total available liquidity of roughly 2x our ATL balance and expect to end the year with roughly $1 billion in cash and investments. In closing, I'd like to add my thanks to our more than 5,600 team members for their incredible efforts during 2022. After a very challenging first half of the year, the team came together in the back half to deliver results, which reduced the financial impact of the regular operations by over 70% as compared to the first two quarters. We're extremely proud of how the team turned the story around, particularly in the fourth quarter and excited about the momentum we have stepping into 2023. With that, thank you, Justin. We can begin taking analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nCatherine O'Brien: I just wanted -- so I just wanted to think about some of the puts and costs -- putting things across this year. Trying to think about what the impact adding the flight attendant and pilot contract for half a year and then slowing capacity growth will mean I think the last time we talked about cost was kind of flattish on high single-digit growth ex-labor contracts. So just trying to think about the walk from there, underlying your current EPS guidance?\nGreg Anderson: Hey, Catie, it's great to hear you. This is Greg. Why don't I kick it off here? So just on your point on the -- as BJ mentioned, beginning in the back half of the year, so July 1, we've incorporated labor deals, both CBA deals for our pilots and flight attendants. And for a half year basis, what I would expect this to be about 1/3 of CASM hit for a half year again basis. In terms of some of the other puts and takes, IROP, I think that would be a tailwind. So call it about two to 3 points year-over-year on the IROP side, we'll see there a slight headwind in inflation, the D&A, I think there's going to be a slight headwind there from about a point or two based on lower productivity. I mean you called out the ASMs being lower than what maybe we are anticipating at that 10%. I think that's worth roughly 4 points to year-over-year. But the other thing that's probably just worth mentioning is the bonus this year -- I'm sorry, last year '22. We carved out that recognition bonus, but this year, that -- in '23 that will be included in so that too will be a headwind. But really, if you kind of compare those two year-over-year, I think they kind of wash each other out. But I'll pause there. Obviously, we're not giving formal guidance, if anyone else wants to add anything or if that help to answer some of your questions there, Catie?\nCatherine O'Brien: Yes, that was great unless anything else to add. I do have a follow-up. So this might be front running some of the initiatives you're going to talk about at Investor Day. But now you set a new record ancillary per passenger over $70, should we think about growth from here being a little bit more tempered going forward? Like you hit a lot of little fruit or some of the new levers that get along with Navitaire? You think there's upside to that? Just kind of like, I don't know, blue sky like next couple of years type number, if you have it.\nGreg Anderson: Yes. Thanks, Catie. Glad to have you back. Yes, I do think that there are more step-ups to come. We have not yet rolled out Navitaire that will come likely in the second quarter. And I would expect a little bit of a tapering as that kind of builds into what it could become. Additionally, we talked about Allegiant Extra. There are only seven tails in that LOPA at the end of '22, we'll be up to 14 by the end of '23. A lot of these things would be back half loaded, but really -- fully pronounced at 24 stories. We will certainly get into those more at an Investor Day in terms of valuation and whatnot. Scott, I don't know if you would like to add any more?\nScott DeAngelo: Yes. No. And I would say that even -- still to just say, as we think about our bundled ancillary, which has been a big driver of people being able to not just buy a la carte, but have that fuller ancillary. We are still at levels of penetration that we think have plenty of room for upside. And last but not least, as we just continue to leverage the technology foundation that Greg mentioned would be going in to create just a better user interface and user experience. We think there's small but material gains along the way as we make it easier to merchandise and easier for our customers to add these things to their card.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel McKenzie from Seaport Global. Your line is now open.\nDaniel McKenzie: Congrats to Drew and BJ. I've got a few questions here. I guess, first, just RASM up mid-single digits, second quarter through fourth quarter. Obviously, that's pretty strong. I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on that a bit. How big is the benefit that you just spoke to Navitaire and the, I guess, the Extra comfort, is there more from Navitaire that can help drive that? And then, I guess, secondly, related to that, if there is a mild recession, to what extent would that potentially change the forecast?\nDrew Wells: Yes. Thanks, Dan. Maybe I have a slightly different perspective. I didn't view mid-single-digit positive and overly aggressive given kind of the growth cadence we have in place. It's been a long time since we had a series of quarters in the low to mid-single digits. And historically, we've had some really strong revenues along with that. If you remember back to last summer, we did have to pull out a material amount of our capacity. We actually did in April and took out 15% to 20% of our summer ASM, which did contribute some thrash as we think about final results, and I think that will be able to buoy this year a little bit more. Navitaire coming online will certainly support. Like I mentioned, we'll get into a bit more in terms of valuation, whatnot through Investor Day, but that will provide a little bit of upside there. So all in all, I do think it's a reasonable revenue target and not something particularly aggressive.\nGreg Anderson: Hey, Drew, and this is Greg. I might add, Dan. Just some other puts the items to think about last year, we talked about IROP already in our opening remarks, then $100 million full year, right? But a big chunk of that is lost revenue. So that's going to be a helpful comp year-over-year on these unit revenue numbers. The growth, although it's limited that Drew is looking at, it's measured, it's de-risked. It's in markets that already exist today. So we're not going out and trying to add new markets. There's already a maturation there. And then the other thing, maybe just to your point about potential recession is our utilization per aircraft going into this year is low, 6.2 hours, right? In 2019, by way of comparison, it was eight hours. And so we already have the lower utilization and our model is built to flex in those peak periods to capture that demand. So I think we're just very well positioned in the event we do see a slowdown.\nDrew Wells: Yes. I think as we look at the next couple of quarters, the only 20% to 25% of our capacity likely be on off-peak day a week kind of going up what Greg was mentioning. So we're very well aligned with where the leisure customer wants to travel already, well positioned for that. And we know that the leisure customer is incredibly resilient. We'll see what that means for far kind of broadly across the industry in the event that, that happens. But -- so the leisure customer is still able to be stimulated to travel just finding that right price point to get there.\nJohn Redmond: And on the inflation front, I mean, we have great visibility on the first half of the year, for sure, the first quarter. So, to the extent there is any modest inflationary pressures, we just don't feel or see it, but it's going to be back ended in the year to the extent there is anything.\nDaniel McKenzie: Wow, that's a great perspective. I can get a second question in here. I guess, BJ, I'm already getting inbound on negative free cash flow this year. It's a solid outlook to be sure, but I'm just wondering if you can speak to that. And if the plan is to use cash on the balance sheet, potentially equity or additional debt if we could potentially just take that worry off the table?\nRobert Neal: Yes. Thanks, Dan. Most of the CapEx this year is debt financed. Greg, I don't know if you want to talk to specific numbers here. We can -- if you think about where the CapEx is and just use sort of like rough historical LTVs, we can bring in north of $450 million in new debt that's at our discretion as we navigate throughout the year. But then there's between $150 and $200 million in principal payments. The thing I'd mention is we have a line of sight to really fantastic terms on attractive financing where all of the CapEx coming in. As you know, Sunseeker is already financed at an interest rate that's in the money now, something that we're really pleased with. And then on the aircraft, the appraisal values are up, I think, $3 million, $3.5 million since we placed our order at the end of 2021, which just gives us a great ability to go out and raise financing and draw a lot of interest for supporting the airlines.\nGreg Anderson: This is Greg. I was just going to add two things, just to BJ's point, maybe just to crystallize here. That's while we are going to add leverage, if you just take the midpoint of our guide for '23 that gives you about $500 million in EBITDA. If you take the net leverage, so I think BJ said, we'll end the year with $1 billion in cash and you kind of take the waterfall of debt that gets you $2.5 billion in debt; net debt, $1.5 billion. So three turns net leverage still comfortable. But these are -- this is a time when we're investing back in the Company. We're investing in assets that are yet to be revenue producing. We're doing it with a strong credit. And so -- but when we get on the other side of this '24 and beyond, you're going to see that that de-lever pretty quickly as our expectation.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen Securities. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker: Two questions. One is, as you think about your ASM growth being so low single digits this year, how are you thinking about where to prioritize the growth? Or you -- in other words, is it new markets? Is it increased service in existing markets? How should we think about that?\nDrew Wells: Sure. Thanks, Helane. It's not a lot of new markets. For the first half of the year, only about 4% of our ASMs will come from markets in their first 12 months. And within that, it's been -- we have a few new markets starting here in the first quarter, and that's about it. It's pretty minimal. I focus more on the restoration of a little bit of that frequency that's where we can get it. But when we're talking 1% in the first quarter and a small step up, there's not a ton beyond that.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's helpful, actually. And then my follow-up question is -- as you're thinking about the resort, Sunseeker, Punta Gorda, the region and so on, climate has been an increasing issue for a lot of companies. And obviously, it was a big issue last year for you guys. How are you thinking about hurricane seasons going forward in the hurricane season this year? Maybe it's how do you protect the resort from hits like this in the future?\nJohn Redmond: Helane, this is John. I'm stating the obvious when I say hurricanes have been around in Florida forever. And the state has reacted to those over time by changing building codes by doing a lot of things with technology that allowed buildings to be built differently in operations to be run differently. So when you take the resort, we thought about that when we were designing it, frankly. A lot of you probably didn't understand when we were first chatting about it, but we built the resort 16 feet above the mean height pipeline. So we wouldn't have had any damage, but we're falling cranes. If you look at the worst hurricane, a lot of people referring to, that's happened to the state of Florida. So put another way, if the resort was done and if the type of storm surge that hit Port Myers hit where the resort is, it would have gone underneath the building and out the other end. So we wouldn't have had any damage. So we're the only resort in the entire state of Florida that don't like that to be able to withstand it and also we're built to Category five standards. So I think that's how we reacted to what we've seen in the state of Florida, and I'm sure that's how others have reacted and whether they're building office buildings or anything else, they're building them differently. And I'm sure homeowners will build differently going forward as well after seeing what happened down in Fort Myers. So we like -- we obviously love what we did. We're positioned fantastic going forward to weather any kind of the storm in Florida. And I guess this was a test to that. Again, but for these hurricanes falling down in the building, we wouldn't have an issue. And it's also worth pointing out, the last major hurricane that hit Southwest Florida like that was Charley in '04. So it's not like these are annual events. They might be annual to a certain extent, somewhere in the state, but not always in the exact same region. So you went from '04 to '22 before it had the next major one. And that one, which was the worst, would not have hurt us at all that we were completed.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Congrats on all the promotions. But John, I guess, as you look at 2023, you have had some leadership changes. You're pulling back growth, as noted in the earlier remarks, since I think 2011, so how do you put this in context? Like what are the strategic priorities for the organization this year? Is it preparing for the MAX? Is it really giving some figure up? What do you want investors to take away from this year?\nJohn Redmond: I mean you're hitting on them, a couple of them right there. We get touched on it a little bit, but we've been starting in '21, we started it in '22, significantly invested in it, which was all of our, call it, our plumbing and electrical, all the package, if you will, we've been spending significant sums of money to make sure that we are at the leading edge of technology in all of our systems. So by the end we will be at that leading edge with everything and all of them turned on in operating. So all the system investments, Greg touched on SAP tracks, Navitaire, NAVBLUE that's a heavy lift. You look at in '22, for instance, we spent in the neighborhood of about $50 million alone on all the technology upgrades, if you will. So that's a big initiative, which allows us to do everything from Viva, that relationship to obviously operate and yield what we're doing in a much better format. The Viva relationship is very strategic for us. We had to fix some of the technology in order to accommodate that. We reached to do that, and we're in great shape to do that. Now we're just waiting on all the regulatory approvals. Boeing in the MAX mean that's well understood. We know it's back-end driven, Q4 really driven. But there's a lot of work that has to be done leading up to the receipt of any plane. So that's all being done. So we're -- we like where we're at. I mean the resort is an obvious one. We've been working on that for some time. We've actually had delays that have and longer than what it has taken to build it. Obviously, I had nothing to do with anything we did, but we are scheduled to open that in '21. But all of these are major initiatives that are driving major CapEx in the last 1.5 years to 2 years that we're not going to see any revenue benefit from until the back end of this year. And BJ and Greg touched on that. But we are in great shape with all these initiatives. The team has done a great job. We have a lot of people focused on it. They're working burning the midnight oil, as I say. But we like where we stand. We're not falling behind on anything, and we're well positioned to be able to absorb all of this significant growth that the Company has taken on with all these new opportunities.\nGreg Anderson: And John, if I might add, and you hit on this in your opening remarks, and Brandon, maybe it's already stating the obvious, but the airline is at the heart of everything we do, operational integrity, as I hope you heard in the opening remarks, number one, too, that's top priority. And as John mentioned, getting a deal for our crew members, our flight attendants and pilots is at the highest priority our Executive Chairman, Maury Gallagher, continues to spend time or has been time trying to make sure we continue to move and advance this ball and get a deal done with our crew members as soon as possible. So I know that probably went without saying, but -- and all of that, that too is a very high priority for us as we think about '23.\nJohn Redmond: It's very worth -- very much worth reiterating, that's for sure.\nBrandon Oglenski: John and Greg, I appreciate that. And I guess specific to the growth this year because you had been planning for more. And I think, Drew, you spoke to this a little bit, but is this really demand-related cost related or operational integrity, what are the constraints right now? Is it really pilot availability that's constraining your ability to grow? Or is this commercial as well?\nDrew Wells: The demand environment is still extraordinarily robust. So that is not a concern. We're generally scheduling up to our first operational constraints in many months. That's going to be our pilot headcount in others, it might be the number of available tails we have given our heavy maintenance lines and how we try to structure that with some peaks and valleys. So that's primarily the driver. As we get into the back half of the year, in preparation for the first MAX deliveries, we will have to start pulling some crew members off the line to begin training in order to be ready to fly those as early as possible. So we'll run into a little bit more of that being kind of the constraints as we get later into the year.\nGreg Anderson: And Drew, sorry, I might add, and the team is going to tease me here, Brandon, because I use this term that we're screen coiled and ready to go. And as you alluded to in your comment is that we plan for a larger organization. And so there's some pacing items, crude constraints being one. But when those loosen up, if you will, I mean, you were spring coiled and ready to go. The infrastructure is going to be able to support that, and that's how we're viewing it long term. So we're excited about that and we're working towards that. But you may see next year or in '25, maybe higher growth than normal like if you were to compare it to aircraft count because you'll take the idea as you have the potential to take utilization of -- so we're flying 6.2, 6.3 hours per day per aircraft per day in '23. If you take that up an hour, that's going to obviously improve capacity as well. So I just want to make sure we mentioned that also.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore Partners. Your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I don't know if the one question was just meant for me, but I'll respect it. On the 4Q revenue outcome, you touched on the breakage, I guess if you could go into a little bit more detail on what were the drivers of the upside and on base fares in particular. Any particular markets and I think the pattern we've seen in the last couple of quarters is that there was kind of an inability or constraints to flex up in these peak demand periods, and that was kind of holding you back. Is there something that has changed or something you're doing differently that is helping you kind of flex back up in the peaks again unlike the last two or three quarters?\nDrew Wells: Duane, I don't know that that's necessarily true. I mean some of our best performance before the holidays was in the summer and what we were able to do on a yield basis, it certainly wasn't to this extent. I think there's a little bit of a difference in -- there always has been in terms of the holidays and spring break versus summer, where we have this very tight window in which travel occurs, right? I think giving is very heavily concentrated around the holiday, same with Christmas and New Year versus a much kind of longer and drawn out summer that's good, but it's kind of the spread drawn out good. So we were really able to capitalize well on that very concentrated window of demand, probably in a way that you're -- at least I thought we were not able to be at the same level in summer. The opting stuff still looks good. October was healthy as well. So there's not necessarily any individual piece to call out. It all looked good with maybe some slight outperformance in the holidays, like I mentioned, tight windows.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I guess -- sorry, I'm going to contradict myself. On the guidance, is that just airline EPS? Or is that consolidated EPS guidance?\nJohn Redmond: Yes, Airline EPS.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMichael Linenberg: Congrats to the team on the promotions. Just one here. I guess Scott DeAngelo, you called out, you talked about the loyalty of your customer base and you provided some qualifiers around it. I thought it was interesting that you called out Southwest and other airlines of where you were getting passengers or picking up new customers. Is the Southwest mention? Is it because of the overlap that you have with them? Or more recently, are you actually seeing meaningful traction in the markets where you may compete head-to-head or just in their backyard?\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, Michael, for the question. It is more of the former. We've tended to overlap with them the most. So when you ask our customers, who did you last or most recently fly with about 1/3 of the time that answer is going to be Southwest West. And then the other carriers, even though it's convenient, I know for the market to classify us alongside other ULCCs, the reality is we don't have much overlap there. And so the next three airlines that are answered when asked who did you last or most recently fly with are always Delta, American and United in that order with, obviously, many of our customers actually flying the regional arms, but identifying with right, the overall brand of those airlines. And so -- it was meant simply to show that in this environment, even if there was some type of recession, I would just ask the market to -- in as much as there was any contraction at any point in leisure travel, also look at the slice of pie that is ULCC because our data would indicate that even if the overall pie were to shrink, our slice of that pie would continue to grow as customers of -- whether it's Southwest or other network carriers are increasingly buying down and/or coming into the ULCC category, given our brand of non-stop travel. So hopefully, that's helpful in providing some color there.\nMichael Linenberg: Well, Scott, on the survey, when they give you the airline, what is the number one reason? Is it because of fares? Or is it because they had a lousy experience? I'm just curious.\nScott DeAngelo: Oh, yes. No, great, it's usually non-stop flight and fares. And those can go one to two, but those are far and away the top two. Schedule is the third one, but it's usually way down and then preferred airport everything else ties for fourth and beyond. But we don't -- we haven't seen that there's just a swell given just one bad experience, but we undoubtedly know that right overall disruptions, especially when it involves connecting flights we'll draw someone now to look for non-stop flights. And as you all know, all of our flights are non-stop. So that's really the key driver, I think, in times of disruption, whether it's weather, whether it's just irregular operations over the summer, over the winter, it happens to every airline. But if there's one thing we know, it's one thing to potentially get canceled delay in your origin or your destination, there is nothing worse than getting stuck in the middle. And that's what we're seeing a lot of customers react to and be drawn in by an airline that only flies non-stop.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Didora from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Didora: Just a question on the CapEx, right? I think last call you said a floor of like $500 million on CapEx. I guess at the time I never thought it could be north of the $700 million you just guided to. I guess, one, what are the big buckets of CapEx kind of that are coming in this year ahead of plan, particularly on the non-aircraft side? And then when you think about the CapEx, and I know you can finance a lot of this. How do you think about minimum liquidity going forward? Because I would think with the MAX is pushed out to 2024 deliveries, CapEx will be pretty high next year as well.\nGreg Anderson: Andrew, it's Greg. I'm going to kick it off real quick and BJ will walk through a little bit more detail just because I think I'm the one that threw out that floor of $500 million of CapEx next year. And really, it was -- we just -- there was a lot of uncertainty around the timing of the Boeing aircraft being delivered in '24 and PDPs. And so -- we wanted to throw that out of the floor that will be no less than. And so we've had more time to work through that and understand the timing, which is now why we're updating you with those numbers. But with that, BJ?\nRobert Neal: Yes. Andrew, just on that same point, I mean, if you think about a large portion of the aircraft are paid for in the calendar year prior to delivery, so with so many aircraft moving into 2024, you've got a lot of CapEx going out for PD this year. I think that's actually our largest CapEx commitment this year is pre-delivery deposits. And then you have the two aircraft delivering from Boeing in the fourth quarter of this year. And then remember, we also slid for placeholder aircraft from 2022 into 2023. So a lot of this CapEx was sliding from '22 to '23 and then paying PDPs for '24 and '23.\nGreg Anderson: And then liquidity, I think BJ mentioned it in his opening comments, 2x, roughly 2x ATL, which gets you right now, ATLs run at about $400 million. I think total liquidity would be around $1 billion is what we're targeting for the year at the end. Is that fair?\nDrew Wells: Yes. And then maybe just mention that our revolver facilities are undrawn today, which are $225 million and then the better part of our $200 million PDP financing facility is undrawn as well. So, using those as necessary throughout the year.\nAndrew Didora: Understood. And just what are the big buckets of the non-aircraft CapEx?\nGreg Anderson: It's -- I think it's about $135 million in total non-aircraft million, $60 million $70 million, that's going to be that IT investment that we were talking about. You have some sims and simulators that we're going to be acquiring to take card delivery to the Boeing aircraft or fleet. And then the remaining would be just your normal kind of standard CapEx, maintenance CapEx, such as parts, tools, things like that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSavi Syth: Just on the kind of the pilot and flight and an also on the pilot side. What have you seen in terms of attrition levels are kind of being able to staff that well? I'm just kind of curious with if you're only getting a deal by midyear that means as you head into the summer. You will be kind of having a headwind versus a lot of other airlines that have increased pay deals. So just curious on what you're expecting there and what you're seeing there?\nGreg Anderson: Savi, it's Greg. Why don't I give this one a stab, and what I would just say and the big takeaway is that I think as we plan the schedule for '23, we've taken a very conservative approach in terms of attrition and onboarding and making sure that we have the available resources and crews to support those peak flying season, such as March in the summer. Just to put some more color around that, for the full year '23, we're expecting about a 25% system attrition on the pilot side. To put perspective in that in '22, it was 17%. The last three months, however, it's been roughly 20%. But again, the point being we're expecting higher or we're planning and scheduling for it to be higher than what we've seen historically or at least in the past three months and past year. In terms of the school house and our ability to attract and bring on pilots, I think just to give some perspective there, we're -- every class, we're anticipating around 12 new hires or pilots. We had two classes in January. There's 30 pilots in that class. All in all just to kind of -- to bring this together, I think we're expecting roughly 200 to 250 new pilots join Allegiant during 2023. Really excited about what Tyler Hollingsworth and [Rod Hardisty], Rod, our Chief Pilot, Tyler, our VP of Flight Ops. They're also out there on the recruiting front and putting in additional pathway programs. So I think there's five creative pathway programs today. They're taking that to eight. And so we're really doing -- taking the appropriate steps, I think, to kind of protect and control our destiny. And -- but we're planning for kind of the -- we're planning for a down case scenario. And so far, we feel good about that plan.\nOperator: I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Redmond for closing remarks.\nJohn Redmond: Well, we appreciate everyone's time and questions, all great questions. You can see why we're excited about '23 in the out years. Great uses the term spring coiled as he mentioned for '24, we wouldn't be in a position but to the investments in '21 and '22. So we're jazzing. And of course, those investments as we touched on our -- not only all the IT infrastructure, et cetera, that we're doing. But all the employee investments, everything from pilots, flight attendants, everything else we're doing. So it's a heavy CapEx lift, but it's needed and required in order to take on the growth that we're doing going forward. So stay tuned, '23 is going to be amazing, but '24 will be really something else. Thank you everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

With that, I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn Redmond: Thank you very much, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. The quarter saw our airline operations getting back to more acceptable performance levels more in line with where we were in 2019 before the pandemic. The respective teams have done a lot of hard work getting to these levels, and the effort and results have continued into Q4. The revenue picture was also solid, with total average fare just shy of $126 and up 15.5% over Q3 of '19. Q4 should exceed Q4 '19 by a similar percentage, assuming no severe weather issues in the balance of the quarter. In this rising fare environment, we are uniquely positioned to not only capture customers trading down, but to continue to grow total average fare given the significant domestic average base fare gap between us and other carriers. With the exception of the other ULCCs, all other carriers' average base share is somewhere between 2 and almost four times higher than us. After adjusting for one-off items such as the Sunseeker Resorts special charge of $35 million, the employee recognition bonus of $9.3 million and the $5 million loss on extinguishment of debt, the quarter was strong and encouraging going into Q4 and '23 as well. Turning to our balance sheet. One important point to make regarding our outstanding debt given the interest rate outlook is the fact that we are 83% fixed and only 17% floating. Our floating rate debt is all secured by aircraft and primarily shorter duration or less than 5 year maturities. All this debt is very flexible, prepayable and refinanceable. Equally important, our current maturities are only 8% of our outstanding debt. In regards to Hurricane Ian, which struck on 928, we are currently operational at all Florida airports. Punta Gorda is the only airport shutdown post Ian, but flying resumed October 6. Our teams did a fantastic job relocating aircraft pre and post Ian, allowing us to become operational faster than expected. Even better, our traffic volumes returned to normal within 14 days of reopening. Southwest Florida is incredible, and the resilience never ceases to amaze and is further validation of the Sunseeker story. Sunseeker Resorts Charlotte Harbor survived Hurricane Ian, which some have referred to as the worst storm to hit the state, without any damage, except from falling cranes or unfinished parts of the building, which allowed water intrusion. We believe all storm damage to the resort is fully insured, including business interruption. The initial estimate of damage determined by the insurance carriers was $35 million, but this amount is subject to change after further assessment and understanding of impacted supply chains. We have estimated the opening of the resort to be delayed roughly 90 days. As a result, we've pushed the beginning reservation acceptance date or opening date from May 26 of '23 to September 1 of '23. Given all the IT system upgrades happening throughout the company and touching everything we do, we knew 2022 and '23 would be foundational years for our company and transformational at the same time. The effort put in by our team members has been nothing short of exceptional. This complete change out would take decades for some to achieve and never contemplated by others, but our team members will accomplish the impossible in 2 years. Certain upgrades will allow us to take full advantage of and more seamlessly integrate our Viva Aerobus partnership. While not a certainty, we believe all necessary approvals will be in place including Category 1 status in Mexico in the first half of '23. Our Viva Partners recently reported an outstanding Q3, extending their compelling growth story. Because of the upgrades, we will be able to take full advantage of the partnership and the opportunities it offers in conjunction with the necessary approvals. In the Q2 earnings call, I made reference to ongoing negotiations with our pilots. Maury [ph] is personally [ph] involved in those negotiations and progress that is being made on a weekly basis. It's an arduous process that, frankly, takes longer than it should. We will get a deal done that works for both parties that recognizes the value and contributions of our pilots and the importance of maintaining our business model. We expect significant progress towards that end over the next couple of months. Thank you to our incredible team members for their passion and stamina you have shown not only in the quarter but throughout the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott Sheldon.\nScott Sheldon: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I touch on third quarter results, I first want to say thank you from this management team and to all of our team members and partners throughout the network. Your efforts throughout the third quarter and particularly through the devastating hurricane that impacted Southwest Florida in late September were tremendous. Our ground maintenance and flight crew volunteers enabled a movement of nearly 25% of our fleet, countless passengers well in excess of 100 team and family members out of our Florida basis. My hat is off to you for an outstanding effort. A few quick comments on the operational environment before I touch on labor. We continue to see improvements in our operational performance on all fronts during the third quarter. It was a relatively clean quarter in that it wasn't solely dominated by labor and stability. As discussed on prior calls, our network is more complex and dispersed than it was in the third quarter of '19. Year over 3 year scheduled departures were up 8.4% and our crew base growth and aircraft growth of 21% and 31%, respectively. This month, we plan on opening our 24th crew based in Provo, Utah, up from 19 bases in 2019. The breadth of our operational footprint requires individual bases to operate as stand-alone franchises and to drive high completion factors and on-time performance, we needed to see some significant improvements in dispatch reliability and unplanned absence trends. We remain cautiously optimistic, but we are seeing nice traction on both fronts. We ended the quarter with nearly 99.5% controllable completion and A14 production of just over 70% through the end of October. Uncontrollable factors such as air traffic control staffing and flow control programs in Florida will continue to be on-time performance headwinds, but we hope to see substantial reductions in our ops costs as we're moving into 2023. Moving on to pilots. We're happy to report we entered into our first exclusive pilot pathway program with Spartan College of Aeronautics in Denver, Colorado. This exclusive program to be branded Altitude will be a closed loop partnership customized for prospective Legion pilots and is expected to produce upwards of 250 pilots annually as the program matures. Details in a formal joint announcement are still to come, but we are excited to secure a direct pipeline for our future growth needs. And the last thing I'd like to touch on is our efforts to ratify a new contract with our pilots. The ratified agreement is and continues to be our Number One. 1 focus and is critical to the long-term success of the airline. As JR mentioned, our team, headed up by the old man himself, Maury Gallagher, continues to meet in person with the IBT and good progress has been made over the last 3 months. The rate environment continues to be incredibly volatile. And since January, we passed 7 comprehensive proposals for IBT consideration. Our proposals touch on everything from rates, rate guarantees, retirement, scheduling, work rules and quality of life enhancements, all of which directionally reflect other domestic air carrier CBAs that have been ratified since the beginning of the year. A newly ratified contract, coupled with the rollout of our altitude-pathway program sets us up nicely for the introduction of our new Boeing fleet in the back half of the year and into 2024. Hope to have something to report in the not-too-distant future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott DeAngelo.\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, Scott. Q3 saw sustained strong leisure travel demand for Allegiant across both web traffic to allegiant.com and passenger segments booked. Just as we saw during the pandemic and as we're seeing again in the face of negative economic factors threatening to impact consumer discretionary spending, our direct-to-consumer distribution approach gives us an advantage by enabling us to stay close to our customers and engage with them in ongoing two way communication to ensure that the Allegiant brand is top of mind at addressing the two most important buying factors for leisure travelers, low fares and nonstop flights. During the current economic climate, we're seeing our brand proposition what we positioned as living the nonstop life to affordable, accessible leisure travel, resonate more than ever to attract new customers and retain existing ones. Year-to-date, total visitation to our website remains up by nearly 30% versus 2019 and new first-time visitors are up by nearly 50% versus 2019. In addition, the number of new customers booking their first Allegiant flight is up by nearly 25% versus 2019 levels. We also continue to see the strong positive impact to leisure travel from the unprecedented number of baby boomers who retired the past 2 years and now have the discretionary time to travel more. Year-to-date, the number of new Allegiant customers age 60 or older is up by more than 60% versus 2019 levels. As I referenced last quarter, our addressable customer audience continues to grow as more new customers consider Allegiant for their leisure travel needs. They're seeking relief from sky high fares, as well as avoiding the risk, inconvenience, and time associated with connecting flights through crowded airport hubs. This past week, in a survey of customers who flew with Allegiant this year, we asked them whether economic considerations, such as inflation, gas prices, and recession fears would make them more or less likely to consider flying with Allegiant again in the next 12 months. Among those customers who have traditionally thrown most often with Southwest, Delta, American or United, more than 40% said they are more likely to consider flying with Allegiant in light of these economic concerns. In particular, for those customers who said they have traditionally flown most often with American or United, nearly 50% said they were more likely to consider flying with Allegiant this upcoming year. Also noteworthy coming out of this survey was getting a deeper understanding into the reasons for travel among Allegiant customers in 2022 to date. About 15% are flying for combined work and leisure representing the first time leasing and material segment of our customer base in this growing Bleisure category. Also, nearly 60% of leisure-only Allegiant customers are flying to visit family and friends. And as we've noted in the past, 15% to 20%, depending on the season, are flying to a second or vacation home. Each of these customer travel occasion types represent what we believe to be the most resilient forms of leisure travel during economic downturns. And to that point, looking forward, web searches for flights during virtually all upcoming weeks of travel through March of next year remain between 10% to 40% above last year's slight search levels at the same time. Beyond the growth of new customers to Allegiant, we're also retaining customers and growing customer value at our greatest levels ever, thanks to our award-winning loyalty program. USA TODAY Readers Choice awarded Best Airline credit card to the Always Allegiant World MasterCard for the fourth consecutive year and in its inaugural year, Always Rewards also claimed the top spot as best frequent flyer program in the nation. The Always Allegiant World MasterCard continues to post record setting months in terms of new card sign-ups, average spend on card and total compensation to Allegiant. Most notably, however, may be that above and beyond the program's third-party revenue and profit stream, our cardholder base of nearly 400,000 currently drives about 15% of our total air and air ancillary revenue and the level of spend by this group on air and air ancillary has grown by more than 350% since 2019. Similarly, our Always Rewards program has about 3 million active members who account for about two third of our total air and air ancillary revenue. And 1 year into its existence, we're already seeing these members spending 34% more on average per itinerary books and booking 28% more frequently on average compared to non-members. Having the vast majority of our revenue linked to customers in our loyalty program is not only positive in terms of retaining these customers in this revenue, but also helps to motivate these customers to attach air ancillary and third-party products, such as hotel and rental card at a greater rate. In closing, we believe Allegiant's unique brand of low fares and nonstop flights remains a compelling distinctive value proposition, especially in these uncertain economic times that is attracting new and returning customers alike in record numbers who are engaging with our popular loyalty programs and making Allegiant their airline of choice. And with that, I'll turn it over to Drew.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. Third quarter revenue was tracking nicely to come in a bit above the original guidance of plus 29% versus the third quarter of 2019. However, due to Hurricane Ian, we lost approximately $3.5 million in revenue to finish with total revenue up plus 28.4%. Similarly, we lost 1 point of scheduled service capacity to finish at plus 17%. The resulting 12.60 TRASM in the quarter is the best third quarter since 2008. Perhaps most importantly, through an immense amount of communication and collaboration, the planning and operational groups have done an incredible job balancing the needs across the enterprise to set the operation up for success, and we're excited about the improvements we've seen on that front. There are generally three distinct pre-hurricane periods to the third quarter. The peak summer weeks were marked with lower growth and strong demand that was strong unitized metrics. The ensuing 4 weeks saw roughly 45% ASM growth and high rates of cash positive line. And while unit revenues were relatively challenged due to the growth, they were still positive. The rest of the quarter until the hurricane was likely the start of the quarter based on relative outperformance. While ASM growth was elevated between 25% and 30%, TRASM growth still performed in the double digits, and September load factors were the highest since 2011. We long theorized the changing dynamics of leisure and hybrid travel should lift the floor on September and other off peak periods, and we're pleased with how that is manifested through the first trial. Scott touched on the emerging significance of hybrid travel to our business, and everyone around this table believes in the structural shift of both how travel is valued as a life experience, but also how our business model measures so well with that shift. Despite the relative September strength, the growth cadence in the quarter was still a unit revenue headwind. If weekly ASM growth through the quarter was the same as the average peak summer growth rate, we'd have expected to perform about 5.5 points better on a year-over 3-year basis. With the unbundled approach to itineraries that we employ, we tried to balance the approach to maximizing total revenue per flight, generally ensuring that we are capturing the ancillary piece where inventory allows and pushing yields where demand is the greatest. As a part of this balance, we accomplished monthly record total revenue per passenger in both September and October on top of load factors we hadn't seen since the early part of last decade. The step-up in ancillary per passenger during the third quarter was essentially in line with the second quarter at plus 17.9%, again, driven by success with our bundled ancillary products and the Always Allegiant World MasterCard program. And the fourth quarter should end at approximately $70 per passenger. While we won't see much incremental upside in this quarter, we will begin to adopt new-to-us Airbus aircraft and the 180-seat Allegiant Extra layout this month, gaining 3 tails by quarter's end and 2 more shortly after the new year. Throughout 2022, Allegiant Extra returns on the 4 initial aircraft currently in service continued to widen the gap on both the required hurdle rate for positive contribution and the performance versus previous years. We are ecstatic to make this available to more customers in the coming quarters. Zooming out a little bit, we expect total revenue for the fourth quarter to be up between 26.5% and 28.5% year-over 3-year with scheduled service capacity up 15%, implying mild sequential TRASM acceleration at the midpoint. And while ASM growth is a bit flatter throughout the fourth quarter versus the third, two primary headwinds remain, 3% due to Hurricane and roughly 1 point due to incremental off-peak days and holiday timing. However, despite these headwinds, the fourth quarter will via for the highest TRASM of any quarter in Allegiant history. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Anderson: Drew, thank you, and we appreciate everyone joining us today. And of course, a special thanks to Team Allegiant. We are extremely proud of the amazing work you continue to accomplish. So operational stability has been one of our top priorities and third quarter results did not disappoint. Controllable completion for the quarter of 99.4% was 2.1% higher than the first half of 2022 and very much trending in the right direction. However, as we were closing out the quarter, we experienced an uncontrollable disruption as Hurricane Ian ripped through Florida. First and foremost, our heartfelt thoughts are with those impacted by the storm. As announced earlier this week, we deepened our partnership with the Red Cross to support the recovery and rebuilding of this area. When Ian made landfall in Southwest Florida, it devastated the surrounding areas, including the Port Charlotte and Punta Gorda area. This hit home for us, in many ways, as Punta Gorda is one of our largest aircraft bases and Port Charlotte is home to our Sunseeker Resort. Over 550 Allegiant and Sunseeker team members live in and around the surrounding areas. We are grateful to report that all of our team members were safe and accounted for, although the recovery for many of them continues. We estimate the hurricane headwind to our operating margin to be 1 point and 3 points in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. And regarding the damage to the resort, we still have limited information, but preliminary estimates suggest approximately $35 million of physical damage primarily caused by subcontractor cranes hitting the building. We believe we have ample insurance to cover these estimated damages. And from an accounting perspective, GAAP required us to record a preliminary loss estimate of the $35 million, which will be offset in subsequent quarters as insurance proceeds are collected. So if we exclude this $35 million, our adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $13.5 million, a 2.4% [op] margin. And prior to the hurricane Ian, and as Drew explained, revenue for the quarter was on pace to exceed our initial expectations. Absolute costs were down 8% from prior quarter aided by a reduction in fuel costs, and our third quarter fuel cost per gallon of $3.85 was generally in line with our initial guide. Our unitized costs, excluding fuel, recognition grant and that $35 million Hurricane Ian special charge, it came in at [$0.0761], up 13.9% versus the same period in 2019 on 14.5% ASM growth. And this increase was largely driven by 4 points of labor productivity, 3 points of inflation and 4 points of aircraft utilization. Aircraft utilization as measured by block hours per day was 6.4 hours per day during the third quarter. And you compare that to 7.4 hours during the same period in 2019. And so we estimate a 1 hour increase in utilization per aircraft per day would have reduced our unit costs by $0.005 [ph] Turning to the fourth quarter. Our guidance issued today suggests an adjusted operating margin of 8%, and that's for the fourth quarter, a meaningful improvement sequentially, and this assumes an average of $3.75 per gallon of fuel. And based on system ASM growth of 13.5%, we expect CASM-X for the quarter to be up 14% year over three. This increase is summarized as follows: 1, inflationary pressures at our airports and a service provider is roughly 4 points; 2, lower aircraft utilization should drive roughly 4 points; and 3, labor -- lower labor productivity should result in another 2 points of this increase. As we look towards 2023, uncertainty remains around fuel price levels, supply chain and OEM delays and pilot constraints. And as such, we are not prepared to share specifics on our '23 budget plans, but we'll provide some high-level thoughts. Overall, our 2023 priority is to continue improving margins, which we have line of sight on. A couple of important steps in helping us get there is, first, operational stability, which is not only paramount for our team members and our guests, but will also improve financial results. This is underscored by our year-to-date spend in total IROPs, which is $60 million more than all of 2019. In addition, we are seeing improved reliability that has naturally helped with crew stability by reducing the number of unplanned absences and sick calls. Second, securing labor contracts. We are in active contract negotiations with our pilot and flight attendant groups. We have terrific crew members, improving communication, upgrading systems and getting a new contract they deserve as our top priority. While these new deals should have a headwind to absolute costs, we expect them to increase the momentum in achieving staffing levels and restoring our ability to optimize aircraft productivity. And speaking of aircraft, our internal teams continue to pace nicely with our plans of being ready to take delivery of our 737 MAX aircraft order. We are excited to bring on the MAX aircraft, particularly as we believe they will bring a 30% earnings advantage compared to our A320 COs. However, the delivery timing from Boeing is pushed to the right a few months. We actually only expect three of the aircraft next year with the first one now not expected until October of 2023. With that backdrop, we want to reaffirm our current plan of 2023 ASM growth to be around 10%. This in no way suggests demand is weak. In fact, we continue to see very strong demand. We will, however, continue to keep a close eye on the consumer as the Fed is still far off of achieving its target goal of 2% inflation and is raising interest rates at unprecedented speed, which leads into some recent debt transactions that have greatly derisked our capital stack. During the third quarter, we carefully timed the market by extending our $533 million term loan maturity from 1 year out to 5 years. This was with the $550 million secured bond offering. That offering was 6 times oversubscribed and priced at a fixed rate of 7.25%. And interest to be paid on the new bond is expected to be less than the pre-existing loan given the high rising rate environment. In addition, and as part of this transaction, we secured a $75 million revolving credit facility with Barclays. And as such, we expect to end the year with $1.2 billion in total liquidity, inclusive of cash on hand and undrawn revolvers. This is more than 2x our liquidity on hand prior to the pandemic. Total debt inclusive of finance leases is expected to end 2022 at roughly $2 billion, which implies $1 billion of net debt. Last month, we drew our final tranche from our $350 million loan with Castle Lake II Fund Sunseeker, and that's at a fixed interest rate of 5.75%. Also during the quarter, we secured $200 million in financing for our upcoming PDP commitments with Boeing. We were really pleased to find stand-alone PDP financing, which didn't require long-term financing commitments for any aircraft. This will provide us with tremendous flexibility in managing the balance sheet as we take delivery of those aircraft in '23 and '24, while also navigating the interest rate environment. We are fortunate to have a fleet plan with tremendous flexibility. And in the event of extended delays in delivery of our 737 MAX order book, we could adjust timing of our A320 retirements and/or take additional aircraft in the used market to meet our network requirements. In addition, we have valuable options for up to 50 additional 737 MAX aircraft for delivery between 2025 and 2028. And as mentioned last quarter, we decided to hold 3 aircraft in storage this year and place them into service in the first half of 2023. This change means we will end 2022 with 123 aircraft in service. And with that, we'll take your questions.\nQ - Savanthi Syth: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm just kind of curious if you could provide just a little color on -- are you seeing your crew levels and attrition levels improving? And as you kind of think about 2023, if you're expecting an improvement into 2023, how much of that will be kind of offset by having to kind of hire and train ahead of the MAX kind of coming into the fleet?\nScott Sheldon: Savi, this is Sheldon. I appreciate the question. Yes, there are certain months definitely throughout '22 where we saw first officer attrition specifically reached 30% on an annual basis. If you look at the complement of pilots throughout the system, it's running about 15%. We've put in more than 350 folks through the school, the schoolhouse this year. And if you look at the net seniority list increase, we're up about 135 folks. So that's a lot of sort of thrash in order to sort of obviously get ready for the introduction of the Boeing fleet. That being said, with the launch of a pilot program. And more importantly, we got to get a deal done. At the end of the day, our rates are so far underwater. I think directionally, we know where the contract needs to be and we're just plowing through it as quickly as we can. So I think aspirationally, we want to have classes of 25 each month, which should more than offset any sort of attrition. But that's sort of how we're looking at modeling this into '23.\nGreg Anderson: And Savi, it's Greg. On your question around the cost headwinds from incorporating the MAX aircraft, where we're looking at today, 2023, we'd expect that to be roughly $0.05 of CASM-X headwind. '24, I think where we hit the top there would be about $0.10 of CASM-X.\nSavanthi Syth: That's super helpful. Thanks for all that color. If I might, on the fuel efficiency side, it seems like the seal efficiency of the Airbus fleet hasn't really been showing up. Wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color and what the trend there might be.\nGreg Anderson: Sure, Savi, it's Greg. Let me take that. I think overall, the -- we target the fuel efficiency on the A320 fleet to be roughly like 86 ASMs per gallon. It also is impacted season by season, so by quarter. The third quarter is generally the hottest and so that will be the lowest or least efficient quarter in terms of ASMs per gallon. So where I think we're going to end the year is probably 84 ASMs per gallon. I would expect a little bit of step up next year in 2023. And then once we take that, the Boeing aircraft, I think you'll -- those are roughly mixed in the fleet, those - or mix between the 2 types, the 7 and the 8200s. I think you're about 110 ASMs per gallon. So I'd like to see in 2024 get closer to 90 ASMs per gallon and then in 2025, where we have more on, going above the 90 ASMs per gallon.\nSavanthi Syth: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth at Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thank you for the time. So your guidance implies some sequential improvement in margins from 3Q to 4Q. And honestly, we haven't had a lot of time to dissect the special bonuses, the debt charge, the hurricane charge. But it looks like ex all of that, you still lost some money, which is historically unusual for Allegiant. What would you point to as the biggest drivers of your loss in 3Q? And what are the fundamental reasons you see margins getting better? Is this really about like we're going to be chugging along here at similar levels until you guys have more confidence in your ability to flex up in the peaks? And I'd love your comments on if you think that confidence is increasing yet.\nGreg Anderson: Duane, thanks for the question. It's Greg. Why don't I kick it off here and the others I'm sure will want to jump in. But I think in terms of the sequential improvement in margins, the fourth quarter is just stronger than the third quarter seasonally. So we should see strength and that should help drive revenue. Some of the tailwinds that we should see as well is operational reliability. Third quarter, we did a nice job there, but it's even trending much better into the fourth quarter. Some of the headwinds, I think, Drew pointed this out in the fourth quarter will still be the lingering of Hurricane Ian. We have some of the Sunseeker operating costs that have been trending up over the quarters as we get closer to opening as well. I think what I'd say, though, is we think about like optimizing aircraft utilization and how we get there. Scott mentioned a focus on labor, but also with the operational reliability improvement, I think we've seen a reduction in unplanned crew absences and sick time. Which if you think about that and you take that crew stability, that can give you more of an opportunity to increase utilization in those peak periods. Candidly, this year, we've capped our peak periods, and that's where, as you -- I know, Duane, you followed us for so many years, you know that's where we make most of our money. I think in March in the summer, we make 60% of all of our earnings in those peak periods. So having that capped, I mean it has been more difficult for us to produce those type of results, but we see line of sight in getting back there. And as we mentioned, with operational stability, that's the first step, and then we'll continue to layer on and kind of torque up utilization where we can and where it makes sense at the right time, right appropriate time. I'll pause there if there's anything anybody else. Did that help, Duane? Did we miss anything?\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I appreciate those thoughts. And then just on CapEx, I think we can back into the remaining spend on Sunseeker next year from the disclosure that you have. Can you just remind us, total aircraft CapEx and maintenance-related CapEx you'd expect next year?\nGreg Anderson: Duane, it's Greg. It's a great question. And what I'll caveat it with is it's just -- it's fluid at this point given the uncertainty of timing around MAX deliveries, not only in '23. But as you know, a big part of our CapEx is going to be PDP payments and trying to understand all that between -- for the entire order. So what I'll say is where we sit today, I think CapEx next year as a floor should be at least $500 million. So I want to say we'll end this year at $350 million for the airline. So for next year, the airline will be at least $500 million. But what I want to say maybe, put BJ on the spot here, but ask BJ to add some color because of that CapEx, I think he's done a really nice job of making sure we have the appropriate financing to support it. But BJ, anything you want to add?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Maybe just Duane, the moving parts are, of course, the actual deliveries to Boeing airplanes, like Greg mentioned, the 2024 schedule will impact PET CapEx in '23. And then there's a couple of other things in there, whether or not those first deliveries or those early deliveries in 24 end up being MAX 7s or MAX 8s. And then finally, just movement in the used A320 acquisitions that we may need to bridge that gap.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you very much.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thanks, Duane.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMichael Linenberg: Good afternoon, everyone. Greg, I want to go back to the 8% adjusted operating margin that you sort of threw out earlier on the call. Is that incorporating like the 3 points from Ian? So we should be thinking more like a 5-point margin, 5% margin ex-Ian ? Or are you rolling that through? And then also just the employee recognition piece, I know you called it out as a special for the last 2 quarters. Is that going to feature as a cost item in the fourth quarter because I know you don't include it in CASM. So we're just trying to get to that 8%. Any color?\nGreg Anderson: So for the fourth quarter, I'd say the adjusted op margin of 8% will exclude that recognition or the bulk of that recognition bonus. And I'll tell you here why in one second, Michael, but it would include the impact from Hurricane Ian. So save the Hurricane Ian, it would be 11%, if that makes sense. And the reason we excluded this year the recognition bonus is we've had a policy for many, many years to - you'd have to achieve a 5% operating margin before we started accruing a bonus profit sharing for our team members. Given this unique environment from labor across all of our team members, and they're just going above and beyond, we wanted to make sure that we did the right thing, and we approved and had bonuses ready for them irrespective of where our profit came in or lack of thereof. What I would say is next year, we're going to pull that out. So next year when we expect to be back to earnings again and providing profits, we're not going to peg it to a recognition brand. It's going to be based on profitability, and we would not exclude that in CASM-X.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, that helps. And then just a quick one to Drew on capacity fourth quarter. You mentioned 15%. I think the schedules are still indicating a bit higher than that. So I guess we should be -- we should assume that we're going to see some additional cuts through additional filing schedules over the next month or so. Is that accurate?\nDrew Wells: I think essentially we just need to file the changes that have been made. Things that happened around Ian will never be reflected in the public sources because they were so close in. So we took an impact there. So I think we're scheduled - and I thought we were going to do this last weekend. I think a new filing is coming soon. But the deal will remain or public forums will remain slightly elevated just due to those closing cancels associated with EM.\nMichael Linenberg: Fair enough. Okay, thanks. Thanks, everyone for answering my question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group at Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. So I want to see if you have any thoughts on CASM next year. So if ASMs are up about 10%, it sounds like maybe you'll be expensing the employee recognition, maybe you get a new pilot deal. How are you thinking about CASM-X next year? Do you think it can be down on a year-over-year basis? Any directional color?\nGreg Anderson: Scott, it's Greg. Maybe just directionally, we're still in the process of budgeting for 2023. So I want to be careful and not get too specific here on where we expect CASM-X to be. You mentioned that 10% ASM number that we've, of course, mentioned as well. I would say that growth is generally -- you should expect that to be back half of '23 loaded. So the first half is going to be limited ASM growth or generally flat. When I say some of the tailwinds or at least a big tailwind in 2023 versus 2022 to the unit cost will be the IROPs being down, right? I think that should be super helpful. And then some of the headwinds are, Savi asked earlier on Boeing, incorporating the Boeing aircraft. So that's about the $0.05 CASM-X headwind you have. FTEs are up with the exception of pilots to kind of support this infrastructure to be larger. I mean, candidly, a year ago, at this time, we thought in 2023, we'd be 20% larger than we're going to be. But we have that infrastructure in place. And as we kind of loosen up and get the pipeline as Scott Sheldon mentioned, put the pilots coming in and the ability to kind of make up utilization and growth. The good thing is we're spring coiled and ready to go. And so we have that foundation in place. And then at some point, I think you could see nice growth, but I wouldn't expect that to even begin happening until the back half of 2023. And again, that's going to be contingent on a labor deal being done or likely being done. And then just everything I talked about here directionally is that doesn't assume a pilot deal in the cost. But I would say for internal forecast is that's what we're expecting. We're building that in for our forecast. But I don't want to give numbers to negotiate publicly if you will.\nScott Group: And so I know you're guiding to margin improvement next year and just it feels like double-digit margin is tough to get to, but let me know if you think differently. But I guess, what is the path to getting back to double-digit margin, operating margin, which you guys consistently used to have? How do we get there?\nGreg Anderson: Yes, it's a great question. Let me kick it off here again. And I'd say -- and I keep saying it, op stability, getting rid of IROP. It's got to come out of the business, $60 million incremental in total IROP costs this year versus 2019. So that's one. That stable ops, as we mentioned, is stabilizing ops, that gives us crew stability so we could peak up more -- we can fly more in those peak periods, which is the most profitable time for us to fly. So that's two. Labor deals getting done, which helps with utilization with growth. That's 3. Aircraft. The aircraft we're bringing in. If you think about 2019, are we -- we talked EBITDA per aircraft of $6 million per shell. The 320, 186-seat or even the 320 that's going to be Allegiant Extra, we -- that has an earnings potential of $7 million of EBITDA per copy. So we think bringing those in along with the 30% economic advantage of the Boeing aircraft is going to be key there as well. Cost discipline. Like as I mentioned, we're going through the budget and austerity is a big theme here at Allegiant this year to make sure that we're cutting out any unnecessary costs, but that we can support the opportunities that we have ahead. And maybe I'll pause and I don't know if Drew or Scott want to hit on some of the commercial initiatives such as systems like Navitaire or Viva. I mean we think these can really drive earnings potential -- or drive margins higher, not to mention loyalty and everything that's happening on that side of the house as well. But anybody else want to add?\nDrew Wells: I think you covered quite a bit.\nGreg Anderson: I think I probably took too much time and answered for everybody, so I apologize. But yes, I think that covered kind of where we wanted to hit.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Didora: Good afternoon, everyone. John or Greg, I know in the release, you highlighted the removal of the suspension on the existing buyback. Obviously, all the government restrictions were lifted at the end of September. Just curious how do you think about capital allocation today now that these restrictions have been lifted. And would you consider buying back stock before, say, getting a new pilot deal? Just curious of your thoughts there.\nJohn Redmond: We're not going to try to predict timing in that regard. I think our Board wanted to make sure that the capital allocation strategies we had [Technical Difficulty] in the past, we opened those back up as soon as we are able to do that, which is why they lifted the restriction that we put in place due to the Cares Act. So now we no longer have that restriction, if you will. So we do have the flexibility to do what we historically have done in the past going forward, trying to predict timing. We're not going to try to do that here. But it is nice to have those restrictions gone.\nAndrew Didora: Understood. And maybe for Scott DeAngelo or Drew. Look, I think a lot of your ULCC peers have some pretty aggressive goals for their non-ticket revenues over the next few years. Just curious what do you think your opportunity is for non-ticket? And how do you think about the trade-off between ticket and non-ticket? Thanks.\nDrew Wells: I'll kick it off here, Drew here. I think in the last call, we talked about an incremental $10 being quite plausible over the next 5 or so years. I continue to believe that that's a very firm target. There's a number of initiatives, Greg hinted at Navitaire and that will unlock some capabilities for us on the ancillary side that we have not had internally really in the history of Allegiant, that'll provide a lot more flexibility in terms of how we approach the ancillary program. I think we've been dynamic, more capable, particularly around seats, but in other areas like bags, we've been fairly handcuffed by our own doing and can really unlock a lot there. So pretty bullish on that. Allegiant Extra was also mentioned, which will drive a lot to the seat line. Greg mentioned, can take the A320s up to $7 million EBITDA per copy if we can return to some of the '19 bandwidth. Beyond that, we have a lot of -- and I'll kick it over to Scott, you guys hear a lot of the co-branded stuff and some third-party elements that he can develop.\nScott Sheldon: Yes. That's exactly what I would add to that, and thanks for the question. The next point, as Maury would put it if he was in the room, is selling outside the aircraft. So even if there are capacity challenges, part of the IT transformation that John spoke about includes really being able to add hotel inventory beyond just Las Vegas, where traditionally we've been strong. But also to streamline the buying and the adding of hotels and rental cars to be at parity with leading OTAs, which is -- it's something we don't currently have, but we'll have in the near future. So that additional hotel and rental car sales, in addition to what Drew says, I think helps us outpace from a revenue perspective.\nGreg Anderson: I think maybe just in closing, the idea is not to just focus on ancillary as the opportunity but base fare as well. So everyone can deploy a different strategy, if you will, on getting to a larger total average fare. But as we get there, it's not strictly a focus on ancillary but a focus on base as well.\nAndrew Didora: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel McKenzie of Seaport Global. Your line is now open.\nDaniel McKenzie: Hey. Thanks, guys. A couple of questions here. Just following up on an earlier question on CASM-X for next year, should we be including the upfront Sunseeker cost in that cost outlook? And the reason I ask is just because there's no real offsetting revenue until that opens, I guess, now September 1. Or I guess maybe if you can provide some perspective on at least how you're initially thinking to report that. And then more broadly, just going on this point of expanding margins for next year, I'm just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on that. What kind of economic scenario does that contemplate? I think Bloomberg has said there's 100% probably a recession. I think the market is assuming 60%. So if you can just elaborate a little bit more on those topics, that would be great.\nGreg Anderson: It's Greg. Why don't I kick it off. I'll try and hit them both. On your Sunseeker comment, next year, we're going to segment reports, so we'll break all that out, so you'll see it separately. So we're planning to begin that next year in '23. And then in terms of -- just as we're thinking about next year, I think in face of a recession, to get to your point, 1, we focus on leisure customers, which generally it's a stickier we've got historically -- been a stickier kind of customer base. Scott DeAngelo, I think mentioned it in his opening comments, 80% VFR and second home, which if you peel that back a little bit on the leisure customer, I think that's probably even more sticky, right, if you think about it from that perspective. So measure growth. We're going up to 10% next year. I think Drew and the team are planning on that to be in existing markets. So it's derisking that type of growth. And then we have our flexible model, the network, the direct distribution. But overall, I mean, with the capacity somewhat constrained and where GDP is outpacing 2019 more so than even the industry, I mean we think even if a recession were to come and there's some headwinds to the consumer that we can continue to stimulate demand, and we're going to be just fine. And I think we're better if not as well -- if not better positioned than most other carriers where we sit today, given all our unique facts and circumstances.\nJohn Redmond: Dan, maybe just to elaborate a little bit on the Sunseeker piece you asked about. The expense you'll see we're incurring now, and you'll see next year is primarily all preopening, right? So next year, we'll blow out all the remaining part of that leading up to the opening of the resort. And most of that will skew in Q3 of '23. So we'll have it, of course, in the first 2 quarters, but most will skew into '23. And we'll share with you what that number is in Q4 when we finish the quarter. We'll break it out and let you know what that number is, and then give you some thoughts as to what the order of magnitude is for all of '23. The other thing, of course, that will impact that is just the delayed opening. Preopening is larger just due to the delay. But having said that, we would expect to recover some of that through insurance as well. So a lot more guidance you would, if you will, on that we'll share with you after Q4.\nDaniel McKenzie: Second question here for, I guess, Scott DeAngelo. Total visitation (inaudible) to the website was up 30% versus '19. To what extent is this data feeding into your revenue management systems or at least informing how the revenue management system should work? And is the reference -- go ahead, I'm sorry, I was going to just follow up with one more. You go ahead and finish, my apologies. Well, I was just going to ask, the reference to the up 30% versus 2019 and kind of the second part of this question, is that our best indicator of pent-up demand as we think about the 2023 revenue picture? Or does it really more reflect the [indiscernible] referenced earlier in the script, so a structural change in demand? So kind of a 2-part question.\nScott DeAngelo: You bet. So we'll take the second part first, and it's the latter. We think it's structural demand. I commented versus 2019 just to keep it consistent, but I'm happy to share our total web users were up by 34% versus last year. So you actually see it gaining steam. So that suggests structural, as Drew had mentioned. And then on the first question, marketing and the revenue management and network planning teams do work extremely close, especially as you think about off peak being able to grab some of what we might not be able to grab on peaking the peaks as it were. And so where we -- when we drive those users and where we're driving them from market wise, it's something we do in lockstep with network planning and revenue to make sure those users are coming at the right time and wanting to fly from and to the right places.\nDrew Wells: Maybe just - this is Drew here. just expand slightly on the actual RM model. It's probably more art than science. It's integrated into the model, but not in a way that's driving significant automated changes or recommendations at this point. It still falls on the analysts to interpret and react accordingly.\nDaniel McKenzie: Yeah, understood. Okay. Thanks for the time, guys.\nDrew Wells: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nConor Cunningham: Hey, everyone. Thank you. Just on the 10% capacity growth, it seems like you're sizing that to your resources that you have right now, but there's still a lot of issues in terms of aviation infrastructure, ATC being a major problem. Just curious on how you plan on navigating a lot of those issues outside of your own control next year.\nGreg Anderson: Sure. As we look at next year and really using '22 as the baseline, ATC has certainly caused some A14 issues. I wouldn't call it anything major after probably the first quarter of the year, we struggled a little bit through March. It didn't really feel a material impact through the summer outside, as like I mentioned, some A14. Not a lot of cancels being driven by that. So at this point, we're not restructuring our network plans or our schedule around that. I think a similar story on TSA and other infrastructure issues. There's probably one-offs that get pointed to. But at this juncture, I would not plan on material changes to our plan in 2002 based on infrastructure that you're referring to.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then just the changing dynamics from like the flexibility. You talked about a little bit in the press release from a monthly standpoint. But some of the other airlines have talked about like day of weeks changing a fair bit. And when I think about you guys, like you barely fly on Tuesdays and Saturdays. I'm just curious on how that trend may be changing or how you're looking at that trend now going forward and seeing if you're making any adjustments to your model as a result of it? Thank you.\nGreg Anderson: No, I think you hit the nail on the head that we don't have a ton of exposure to markets that are beyond two and three times per week. Where we are running 6 or more times a week, we certainly have seen some of that same shift to where Wednesdays, primarily Wednesdays would come up a bit more toward the week average. Tuesday is still lagging a little bit behind that. And I don't think it necessarily changes our philosophy at all. We've had the compressed schedules even on larger markets a little bit given the constraints we have in place, and we'd love to be able to restore that and take better advantage. We would be doing that with or without the results that we've been seeing, I believe. So seeing what you're indicating, but it's not something that needs to change our approach in my opinion. And I think the other part worth mentioning, and this came up just the other day. As you think about load factors exceeding our 90% booked, that kind of implies more than just your peak patterns that are booking, right? So instead of just a heavy Friday to Monday, or Thursday to Sunday weekend pattern coming into the destination, you're also experiencing those going out of the destination as well as covering kind of the midweek type of travel. So that's more of how we'll see the dynamic shift and kind of the dynamic that you need to adjust in order to facilitate book load factors at those levels.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna International Group.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. So John, on the 10% ASM growth for next year, what is your risk-adjusted view on the order book? So meaning you're contracted to receive ex-aircraft, but you're expecting a minimum of, let's say, Y? And then on the 10%, could you give us some color on the moving pieces there, how much you're expecting to come from departures, gauge and stage. Thank yoiu.\nJohn Redmond: Well, I'll let Greg or BJ talk about some of the more - those kind of details. But at the end of the day, we have an agreement in place with Boeing. We're not going to renegotiate, if you will, over the phone. As we come into more information through conversation with Boeing, we will react in a way that makes sense for Allegiant, but we're just going to stay tuned and see what happens. But right now, there's nothing really to add beyond what Greg and BJ mentioned about the 23 deliveries that we expect. But go into other detail that you're talking about?\nGreg Anderson: Sure, Chris. I think on the 10% growth, and Drew may fact check me here, but the departures are going to lag the ASM growth because we've gauged slightly, maybe a point or two, but we'll get back on that. We'll see where that comes out with next year. And then to John's point, what I would say on the Boeing deliveries, they're always going to be back half of next year. That's what we're expecting. We're eager to get these aircraft in. We're planning on it. We have a whole team set up and working towards that. As I mentioned, they're 30% earnings advantage with that -- with those aircraft. We have bonus depreciation, which it's 100% in 2023. It steps down to 80% in '24 and then 60% in '25. That's very helpful for us in terms of offsetting cash taxes and part of our decision-making candidly. So we want to get these aircraft in. They are game changers, particularly in a high fuel environment for us. But we're planning, we're preparing and being flexible depending on when that time comes. But I don't know, BJ, if I missed anything, if there's anything else you want to add?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. just to your question on contractual deliveries and expected deliveries. So we're contracted to take originally 10 aircraft during 2023. We had mutually agreed to reduce that to 8 aircraft shortly after signing the agreement. That was for some operational reasons to help us with onboarding the airplane type. And then we've now received notice from Boeing that it will only be 3 aircraft delivered in 2023, and we're still working with them to determine when the 5 airplanes that fell out of '23 will deliver. To Greg's point, we want to be made whole on that. There are a lot of things we were counting on with those, but we're not sure they're going to fit into 2024. So we'll have to update that maybe on the next call.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And Greg, on the CASM-X breakout for 4Q, how much of the 10 points that you outlined, do you see carrying over into 2023? And then also, I believe you suggested in response to Scott's CASM-X question that you were anticipating some CASM-X relief in the second half, which sounds like just a function of where your capacity is expected to be plus these 3 aircraft. So is that the case? And then B, is that including a labor deal in that scenario? Thank you\nGreg Anderson: That is not including a labor deal. But what I would say is getting a labor deal done gives us a path to take up utilization or optimize utilization per aircraft, which I think is really meaningful. In my prepared remarks, Chris, I think I mentioned every hour of increase in utilization per aircraft per day is worth like $0.05 of CASM-X. So that could be a meaningful a tailwind for us there. I think to your question about kind of what's rolling over 4Q costs versus next year -- into early next year. One of the things that I think that maybe Linenberg was getting at, but there is going to be the headwind in unit costs when it comes to our bonus accrual as mentioned. We're excluding it this year, but we'd add that back in next year, so that will be a headwind. But also some of our cost -- unit costs are seasonal depending on just ASMs. First quarter, we're going to generally have more ASMs than we would in the fourth quarter. So we'd have to take that into account as well. But yes, I mean I think like -- I mean, I'm just going to pause or stop there because I want to be careful for not getting into too much detail and guiding for already too. Because, again, we're still working through the budget, and I want to be fair to that process.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Just the integration from Boeing, did you say that was $0.5 or $0.05? Thank you\nGreg Anderson: $0.05 of CASM-X. And then that's added in by 24 at a mature $0.10 [ph] of CASM-X.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn it back to John Redmond, CEO, for closing remarks.\nJohn Redmond: Well, we appreciate the questions."}, {"symbol": "ALGT", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-08-03 23:03:07", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2022 Allegiant Travel Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sherry Wilson, Managing Director of Investor Relations.\nSherry Wilson: Thank you Leeway. Welcome to the Allegiant Travel Company's second quarter 2022 earnings call. On the call with me today are John Redmond, the company's Chief Executive Officer; Greg Anderson, President and Chief Financial Officer; Scott DeAngelo, our EVP and Chief Marketing Officer; Drew Wells our SVP of Revenue and Planning; and a handful of others to help answer questions. We will start the call with commentary and then open it up to questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. The company's comments today will contain forward-looking statements concerning our future performance and strategic plan. Various risk factors could cause the underlying assumptions of these statements and our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. These risk factors and others are more fully disclosed in our filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements are based on information available to us today. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise. The company cautions investors not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which may be based on assumptions and events that do not materialize. To view this earnings release as well as the rebroadcast of the call, feel free to visit the company's Investor Relations site. With that, I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn Redmond: Thank you very much Sherry and good afternoon everyone. I should probably advise that Scott Sheldon is not here today, but obviously we'll still take whatever questions you have. This is, of course, the first earnings call in the history of Allegiant, Maury has not participated or provided his opening comments. No one in the industry has the depth of knowledge and awareness of the industry that Maury has. So as long as your questions are more present day focused, we'll get by. I have started every earnings call thanking our amazing, dedicated and passionate employees. So would be remiss if that commentary was not repeated. Thank you all. You are the best. With this new chapter beginning, it's fully fitting I announce the promotions of Scott Sheldon and Greg Anderson to President effective 8/1. Every one of you on the call know them. So they need no introduction. We have the best management team in the industry and this is one of many steps we are taking to ensure consistency, continuity and execution. Scott -- Greg, Scott DeAngelo, our CMO and Rob Wilson, our CTO have all signed employment agreements through December 2026. In regards to our operations, Q2 is not our best or an industry best for that matter, but we're reacting fast to this ever-changing environment. July, we started to get back within reach of where we should be with a 99% controllable completion and we expect Q3 to be at the same performance level or better than July. July was better than June on every metric from STAR D0 to A14 and controllable cancellations. We have always been a margin focused company and that won't change going forward. With strong load factors and improving operations, margins will grow given reduced IROPs. We are in negotiations with our pilots, but have no updates regarding financial impact or timing. Maury did mention in the Q1 earnings call, he was personally involved in those negotiations. So having a decision-maker like him with his intimate knowledge of the issues and understanding of the business model is invaluable for all parties. In addition, we are having partnership conversations with several flight schools to ensure a predictable stream of pilots into the future. There has been plenty of dialogue and commentary out there regarding how people see 2023 unfold. We have never been ones to overpromise and underdeliver but trying to make any predictions or forecasts in this environment given the many variables is not something we will do. We have a history of year-over-year growth, but that history provides no crystal ball during times of multiple variables moving in unpredictable ways with no line of sight. Having said that, our model was built to handle times like this and our DNA is to remain very flexible and act or react based on changing circumstances and we will continue to do that as we always have done. This approach has served us very well to date. As for Sunseeker Resort Charlotte Harbor, we are still targeting to open May of 2023, but will not finalize the opening month until early Q4. To date, we have booked 1,100 transient room-nights at an ADR of $390, which is impressive in that most of these reservations are in the May through September time frame, which is historically the slowest months of the year. In addition, we've booked 31 groups totaling 31,300 room-nights. The total contracted rooms, food and beverage revenue, for these groups was roughly $13.4 million. An interesting point to make here is, we have already booked 5.6% of the total room-nights for 2024, none of which are transient bookings and stopped taking group reservations, for February of 2024. This impressive booked percentage, will only increase as we move closer to opening.  Allegiant has a direct relationship with its guests; meaning we don't use GDS or OTAs, to book travel. Sunseeker of course, follows the same high-margin approach, which requires a significant number of emails, to perform at the level we expect to. To date, we have roughly 3.1 million emails in the Sunseeker database, and project this number will grow to over four million by opening. These numbers are unprecedented in the resort or hotel world, and show the power and synergy of the Allegiant model and Sunseeker Resort. They also speak volumes about our excitement, in opportunities in the asset-light space. Building an email database is absolutely critical, and foundational to success in this space. After all how can you fill a hotel, if you don't have a database to market to? I can't think of a more efficient and cost-effective approach to fill a resort, or a plane than email marketing. You are starting to see the pieces coming together, of what we refer to as Allegion 2.0. Last but not least, we have made the decision to pay off our CARES Act-related government debt of $24.6 million, before month-end. We appreciate the assistance the CARES Act provided, during the unprecedented early stages of the COVID pandemic. Given the guidance and decisions of our board, the untold number of analyses and conversations between management team and the sacrifices made by all of our employees, we find ourselves in the amiable position of paying off this loan, well before its maturity date. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott DeAngelo. \nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, John. Second quarter again saw exceptionally strong demand for Allegiant, in terms of both web traffic, to allegiant.com, and passenger segments booked. Total visitors to our website were up by nearly 35% in the quarter versus 2019. Most notably, new visitors were up by nearly 60%, and visitors coming to allegiant.com by directly entering the URL, or by using our mobile app, were up by more than 85% versus 2019. What's more, we've added nearly one million new emails to our customer database, in the first half of this year. The continued huge increases in both new visitors and direct visitors to allegiant.com, speaks not only to the ever-increasing awareness of our brand, but also what that brand stands for: low fares and nonstop flights, the two most important buying factors, during what's been a turbulent time, in terms of both airline industry operations and inflationary economic conditions. Put simply our addressable customer audience continues to grow, as more new customers consider Allegiant for their leisure travel needs, more than 85% of which are coming to us, after either last flying or most frequently flying Southwest Delta American or United. Less than 15% are coming from all other airlines combined, and less than 10% are coming from other ULCCs.  Customers are looking to find relief from sky-high fares, as well as avoid the risk associated with connecting flights, through overloaded major airport hubs. To that point, our weekly tracking of customer sentiment, which was originally focused on COVID but now expanded to include customer sentiment towards the economy, and air travel, shows a meaningful change in the top three considerations for customers, when selecting an airline for leisure travel in the current environment. In past years price, non-stop service and schedule were the prevailing top considerations. But in the past several months, while price and non-stop service not surprisingly continue to be the top two factors, the airport itself namely the convenience of smaller less crowded airports has replaced schedule as the third most important factor. This represents yet another material development that favors Allegiant and our attractive network of alternative airport locations like Mesa, Sanford and St. Pete-Clearwater to name a few. These factors not only explain the historic highs in web visits and bookings but also why the number of visitors to allegiant.com in the past several weeks to conduct flight searches for travel sometime during the August through November time period is up between 40% to 100% for all weeks compared to the same booking and travel periods last year. And while bookings from all customer ages continue to increase on a year-over-three-year basis, customers 65 years and older again showed dramatic booking increases at more than 60% above 2019 levels. This is great news as this age group represents our most frequent travelers many flying between a primary residence and vacation home with great flexibility and resiliency as a general rule, given their discretionary time and income. While air travel demand remains strong for the capacity we have posted, we also continue to aggressively focus on driving greater value per customer by selling outside the aircraft through the attachment of asset-light high-margin third-party products. The Always Allegiant World MasterCard remains the prominent driver, continuing to post record-setting months in terms of new card sign-ups, average spend on the card and total compensation to Allegiant. New card sign-ups for the quarter were up by 35% versus last year and 65% versus 2019 and revenue to Allegiant was up by nearly 130% versus last year and more than 150% versus 2019. In addition, our non-credit card-based loyalty program Always Rewards is just coming up on its one-year anniversary but already we're seeing engaged Always Rewards members spending 34% more on average than non-members, driven by increased take rates on air ancillary products and attachment of third-party products as customers engage with our simple but compelling rewards currency to maximize their point earnings for use on future leisure travel with Allegiant. Also of note, we continue aggressive technology development efforts to boost our ability to sell more hotels at increased attachment levels by connecting with more hotel inventory, experimenting with price presentation and better hotel merchandising and streamlining the checkout process to be at par with leading online travel agencies. In closing, we believe our unique value proposition of low fares, non-stop flights and broad service of smaller alternative airports remains and will continue to remain an attractive distinctive value proposition, especially in these uncertain economic times that is attracting new and returning customers alike in record numbers. And our focus on continuing to grow our high-margin asset-light third-party product sales can help us drive revenue per passenger growth in the upcoming years to provide at the very least, a partial but nonetheless, material offset amidst otherwise choppy conditions. And with that I'll turn it over to Drew for a deeper discussion of revenue and capacity.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott, and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. As has been mentioned, demand hit astronomical levels in the quarter. Scott talked about the outstanding web visitation and that turned into highest load factors we've produced since 2014. Along with accomplishing our targets to fill aircraft, we produced a second quarter best $66 per passenger in ancillary revenues. In total, the quarter finished with nearly $630 million in revenue, an increase of 28.1% over 2019. Core demand exceeded our expectations at the outset of the quarter. However, some non-core elements drove a headwind that Greg will detail shortly. Additionally in what is an encouraging but a revenue-offsetting dynamic, the use of vouchers given out above and beyond refunds or through marketing efforts encouraging folks to travel when ready were up nearly 200% per passenger; a great sign that beyond the great work Scott and his team has done to aid awareness and produce new visitors our previous flying guests are returning to Allegiant for additional trips. Scheduled service ASMs grew 13.4%, resulting in a TRASM change of 15.7%. And while I'm pleased with the summary results, this quarter was truly a story of the peaks and the off-peaks. As we mentioned on the May call, because the rise in fuel, was so rapid, we opted to maintain the majority of the flying through the off-peak April and May time frame due to the proximity to departure. It is worth noting, this flying was still earnings accretive despite the fuel expense. Meanwhile, June produced arguably the best revenue story in company history both in terms of total recognized revenue and revenue per flight. We narrowly missed 90% boarded load factors recorded nearly $70 per passenger in ancillary and had the third highest monthly increase when comparing to June 2019 in air rev per passenger over the last 15 years of Allegiant, and certainly, the best with any amount of meaningful ASM growth. However, not all ASMs are created equal. And candidly, we did not have a schedule to fully realize, all the potential revenue in the second quarter nor will we in the third. At the beginning of the year, we had aspirations for 30% 2Q growth and 35% in the third. And while demand did its part fuel prices and operational considerations have resulted in the current growth rates. Much of this came at the expense of peak flying. June and July are the lowest year-over-3-year growth months in their respective quarters with utilization roughly 20% below 2019 levels. In fact June and July featured less flying than the same months in 2021. We do take some solace in the unitized metric benefits we see in these months. And looking forward July will mirror the best of what we saw in Q2. That phenomenal story features boarded loads over 90%, a July record ancillary per passenger and the fourth highest air revenue per passenger increase comparing to July 2019 over the last 15 years of the airline. Furthermore, the operational integrity intended from the flight cuts materialized in the month, with a 99% completion as John mentioned. However, we are still a 100% leisure airline, subject to the whims of traditional leisure seasonality, and the distribution of growth between peak and off-peak, within the quarter, will drive a modest headwind to unitized rev. All in all, we expect to grow the scheduled service ASMs approximately 18% in the third quarter, and system ASMs approximately 16%. Further, we expect total revenue to grow roughly 29%. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Anderson: Drew, thank you, and good afternoon everyone. For the second quarter, we reported GAAP net income of $4.4 million, excluding our recognition bonus that would have been $11.1 million. We have the best team members in the industry and we are excited to recognize them for their incredible efforts day-in and day-out. Thank you, Team Allegiant for everything you do. Our second quarter financial results did not meet our initial expectations which is largely explained by three areas. First, and around revenue, we estimate we left roughly $10 million on the table during the second quarter as we transitioned to a new credit card processor and this drove an additional $4 million headwind in July. This issue has been resolved and is behind us. Second fuel. From mid-April into May, we saw our fuel price per gallon increase by nearly $0.50 another step-function increase in fuel. The rapid rise in fuel intra-quarter resulted in $19 million more in fuel costs than initially planned. Third, IROPs. Irregular operations drove an additional $9 million in incremental customer compensation. We are trending in the right direction as these costs were 40% down as compared to the first quarter and driven by an improvement in completion factor. And we are encouraged to see reliability in our operations continues to improve as the peak flying month of July resulted in a 99% completion factor, or the highest of the year. If we adjust for the $10 million in revenue, $19 million of fuel, and $9 million in additional customer compensation our 2Q operating margin would have been 11.4% and in line with our initial guide. Turning to the second quarter costs, excluding fuel our unitized costs for the quarter were $0.0676 and in line with expectations. Excluding our recognition bonus accrual and our IROPs customer compensation, our CASM-X was up 11% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Decreased productivity drove the majority of our CASM-X increase. The lower productivity can be seen through aircraft utilization, which is down 17.5% as compared to the same period in 2019. In addition, inflationary pressures primarily at the airports drove nearly two points of CASM-X increase. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in total liquidity inclusive of cash on hand. In August, we signed up a $100 million warehouse revolver, with MUFG bringing our total liquidity to $1.3 billion, or 70% of 2019's revenue. Our net debt balances increased slightly to approximately $750 million. This is largely due to construction draws for Sunseeker. However, this net debt balance is still well below pre-pandemic levels. And for the full year 2022, we expect to make $185 million in principal debt payments and $90 million is expected for interest expense. Turning towards the third quarter, our guidance issued today suggests an operating margin of 5% on system ASM capacity growth of 16% year-over-three. This guidance also assumes an average of $3.80 per gallon of fuel. Throughout 2022, we have action trimming our initial planned capacity by roughly 15 percentage points. These capacity reductions were primarily driven by staffing challenges, the volatility around rising fuel costs and adding more buffers for operational stability. As mentioned, operational stability for the month of July improved as it had a completion factor of roughly 99%; just want to point out a nearly two-percentage point improvement when compared to June. And based on third quarter capacity growth of 16%, we expect CASM-X for the quarter to be up 10% year-over-three. This increase is primarily related to inflationary pressures and productivity similar to the second quarter. Lower aircraft utilization versus third quarter of 2019 should drive roughly four points of CASM increase for assets and other fixed costs. Lower labor productivity should result in another two points of that increase. And inflationary pressures primarily again at our airports and with our service providers is roughly two points. As we look towards 2023, there remains significant uncertainty around fuel, the broader travel ecosystem and labor challenges. And while the US consumer is strong and the demand environment remains incredibly robust, we know the future macroeconomic environment is uncertain. Allegiant has a strong track record of industry-leading financial performance regardless of the macro or fuel environment. Our differentiated model is built to outperform. And as John said, our focus is on margins. And in the coming months, we will closely monitor the landscape and said factors, as we continue to refine our capacity plans for 2023 with an eye towards improving margins. So please stay tuned. Turning to fleet. We are fortunate to have a fleet plan with tremendous flexibility. As mentioned last quarter, we decided to hold three aircraft in storage this year and place them into service in the first half of 2023. This change means we will end 2022 with 124 aircraft in service. And currently, we have 34 unencumbered aircraft, which also helps aid our fleet flexibility. Turning to reinvestments in the business our full year 2022 total airline CapEx expectation has slightly reduced and it's $240 million in aircraft CapEx, which is inclusive of pre-delivery deposits $140 million and $60 million in other and heavy maintenance CapEx respectively. And in closing, we truly believe Allegiant has a differentiated business model. Over the past 20 years, our differentiation has come through major pillars, such as our asset acquisition strategy, uniquely vast network, direct distribution to our customers, selling third-party products, and most importantly, our people. We are continuing to refine and enhance these pillars as part of our 2.0 strategy. Our MAX order with Boeing is expected to provide assets that are 30% more efficient and at the same time monthly ownership costs on par with our used A320 aircraft. Our vast domestic network currently includes more than 610 routes and we serve 128 cities more cities in the US than nearly every carrier. And our network team has identified more than 1,400 incremental routes for us to expand our non-stop service to a runway of airline growth for many, many years to come. Opening, our Sunseeker Resort will enhance our ability to sell products outside of the tube of an air frame with our direct distribution channel and set the stage for unlocking our asset-light strategy around hotels. Always loyalty program enhances the value proposition we have with our guests, their ability to earn and burn points through multiple platforms and should further deepen our relationship with them. And increased investments in systems tools and infrastructure will better equip our team members, while arming them with the data to enhance our execution and drive further efficiencies. Each of these initiatives should meaningly improve our bottom line and our long-term earnings potential. And with that, we'll take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James. \nSavi Syth: Maybe if I can start off with on the revenue side kind of the outlook here in the third quarter. It seems like maybe unit revenue not as strong as what you thought it could be in the third quarter maybe a couple of months ago. I was just kind of curious if that was the case and what might be driving that?\nDrew Wells : Thanks Savi. I think that's generally a fair statement. We're certainly off the absolute ridiculous highs that we were seeing from a demand front. We're still quite elevated higher than what we've seen really through any of my 11.5 years. But off the highs a bit which I think you see reflected in the guide here.\nSavi Syth: Yeah. That makes sense. And just on the operations side, I was curious what are you expecting in terms of -- what has changed that's allowing kind of July to show this kind of positive improvement? And maybe as you kind of fill out the quarter the expectation to do maybe similar to July or better. Is there like are ATC issues getting resolved? Is there something different that's happening at Allegiant?\nGreg Anderson: Hey Savi, it's Greg. Why don't I take a stab at it first here? And I mean, one July we've seen steady improvements continue, not only in July but we would expect August and September to improve as well. Some of it's just capacity and rightsizing and making sure that we have that out there and that we can support that with our crews. Earlier in the year we saw some unplanned absences spike. We've seen that -- we've been able to better manage through that. Certainly to your point weather in June and ATC issues have been a drag on operations. And that's something we'll keep an eye on. I'd say, like in our stations and airports we've seen stabilization there. Our team Kenny Wilford and his team have gone out and there's been a couple of airports where we've had to change out service providers. And once we've done that and lessons learned we've seen vast improvements in those respective areas and turn times. But we know we struggled a bit and didn't meet expectations in the summer. We're getting better. One of the things I think that's worth mentioning again and we talk about it quite a bit is customer compensation. That's expensive and it's meant to make it sting on our side, but it also helps mitigate some of those operational disruptions and kind of help with the brand performance from our customers. So hopefully that helps answer the question Savi, but anything else?\nSavi Syth: That's it. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks for the time. Just on ancillaries, how high do you think they can go? I mean, you're getting a lot better at selling them. You're offering new products. What should I think about in terms of I don't know goals?\nDrew Wells: Sure. Helane, I think as we look out over the next few years Scott DeAngelo talked a little bit about some of the systems changes that we'll be implementing and putting in place particularly on the third-party side. There will also be some on the airlines. I think as we look out five years another $10 per passenger is totally reasonable. I'll look over at Scott DeAngelo too to make sure I'm not overselling his thoughts too, but something getting into the mid-$70s I think is completely feasible.\nScott DeAngelo: And I guess I would also throw in there as the product evolves over that same time frame in the next several years, Drew has brought up before Allegiant Extra which would be our kind of entree into Economy Premium with extra leg room, priority boarding et cetera as kind of a sub-bundle, right? There become different ways to merchandise and more in that case ancillary product to sell across the fleet overtime that could help get to that number that Drew pointed out.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I don't know John if you're willing to answer this question, because it's Sunseeker, but the numbers that you called out for forward I don't know if you call them forward bookings or advanced reservations how does that compare with your experience at your prior firms in terms of level of bookings this far away from actual date of the trek?\nJohn Redmond: They're good questions Helane. And in terms of how early we started to sell, no one starts selling that early. So when you take a -- like the last big MGM-type property that opened was Barrera [Ph] and they didn't even start selling until six months out. We elected to sell much further out because we were getting a lot of learnings out of that. And when you start talking to customers and starting to sell product we had all brand-new systems. We want to make sure we can shake them all out. So there's a multitude of reasons to start doing it on the transient side which is why we're having great success there. Group bookings those are wildly impressive because you can't even see what the product looks like. So when people are picking us versus someone else, the other properties they're looking at are going concerns. They may have stayed there in the past. They know exactly what they offer. They're selecting us without knowing anything. A lot of those selections are being based on the reputations all of us have. And in a lot of cases, they're touring a property by walking down the promenade and envisioning what's going to be there. So, we're ecstatic about these early learnings the early bookings, the group bookings. 31,300 room-nights, is off the charts. And of course, booking 5.6% of the total room inventory in 2024 already is amazing. But this just speaks volumes about the importance we've been talking about of having an email strategy and we've been developing that strategy for some period of time. There is no hotel that's ever opened in the world that had over four million emails not even half of that when it opened. So, stay tuned. These are things we've been talking about for some time that what we were going to do to make sure that this property was going to be wildly successful and we're starting to see those data points come to fruition.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s helpful, John. Thanks for the answers.\nJohn Redmond: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you so much. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead and ask your question.\nScott Group: Guys, I'm curious why do you think your RASM increases are lagging peers? And maybe just on the third quarter margin guidance, you said the airline is running a lot better. Fuel is coming down versus last quarter. Why are the implied margins lower in 3Q than 2Q?\nGreg Anderson: Hey, Scott. It's Greg. Why don't I start, and I think Drew will add some commentary on the revenue side. Just as you're aware we're 100% focused on leisure. And just historically, I think in 15 of the last 17 years. The third quarter is the kind of lowest performing quarter for us, because September and off-peak is just so drastic. And so that's a big element of why I think our ASMs sequentially, are meaningfully down second quarter to third. And then, maybe perhaps Drew can add color on the...\nDrew Wells: And taking it one step further, if you think about our ASM cadence, yes, the growth will be the smallest in July, which impacts the RASM cadence. But fuel will be the highest as we see it today in July, which had the most absolute ASM. So, they kind of work against one another there, as it pertains to a full quarter on both the RASM and the margin front. I think beyond that and maybe it impacted both 2Q and 3Q, as you think about unitized metrics, I think we're one of two carriers that both increased stage and gauge versus 2019, which is going to put some headwinds against the unitized metrics there. And I think it comes out to about three to four points in each quarter.\nScott Group: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just some early thoughts about 2023 in terms of capacity growth and what that may mean for CASM. Do you think it's going to be down next year versus this year? Things like that.\nGreg Anderson: Sure. Hey, Scott. It's Greg again here. As John mentioned and we're trying to get across here is that 2023, the focus is going to be on improving margins and we would expect 2023 margins to be better than 2022. As we talked about there's a lot of uncertainty out there as we kind of refine and get to a capacity plan for 2023. In addition, we have -- we're going to start taking aircraft for Boeing next year as well, which we'll have to have pilots available for that, which will help kind of cap that growth if you will. I would say, historically, it's been a 10% growth. That's what we typically target at Allegiant. We flex that up and down based on the environment. And what we're seeing today, again coupled with the Boeing taking delivery next year and extra pilots for that, I think 10% growth in 2023 would be the cap. You may see that come down from there. In terms of CASM ex, that's going to be dependent on capacity. We\u2019re also and as John mentioned, we're in active discussions with our pilots trying to drive a deal making progress there, in addition to our flight attendants. So there's some labor costs that will be associated in 2023 or potentially if we're able to drive a deal. We would expect 2023 though to also, again, as we mentioned the improvement in operations to drive out of the business those IROPs costs, which were meaningful and that should help on the margin side. I'm hesitant though just given all the uncertainties Scott to go in and give you a guide for kind of CASM ex. But I just -- I think hopefully, you could take away that we're focused on cost and doing the right things. But ultimately, we're going to drive margin.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you so much. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead and ask your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Sylvia calling in for Mike. So last quarter you talked about the pilot attrition rate a little bit and that it was elevated. And it's really encouraging to hear that you're partnering with various flight schools for new recruits. Could you talk a little bit about how the attrition trends looked in the second quarter? And do you think the attrition rate will remain elevated for the rest of the year? \nGreg Anderson: This is Greg again. I'm just going to kick it off but then we have Allen Thieman in the room who's our VP of Flight Crew Planning who's really close to this. But we're actively at the table. Our pilots are paid candidly as it is in the market, but we want to get their pay back up there. We're working on improving the level of service to our pilots and also better systems around scheduling. So we're making a lot of effort in that regard. And then with Allen he could give you more color on hiring and attrition. \nAllen Thieman: Sure. Happy to be here. So as we discussed during the last time we spoke covering Q1 to your point we did see pilot attrition spike in the first quarter with February in particular. Since that time we have actually seen a drop in monthly attrition. Last month July of 2022 was the lowest number that we have seen since before December of 2021. And so certainly positive news, but we are prepared for attrition to be choppy and it will certainly fluctuate, and probably closely align with legacy hiring patterns. That continues to be where most of our pilots are heading. And then just to kind of put some numbers around it, Scott during the last call provided the trailing 12-month attrition. That was at 123, May 2021 to April 2022. Today our trailing 12-month is only 132 pilots. So it is trending slightly up, but it is very much in line with our expectations. \nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That was really helpful. And then just another question regarding the PSP. So you said you were going to pay that back before the month-end. So does that free you from engaging in like buybacks or paying dividends or any other transactions that you weren't allowed to do? Does that free you earlier than previously outlined? \nJohn Redmond: No,I don't think the quid pro quo people should read into it any of those types of activities like dividends and buybacks. It was strictly something that we thought is the right thing to do. We're sitting on a very enviable position in terms of liquidity. And this is just something that we debated at length at our board, and we think it's the right thing to do. So we've been pretty much a thought leader throughout the pandemic and I think this just continues that approach where we're the first ones to do this. And we just want to get it behind us. We appreciated what happened, but I think companies when they no longer need the assistance should pay it off. So that's why we decided that. \nGreg Anderson: And John just for all airlines right those restrictions lift October 1 for the dividend and share repurchases irrespective of when you pay back the debt. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. Got it. Thank you. That was very helpful. Thank you very mych.\nGreg Anderson: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Daniel McKenzie of Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nDaniel McKenzie: It looks like flying is going to be up roughly 30% in the month of September just looking at the schedules data and please correct me on that. But based on what we know about July, the implied September TRASM does seem to be negative. But I'm just wondering how much of the revenue deceleration is something that's being intentionally engineered by the network planning team? And how much is a -- could it be a weaker consumer that you're anticipating later in the quarter? And then that's kind of one part. And then just why the unusual growth if that's correct in an off-peak month? And should we extrapolate those September trends into October and November? \nDrew Wells: Thanks, Dan. A lot here. Let me try to unpack that. So you are correct that there will be elevated September growth relative to the other months in particular. I'll point out though that utilization remains under five hours per aircraft per day. I mean it is a very lowly utilized month still. So more a function of some day of week, versus 2019. Labor Day moves a bit further back in the month. We capture more of the Labor Day traffic in the month of September. And believe it or not, given the low amount of flying that is meaningful from a growth perspective. I do not believe that September will be negative on the TRASM front. I'm not running away with an incredible TRASM at this point. So ideally there's some upside there. But I do not believe it will be negative.\nDaniel McKenzie: Okay. And I'm going to pass along a question that was actually asked to me by a long-only investor on the asset-light side of Sunseeker. So, for those that are taking a three-year outlook, what are you anticipating that revenue stream could look like? And then separately, just given the current trends of the hotel when do you expect to make a decision on the remaining 13 acres of undeveloped land? And then I guess just I'll throw one I'll squeeze one more in there. That $390 average room rate, I'm just curious what percent of the rooms booked are the larger suites. So just kind of a mix question related to that average room rate.\nJohn Redmond: I appreciate it, Dan. If I miss anything because I think there's like three or four questions there. But maybe the most recent will be easiest. The mix we're seeing right now between standard rooms and suites is about 84% standard rooms, 16% suites, so a lot of demand for the suite product which has been great. And keep in mind that we haven't posted an area to be able to fly into that market. So 70% of the reservations we're taking now are from local in-state which has been amazing and they're the people most aware of the project. So when we start getting bookings that are going to come through the Allegiant passengers when they book air that's when we'll start to I would imagine see that suite mix even pick up a little bit. Asset-light, one of the absolute critical factors to that is having an email database. So not only does that serve us well, obviously for opening up a new property, but for taking on other opportunities is critical. When you look at picking the other management company out there, I don't care whether it's Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt or whoever, they don't let you use their database to market a property when you sign them up. So that's a big differentiating factor for us moving into that asset-light space that anyone whose property we choose to manage we'll be able to -- we will allow them to use our database to be able to market to fill that hotel. And then in terms of the Phase three as we call it which would be effectively doubling the size of the resort we haven't made any decisions on timing there. Clearly, we would not start a project that in essence copied or followed the same blueprint as Phase one and two did, until we saw that the results are there the strength is there the demand is there for the product before we'd ever recommend to the board that we would want to start a project like that. And of course, there's always the opportunities to do anything with that property. I mean we've had inquiries from a multitude of different types of developers. So those of course are always possibilities down the road. So I think by the time, we ever make a decision on that, it would be at the end of this year or early into '23 before we decide when to start something or what to do with it.\nDaniel McKenzie: Okay. Thanks for the time guys.\nJohn Redmond: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, so much. And we don't have any more questions. I would now like to turn the conference back to John Redmond for closing remarks.\nJohn Redmond: Well, in closing, we appreciate everyone's time. We're glad we were able to be responsive to everyone's questions. And stay tuned for...\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

My name is John, I\u2019ll be the operator for today' call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Latter, we will conduct un-see question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Sherry Wilson.\nSherry Wilson : Thank you, John. Welcome to the Allegiant Travel Company\u2019s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Maury Gallagher, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Redmond, the company's President and incoming Chief Executive Officer; Greg Anderson, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Scott Sheldon, our EVP and Chief Operating Officer; Scott DeAngelo, our EVP and Chief Marketing Officer; Drew Wells, our SVP of Revenue and Planning; and a handful of others to help answer questions.

With that, I'll turn it over to John Redmond.\nJohn Redmond : Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Our dedicated and passionate team members are the reason for the stellar results and industry-leading margins we are reporting today. To come out of the throes of Omicron, 600 weather cancellations out of 1,800 total cancellations, ATC issues and high fuel and still produce a 10.7% and 1.4% EBITDA and operating margins, respectively, is rather amazing. This spring was the busiest and best spring in the company's history, and this incredible demand continued into April and chose no end. Very strong load factors, especially March at 87%, helped offset the run-up in fuel prices and those high load factors are now expected to continue through the year. Again, I can only say thank you very much to each and every team member. Our priority for the rest of the year is operational integrity. It is paramount, not only for our guests, but our employees, our long-term vision and our brand. Our business model and DNA have always been to match capacity with demand and fuel prices. We have shown over the years, no one in the industry is better at it. Our Q2 guidance reflects this imperative adjusting our capacity to up roughly 12% year over 3 year and total operating revenue increase of roughly 30% year over 3 years. 2022 is a foundational year for our company. Significant investments are being made in various initiatives, including IT, that will set us up well into the future and drive focus to where it matters most, continuing to differentiate our business model, improve the customer experience and interaction with Allegiant and, of course, drive more revenue streams. Strategic initiatives don't happen overnight, but the benefits can be transformational. Always Allegiant World MasterCard was an initiative that launched in 2016 and is really starting to hit its stride helping to drive total average fare. The cash benefit of the card was $53 million in 2021. We have roughly 320,000 cardholders to date, which will further accelerate in the out years given our partnerships, relationships and resorts. Our credit card, along with our Always Rewards program are intended to increase share of wallet through greater interaction with the Allegiant Travel portfolio. Our joint venture with Viva Aerobus is a piece of that foundation that is being laid this year. But for that relationship and other IT initiatives, we would be years off entering the Mexican leisure market and the financial benefits would not have been the same as our joint venture. Sunseeker, of course, started in 2017 and after a pandemic interruption will be completed over the next year. That project in turn, will lead to further asset-light opportunities. We have our work cut out, but our team members are up to the challenge. All of these initiatives will set the foundation for Allegiant 2.0, even with all the foundation work being done, we should still end the year with total liquidity in the neighborhood of $1.1 billion. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott Sheldon.\nScott Sheldon: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the first quarter themes, I'd first like to thank you from this management team and to all of our customers, team members and partners through out the network. This continues to be an incredibly unpredictable time and we were certainly not immune to the impact Omicron had on our operations in late December and the residual impact for most of the first quarter. We had claims position, crudes position. The planning team did an outstanding job aligning peak holiday capacity with our internal capabilities. And unfortunately, over a 30-day period starting December 20, we canceled nearly 1,000 flights or over 12% of our schedule. We went from having 20 folks offline due to COVID over 400 in a 10-day span. Perhaps more importantly, was the longer-term impact on our frontline training pipelines and the training needs to train and deploy team members throughout the network to meet future scheduling needs. Before I get into pilots, which is clearly dominating the headlines these days, I want to take a minute to talk about operational trends. Historically, we prided ourselves on leading the industry in a controllable completion factor and targeting high 70% on-time performance. Unfortunately, we're falling short of these targets in this current environment, some reasons being self-inflicted, some being very much out of our control. Looking back at full year '21, we led the industry in being the only carrier to exceed 2019 capacity levels, which drove an incredible 17% adjusted EBITDA margin. We are best positioned to take advantage of the leisure recovery cycle. We made a conscious decision to keep as wide as a selling net as possible, but it did come at a cost that's reflected as us being lasting completion and on-time performance. Clearly, we have lots of work to do. Fast forward to today, our network is simply much more complex than this first than it was in first quarter of '19. Year-over 3-year departures are up 13% on crime-based growth and aircraft growth of approximately 50% and 40%, respectively. During the quarter, we opened two new bases Appleton and Influent [ph] which brings our total to 23 up from 15 in 2019. We plan on opening our 24th base in Provo this fall and pre-pandemic environment, many of these attributes that give us operational and commercial advantages in these small markets or headwinds today, small bases, which are loosely defined as 5 aircraft or less are highly dependent on a certain level of labor stability and are more or less relied upon to operating stand-alone entities. There's a high degree of focus on dispatch reliability and labor consistency, particularly our flight crews. Without labor consistency, we will be challenged to drive substantial improvements in performance, which is undoubtedly our key focus as we move into summer. Moving on to pilots, pilot staffing and pilot nutrition. We are seeing some of the same themes as our industry peers with perhaps a slight difference. We continue to be successful in bringing on quality applicants. Since July of last year, we've hired over 200 pilots through April, and our May and June classes are already filled to target levels. That would bring our total hiring levels to nearly 250 pilots, which was just short of our projected 270 target need for summer flying 2022. Attrition levels on the other hand, are elevated above historical norms and have impacted our first officer ranks the hardest. Year-to-date, we've lost 8 crew members to other carriers, primarily to legacy carriers and 123 total since May of last year. And the last thing I'd like to touch on is our efforts to ratify a new contract with our pilots. It's our number one focus, and it's critical to stabilizing our current workforce and to meet the demands of the airline as we look into 2023. Given the attrition trends we were seeing in mid fourth quarter of last year, we made a substantial effort to expedite the framework of a new deal. Since January, we passed four comprehensive proposals that touch on everything from rates, rate guarantees, retirement, scheduling, work rules, quality of life enhancements and investments in virtually every stock crew members interface with daily. It's an unusual approach for sure and is no way meant to short change the process as our pilots are critical to the success of this company, and we hope to have something positive to report in the near future. In closing, I'd just like to thank our team members and partners. Once again, your patience and preserverance in this environment has been tremendous, and we are here to support your efforts to help make this the premier leisure brand in the travel space. We've always prided ourselves on being ultra flexible and taking calculated risks. This year will be no different, and I know we'll take some lumps. That being said, we feel we struck the right balance to drive operational performance while maximizing earnings potential, and we look forward to a successful summer. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott Dean.\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, Scott. On the commercial side, first quarter saw historic highs for Allegiant in terms of build web traffic to allegiant.com and passenger segments booked total visitors to our website were up by more than 25% in the quarter versus 2019, with repeat visitors being up by more than 10% and first-time visitors being up by more than 50%. Most notably, visitors coming to allegiant.com did so by directly entering the URL or by using our mobile app. Users coming that way were up by more than 80%. This speaks to the ever-increasing awareness levels for our brand. More people know about us, and they're coming directly to us at allegiant.com. The number of passenger segments booked in Q1 was 35% more than in 2019, and we achieved our highest ever trailing 7-day moving average in passenger segments book on two separate occasions in the quarter. Moreover, this demand for leisure travel shows no sign of slowing down, as the number of visitors who came to our website in March to conduct flight searches for travel in April through November was up by 150% to 250% compared to 2019 levels for the majority of weeks in that travel time period. And while bookings from customers of all ages showed increases on a year-over 3-year basis, most in the 15% to 20% range, customers 65 years and older showed dramatic booking increases at more than 60% above 2019 levels. This is great news that this age group represents our most frequent travelers, many flying between a primary residence and the vacation home. In addition, as we saw in the past two quarters, third-party revenue growth continued to outpace passenger and passenger revenue growth exceeding 2019 levels by more than 30%. This continues to be driven by our Allegiant 2.0 approach of enhancing our web and app experience to make it easy for our customers to buy more of their leisure travel needs from us and by enhancing the breadth of our leisure travel offerings at allegiant.com. That said, the always Allegiant World MasterCard was once again the prominent driver, having its strongest three months ever in terms of new card sign-ups, average spend on the card and total compensation to Allegiant. Each month of the first quarter successively set the record for new card sign-ups. For the quarter, new card sign-ups were up by nearly 100% and compensation to Allegiant was up just over 130% versus 2019. In closing, the historic high demand we saw in the first quarter for capacity levels at higher than both 2021 and 2019 appears to be structural, not simply fleeting pinup demand or revenge travel, at least for the foreseeable future. It's broad-based across all the markets we serve for all upcoming travel periods we're selling into, and it's coming from both repeat customer growth, which we believe speaks to the effectiveness of our loyalty programs and first-time customers, which we believe speaks to the growing awareness of and preference for our Allegiant brand of low fare and all non-stop travel. And with that, I'll turn it over to Drew.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. The cadence of revenue performance since the midpoint of the first quarter has been the best I've ever seen. We have been TRASM [ph] positive for eight consecutive weeks with line of sight to many more against comparable 2019 weeks. The first quarter finished with total revenue 10.7% ahead of 2019, on system ASMs of plus 18.2%. Better-than-expected close-in bookings, Superior Always Allegiant World MasterCard performance, as well as an extraordinarily robust March Madness fixed fee program drove us above the guided range. The month of March was the mic drop month we have waited over 2 years for now. Despite growing ASMs by over 14% in the month, our boarded load factor of 86.5% and TRASM $0.1286 [ph] both exceeded March 2019. The incredible March madness resulted in the best 1Q fixed fee revenue total in company history and the third best month. The $500 million in total revenue for the quarter was the first time we've exceeded that milestone. Our REV and loyalty teams have continued to drive immense ancillary success, which in turn make the load factor performance significantly more powerful. The $68 per passenger represents a 17% increase over first quarter 2019 and the second best quarter in company history, trailing just 4Q '21. As excited as I am about March's performance, the second quarter looks even better. We are guiding total revenue growth of plus 28% to plus 32% over second quarter 2019 on scheduled service ASMs of plus 10% to plus 14% and system ASMs of plus 9% to plus 13%. This implies a double-digit PRASM growth on double-digit ASM growth and total revenue in excess of $600 million. April continued march of success and posted a load factor beat of over 4 points versus 2019. And as I mentioned, all weeks were TRASM positive. We haven't finalized everything, but I expect the months TRASM and plus mid-teens. While we are seeing solid performance in the off-peak weeks, the peak periods are where the real upside is on display, and I expect June to have the best year over 3-year performance in the quarter. While I mentioned TRASM extensively, I want to point out that the metric is an output and not the end goal. Our team is focused on maximizing total profitability to our network and pricing decisions. In 2021, we began service to 10 new cities plus one more in March 22. Those airports range from smaller like Key West and Amarillo to larger like Doles in Minneapolis. This Silver's network will still have roughly 13% of ASMs coming from routes in the first 12 months of operations, and we've already had some incredible successes in these new ads. But we prepare our network strategy so that markets can mature over several years. Put differently, we've been planting seeds for the future. And we expect our future network strategy to look like this indefinitely with a broad mix of city sizes and destination profiles that fit our strategy and that we can expand upon. Lastly, after a test, we started in 2019, we are happy to announce that we will roll out our Allegiant Extra product across most of the fleet. While both the results and customer feedback of the product have been compelling throughout the test, the pandemic put a bit of a pause in the decision process. We have been further encouraged by even stronger results over the last 6 months and will now take all inducted as Airbus A320s and the 180-seat Allegiant extra configuration starting in the fourth quarter of this year. Additionally, all new Boeing aircraft will deliver in an Allegiant extra layout. Remember, our layout primarily involves the removal and re-pitching of rows and nothing structural, enabling a relatively easy return to maximum seat count should that be desired. Customers enjoy legroom advantages, complementary priority boarding and drink on board as well as reserved overhead bin space. This should drive an air ancillary boost into 2023 as the fleet grows. And with that, I'd like to pass it over to Greg.\nGreg Anderson: Drew, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter, we reported a net loss of $7.9 million. These results can be characterized by the tale of two halves. The first half of our flying for the quarter was not profitable, primarily due to the impacts of Omicron. We recorded an operating margin of negative 18% and net loss of $44 million for the month of January and February. However, the second half of our flying during the quarter was very profitable, as evidenced by an operating margin north of 21% and net income of $36 million for the month of March. This despite paying $3.46 per gallon of fuel, an increase of 40% from January. The revenue team came through as TRASM accelerated during the quarter, closing just under $0.13 for the month of March, gaining first quarter TRASM of $10.78. Excluding fuel, our unitized costs for the quarter were $7.012, and we are seeing deceleration into the second quarter. Costs were pressured during the first quarter by the $16 million in customer compensation relating to IROPs. Primarily, that was due to Omicron and $7 million for the special recognition bonus for our team members. Normally, our first quarter results would not trigger profit sharing. However, given these extraordinary circumstances in both the airline sector and the broader macroeconomic environment, our Board was pleased to guarantee our team members a recognition bonus for 2022. We have the best team in the business and our sincere thanks to each of you. Excluding this recognition bonus accrual and our IROPs customer compensation, our CASM mix would have been down or was down 0.5% compared to the first quarter of 2019. The robust demand environment and strength in sales drove a sequential increase in our ATL of $150 million, nearly 50% higher from the fourth quarter. Our strong liquidity of $1.2 billion is more than two times our ATL and 60% of 2019's revenue. Our debt balances remained flat sequentially at approximately $550 million and well below pre-pandemic levels. Turning towards the second quarter. Our guidance issued today suggests an operating margin north of 12% for the second quarter on ASM capacity growth of 12%, that's year over 3%. This guidance also assumes an average of $4 per gallon of fuel. In February, we actioned trimming our planned capacity in the second quarter by roughly 10 percentage points. And as messaged back then, these reductions were primarily driven by staffing challenges and the volatility around rising fuel costs given the uncertain geopolitical pressures. This capacity reduction does add some headwind to our unit cost as we expect second quarter CASM ex to be up 14% year over 3. This increase is primarily related to inflationary pressures and productivity. We've talked at length around inflationary costs on prior calls that I thought I'd touch briefly on productivity. To help frame this, we expect to place into service 3 aircraft this quarter, bringing our total fleet count to 115 by June 10. Based on our capacity guide, we expect the average ASMs produced per aircraft during the second quarter to be $46 million. This is 12% less production than the average aircraft during the same period in 2019, which we estimate is approximately 30% [ph] headwind to our CASM ex. While this reduced production puts pressure on our unit cost, there is a benefit to the other side of the profitability equation by driving higher yields and higher unit revenue. As Drew indicated, demand is on fire and current bookings suggest total revenue for the second quarter to be up approximately 30% and TRASM up nearly 20% as compared to the same period in 2019, which I believe segues well into our Allegiant Extra announcement. While reducing the number of seats may not fully optimize unit costs, our data suggests this initiative will be meaningfully accretive to our bottom line as we are a margin-focused company. And what gives us an advantage of driving higher margins is our unique ability to align capacity with demand given our low fixed, high variable cost structure. Regardless of the macro environment, where the high fuel, low fuel, a weak economy are a strong one, we have a proven track record of always outperforming over the long run with flexibility to bring stability. And speaking of flexibility that the hallmark around our fleet, given supply chain disruptions and MRO delays, we're going to give ourselves a little more breathing room by slowing the induction of 3 aircraft in '22, pushing them into early '23. As a result, we now expect to end the year with 124 aircraft compared to our initial plan to end with 127. Pushing these 3 aircraft in 23 should not impact our second half capacity expectations. And turning to reinvestments in the business. Our full year '22 airline CapEx guide remains unchanged. That's $260 million in aircraft CapEx. This is inclusive of our predelivery deposits, $100 million to $90 million in other and heavy maintenance CapEx, respectively. And in closing, we continue to make meaningful progress on our major strategic items and incorporating Boeing aircraft coming online in mid-2023. These aircraft are 30% more fuel efficient as measured by ASMs per gallon, our partnership with Viva Aerobus, and that's expecting - we're expecting to go on sale later this year, opening our Sunseeker Resort and approximately a year from now, the increased investments in our systems, tools and infrastructure to better support our long-term growth plans to drive higher revenue and combat costs and progress with our partner, Schneider Electric on our ESG initiatives with the intention of publishing our inaugural sustainability report later this year. And with that said, it is my privilege to turn the call over to Maury Gallagher. And Maury, on behalf of the team, we want to thank you for your mentorship, guidance and leadership over these many years. You are legend.\nMaury Gallagher : Well, how do you follow that? Thank you, Greg. You've gotten a good overview from these very astute managers in the last few minutes. And as you can see, we're making very good progress on our way back to normalcy, preparing in particular for our peak flying this coming summer. And as you can see, I'm last to speak, and I suggested that should be the case because this is my last conference call. I've done 61 of these calls before to date, talking about Allegiant our journey, our exploits and our successes over the past 15 years. Deep breath. We have talked about Allegiant 2.0 numbers of times, our efforts to drive additional revenues from our current customer base, and we are the only carrier I'm aware of that talks directly to all of its customers. And to that end, we have almost 15 million e-mail addresses available to us to do that communication. And while increasing unit revenues from our then customers wallets was important strategically, we wanted to further enhance our brand, particularly in the last few years. And what was the best way to increase the awareness of Allegiant with the traveling leisure-oriented public, front and center in this effort was our partnering with the Las Vegas Raiders and the stadium naming rights. And in that process in the past 24 months, having our name on what has now become Allegiant stadium has done more to increase our brand with the traveling public nationwide than we were able to accomplish in my opinion, in the first 20 years. But just as important, these naming rights have provided us with credibility. I've heard the following statement a number of times from different people that I've talked to, wow, you own a premier football stadium in the world's greatest leisure destination, and you must be a great company. Well, clearly, we don't own the stadium. It'd be nice, but we don't own it. But we are receiving a benefit of this affiliation and in a substantially increase people's belief in us as a company that is reliable and worth trusting. Our second major trophy property will be our Sunseeker Resort due to open early next year. This has been one of the more ambitious undertakings during my time here. And there has been a great deal of pushback from many of you on the phone call today. But I'm going to make a forecast, unlike any time before, Suntakeris going to be a huge success. You can say you heard it here first. John Redmond is one of the few people in the world who could have pulled this off, including finding location, designing the building and recruiting this world-class management team that we're now assembling. And I've had the privilege of knowing John for 20 years and an even bigger privilege, larger privilege of working closely with him in the past 5.5 years. And when he joined management in 2016, neither of us understood what he might recommend, and I specifically asked him to enhance our third-party revenues, particularly hotels, given this background. But once gone located the 23-acre waterfront property in Port Charlotte, Florida, and laid out his vision and plan, I became a believer. In the coming months, you will hear about John's efforts to develop our asset-light approach. There are a number of substantial irons in the fire that will leverage our Sunseeker effort and the management talent that we have put together - John has put together. And there are some early returns on Sunseeker that we would like to share with you today, preliminary bookings and interest, and I'm going to ask John to give us some of those numbers. John?\nJohn Redmond: Thank you, Maury. These are rather amazing to say the least. But currently, we have 1.4 million e-mails in the Sunseeker database, and we're targeting 2.5 million by year-end. Now to put that in perspective, the 3,500-room new property on the Strip resorts world after 9 months of being open had 200,000 e-mails. So we're headed in the right direction. This has been a big focus of us to have a lot of e-mails. We've also booked 226 transient reservations totaling 610 room nights to date at an ADR of $380. We modeled ADR at 255. We went on sale mid-February selling into May of 2023. The reservations were made by individuals from 27 different states, shows the breadth of our e-mail database amazing. We've also booked 17 groups totaling 21,500 room nights. The total contracted rooms, food and beverage revenue is roughly $8.3 million. The March 2022 year-to-date Southwest Florida transient ADR as provided by STR Smith Travel Research for the market set, which are 25 hotels in Southwest Florida was $638, up 38% over the same period last year for the comp set, which is a 10 hotel grouping that we track in Southwest Florida, the transient ADR was up - was $644 and up 29% over the same period last year. For the year 2021 full year, the Southwest Florida transient ADR, again, as provided by STR Smith Travel Research for the market set was $411 and the transient ADR for the comp set was $457. Again, incredibly impressive to see what's going on in Florida. I'll turn it back over to you, Maury.\nMaury Gallagher: Thanks, John. This is going to be an amazing additive trophy property to us and it may not equal quite what the stadium has done for us, but it's going to be high in those ranks. So pushing our brand out there and bringing more awareness of the leisure traveling public to Allegiant as we go forward. I've spent 40 years in this industry, and this word different has been my operative word that I've fallen to all the time. And I've learned over the years, we needed to differentiate ourselves from the other 10 carriers in this industry that we knock heads with. Currently, operating a safe quality airline is a critical component of this success, but a focus on the customer has been just as critical. And I believe we've done this better than any other carrier since our beginning in the early 2000s. And going forward, Allegiant is extremely well positioned to continue to differentiate itself, not the least of what you just heard from John, from competitors and generate incremental revenue so important to our profitability. In closing, I'm an airline person at heart. The airline has been the driver of our success over the years, and it will continue to do that in the coming years. In the next 5 to 8 years, we should double our size and be able to service in excess of 30 million customers with our airline network as we grow our way to 200 aircraft. The airline is a catalyst that will drive these incremental revenues so important for our industry-leading success. In 2006, we named the company Allegiant Travel for a reason. While we operate an airline, we are first and foremost a travel company focused on providing our leisure customers with a quality experience, both in the air and soon to be on the ground. Now we'll not be leaving the company, but rather working to support the management team in the coming months in our efforts to finalize the deal with the pilots. I will be working with Andrew Robles, the President of our local here and other efforts in Washington, D.C. as we work towards a solution to the pilot supply problem. But I will be moving to the background and that's as it should be. I will continue to be on the board and certainly one of the premier shareholders as far as I'm concerned. Lastly, I want to thank all of our team members who have been the backbone of this successful effort for the past 20 years. Nothing has given me more pleasure in watching the young people who have joined Allegiant over the years, find their sea legs become knowledgeable in the fields and begin their future with this great company. And a fitting statement in being a history major, by choice in many years ago. I have called upon Mr. General Douglas McArthurs famous speech to Congress in April of 51 about his retirement. And as he said, clothe refrain of one of the most popular Barrick ballots for can most proudly, old soldiers never die. They just stayed away - and so I. Thank you.\nSherry Wilson: And with that, we'll turn it over for questions. Sherry?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Savanthi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good afternoon. And congrats, Maury. I agree with Greg that you are legend, still looking forward to your contributions - continued contributions to Allegiant and the industry here.\nMaury Gallagher: Thanks.\nSavanthi Syth: Thanks, Maury. Just if I might, on the capacity front, given this outlook, assuming much doesn't change in the side of demand or fuel. I was curious what this means for maybe 2022 capacity. And if there's an adjustment here, should you 2023 grow from here? Or do you kind of catch up on utilization and catch up on some of the growth in 2023?\nDrew Wells: Sure, Drew here. I'll start with this one. I think for full year '22, we're still looking at growth around that 20% number. I say that as Brent crossed 110 again today. So I would expect there potentially be some revision in the back half of the year if this maintains. But I still feel good about that number in general, an some runaway there. As you think about '23, I think we're moving back toward that long-term measured type of approach of roughly 10%. Again, that assumes that fuel doesn't run away, demand stay elevated, et cetera, et cetera. But I really like where we're going and in terms of getting back to that measured approach. And some of it will probably come from utilization sure.\nSavanthi Syth: Makes sense. And then just can you talk about - I know some of it - and I wonder if some of the capacity constraints are related to what you're seeing in Florida and your operational impact there, how much of it is kind of driven by Allegiant internal kind of supply issues versus kind of external partner issues or even the ATC issues in Florida?\nDrew Wells: Sure. A lot there, taking probably at a high level to diving in dramatically. If you think about what we did for this summer, just a little bit over half of our cuts did come in Florida, though certainly sort of the ATC and flow environment there did have an impact on our decision. I think for any peak period going forward, we're going to run utilization basically as hard as the first constraint we come up against whether it's labor, whether it's aircraft, whatever it is, demand in peak periods has always been there such that we should operate to the limit we feel comfortable with the company. Off-peak will always be driven by either the demand environment or fuel and the resulting profitability. So that's kind of a little bit of both, depending on which time frame we're talking about.\nSavanthi Syth: That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon. Yes, echoing Savi's words, definitely legend Maury, you will be missed, but knowing that you're going to remain one of the largest shareholders, if not the largest, gives us good comfort. Onto my questions here. I guess this would be to Greg with respect to the - excuse me, 737 MAX deliveries. We hear from other carriers that have airplanes coming this year that aircraft continue to get put back - or excuse me, delayed because of some of the manufacturing issues that - or bottlenecks that Boeing is facing, whether it's supply chain labor, getting raw materials, et cetera. When you think about 2023, are you starting to sort of rethink the 10 aircraft coming in? Is it more of a 2024 phenomenon? And I have sort of a related question on overall economics of those airplanes? Thanks.\nGreg Anderson: Mike, it's Greg. Why don't I kick it off and turn it over to [indiscernible] Yeah, where we sit today, we're still planning and expecting to take Boeing the MAX aircraft in the back half of 2023. What we're thinking about right now is the split between the 8200s and the dash 7s. So we're evaluating that. Candidly, we may look to take the 8200s first. That would be a little easier for us in terms of getting it through on the spec and through for our maintenance and the team members to get it kind of up and running, then you can leverage that work on dash 7. But I want to turn it over to BJ to give you some additional color.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Yes, Mike, I guess I'd just say that we're still over a year away from the first scheduled delivery now. So we aren't hearing anything out of Boeing about potential delays. We are hearing some of that same chatter that you mentioned about their current situation. But I guess I would just point to the fact that these airplanes are coming in pretty late in the year. And so we didn't have a lot of capacity planned on those airplanes in 2023 to start with. So I think we all feel pretty good about that and look at Andrew here, but yes, we're okay.\nDrew Wells: Yes. I mean we just put our winter '22 capacity out there we're going to have time to think about '23.\nMike Linenberg: Good. And then just on the economics on the airplane, we go back to late last year, early this year, the view was that the 7s, you were looking at something on the order of like $7 million of EBITDA per aircraft, and I think the 8 were closer to like $10 million. And yet we've just seen this significant surge in inflation, not just fuel, but we're dealing with labor and other like things coming in a lot higher than what anybody expected, including the Fed, right? And I'm curious where you are as you think about that $7 million to $10 million for each airplane? Or is it the view that, that's going to find its way into the fare structure and the $7 million and $10 million are still pretty good numbers to sort of use when we think about overall profitability.\nGreg Anderson: Mike, no, it's a great question. It's Greg. Why don't I kick it off, and I'm sure others would like to add some commentary on that. Certainly, the rise in fuel is something to keep an eye on, and it's great that these MAX aircraft there on a block hour - I'm sorry, on a gallon basis, ASMs per gallon on an efficiency basis for fuel. They're about 30% more fuel efficient. So that obviously will be helpful for us in terms of combating the higher fuel cost. What I would say is we think that certainly on like-for-like utilization, we will outperform or out earn with the Boeing aircraft because we have a third of our network that's going to support those aircraft, and we have a 20% improvement on operating costs. So it certainly should help us continue to drive back to that industry-leading EBITDA per aircraft that we had in 2019. But there's other areas in the business. We're constantly looking at combating the inflationary pressures that you mentioned. We're doing that through systems. John talked about transformational systems. We'll see that from the back end where we can scale up more on the management side through SAP or track or with productivity, as Scott mentioned, on the - on getting a new system for our pilots and crew members, NapBlue, that should help us with scheduling and improve on productivity from that side of the house. You have also - you have our - John mentioned our Viva partnership, right, where we think there's some accretion there, assuming that gets approved through ATI. So as Maury and John have said, we're looking at growing combating our cost but also growing on the revenue side. And there's a lot of irons in the fire that we think will help us and restore and get back to that EBITDA per aircraft. And Drew, I don't know if you want to talk about the fare environment to Mike \nDrew Wells: My view looking forward is that there is a structural change in the demand environment, one that will produce a higher level of demand for quite a while that you saw in 2019. I do think that the summer of '22 is probably the pinnacle it may retrieve a little bit. But the structural change in how I think people view travel, view experiencing life has changed such that there will be a persistent upward pressure on the overall demand, whether it's fair, whether it's loans for the foreseeable future. So I do think we'll recapture some through that avenue as well.\nMike Linenberg: Great.\nMaury Gallagher: The point, Michael, is we're going to buy these airplanes. And so the balance sheet will come into effect and our ownership costs are just not going to be that much higher than we would spend for a normal 186-seat Airbus. But you get all the benefits of fuel burn and things like that. So that's going to help us offset a lot of pressure on the cost side. And they're just very exceptional airplanes. If you can manage in the proper way in a sense of ownership and be in for the long haul.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. Maury, your timing, and obviously, the Greg and the team, when you bought those airplanes, it could have been more perfect and even things like the benefits of tax depreciation, and it's just a lot of things that are going to help you in ownership that I think people don't fully appreciate, but...\nMaury Gallagher: Well, I'll tell you one other thing, Michael, that really helped us is, candidly, if you make a lot of money in any business, particularly this business, you've got a partner in downturns, it's called the federal government and you get all that money back. And a lot of that's sitting on our balance sheet that we paid it in taxes over the years when we made so much money.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. No, no very good. One of the few that can make that claim.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon. And Maury, very politic in to a long run here. So thank you for that. I guess, guys, can you talk to the pilot issues that you're speaking to in the prepared remarks. I think you mentioned attrition levels at the end of the year. Has that gotten worse? Or have you been able to solve for that? And what's the long-term solution here?\nScott Sheldon: This is Scott. Yes, you started to see sort of a trickle May of last year. There was a pretty bad month, I want to say, it was October. November and December settled down. I think there was a quiet period when you look at what was going on with Omicron for December, January. And I sort of view it as sort of pent up where you had back-to-back months of 20-plus pilot attrition months. But that seems to have come down a little bit. Longer term, obviously, the contract is critical to getting something competitive out in our pilot hand, something that reflects industry standard at worst. We think we have some interesting and unique concepts that will keep these guys more in a more competitive foothold as other carriers start to solidify their contracts. I think everyone has a minimal contracts with the exception of Spirit and Frontier right now. So it's going to be a moving target, but we feel if we can keep sort of the economics to the sidelines and just know that you're going to be paid a reasonable rate. We think that's sort of the mousetrap that we have to offer, which is out and back. It's a simple system, single day trips. Just the quality of life aspect is much more desirable than what other carriers have to offer. And then there's a traditional stuff like partner with flight schools and the like, but first and foremost, we got to get a contract in place.\nMaury Gallagher: Let me also comment, Brandon. One of my jobs post the job is going to be working closely with the leader of the - our IBT group and working to see we can move this thing along and get ourselves in a good position sooner rather than later some of these things. We're on our second contract, if you will, and language typically in first contracts is clumsy and needs to be revised, and we've got a commitment on the other side to make things work. And it will take some time, but hopefully, we'll have some answers here in the not-too-distant future.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate the response from both of you. And I guess, Greg, as you think longer term about unit cost and not just specific to the pilots, but inflation is real here. Does this change the trajectory for the company?\nGreg Anderson: Brandon, thinking longer term, what I would say kind of echoing some of the comments I was making before. But we, of course, right now where we said we are investing in our organization. And as Maury used the term grow, come up underneath it. And so we have an infrastructure that's larger right now. We're going to grow and come up underneath it. And I mentioned that because the goal there, as John mentioned in his opening remarks, as operational integrity and so getting back and getting - driving IROPs out of the business, that's certainly going to help on the cost side. Productivity, as I mentioned, whether that's the utilization on the aircraft, but pilot productivity, crew productivity will be helpful. We talked about the systems marketing. I think it's another one we don't - I didn't mention earlier, but we had some investments, as Maury mentioned in the stadium, that Scott Angel and his team put together also with Live Nation. Brandon, as we grow, the ASM, if you will, CASM ex will come down relatively speaking, on those items because those costs are fixed. And so you kind of combat it from that perspective. Viva, that's another example where we're working closely with Viva and their team is combating costs and where we can find synergies working together on the cost front. We're spending some time there. So we think that, too, will help. So all in all, I mean, yes, there's an absolute pressure on the cost side. But we are - we're a margin-focused company. We talk a lot about MASM [ph] here, and there's two sides to the equation. So we'll continue to focus on that, but we'll make sure that we keep a low fixed, high variable cost structure, so we can continue to outperform.\nBrandon Oglenski: MASM. I love a new acronym. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Catherine O\u2019Brien from Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo everyone else's comments, Maury. It's been a pleasure working with you over the years and congratulations, Sean, on moving into the new role. So I want to come back and talk about revenue a little bit. Your revenue outlook like many of your peers is incredibly strong for the second quarter. But you don't have the same exposure to some of the business or longer-haul international recovery that's really in its early stages that some of them do. So is this strength it's just really good old-fashioned pent-up leisure demand outstripping supply and passengers is willing to pay higher fares? Or are there also some maybe some positive competitive developments where less overall domestic supply is being pointed at leisure destinations, excuse me, than it was over the last year or two? Or I know your third-party ones outstrip - is it just non-fair initiatives also taking that extra mile next quarter? I know that's quite a few questions in one. But just trying to get a sense of where you're seeing the most strength come from as we head into next quarter? Thanks.\nMaury Gallagher: Sure. I think the simplest answer to that is just yes. I mean, all of the above are certainly influencing and putting upward structure on what we're accomplishing here. I think first and foremost, we've had U.S. domestic leisure travel this entire time. The demand pool is larger for that than it ever has been and being as well positioned as we are to take advantage. We're seeing the benefits of that. We'll see some in far in first quarter. Our average fare per passenger was slightly higher than it was in 1Q '19. We're starting to expand on load factors, which I think is a direct result of just that larger pool. But I think you alluded to it a little bit with the return of business internationally. I think focus around the industry is going to start to shift a little bit away from simply the leader traveler here domestically and trying to recover elsewhere that will open up more kind of more leisure field for us. So I may have lost over some things there. But suffice it to say, all of those things are true, but really is just overall core strength of the leisure demand and where we're positioned right now.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: That's great. Thanks. And then maybe one for Greg. So your net debt is lower than it was for content really strong liquidity position. I know that you in the industry are barred from shareholder returns until later this fall. But do you think reinstating your dividend is on the table over the short to medium term? Or do they be like a little bit of incremental Sunseeker CapEx you're seeing or the MAX order, just change the calculus of how you're thinking about deploying capital going forward? Thanks so much for the time.\nJohn Redmond: Thank you, Caty. This is John. When you look at the history, the company history of returning capital to shareholders, I think it's not a bad proxy to look at when you're looking at what company's future actions may be, but has not been a conversation we've had yet as a Board on whether or not Q4 this year or some future quarters the right quarter to start that. So that's probably the best way to look at it. But as you know, we have a history of paying dividends and buying back stock. So as I said, that's a good proxy for future activity that we would consider.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: That's great. Thanks so much, John.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, everyone. Maury, I will sign on to the petition granting you legend status, so thanks for everything you've done for us. A couple of questions here, maybe a little bit bigger picture. I think one of the big debates over the last several weeks has been the point of demand destruction. And I think one of the debates in the space is whether that point is closer for a ULCC airline because the customer may be more price sensitive? Or if it is further away because the fare itself is lower. How would you answer that question? And again, are you seeing that point at this point? And kind of do you think it's closer or further away for LCC?\nMaury Gallagher: First time I've heard this question, so bear with me perhaps. I would say if you look through the history of all of the environments in which Allegiant has operated, we have not seen demand destruct at any of those, whether we're in a recession, whether we're growing the economy rapidly high fuel, low fuel, whatever it is, the cost model that Greg and team maintain enabled us to be successful in any of those environments. So we can respond with lower fares as needed. We'll typically use our capacity in order to use supply and demand to our benefit to get there. If fuel remains high, we can pull capacity back and make sure we're getting the fair needed to remain profitable at the expense of some of that demand it purposely so. So I would say it's certainly farther off, if not well into the future, if I'm understanding the premise correctly...\nDrew Wells: Scott. We're the ultimate demand management company. We have from the debt goes, managed demand in September and January. So we're geared for that better than anybody. But Scott?\nScott Sheldon: Yes. The only thing I would add is looking at our customer base, I know I've mentioned this on calls before, 85% of our customers when asked, what airline did you last flight or what airline do you regularly fly, say, Southwest or one of the three network carriers, obviously, beat their regional partners as well in that order. So our customers are the same as their customers. So in as much they are somewhat inelastic in their demand to airfare, so to ours. The last point I'd make, and the comment I pointed out in my prepared remarks was the significant growth of our customers aged 65 and older. Most of these are those that own second, some of them third homes that fly us out of Cincinnati, Grand Rapids, India, et cetera, many legacy markets for network carriers that upon consolidation left those areas as hubs. And they fly us because we're taking them non-stop, and they are - actually have quite amount of discretionary time and income. So I would just put that forward to say our customer base probably looks a lot different than maybe even other ULCC customer bases and would vote for the over or the further out on our customer base being impacted by the effects you're talking about.\nMaury Gallagher: Maybe not to expand a little bit on what Scott was saying, a customer carrier selection is not indicative of a customer's network. They're just willing to spend more on when they get there on the experience rather than on how they get there. And in case - in our case, of course, when you have 75% of your flights are non-stop, non-competitive, in some cases, we're the only choice.\nRavi Shanker: That's very good color. Thank you. And maybe kind of a related follow-up there. Thank you for the stats on your higher web traffic. Do you have details on how many of those visits were new to Allegiant new to ULCCs in general? I'm just trying to get a sense of are you guys taking share or are you growing the pie here?\nMaury Gallagher: Yes. And I think a little bit of both. The answer is yes to the first question. About half of our web visits in Q1 were from first-time users. We don't know if their first time to ULCC. We just know it's the first time we ever saw them. So that's the first one. I think there is a combination. I think that as airfares have gone up, I hypothesized that given the last comment I made about who our customers tell us they last or regularly fly. We remain still even at an elevated airfare, an attractive option versus, say, network carriers and or Southwest from a price perspective. So we could very well be seeing people, if you will, coming to us for the first time because they may be priced out and or price shopping more vigorously than they've done in the past, just given all the variety of inflationary pressures. But just the hypothesis for now.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thank you for that. And I look forward to an Allegiant Analyst Day hosted at Sunseeker before it opens, just an idea.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you...\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Group from Wolfe Research\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Afternoon. So you had a comment on the call that summer could be the pinnacle of demand and may retreat a little bit. I just wanted to - is that something you're seeing? Is that just a sort of a hypothesis? And if that's right, though, just maybe talk about why do you want to ramp capacity from low double digits to mid-20s in the back half of the year if demand may start to moderate a little bit?\nMaury Gallagher: So when I talk about that, I think this summer is going to get the perfect storm combination of that structural change that Scott and I talked about, as well as some of the maybe more temporary pent-up from folks that haven't traveled in 2, 3 years. So it's kind of just that cherry on top, and I think will come out because holidays '21 were relatively strong. As folks said, come Hilleriwater [ph] I'm going to travel for holidays, and I'll take January off, which every airline saw on their results. So I'm not suggesting we're coming back to 2019 levels by any means that looking to remain quite elevated and quite strong, just maybe slightly moderated from what I think will be the pinnacle in summer '21. So I wouldn't run away with taking it down, but I also wouldn't run away with the continued sequential growth or something like that.\nScott Group: Okay. And what changes actually allows you to get to that from a low double-digit capacity growth to a mid-20% capacity growth? What actually changes that lets you do that?\nMaury Gallagher: So I'm not sure we're midpoint. I'm thinking something about 20 for the full year. So I guess you're implying mid-20s for the back half. Some of it will be more comp driven for - to what we have in the back half of the year. We'll have some off-peak growth certainly through the August, September, October time frame, and it's a nice kind of round number for the year as well. So I don't know that something needs to materially change for us to get there. We'll have the aircraft. We believe we have the pilots in place to do it. This is purely our take on where profitability will be and what's the right level of flying for us to accomplish. And as I see it today, that's about right, it made a little downward pressure applied by another fuel spike that we're kind of seeing today.\nScott Group: Okay. And then just last thing real quick. Can you just give an update on the updated budget for Sunseeker and confidence level that this is sort of the final raise here?\nMaury Gallagher: Yes. I think when you look at the world and the challenges all of us have faced regardless of industry with supply chain and cost inflation pressures, it's been tough to put an opinion as to when things may stop in terms of - and when I say stop, I mean, escalation. We think we're there now. There could be obviously some slight movement, but we think the 618 is a final number. But I always want to caution that this world is changing daily when it comes to supply chain and cost pressures. Maybe to give some additional comfort around that number, we are 75% bought out on the project and we will be 100% bought out by July 1. So over the next 60 days, we'll be buying out the rest of the project. And of course, by the Q2 call, there will be incredible conviction around a number. And hopefully, that number is still 618, and we feel real good about that number today.\nScott Sheldon: As a sidebar, you want to see an impressive building and coming together, go out to sunseekerresorts.com which is it's got a AR in it. And look, there's what's the word, there's a...\nMaury Gallagher: Footage\u2026\nScott Sheldon: Well, the drone footage, but there - there's a button you have to click...\nMaury Gallagher: Project updates.\nScott Sheldon: Project updates and look at the drilling footage, it's impressive.\nOperator: Thank you.

With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Maury.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you, Sherry. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. We were profitable again in the quarter just ended. The model and our personnel continue to shine in these very difficult times. Operations were returning to normal in December when Omicron took over. But it's trending down and hopefully will be just a bad memory by March. You will hear an overview of our performance and what we believe we're coming months hold in just a moment. Or take some time and reflect on some of our history. We have completed our 20th full year at Allegiant, first year was 2002. We early on, understood we could not copy existing carriers and attempt to beat them at their game. So, in early 2002, we began experimenting and implementing this model you have come to appreciate and admire. It was developed and refined during the next three years and 20 years in, it continues to differentiate us. During these 20 years, we have led the industry and operating margins as well, averaging 15% During this time, while the next closest Southwest and Alaska averaged 10%. That's a 50% difference in margin. We also led the industry during this time with 69 consecutive quarters of profitability, the first quarter of 2020, including remaining profitable during the 2008-2009 period when all others were falling underneath the zero line. The end of 2021 completed our 15th year as a public company. We've had 60 of these quarterly calls. This is our 61st. Our market cap on December 8th, 2006, our first day as a public company, was approximately $400 million. Today, we have a $3.2 billion market cap or an 800% increase in value for our shareholders during these 15 years. No one in the industry has had anywhere close to this wealth creation. In the past years as we have emerged from COVID, we have made the necessary strategic moves to position us for the coming years including a terrific order we recently placed with Boeing new international relationship that will allow us to enter the international markets in the next few years. Investing in branding tools including Allegiant stadium and soon Sunseeker necessary components of our branding for Allegiant 2.0. Our continued development of our incremental, ancillary and third-party revenues. And lastly, a greatly enhanced balance sheet with almost $1.2 billion of cash. Allegiant Travel Company is extraordinarily well-positioned. Our airline and our unique competitive model continue to be the backbone of our success. 75% of our routes, by the way, are still not competitive. We have years of growth left with as many as 1,400 new routes that we feel strongly will provide us that growth opportunity. And why have I told you this history because this team this company has proven year in and year out they can execute. And while at times history has not been a reliable prognosticator, this time, I believe it's very much very reliable. Lastly, this management team is the best in the industry in my opinion. When combined with the best team members who have proven themselves continuously for the past 20 years. We will continue to lead the industry in our rightful place at the head of the pack. John?\nJohn Redmond: Thank you, Maury and good afternoon everyone. I would like to first and foremost thank every one of our team members for their incredible efforts throughout this crazy 2021 year. Allegiant's story and history are amazing to hear and difficult to replicate for any company in any industry. The company is not a model of consistency. The 10 years depth and breadth of our management team is a foundation of our success. As I reflected after the Boeing Investor Day, we recently had two words that were used most in that call. And then all preceding calls and presentations that have participated in the past are opportunistic and flexibility. I'm confident you'll hear these words used going forward as well. That's our DNA. Everything that company has ever done has created flexibility or took advantage of an opportunity, regardless of whether the timing was pre-pandemic or post. Post-pandemic when we did the equity raise May of 2021, we raised growth capital when our stock was trading close to all-time highs, while other carriers raised survival capital throughout 2020. This opportunistic timing created incredible financial flexibility. To-date, during the pandemic we have purchased or leased 25 A320 series aircraft at the most opportunity prices we've ever seen. Furthermore, we purchase roughly $30 million in spare parts and engine-related supplies at a discount of approximately 40%. Sunseeker was started and will be completed during the period of time that allowed us to take advantage of the Trump Tax Reform Act. Likewise, the recently announced 50-plane Boeing purchase to be completed by the end of 2025 was not only on favorable terms, but will also take advantage of the Tax Reform Act before its expiration. This past year has had its highs and lows, but we stayed the course and ended the year in a much better position than it started, not only financially, but we added nine cities to the network, further broadening our reach and exposure. 2022 will truly be a foundational year as we move into the 21st year of the company's existence. Quickly on Sunseeker, I mentioned on the previous call, the budget for Sunseeker Resort was originally $500 million. We were on track for the anticipated opening and on budget when we stopped the project due to the pandemic. When we restarted the project in August of 2021, the budget was revised to $510 million, given the costs incurred while we were shut down. After restarting the project and spending some time understanding the impact to the budget due to the unexpected supply chain that impacted price and delivery timeframes, I mentioned in the last earnings call Q3 2021, the budget could increase by 10% to 15%. That estimate has not changed as of today. In order to provide some level of comfort, we have bought out -- we have signed commitments for 74% of the revised budget assuming the high end of the estimate of $585 million. By the end of Q2 2022, we should be roughly 100% bought out. As a reminder, we will restart Sunseeker segment reporting beginning year end 2021. The following Sunseeker Resort data points are Q1 2022 guide. Capital expenditures should be between $50 million and $60 million and pre-open expenses will be in a range of $3 million to $4 million. And with that I will turn it over to Scott DeAngelo.\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, John. Throughout Q4, the Allegiant brand continued to shine, attracting 9% more visitors to allegiant.com who drove 16% more transactions versus 2019. Simply put, we attracted more web visitors and converted them into customers at a greater rate to drive more bookings among both first time and repeat customers than in any fourth quarter in our history. As we did each quarter in 2021, we sequentially improved, narrowing the gap versus 2019 during the first half of the year and widening the lead versus 2019 during the second half. For Q4, this included both overall passenger revenue, which beat 2019 by nearly 9% and third-party revenue, which beat 2019 by nearly 54%. The Allways Allegiant World MasterCard program was a key driver having a strongest year ever in terms of new card signups, average spend on the card, and total compensation to Allegiant. Each month of the fourth quarter and seven months in the last three quarters, ranked among our top 10 months ever for new card signups. In total, new card signups were up by 27% for the quarter and 16% for the year versus 2019. While full brand compensation to Allegiant was up by 52% and 38% for the quarter and the year, respectively versus 2019. For the year we focus currently on the 1.9 million passengers who flew with us and drove $880 million of revenue in 2019, but did not fly during the main part of the pandemic during 2020. I'm happy to report that we won back nearly 40% of these customers and one-third of that revenue this past year despite continued periods of pandemic-driven customer uncertainty and demand headwind. 2021 saw the launch of our new web and our customer experience, the launch of Allways Rewards their first ever broad based non-credit card loyalty program and the activation of major strategic partnerships with Live Nation and Allegiant Stadium, as leisure travelers returned to attend live music and sporting events [indiscernible]. In summary, the Allegiant brand is thriving and our direct-to-consumer distribution model, our all non-stop flight network, and selling beyond the aircraft to increasingly win share of leisure travel dollars for asset-light high-margin third-party products is enabling us to proactively stimulate demand in preference for Allegiant, while driving deeper levels of customer engagement across all we offer at allegiant.com and ultimately setting up unprecedented growth prospects for Allegiant in 2022 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to Drew Wells.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. I'm quite pleased with the fourth quarter revenue results. Total revenue came in 7.8% higher than 2019 on system ASM growth of 13%. In a lot of ways, the fourth quarter marks more normalcy and how we are thinking about the world. Peak demand periods, namely the holidays, saw load factors and revenue per flight that largely mirrored pre-pandemic norms. Once again, the network was expanding to the tune of 56 new routes and five new airports. Those routes were part of the 10% of ASMs in their first 12 months of operation. That feeling of normalcy was interrupted in December and COVID -- reared its head once more. We have proactively cut roughly 10% of our anticipated December schedule and a smaller portion of November to right-size and protect the schedule. However, despite manifested in a new way, as closer end holiday bookings never materially slowed, while the impact of the industry's operation was heavily felt. Off-peak January and February did feel the impact of slower bookings and the overall outlook for the first quarter is an exaggerated story of peak versus off-peak demand. The off-peak period will lag considerably in January border load factors finished just shy of 70%. However, I expect the peak to continue to be on par with pre-pandemic levels. Peak demand is incredibly strong. I think March could book over 85% and while still early, a relatively normal booking curve gives a bit more insight into summer, which is also showing great promise. As we continue to compare back to 2019, we are still mired in the NBAD retirement comp and the resulting muted growth. This results in modestly higher January and February percentage growth first peak March. Even with an elevated growth rate in the first quarter, our 1Q's scheduled service compound growth rate since 2018 is just 7%. It is important to note that nearly 90% of markets are still running just twice a week through the off-peak season. This means growth is primarily fleet and market-driven and not increased frequency. Another 13 markets inaugurate service in the first quarter and just over 12% of first quarter scheduled service ASMs will be in their first year of operation. Similar to the holiday peaks, the fourth quarter and despite incredible demand, March capacity has been reduced around 11% as they continue to work alongside our ops teams to right-size and protect the schedule. We are forecasting our first quarter ASM guide at plus 19% to plus 23% versus 2019. The weather patterns currently forming in the Midwest will put some pressure on the top end right out of the gate. The distribution of peak versus off-peak demand in ASM along with higher new market mix puts a bit of a feeling on how the quarter is likely to take shape and we are guiding the first quarter total revenue to be up between 5% and 9.5% for 2019. The continued fluidity of the environment and backloaded nature of the quarter drives slightly more uncertainty and in turn a wider range. With that, I'd like to pass it over to Greg.\nGreg Anderson: Drew, thank you and good afternoon everyone. 2021 was another challenging year and it has been amazing and humble to see team Allegiant continually rise to the occasion in this unpredictable environment. During 2021, we inducted 13 aircraft into our fleet, we added more than 700 team members, we flew 8% more ASMs than we did in 2019. Additionally, our passenger and revenue accounts for the past two quarters exceeded the same periods in 2019. We had three consecutive profitable quarters including the fourth and a full year adjusted operating margin of 6.6% and adjusted net income of $35 million. These are industry leading results in 2021 and in recognition of these extraordinary efforts, it is with great with great pleasure to mention our Board approved a special variable compensation payout to all of our team members based on GAAP results. Our sincerest thanks to all of you. For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.18, our third consecutive quarter of positive adjusted net income. Demand and revenue are strong. Even in the face of Omicron and disruptive weather, our 4Q 2021 revenue was up 8% year over two year on increased capacity of 13%. On the cost front, we still have some work to do. Adjusted operating costs excluding fuel outpace growth and we're up 21% year over two year. On a unitized basis, our adjusted CASM-X was $0.0724 or up 7% year over two year. Excluding the effects of our IROP costs specific to customer compensation during the fourth quarter, our adjusted CASM-X would have been $.0673 or flat year over two years. As described last quarter, the largest component of our IROP cost is the compensation program for inconvenience passengers. This is compensation we provide in excess of the ticket amount. We are not aware of any program in the industry near as generous and importantly, our customers impacted by summer IROPs have returned to book at the same rate to those who were not impacted. This customer compensation program drove an incremental $23 million in payments to our impacted customers during the fourth quarter. Turning towards 2022, Omicron continue to rip into January and drove further irregular operations. As Maury noted we extract this volatility to largely be behind us. We expect IROP customer compensation cost to provide roughly $0.30 headwind to our first quarter CASM. Based on our first quarter 2022 capacity guide, we estimate our first quarter CASM-X at a midpoint of $0.0685, up 3% when compared to 1Q 2019. In addition to the elevated IROPs, the primary headwinds around unitized cost year over three are largely driven by inflationary pressures with stations wages and fuel. These headwinds are in part combatted by efficiencies gained and labor productivity as we expect our FTE per aircraft in 2022 to be closer to 42 or 43, which compares favorably to our 2019 average of 48. This decrease primarily relates to management and corporate area scaling with our growth. In addition, our average seat per departure is up by five seats to 3% year over three. ASMs per gallon in the first quarter are also expected to increase by 5% compared to the same period in 2019. fuel prices however, continue to rise and we are currently seeing Brent hovering around $90 per barrel. Elevated fuel coupled with labor constraints, inflationary pressures, and Omicron are some of the current challenges at hand. Given these uncertainties, we are pleased with our measured baseline growth plan for 2022. Today, we expect a comfortable full year 2022 departure growth in the low double-digits compared to 2021. However year-over-year ASM growth should naturally outpace departure growth by roughly five percentage points given the increasing average seats -- stage length for departure. We expect our earnings potential to improve throughout 2022 as the environment becomes more normalized. Our unique model should allow us to layer on more capacity at the appropriate times to drive higher profitability while maintaining the flexibility to not fly if the environment or returns do not justify. This flexibility is further supported by our strong balance sheet. Over the past few years, we have more than doubled our cash balance as well, while nearly cutting our net debt in half. We did not have the enhanced burden of leveraging up with the expensive debt during the pandemic as most other carriers did. And the strength of our balance sheet coupled with our broad network support well our new aircraft order with Boeing for the 50 MAX 737 family-powered by CFM. The operating efficiencies of the MAX aircraft should drive even higher returns on our most productive lines of flying. We are excited to incorporate these aircraft in our fleet. As we do so, we expect a nominal headwind towards unit cost during 2022 due to training and staffing. In early January, we made our first pre delivery deposit for this order and the first delivery is expected in June of 2023. Our full year 2022 aircraft cash CapEx of $260 million includes pre-delivery deposits for this year. For full year 2022, we expect roughly $90 million heavy maintenance CapEx. This is 30% less than our pre-pandemic expectations for 2022. And given our MAX order coupled with the resulting deeper partnership with CFM in supporting our existing CEO engines -- or CO engine, we have increased our ability to more efficiently manage our heavy maintenance program for years to come. Our fleet plan has an ending 2022 with 127 a 320 aircraft, of which 70 are configured at 180.60. Of the 19 incremental aircraft year-over-year, we have already taken delivery of nine. As a reminder, 15 of these aircraft were acquired through finance or operating lease. We expect to exit 2022 with average seats per departure of 177 seats and average ASMs per gallon of 87. As we incorporate the 737 MAX aircraft over the next three years, our ASMs per gallon should increase by more than 10% versus the 2022 exit rate. And we estimate a percentage point increase in ASMs per gallon is worth roughly $7 million in fuel savings when compared to 2019 fuel efficiency levels. In closing, as noted earlier, 2021 was another chaotic year. Throughout this chaos, we felt there were unique points in time to make several moves to enhance long-term value for our stakeholders. These moves include but are not limited to aircraft order with Boeing; partnership with Viva Aerobus, secured financing to complete our Sunseeker project, and increased investments in systems, tools, and infrastructure to better support our long-term growth plans. With many of these major strategic items set, we will continue to focus on getting and staying ahead on the execution front. Team Allegiant has seen and experienced a lot together over many years and I believe our results stand for themselves. With that, I turn it over to questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Hey, I guess Drew, I want to ask you this question on your model and it's been one of stimulation and low fares. And yet -- it's not just fuel prices going up, it's lots of input costs going up, as Greg talked about. And you look at your capacity growth in the March quarter, although thanks for the context that you provided versus 2018, it's obviously not as much as what the headline number would suggest. But having gone through these cycles before when energy prices run or input costs come -- move up. At what point do you feel like you may have to back off on the growth in order to generate the type of render -- to generate the type of revenue that you need to offset these higher costs? Do you feel like we're close or getting closer? I'm curious about your thoughts and maybe it's more of a philosophical question and maybe even more you can chime in on that? Thank you.\nDrew Wells: Sure, I'll kick it off. And Maury, please fill in if you have anything there. I think we're there in terms of having your view based on where fuel is. It's a little challenging when you're running so high a twice a week markets, right, you're really making a decision on do we keep this market for the season or do we not?\nMichael Linenberg: Okay.\nDrew Wells: For the first part of first quarter, we've opted to keep a lot of those markets in. As we look towards the post-Easter to Memorial Day timeframe, kind of, the next off-peak, we'll see that may not be the case, especially if there's continue to run. So, we're undergoing that right now to ensure that we are right-sized for where oil is and possibly could be trending. For the peaks like March and the summer, our hurdle rate right now just to get into the schedule, given some tighter scheduling there is already well higher than where oil sits today. So, I don't feel compelled, in the least, to cut out the peaks. So, maybe it's a kind of a stay tuned for the late April early May timeframe is that's the next one, I think, we can affect materially.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Thank you.\nMaury Gallagher: The other comment, Michael is, when you've got 75% of your routes that are non-competitive, you have some more power to do things because you don't have somebody pricing against you at that point. And new markets also give you an ability to go in and kind of, set your own pricing, but classically, you can't raise fares just because you want to and because costs are going up, you got to cut capacity, there's no doubt about it. So, you have to be mindful of that.\nDrew Wells: We've generally stimulated traffic to where it is given the fares out there and every incremental dollar does put some headwind on most markets. So, we have to be fairly picky in how we deploy that in any way other than typical supply and demand.\nMichael Linenberg: Very helpful. And then just one quick one. Just on pilots, I know you didn't -- it wasn't in the commentary -- the prepared commentary, but I'm just curious what you're seeing on really the pilots and the mechanics, I'm talking about just the hiring perspective, it just seems like we're hearing from a lot of carriers. When I say lot, it's out there in the press that it's just getting harder to recruit what you're seeing, et cetera. Thank you.\nScott Sheldon: Yes, hey, Michael, this is Sheldon. It's definitely it's very competitive. We're currently under in Section 6, bargaining with our pilots. We're trying to expedite sort of the renewal of the of the existing CBA and so we, sort of, reupped our efforts there. We ratified our CBA, or the art mechanics ratified their first contract in fourth quarter. So, it gives us some more levers to pull in order to be a little more competitive in the marketplace. We are seeing some attrition go up on the pilot side. If you sort of look at steady state, our attrition runs anywhere from 5% to 6%, that's crept up to below 10%, if you will, majority on that both side, majority go into legacy carriers. And so we clearly see the need, there's a lot of planes coming in and obviously, we need to get something in place in order to support the backend of 2022 and into 2023 growth. And that's obviously the core focus, at least, in my part of the world.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay.\nDrew Wells: I just going to add, and you may recall, last quarter, the quarter prior, we talked about trying to get out ahead, on the pilot, mechanic, and flight attendants side. And so we, as compared to prior staffing model levels, we've increased -- we went out and increase those and try and get those line level employees and team members in more quickly. And I think we see a lot of strong applicants come and Allegiant is a great place to work. From a pilot's perspective, we have a unique model out and back. So, it's just different. Folks are -- crew members are in their beds at night. So, there is some advantages there also with the ability to move from right to left.\nMichael Linenberg: Can I just throw, is it -- for the first time in a long time, are we saying that the ability to advance at a legacy carrier, you're able to advance at a pace that maybe is almost similar to at a relatively younger ULCC? Is that -- because I've never -- I can't think of the last time when we saw maybe a decent number of pilots jumping from, say -- from your company to a legacy?\nJohn Redmond: Yes, I think that's accurate. I mean, if you look at folks that took early outs during 2020 and 2021, these folks are struggling to get back to even 2019 capacity. So, there's definitely opportunities. But steady state, obviously, these guys don't grow at the pace at which sort of yield -- spaces. And just that to add on there, I mean, if you look at the compression of narrowbody rates between legacies and the ULCC space, it's never been more compressed. So, it's getting more and more -- it's less about literally, the rate spread than it is about advancement, right seat to the left. Obviously, each one has a different proposition, quality of life proposition. So, that's an area we do like. We think we can punch above our weight limit, so to speak. And as you probably could add this on the front end, I mean, we're getting 70 applicants a week.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay.\nJohn Redmond: Certain classes, we are very successful. So, typical class size for us is 25 to 30. We started a class this week, we had all 24 applicants show up. So, it's somewhat of a mixed bag, if you will, but it's obviously the core focus, but longer term with the rate compression, specifically we think we have a better value proposition than most.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. Thanks. Thanks everyone.\nMaury Gallagher: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Maury you said at the start of the call that 75% of your routes are still not competitive. Why do you think that's the case? Are they -- is it just too hard for others to compete in those routes? Are they just not getting enough attention? Do you just have a really, really good mousetrap? And kind of how do you think that trends over time?\nMaury Gallagher: I'll let Drew do most of the talking about the mousetrap factor and if I were two times a week, it's not enough to support a lot of people. They just don't have the configurations and/or -- when you're flying 12 hours a day, as a ULCC, you need to have markets where you can run those airplanes seven days a week. We can -- we have a lot more flexibility. We can do more if we need to, but majority, we don't. Drew?\nDrew Wells: I think Maury hit all the major points. It's far easier when you built your business model to operate at twice a week and have the ability to scale up when demand dictates than the opposite of design your business model around daily service and try to scale that down, which doesn't work very well. So, it's just part and parcel of who we are and core in this business model to cater to less than daily routes wherever no one else, particularly is paying attention.\nMaury Gallagher: The other component of this that is something really important to us is in peak times, we can add capacity in really good numbers and no one else is going to react because everybody's making money. You come in underneath, you add capacity, you can add it at a lower cost, and in many cases in big markets, so it's providing another avenue for us to kind of grow into markets who here before we might not have even looked at.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. And I think I know the answer to this, but just given all the 5G headlines in recent weeks, kind of, anything around potential disruption around some of the smaller airports, kind of older equipment, kind of how do you see that trending and any impact you could have? Thank you.\nDrew Wells: Yes, I mean, it's in general, it's we're probably one of the least impacted airlines. Obviously, we're monitoring it. But for the most part, it's been somewhat of a non-event for us. The best way I can describe it.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O\u2019Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey, everyone, good afternoon. Thanks so much for the time. So, just one on the capacity plans for this year, I know we haven't thrown out a finalized number unless I missed it. But I know on the last call, you were talking about low double-digit growth for this year versus 2019 and I know 1Q comps are a little bit messy, of course. So, guessing that 2019 to 2023 is probably the high watermark for this year. But correct me if I'm wrong. But I guess since the last time we talked, are you seeing incremental opportunities to add capacity? Or it just sounded to me like your comments based on ASMs running several points ahead of a double-digit departure increase sound like gross is running maybe a bit higher than you were thinking last time we talked? Thanks.\nDrew Wells: Yes, Kate, maybe I'll kick it off and open up to the floor if anyone else wants in. I think it's fair that we're seeing a little bit more in terms of ability to add some capacity. If you remember, last time we were still kind of working alongside with the ops groups to make sure that we can right-size the schedule. And I truly believe that we had Thanksgiving and Christmas in a really good place, barring COVID polls that were kind of unforeseen and how they came to fruition. So, I think kind of the place we've gotten to working alongside one other, kind of, as an enterprise as a whole, has given us a bit more confidence to add in some incremental departures throughout the year. We think you'll see a lot come through the off-peak months, things that will be a little bit less stressful in terms of ads. So, there's probably a little bit more granularity and detail there than simply headline numbers as we go throughout the year. \nGreg Anderson: And Katie, I would just maybe add on the low double-digit growth. As we talked about that last time, we probably should have better explained that that was more around departures, but ASM will naturally -- ASM growth will naturally outpace that due to larger average -- higher average seat per departure plus a little bit longer gauge by about five percentage points is what we're expecting.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, got it. And so then, I guess maybe just a related question for you, Greg. In the same sentence about talking about low double-digits, on the last call, you also mentioned, you're expecting that full year 2022 CASM-X will be about flat. I guess, is that still the case? And then can you just help us think about what expenses roll off through the year that you'll be able to get to flat CASM just on what I'm guessing is going to be less capacity growth it's how that works? Thanks so much.\nGreg Anderson: Yes, no, thanks for the question, Katie. And let's just -- when we're talking flat CASM, that's based on 2019 is about $0.065. And where we sit today, I think we're a little bit higher than that, maybe a point or so, but we'll see. A lot of that's going to be based on capacity. We started in January, as Maury mentioned Omicron ripped through and that puts some pressure on us on the IROB side. And that customer compensation program in which we -- that seems for us to be candid. But you take that out, I think we'll start working through the year. If we -- some opportunities, I think, on the tailwind side, Katie will be as the operating environment or travel ecosystem gets better, ideally, we're able to be more productive with our assets and our team members to kind of, grow up under -- or come in underneath that. So, that that too can help. I think on the station side, one of the things that we're seeing on the inflationary pressures has been around ground handling. I think we've talked about that quite a bit. Catering, for example, we'll see some pressure on the catering side. It's not a big number, but it's still about 10% there, but we offset that through our buy onboard program. I mean, the margins they're still the same. I think you have the potential to improve on station a little bit. We're assuming on the airport side, you have -- we're assuming inflationary pressures around 7% year-over-year, so 2022 versus 2021. And I mentioned that as just as the bigger carriers and some of our larger airports, they start flying international or they start buying more business that should help with those costs and come down, but we're not making any assumptions on that side yet.\nGreg Anderson: And Katie, maybe one comment I should have added in the first -- the first bit. I think this is going to be a point of confusion throughout a bunch -- much of this year, but, I think Maury comments are mostly driven on 2022 versus 2021 and not versus 2019, like we're guiding today. So, if you think about departures in 2022 versus 2021, I think a lot of what was said holds true with the lower double-digits and adding a little bit into that -- the comparison versus 2019. So, you probably only found out to be a lot clearer in the comparison a reference point, but I believe that's what Maury was referring to last quarter.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, got it. Maybe just one really quick follow up, Greg, just to make sure I have this on the CASM. So, you think probably this year, I know you're guiding to anything formal, but maybe like low single-digit inflation versus 2019, it's probably where we end up with some of these IROP pressures in start to year, is that right?\nGreg Anderson: Yes, I think you're right. I don't want to come out and formally guide guys that. I think we'll be maybe slightly above where we were at, potentially, depending on how the environment works capacity in the light, but yes, that's right.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Thank you so much for all the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your question please.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good evening everyone and thank you for taking my question. I guess, can you guys give us a little bit of context here on the quarter because obviously, capacity growth close to 20%, but revenue 5%to 9%. I'm assuming that there's a big drag here in January and February that you alluded to, can you give us some feeling like how this is booking up for March and the spring break periods if you don't mind?\nGreg Anderson: Yes, I think March is going to be -- particularly the peak spring break will be reflective of pre-pandemic revenue stats in terms of loads, the amount of revenue carried by flight. So, I think -- as you think about where demand is relative to the 2019, 2018, where we're there, it's, it's the other weeks that we need the recovery to get that full kind of traveling benefit or traveling growth.\nBrandon Oglenski: So, I guess, your point is that you are getting recovered PRASM too, not just demand, because obviously, your capacity is up a lot as well?\nGreg Anderson: Yes, the peak spring break will look very much like they did in 2019 or 2018. They're healthy in terms of demand and in any unitized metric you'd like to you'd like to use.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, appreciate that. And then Greg, on the irregular operation costs here, I get it that a lot of this might have been driven by Omicron, but can you give us a sense of like, how much of this was disrupted because of crew availability versus just normal weather? We had assumed that some of this is going to be ongoing in the future, right?\nGreg Anderson: Yes, it's a good question, Brandon. Let me kick it off and maybe Scott wants to add in on it as well. But what I'd say is where -- as I've been talking on this call and as I've been talking about IROPs and given the numbers, I've been trying to be more specific on the customer compensation, which is just a component of the IROPs, but because that's somewhat we believe unique to us. That's what I've been really when I talk about like the $23 million that -- from the fourth quarter, that's what I'm talking about there. In 2019, Brandon, when we had the operating environment, like we did, IROPs were negligible. I mean I think it was like $4 million or $5 million in total for the full year. So, we've been getting out ahead of that. We talked about the staffing, we've talked about parts and things of that nature to try and combat the IROP situation. And so I don't have a thick guide for that in 2022, or buffer, I do -- we do have a little bit, but we think we're going to get ahead of that. Omicron came on quickly and so -- it hit us quickly, but it's -- we think it's abated quite nicely. And in terms of the mix between Omicron and weather, I don't have a percentage, Scott, but I know Omicron drove a lot of it if not.\nScott Sheldon: Yes, I mean, just to sort of put this in context, because then the results really don't show sort of how good we were set up for peak December flying. We basically had call it 900 controllable cancellations for the quarter. 450 of those happened in the last 11 days and that would include crew and mechanicals. And so it was so backend loaded, if you look at the distribution of departures for the quarter, it was very obviously heavily weighted to December, in addition to the back half of December. So, we really set up nicely, weather obviously was impacted, but the majority of that is just -- you go from sort of 30, 40 COVID through polls, going up to 300, in about 12 days. And so I think this is no different than any other carriers. This is definitely different than the Delta variant, we saw a dramatically increased amount of just sick calls, which obviously, you pull them for COVID, that's a 10-day -- five to 10 day sort of events. Our crew sick calls were north of 30% in over a five-day period. It just -- it was such a shock to the system, but prior to the Omicron, sort of, spike there, we were just really, really set up nicely. Drew and team did a nice job sort of matching the capacity to what our crews could handle but yeah, I mean, really was -- the story of this quarter was really the last 11 days. Other than that, it was a fairly clean quarter.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie from Seaport Global. Your question, please.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, thanks, guys. so, the revenue forecasts about 5% to 9.5%, I guess, on a 21% increase in capacity. A couple questions here. Stripping away the suboptimal fleet utilization in the fourth and first quarters, what would the growth look like if no supply chain bottlenecks? And if we can just step -- and then secondly, related that if we can strip away COVID crew impacts? Is there an updated expectation around the timing for when supply chain issues might be resolved? I think last quarter, you had talked about some MRO challenges.\nMaury Gallagher: Dan its -- I wish we could tell you. I mean, as I sit here today, I continue to be baffled by the ongoing nature of this. And usually these markets are pretty efficient and they fix themselves. But you have a combination of labor challenges, you've got the combination of just parts and the like. Having said that, our MRO activity is, I was just talking with BJ, throw some comments in here. We've got 10, 11 airplanes in -- undergoing stuff, and it's actually working pretty well. So, you're looking for positive rays of light to show through, but so much of the broad message is still difficult. Stuff isn't on grocery shelves, personnel shortages, pilots in particular moving around very quickly, but the MRO seems to be hanging in there.\nJohn Redmond: Yes, I think just on the induction side, we got ahead of it really well, this year, because there was such a supply of used aircraft that everything's already on property really, for this year, and lots of parts and kits and everything are on hand earlier. I don't know if that's really representative of the heavy maintenance environment, Scott.\nScott Sheldon: Yes, the heavy is definitely more volatile. We do the best we can to be surgical and match spend days to anticipated findings, both routine and non-routine. A lot of these we can deal with paper cuts, but we find non-routines that drive a substantial amount of engineering work, which obviously is tied back to labor and then any component repairs, obviously, that's supply chain, so they can drive definitely increased spend days, and that's where it gets pretty invasive on the schedule. But it's slowly getting better to, I think, everyone's point.\nMaury Gallagher: Fleet is going to be more problematic in heavy maintenance. The newer fleet, it's four or five, six years old and while it's a great way to work, we're going to pay more of a price for it this year, just on schedule and availability. So, we're probably going to keep more airplanes on the sideline than we normally would. We're doing a lot of things differently than we normally would at this point still.\nGreg Anderson: And, Dan, it's Greg. Let me give one high level comment, just to add here is that we're long-term thinkers and yes, there's going to be noise in the short-term, we're going to get through it, we get through it well, if not better than anybody. And then if the environment starts to stabilize and get more normal, I mean, watch out, we're going to be firing on all cylinders and it's going to be pretty powerful, we think ahead of us, as Maury mentioned in his opening comments,\nMaury Gallagher: The best way to approach this, Dan is to come up underneath it. Don't try and time it perfectly and hit it spot on because we've been not -- we haven't been able to do that. But if we come up, make our best guess, you'd rather not be canceling flights, and maybe leave a little on the table so to speak and capacity or you could have done more than just grow that -- you grow into that.\nDan McKenzie: So, I guess, that's really gets to my next question. As we think about this noise, what would growth have been this year without the noise. So, instead of departures up low double-digits with ASMs up about five percentage points to that, this trimming -- is the noise, you're trimming, say five percentage points of growth off of 2022, that potentially could come back in 2023?\nGreg Anderson: I think that's a bit challenging to say, you know, I think the biggest growth limiter for us this year and into next year will be more of crew hiring pipeline and more so than other supply chain elements. So, with more crews, we grow more. I mean it's that straightforward. So, I think you can run that as far as you want.\nMaury Gallagher: I think it's pretty interesting Dan. I don't think anyone's growing as much as we are. And I don't want to sit here and make excuses for that. But we're in a growth mode, it's just a question of how we do it. And at the end of the day, when you say you want to -- you're going to do something, you want to complete it. And we haven't been able to do that with the regularity and the ability to leave historically, you look at 2019, how well we ran, the whole industry for that matter, we've got to get back to that and we're -- there's so many moving parts, we've got to try and coordinate as many as we can, and I sense we'll get back there because the Omicron stuff has really been a bit of tough, but I don't know about you, but everybody that I'm talking to is just done with changing lifestyles, and all of a sudden closing down and opening up closing down. So, I'm bullish in this -- certainly in the second half of the year, if not, even in the second quarter, we'll be in good shape, even March should be good.\nDan McKenzie: Yes, prudent growth, I get it, under shooting. And then if I need to squeeze one last one in here, going back to the fleet presentation, I'm just wanting to help us tie growth in cost into a CASM-X target, say three years out, so not a guide, but if we just juxtapose growth with scale, I'm just trying to get a sense for what that means to the airline for the route and you guys are delivering a very positive message today, on growth and longer term. And I'm just wondering if you can help us connect the dots on how to think about the cost structure over that longer term?\nGreg Anderson: Yes, thanks, Dan, for the question. I mean, I think what I start off by saying is we're focused on margins. And we think the aircraft that we'll bring on with Boeing in the future, that's what we're going to be focused on. So, there's two sides to the equation, cost and revenue and nobody, in our view, can adapt and match capacity with demand quite like us. So, maintaining that flexibility is important. With that said, we think that we have a great cost structure, we'll continue to hold that cost structure for years to come. The announcement of the fleet, the new order with Boeing isn't going to change that one bit. And as we look out for 2023 to 2025, I mean, I don't want to go out and give a guide, but I don't think it's going to materially rise, where we're seeing today, all else being equal, but there's pressures that are going to come. Scott mentioned that now we're in discussions with pilots and there's other items that we want to think about. But I don't want to give a guide other than I would say that our cost structure we feel is in a great spot and we'll continue to focus on that. It's an everyday commitment by all of us, and we'll make sure that it's the right -- it's in the right place moving forward.\nDan McKenzie: That's great. Thanks for the time you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen. Your question please.\nHelane Becker: Hello, thank you very much. Hi, everybody. So, here's my question. One thing as a point of clarification, I think you said that some markets you're doing a couple times a week, we talked a lot about that. What percent of markets did you say are new versus prior years and was that for 2022 or 2021?\nGreg Anderson: So, I mentioned a couple percentages; so 4Q 2021 was about 10%, of ASM and 1Q 2022 ramping up to 12%. So, historically, that's around kind of late 2017, early 2018 levels.\nHelane Becker: Right, exactly so. So, those are levels that you've A, done before, and B, you feel comfortable with. It's not getting too far over your students, right?\nGreg Anderson: We've certainly exceeded these levels before. So, we're quite comfortable. I think 2Q will probably ramp a little bit again over 1Q, but that that will likely be the high watermark for this year and possibly early 2023 if I had to guess.\nHelane Becker: Great, that's perfectly helpful. Thank you. And then my other question is with respect to debt and principal repayments. I see the guide for 2022, is there debt that you could prepay that would make sense or is it -- or not? And I'm sorry, I think you said this, what percentage of the aircraft deliveries this year are financed now?\nGreg Anderson: The aircrafts that will be delivered this year, I think there's only one that will not be under a finance lease, Helane. And in terms of our debt where we sit today, I think around well, the so called $1.5 billion, I'm rounding here, it's $500 million of the term loan is all pre-payable, we have some other pre-payable debt on the aircraft side. It's something we'll look at closely, given the market conditions and getting out ahead. And so we're having discussions now and thinking about our balance sheet long-term. And there's I think there's some momentum behind us. I think there's a lot of capital out there to be put to use and so that's something -- it's a great question and we don't have a specific answer for you today other than there's a big chunk of our debt that is pre-payable that we'll look at in the near-term to see kind of long-term -- or in the near-term, potentially refinancing or taking out?\nHelane Becker: Okay, that's really helpful. And if I could just squish one more in. Did you issue warrants to the government last year?\nHelane Becker: No, I mean, a very small amount, but that\u2019s a very small, because we didn't take the loan, the government loan, we took the grant. And then most of what we received was -- didn't have a loan associated with it anything from $100 million or below for each one of the cycles there, if you will, or each one of the grant issuances. There was no loan or warrants attached.\nHelane Becker: Right, because if there are any that the government holds, you could buy this, theoretically, right?\nGreg Anderson: Yes, but it's just -- I mean, I can't remember the percentage, Helane, it's something we're not focused on, but it is negligible for us, I mean, just really small.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that's really helpful. Thank you, everybody, and thanks for the extra time,\nGreg Anderson: Thanks Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nHunter Keay: Hi, everybody. Drew, you were the only airline Executive three months ago to warn us that COVID wasn't gone yet. And -- by the good call, and I'm kind of curious to get your updated feelings on that? How did you know that? What is it that you were looking at? Seriously, what is it -- what are you looking -- you saw the case count, so what is it that you were looking at the time that gave you some caution on everybody, running a victory lap on COVID being done? And are you seeing any of those same things now, any other metrics that you may look at to give you the same degree of caution? Or do you feel like we're good to go here?\nDrew Wells: I feel like I'm getting way, way outside of my lane here. But I think some of this data has come out recently, but it's kind of follow flu season, I very much depends on temperature and humidity, and where people are likely congregating. And that's why you see it in most of the country through the winter as people go inside. And then you see it somewhat in the high humid, high heat areas in the summer as people start to congregate inside air conditioning. And so I think it's more of a seasonality aspects to it than anything. There wasn't something that we were picking up in demand. It was just kind of what we'd seen in terms of trends of cases and where what's happened geographically and made sense from that perspective. But by no means am I trying to pretend to be an epidemiologist, please don't take any of my words says, as serious here. But that's really it, nothing beyond that.\nHunter Keay: Yes, I guess the question was, do you feel a little better now than you did then?\nDrew Wells: I do. I feel a lot better about what we're seeing and moving forward. I don't think we're completely out of the clear, but Scott DeAngelo mentioned this in previous calls, each wave has had less of an impact than the previous wave. And I became the bookings, particularly in the peak period, those did not slow down at all. He felt it in the off-peak. So, I do have more confidence moving forward that that even if it doesn't make headlines, again, it won't be quite as impactful. I wish I could say the same with any confidence on kind of the operation side and what it means for COVID pulls. I don't have any good line of sight of that. I don't think anybody does. But it's kind of the next thing to follow I guess.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And then, is there any changes -- and this is one is for Sheldon, maybe or Maury, would you be permitted to make any changes to the bidding process without amending any CBAs? I'm kind of curious, we see these really good peaks and these really bad troughs and if there's a situation where this is sort of the new normal, is there going to be anything you can do outside of the CBA amendments to sort of change the way that you schedule your folks to have a little bit more nimbleness on the bidding process so you could make more schedule changes closer in, or does that require CBA amendments?\nScott Sheldon: Yes, unfortunately, we're sort of tied up there. We were able to come to an agreement. This is in 2020, where you basically in order to keep crews, sort of on staff and try to mitigate involuntary furloughs is to -- how do we pay these people half time, use them when we start to see strength. And just sort of have these guys in standby mode and so we could do that. But the minute this thing was amendable, our hands are basically tied.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thank you.\nMaury Gallagher: Thanks Hunter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your question please.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. So, if you add it all up, how much would you say Omicron is costing you in revenue in the first quarter? Again, a lot of this commentary is very backwards looking, but if we could just estimate between cancels that were maybe people calling in sick as opposed to staffing constraints and lost demand, how many points of revenue do you think you lost there? And to put a finer point on many of the previous questions, are we sort of fully back to the bookings momentum you would expect in a normal period for a time like March?\nGreg Anderson: So, honestly, I don't have a great number for you in terms of points of revenue loss due to Omicron. One of the things I think that's challenging with that is, is estimating the true return demand and peak versus off-peak. Like I mentioned, March demand looks fully normal pre-pandemic levels, I'd say zero is the [indiscernible] that -- it probably should be above and beyond really hard to tell. Your guess maybe as good as mine of what January should have looked like without Omicron. It's the shortest booking curve of the year and that\u2019s very, very compressed and the vast majority of booking should come in during a time when Omicron was present and very active. So, I think it's a wild challenge to try to get to that number in a meaningful way for you.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, fair enough. With respect to small markets, I wonder if you're seeing more whitespace. Obviously, constraints, impact regionals as well and the ability to sort of serve some of those smallest markets is going to be impacted, at least for a period of time. So, is your opportunity set, getting bigger here or are there orphan markets, for lack of a better word, that are sort of incremental growth opportunities for you?\nGreg Anderson: Yes, I mean, there certainly are -- I would caution with running away too far with this. Remember, we're only a couple years -- three years, maybe now removed from the questions in the opposite fashion. And while a lot of small cities are being added, and our point at that time was we didn't see a lot of degradation in performance, where we were serving those small cities and I would envision the same in reverse. Now, I don't, I don't expect a massive amount of lifts to come through the results. Obviously, fewer seats is better, in general, but not something I would run away with here. We'll have some incremental opportunity, but nothing I'm going to call game-changing.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And maybe one last one for Maury, as you as you look at the staffing constraints across the industry, during this period of time, how does it impact, if at all, your thinking around M&A in the low cost sector?\nMaury Gallagher: Who knows. I think there's a lot of variables in M&A that's outside of just the day-to-day operations. But I think everybody's got their heads down just trying to figure out how to run tomorrow without trying to, kind of, look big picture at this point. But never say never.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Maury Gallagher for any further remarks.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you all very much. We appreciate your calls. And we'll talk with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Maury.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us again. We had another very good quarter as we saw loads and yields improved versus earlier this year in Q1 and Q2. Our scheduled service ASMs increased 17% this year versus the same quarter in 2019. As I mentioned in our release, we were the only carrier this year that I\u2019m aware of who has both grown their system compared to 2019 and been profitable. And subsequently, this has been \u2013 this was a substantial increase versus the sequential 4.5% growth in Q2 and 3.1% growth in Q1. While our third quarter\u2019s results were profitable, they were impacted by our operational challenges. This spring many in the industry were revving their motors for the drag race to restart their airlines. Common theme was flagged paint planting and get there before someone else. Majors had to refocus much of their flying to leisure oriented destinations, given the lack of business and international passengers. And we the low-cost carriers were feeling our oats as well and looking to get out and plant some flags. We all \u2013 we\u2019re looking to get out of the gates quickly and stake the new turf. Regardless, the focus on leisure traffic and the associated airports by all concerned. As a result, the operational demands on leisure destination airports, particularly in Florida were substantial. Comparatively, business focused airports and most of your larger NFL cities were operating at a fraction of their traditional volumes. Some of our destination airports had operational increases of up to a 100% compared to 2020 and 2019 respectively. This added leisure flight activity was hampered by a difficult labor environment as well. Airports with these increases in activity did not have the necessary personnel for this substantial growth. And illustrative example of this unprecedented leisure effect with Southwest comments about their recent operational problems tied to ATC issues in Florida stating that half of their flights now touch Florida each day. This amazing evolution of the network of one of the major carriers in the U.S. is indicative of the substantial shift in where airplanes were flying this past summer. My label for this phenomena is leisure destination overload. As I said we were not immune to the challenges, the industry was experiencing this past summer. For the past few years, we have implemented a generous compensation program if and when we interrupt a customer\u2019s trip. Our approach in this advantage to provide a better than average amount of TLC to help make takes the sting out of one of this bad situation. If we were to add back these interrupted trip costs and other one-time associated operational expenses, our unit costs would have been on the mark. Greg will have more comments in a few minutes. You\u2019ve heard every carrier so far comment on increasing fuel prices. Some carriers are still hedging, but understand this will only provide short-term relief. Capacity reductions are the only remedy long-term for fuel price increases. We have firsthand knowledge in this area in 2008 and the first half of the year, we made substantial capacity cuts to offset the them skyrocketing energy costs. And while we plan on growing this coming year by at least low-double digit percentages, increasing fuel costs could put a damper on this growth. As we told you repeatedly, our models flexibility allows us to flex up and down better than others. We have shown a consistent ability to grow over the years, but we\u2019ve also been able to quickly retreat if needed as we did an early 2008 and last year\u2019s pandemic. I\u2019m excited about where we\u2019re at. We\u2019re in excellent shape. Our balance sheet is improved substantially during these difficult times. The quarter end we had over $1.1 billion of cash and only $500 million in net debt. We restarted Sunseeker and we recently completed a $350 million financing line to finish the construction. And John will have some additional comments. Our third-party revenue efforts are paying dividends. They\u2019re increasing nicely. These incremental revenues have been a difference maker through the years, providing us with industry leading unit revenues and associated profits. This is all part of our Allegiant 2.0 strategy that we\u2019ve talked about previously. Scott DeAngelo will have further comments as well. We are continuing our climb back from the depths of the pandemic and this climb up has not been a straight line, has been complicated by the volatility of the labor markets as well as COVID-related absences that we experienced this past summer, but we\u2019ve seen demand continued to increase nicely in the past few months in spite of the Delta variant outbreak. We were the first to profitability from COVID, our model and our non-competitive route structure continue to be industry leaders. And I believe 2022, we\u2019ll continue this return to normalcy and we will lead the industry out of this \u2013 of the past year and a half. Lastly, as usual, I want to thank our team members who have been the difference maker in our success for the years and now is no different. There\u2019ve been warriors on the front line, this entire time, the past year and a half consistently transporting our passengers day in and day out to their destinations. Thank you to everyone. John?\nJohn Redmond: Thank you very much, Maury, and good afternoon, everyone. Like Maury, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank all of our incredible team members who go above and beyond every day to help this company move forward out of this pandemic. The challenges brought on by the pandemic shockwave have led to supply chain upheaval and labor shortages, creating operational challenges throughout the company, none of us have ever seen or experienced before. You are all rising to the occasion and we are getting through it as painful as it may be. Again, I am thankful for your continued efforts and understanding. Given these unprecedented challenges, we still had a great financial quarter after adjusting for one-off costs associated with irregular ops. As we adjust to and fix these challenges, our results will continue to improve. Our revenue is strengthening, exceeding Q3 2019 and we expect Q4 to exceed 2019 Q4 as well. In regards to Sunseeker, here are the couple of updates. As previously announced the $350 million financing transaction with Castlelake has been completed. We expect the first $175 million traunch to fund in the next couple of days. Castlelake has been a great partner in Allegiant Travel looks forward to a long-term relationship. Construction as resumed on the resort with approximately 250 people working on a project today. Construction on the golf course has resumed as well. We expect these projects to be completed in Q1 2023. The hotel tower should be topped off by the end of this year. The two suite towers as expected will top off in Q1 2022. We expect to begin taking reservations in Q1 2022 as well. And also beginning Q1 2022, we will resume segment reporting showing Sunseeker data separately as we did in the past pre-pandemic. As I\u2019ve done on past earnings calls, I thought it would be helpful to provide some directional data points to help you understand how we see things for full year 2021. All these data points I\u2019m providing are on an adjusted basis, which exclude COVID-related special charges, the net benefit from the payroll support programs and bonus accruals. Furthermore, all data points provided assume fuel at $2.17 a gallon for the full year. EBITDA expect to be an excess of $275 million with a margin around 17%, also would expect fully diluted EPS in excess of a $1.50 a share. Again, these are all on an adjusted basis. In addition to the above, we expect yearend cash balance of around $1.3 billion and net debt of around $300 million. And Greg will provide more detail around these data points in his commentary. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott Sheldon.\nScott Sheldon: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Perhaps a common or two on our third quarter operations. But without stating the obvious our operational results and corresponding headwinds were similar to that of our industry peers who have released or this earning cycle. From a capacity standpoint, we had perhaps one of the more ambitious summer schedules in the domestic U.S. market. Third quarter 2021 departures were scheduled to be up nearly 17% year over two years average aircraft gross up nearly 20% and destination and route growth were expected to be at 25% and 29% respectively. Furthermore, the distribution in departure growth among our approved basis has continued to shift to some of our smaller and mid-sized markets, which puts additional strain on infrastructure and labor staffing challenges. Despite those added complexities, we were seeing enough improvement in the operating environment to stay the course as we exited June and we felt we had all the necessary complemental flight crews and frontline employees to execute the back half of our summer schedule. Unfortunately, the Delta variant surge in late July and early August was simply too much to recover. And we took an abnormally high number of cancellations. In addition, our core operating performance metrics were down as compared to historical trends, but we were starting to see those trend up. Over the course of summer, we had as much as 30% of our frontline workforce impacted by COVID and/or other types of leads with a definitive spike as we turn the calendar from July to August. Greg will have more commentary on IROPs. Looking into the back half of the year and into 2022, Drew and team remain optimistic on the demand and revenue environment. That being said, we\u2019re trying to build in some safety nets from a num \u2013 for a number of higher risk operational areas. Our ops team continues to work with planning to ensure we establish appropriate buffers to execute a more consistent schedule to help mitigate passenger disruptions. And that I believe mine labor and MRO supply chain challenges are the number one and two focus areas as we look to support our March 2022 volume. One quick comment on labor before sign off, I\u2019d like to congratulate all of our maintenance technicians, maintenance control staff, quality and stores personnel represented by the IBT for ratifying their first collective bargaining agreement, disagreement helps make us competitive in the marketplace. As we look to fill much needed positions for our 20 \u2013 excuse me, 2022 schedule. I know this is a long time coming and was restricted by our 2020 COVID pause, but I very much appreciate everyone\u2019s effort involved to get this to the finish line. And in closing, I\u2019d like to thank all of our team members across the network for their straining service and professionalism in the face of our latest Delta variant spike. Your efforts have been tremendous for team members and partners are the backbone and the face of our organization and their unwavering commitment and loyalty to our consumers is why our organization has and will continue to be successful. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott DeAngelo.\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, Scott. From a marketing perspective, despite the headwinds, we\u2019ve called out the Allegiant brand continued to shine, attracting more visitors to allegiant.com and more bookings among both first time and repeat customers than in any third quarter in our history. And late August while the Delta variant drove customer sentiment as we measure in our weekly tracking survey to its lowest level since early January, it is sensory turned to its highest level since mid-July. And while the Delta variant negatively impacted bookings during August and September, the degree of that negative impact was far more modest than that seen its similar customer sentiment levels during 2020 and the beginning of this year. Simply put Allegiant customer demand is showing increased resiliency, despite continued bumps along the pandemic road to recovery. Despite the Delta varying headwinds during a considerable portion of the quarter, we still managed to increase visitation to allegiant.com by 1% and more importantly, increased bookings at allegiant.com by 5% versus 2019 levels. The fact transactions increased at 5 times the rate of web visits points to Allegiant heightened brand awareness, increased marketing efficacy at attracting the right visitors to our site and enhanced web and app experience, which makes it easier for those visitors to find and buy what they want. All of these enhancements again combined to attract and convert more new and more returning customers in the lowest cost ways. Specifically, our lowest cost channels that is customers coming to us via our mobile app or by directly entering the allegiant.com URL or by clicking on a link in one of the 50 million targeted e-mails we send each week, now account for 80% of total visits to allegiant.com and that\u2019s drove nearly 20% more website visitors than they did in 2019. And those visitors translated into a healthy balance of both first time and repeat Allegiant customer bookings. Bookings from first time customers saw a nearly 2.5% increase. And those from repeat customers saw nearly 3% increase compared to 2019. We also continue to achieve deeper levels of customer engagement across everything we offer at allegiant.com. Overall, third-party revenue, which comprises co-brand credit card, hotel stays and car rentals was up nearly 35% for the quarter versus 2019, compared to scheduled service passenger growth in the quarter of just over 2% versus 2019. A greater portion of customers are spending more of their leisure wallet at allegiant.com on products beyond just air travel. The continued growth in our asset light third-party product revenue stream was they did not only by the web and app redesign launched earlier this year, but also by the introduction of our first ever non-credit card loyalty program, Allways Rewards and enhancements to our co-brand credit card acquisition approach that launched during this past quarter. The Allegiant World Mastercard, which is now being branded under the Allways Rewards umbrella was once again voted the top airline co-brand credit card in the nation for the third consecutive year in USA Today Readers\u2019 Choice Award. You may recall that our second quarter saw the number one and the number three best months of new cardholder acquisition and the programs history. And this quarter, despite various headwinds in the traditional decline of leisure travel in early fall, we achieved the number four and the number five best months of new cardholder acquisition in the program\u2019s history. In total, new card signups in the quarter were up by more than 12% versus 2019. Contributing to the continued growth in new cardholders was the introduction of instant credit enrollment in our mobile app. Historically, this has been the top performing way that we acquire new cardholders on our website. So we expanded this functionality to our mobile app for 20% of our bookings are now made and the results are exceeding our expectations. Building off the success of our co-brand credit card simple, popular point earning and redemption model, and combining that with inspiration from winning, tech forward, consumer friendly programs like Apple Card and Target Circle rewards, we launched Allways Rewards this past quarter. Already, Allways Rewards members spend 23% more per transaction than non-members. Left that is driven primarily by their increased attachment of air ancillary and third-party products to their itineraries. These loyalty programs combined with the redesigned website and mobile app and soon to be joined by other technology enhancements in the upcoming year are all playing meaningful roles in helping us sell beyond the aircraft and we\u2019ve Allegiant into the most important and highest margin aspects of leisure travel, including third-party distribution of hotel, rental car, and even sports and entertainment events. And to that end, Allegiant Stadium, in addition to driving more than 60 million viewers across live broadcast during the season\u2019s first four games at the stadium, as well as driving web visits and bookings up by as much as 39% above 2019 levels on the days of and after these games has now joined our portfolio of third-party products. As the NFL season kicked off, we launched Allegiant Stadium travel packages that include air travel, hotel stay and game tickets. While these packages don\u2019t represent a material revenue driver, they do serve as a high profile way to showcase our ability to sell beyond the aircraft. And to that point, for 80% of Allegiant Stadium package customers, it\u2019s the first time they had ever booked a hotel through allegiant.com. And for nearly one-third of these customers, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve flown to Las Vegas on Allegiant. Beyond the wildly positive impact, we\u2019re seeing directly from this partnership, Allegiant Stadium has become a crown jewel of sorts for broader nationwide Las Vegas advertising that the destination itself is doing. Allegiant Stadium is central to the destinations claim that Las Vegas is now the entertainment and sports capital of the world. Thanks in large part to Allegiant Stadium elevating Las Vegas as a destination to what they have dumped the greatest arena on earth. In summary, the Allegiant brand is thriving, share, headwinds exist, but they will ultimately subside, and as they do, we believe we are best positioned with the increased demand we continue to see from new and repeat customers for Allegiant brand of affordable, accessible leisure travel to maximize our share, not only of their non-stop leisure air travel, but also of their spending on the increasing array of leisure products we\u2019re able to offer at allegiant.com. And with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Drew.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott. Thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. I\u2019m immensely pleased with the third quarter revenue results. Total revenue came in 5.3% higher than 3Q 2019 on scheduled service ASM growth of 17%. We are among the first carriers to restore revenues above 2019 levels and likely the first U.S. carrier to do so on the scheduled service side. We hit the ground running with the July load factor over 80% and finished with a pandemic best 76.6% load factor for the quarter. The ancillary performance, once again, led the charge browse as bundled and the redesigned website impact on take rates, continue to generate positive results. The RM team continues to do a remarkable job handling the complex task of balance loads and yields on a market level, even as the environment changes rapidly. As is always the case, with the bulk of ASMs in the first half of the quarter, before we dramatically pull down our schedule for the off peak fall, 3Q goes as the summer goes. This scheduling flexibility is key to our model and the upcoming quarters, we continue to put that to the test, with rising fuel costs, supply chain disruption, potential TSA staffing issues, and the potential for additional seasonal COVID spikes. We are and will continue to work in lockstep with the organization to maintain this flexibility and ensure enterprise success. After inaugurating, seven routes in the third quarter and several successful hyper seasonal one and two weekend events specific routes. We will launch 52 new markets in the fourth quarter with 75% of those connecting the dots between existing Allegiant cities. Despite that, we will have a lower percentage of markets in their first 12 months than we previously communicated, down roughly 4 points in the third quarter and 1 point in the fourth. Similarly, we expect our fourth quarter growth rates also come in lower than previously communicated, in part, as we react to rising fuel. We planned capacity with a typical cost per gallon buffer of $0.50, if only the third time, the last nearly decade we\u2019ve hit or exceeded that buffer. With that, we now expect scheduled service ASMs of 12% to 16% and system ASM of 10% to 14%. We are positioned similarly today to where we were 12 months ago. So we\u2019ve Thanksgiving having more revenue on the books today than the same holiday period finished with last year on a considerably higher base. The booking cadence has research to be in line seasonally adjusted with the peaks of the summer and holiday demand looks quite strong. The reopening of cross border travel for vaccinated travelers starting next month has shown a meaningful impact to our near border airports. Normally, I would be quite bullish on the fourth quarter prospects. However, the seven-day average U.S. new case count of 70,000 is hovering around an eerily similar number to late October 2020, granted on a different trajectory over the past several weeks. As such, I\u2019m a bit worry of running away with the excitement of 4Q potential and it built in some expectation of spike related headwinds. That said, I believe we will continue to lead the recovery and our forecasting another positive total revenue quarter of plus 0.5% to plus 4%. And with some positive variance, believe we can achieve an 80% book load factor in both November and December. As we look to 2022, we have some fairly low comps in the first half of the year, as growth was limited to 3% versus 2019 that will provide a catalyst for headline growth and help set the stage for the rest of the year. We are still working through June and beyond to ensure we are setting up the company for success in finding the proper balance between growth and operational integrity. We\u2019ll have much more detail to provide in three months time. And with that, I\u2019d like to pass over to Greg.\nGreg Anderson: Drew, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. So on the current tone of our business for the third quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.66, our second consecutive quarter positive adjusted net income. While this quarter\u2019s adjusted results fell below initial expectations, we experienced non-recurring and unusual irregular operations. These incidents are not unique to Allegiant, nor do we believe they are systemic. The total cost impact during the third quarter for these elevated IROP events was around $28 million. Roughly half of this $28 million was driven by areas such as incremental contract labor, supply chain constraints and incremental ferry flights. The other half of our 3Q IROP costs and as Maury teed up, related to our compensation program for customers in which we aspire to do more to take care of them, if we significantly interrupt their trips. This past quarter, we paid $15 million to these impacted passengers. For example, in addition to credit vouchers issued to our customers, we may also compensate them between a $100 to $300 per eligible passenger to provide immediate support for reaccommodation. The purpose and intended impact of providing the additional compensation is twofold. First, and of course, to better assist our customers when unusual and difficult circumstances disrupt their plans. But second, and equally important to our bigger picture, it drives greater accountability to the financial, as well as the human impact of flight disruptions by really making the same for Allegiant. With that backdrop, our third quarter adjusted total costs increased 17.5% year over two years. However, excluding the $28 million in IROP costs has just outlined. This cost increase would have been under 10% on total system capacity growth of 14.2% year over two year. Turning towards the fourth quarter. Despite expected capacity growth of 12%. We expect unit costs excluding fuel to be slightly down to flat year over two year. This is largely driven by the increased cost pressure at our airports and ground service providers. Our expected 4Q CASM-X implies a full year 2021 adjusted CASM-X at around 2019 levels. As noted earlier, fuel costs continue to rise as we are currently paying $2.55 per gallon of fuel, a sequential quarterly increase at $0.35 per gallon. However, even at these elevated fuel costs, we expect our fourth quarter financial results to remain profitable and exceed third quarters adjusted EPS. Based on our fuel consumption and an increase of $0.10 per gallon of fuel equates to roughly $5 million per quarter. Moving to the balance sheet, as of today, we have $1.2 billion in total cash and improvement from the end of 3Q. As earlier this month, we received the remaining $116 million in our \u2013 in cash from our NOL refund. Also, and as of today, our net debt is around $400 million, a decrease of 60% since the beginning of the pandemic. For the full year 2021, we expect to reinvest $240 million back into the airline and increase in our guide by $20 million. And this increase is just primarily driven by our strategic parts purchasing initiative, along with some other non-aircraft CapEx. Year-to-date, we have paid down more than $200 million of our debt balances, $50 million of which was in the form of prepayments. This brings our current total debt to roughly $1.5 billion, a decrease of 5% since the beginning of the year. Looking towards 2022, we are in the mid innings, finalizing our 2022 capacity plans and expect to provide an update next time we speak. We are actually exploring a possible Investor Day/Call in December, and we\u2019ll keep you apprised of status in the coming weeks. Given the uncertainties with rising fuel labor and supply chain constraints, we intend to establish a baseline of capacity growth for 2022 in the low double digits area and harnessing the unique flexibility of our model, we are confident in our ability to spring up capacity, if and when appropriate. In addition, we have action working towards getting a couple of steps ahead of the growth by bringing on 300 frontline team members ahead of what we normally would, namely pilots, flight attendants and mechanics. And this estimate about a $15 million in incremental cost during 2022, when compared to historical staffing levels. Advancing these hires should greatly aid the quality of our performance by getting team members trained and experienced then as the choppy environment abates, we expect to naturally grow into these incremental heads. We are mindful of the looming inflationary pressures, where we can we are offsetting such pressures and examples of our few are as follows since the onset of the pandemic, we have acquired aircraft and spare engines are prices significantly discounted when compared to pre-pandemic levels. To-date, we estimate $150 million in direct savings here. Similarly, we strategically purchased $40 million with the spare parts that an average discount of 50%, another $20 million in savings. And finally, for these examples, our most carriers in our industry significantly increased their debt during the pandemic, we did not. As a result, our full year 2021 interest expense should be around 20% down year over two year. In closing, with fleet, we expect our full year 2022 airline gross CapEx, which includes capital leases to be around $350 million. This is primarily driven by $200 million in aircraft gross CapEx with the remaining $150 million, roughly split between other in heavy maintenance categories. As a reminder, our fleet plan includes 19 incremental aircraft to be placed into service throughout 2022, bringing our total expected fleet count by the end of the year to 127. Of these 19 aircraft to be placed in service next year, 11 have or will be acquired in 2021 and are already included in that 2021 CapEx guide. Eight aircrafts are slated to close next year of which six have been structured under a capital lease. As a result of these capital leases, our full year 2022 committed net aircraft cash CapEx is expected to be only $55 million. By year end 2022, more than 50% of our fleet will be comprised of 186 seat aircraft, which compares favorably to 2019 composition of roughly 25%, a 186 seat aircraft. The larger gauge 186 seat aircraft have additional benefit in a rising fuel environment as they are the most efficient in our fleet on an ASM per gallon basis. We expect full year 2022 ASMs per gallon to increase by 5% year over three year and at a $2.55 per gallon, this increased efficiency is worth roughly $30 million in fuel savings compared to 2019 fuel efficiency levels. And with that, we\u2019ll open it up to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James. Savi, your line is now open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just actually a quick question to start with. Greg, you talked about the liquidity right now being or cash being right now $1.2 billion. And I think the guidance is to $1.3 billion by the end of the year. Is there something kind of different the way the cash building \u2013 is building in the fourth quarter this year than past? Or are there other kind of inputs coming in?\nGreg Anderson: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other inputs, Savi. It\u2019s just \u2013 we\u2019re a little bit over $1.2 billion right now. And I think just the inferences that we\u2019re going to build cash through operational cash flow.\nSavi Syth: And then just a little bit more clarity on 2022 planning. So it sounds like the hiring is done for kind of operations levels above the kind of low single digits. Is that how you\u2019re thinking about it? And then you\u2019ll kind of grow into it, if you\u2019re comfortable with that operations or just looking for a little bit more clarity on how you\u2019re thinking about kind of hiring and then operating in 2022?\nGreg Anderson: Yes. We have, obviously our pipeline is full. We hired upwards of 270 pilots and these would sort of dovetail into March peak flying in addition to summer. We are seeing a little bit of a spike in attrition particularly on the any of those sides, it\u2019s not terribly materially yet. But I think those sorts of numbers would give you low double digit growth for the summer. Flight attendants, that\u2019s \u2013 that attrition is fairly stable right now. Mechanics is the big one. I mean, we were just very, very underwater when it came to being competitive. And so out of any of the areas, that\u2019s probably where we have to catch up the most.\nScott DeAngelo: Yes. So I maybe just to clarify, the low-double digit as well, what Maury can now look things, which I think I heard you maybe say, I just wanted to clarify that from.\nSavi Syth: Sorry. Yes, that makes sense. Thank you.\nMaury Gallagher: Thanks, Savi.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of MKM Partners. Conor, your line is now open.\nConor Cunningham: Everyone, thank you. Just on the budget for Sunseeker, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been finalized yet. So just curious where that may sit today, given all the supply chain issues and inflationary cost pressures. I just would think that it\u2019s higher than what you had previously kind of soft guided to, which was like, I think 510 to 550. So just curious on where that may sit right now or maybe why you haven\u2019t finalized it in general.\nJohn Redmond: It\u2019s a good point, I think. We and the rest of the world is experiencing these supply chain disruptions. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an industry that\u2019s immune to it or a product that is. So we know that the costs are going to be higher. We\u2019re still working through exactly how much higher, but it could be in the 10% to 15% range on the total project maybe even slightly higher. I think a lot of that we will understand as we move more into the end of this year and probably into Q3. So it\u2019s not only understanding better the impact of that supply chain disruption on costs, but also on timing. We are \u2013 of course, pre-pandemic were paced to open April of 2021, now everything\u2019s kind of been thrown into turmoil in that regard. So those two issues, both costs and timing that we\u2019re working through. But as I mentioned before, we know we\u2019re going to be over \u2013 we were at five, the carrying costs, if you will, throughout the pandemic, took us to like 510, and now it\u2019s just working through the order of magnitude above 510, but we know it\u2019s going to be, call it, in the 10%, maybe even 15% range and could be slightly higher. But it\u2019s just too early to give any degree of specificity on what that number will eventually be.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then more \u2013 I know you talked about the potential of slowing growth to maintain that historical fueled affair ratio that everyone always talks about. But a lot of the other airlines need to bring back capacity and just to settle like very non-fuel cost pressures that they\u2019re dealing with given no one made any infrastructure changes during the pandemic. So I\u2019m just curious and what gives you the confidence that the industry is going to file? What has historically been a good idea to cut capacity to drive here and I mean, I think the risk you run is like you caught growth and no one else does. And the reason why I bring it up, I just think it\u2019s a point that basically everyone\u2019s struggling with right now. So if we can just speak to the high level dynamics that you see playing out in general.\nMaury Gallagher: Well, you\u2019re spot on everybody that\u2019s sitting here today, if they had the decisions they made last December, January, and February for the summer of 2021, we\u2019d probably do it differently. At times, we were facing 10%, 15% of our personnel in maintenance in our MROs, where we\u2019re having our airplanes work worked on, they weren\u2019t in. COVID just rippled all through the summer. So we\u2019ve got a bit of a uncertainty that\u2019s in the organization right now as to what can we count on? Scott mentioned labor problems with our maintenance personnel, a lot of COVID issues with them in the different basis we have going through it. So we\u2019re assessing, where the personnel we need to be. We\u2019re hiring very actively. The irony of it is, I mean, everybody in this business is hiring yet, they still haven\u2019t gotten back to full capacity. So there\u2019s some incongruities as to what you have. Long-term, we\u2019ve always kind of run to our own \u2013 the beat of our own drum. First and foremost, as you heard Scott DeAngelo talk about the quality of our brand and the like is really got to be thought of very appropriately. And IROPs are just not long-term acceptable to us. And the irony of it is, this industry ran like a Swiss watch in 2019. And now it\u2019s almost like we\u2019ve forgotten how to run on time and deal with interruptions. But as in our case, we\u2019re definitely focused on getting back to a really solid operation something we can count on. And that\u2019s going to be a short term the next through the first quarter. Well, I think we\u2019ll have a good handle on what we\u2019re doing as we go into January, February and March. And then we\u2019ll reassess growth at that point. Could we grow more than the low double digits? Yes. But do we have to. No. I mean, again, while others may be growing, the beauty of our business model is we\u2019re still 75% on competitive, non-competitive in our root structure. And that\u2019s always been the case and we don\u2019t see that changing materially. So I like to get there quicker, if we can, but we\u2019re not going to sacrifice the \u2013 our customers and our own personnel that come with operational problems. But as I said in my comments, I\u2019m very bullish on the business model and where we\u2019re at, Scott De\u2019s revenues that are coming through, these third-party stuff is \u2013 you guys should really take a look at that stuff. That\u2019s very meaningful. Long-term, repetitive revenue that\u2019s going to be a very, very powerful for us.\nConor Cunningham: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie of Seaport Global Securities. Dan, your line is now open.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon guys. Few questions here. Going back to the supply chain challenges, being the number one, number two areas of focus. I\u2019m just wondering if you can clarify that a little bit more, what is within your control, what isn\u2019t and what is the level of confidence that the infrastructure is in place to protect the operations over the holidays? So I\u2019m just hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on that.\nMaury Gallagher: Let me give an overview and I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott, where there are certainly supply chain problems for us. The airline isn\u2019t as bad, I think is construction. And I think John would probably say, Sunseeker is a little more difficult than ours. At this point, the main thing is to make sure we don\u2019t over schedule the airline. And we have the sufficient pilots, flight attendants, maintenance can do their job. So we\u2019re very focused on that for the next 60 days. Scott?\nScott Sheldon: Yes. We\u2019ll get through the holidays. We have a couple tales that might bleed into Thanksgiving. But when you think about 2022 with 19 inductions, we\u2019re going to have 24 heavy maintenance events, a lot of the materials that have sourced is coming from outside the country. We operate out of six MROs in a number of different countries. I mean, the list is long, when you think about each one sort of has its own little corner case. We\u2019re definitely trying to simplify given our execution through the first nine months. If you guys remember the first quarter, it hit us as we\u2019re trying to wake planes up, MROs are scrambling to get their operations back online. So we\u2019re trying to either build in additional buffers, that\u2019ll just allow us to make sure we have the iron that we need. And then Greg and BJ\u2019s teams are trying to get ahead as much as they can on the supply chain. We have a bunch of max packs conversions next year, is that correct?\nMaury Gallagher: Everything should be onsite.\nScott Sheldon: Onsite, okay. That was a big piece is just getting Airbus kits for our max packs conversions. We\u2019re opening up some of these planes in a larger structural package that refining a little bit of corrosion. Like, anything can really increase the span, but it\u2019s a very much a high priority for us to sort of build in buffers.\nMaury Gallagher: But Dan, just to finish that. Everybody, when we came into the first quarter, we thought we were back in 2019. Demand was back. We just turn on the switch and it all runs like, we thought it would just all the variables there\u2019s debt by a thousand cuts. So think everybody\u2019s probably walking around on eggshells trying to make sure they don\u2019t over promise and under-deliver. So we\u2019re going to pull it back accordingly and variables we can control, we obviously will, but we\u2019re learning as we go.\nGreg Anderson: And Dan, it\u2019s Greg. I may just add one more comment to that on the supply chain really around parts and the like and that we have a mantra. We want to make sure that the right parts until at the right place at the right time. Just given the constraints that we experienced this past year, that wasn\u2019t always the case, but we have been proactively and for some time now trying to get ahead of that. We\u2019ve talked about the strategic parts initiative, where we\u2019ve gone out and we\u2019ve acquired $20 million \u2013 we spent $20 million for $40 million worth of parts and getting those in. We increased a little bit more on our CapEx guide this year to continue to try and get ahead, so that we can better support the operations and increase like max levels from an inventory experience perspective.\nDan McKenzie: Yes, thanks for that comprehensive answer. That\u2019s very helpful. And then I guess, second question here, Drew, from what I can see, it looks like over 50% of the overall capacity in at least November and December comes from holiday flying, but please correct me on that, I guess. So a couple questions, in the fourth quarter here, what percent of the flying is peak versus off peak. And then just with respect to the revenue forecast, what have you factored in for children getting vaccinated? And I guess, what I\u2019m getting at is just given the level of capacity that\u2019s scheduled over the holidays. It just seems like a small change in holiday command \u2013 demand, pardon me, could really move the revenue dynamic by tens of millions of dollars.\nDrew Wells: Yes. I mean, you\u2019re spot on with the last part there in fourth quarter, I\u2019m sure, my peers would agree. It\u2019s one of the hardest to forecast, because it is no back loaded, they have so much more time and variability built into that, particularly, when there are environmental concerns like we see today. I\u2019m not building in upside for children being vaccinated at this point. I\u2019ll take that upside as it comes and as we see it kind of be effective and prevailing. So that\u2019s not something I\u2019m currently contemplating. In terms of peak and off peak, if you\u2019re just thinking day or week, we\u2019re looking about 23% of our ASMs being on off peak days. What I would caution is that, an off peak day in the heart of Christmas is not the same as an off peak day in October, for example. So there\u2019s a little bit of probably misleading in that as it pertains to holidays in particular.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. Very good. Thanks for the time you guys.\nMaury Gallagher: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen. Helane, your line is now open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much. Hi, everybody. And thank you very much for your time. So not sure who this is for, but as you think about inducting aircraft into the network, I think you said 19 aircraft are coming in next year and I thought it was 24 aircraft going into heavy maintenance. How should we think about the level of aircraft that you\u2019re comfortable inducting? I mean, you\u2019re getting ahead of it on hiring, I guess, but what are you forecasting for total attrition for next year?\nScott DeAngelo: Hey, Helane. I should have mentioned this and BJ just reminded me of the 19 inductions all, but two are coming from FAA trace, which makes the induction that much easier. Obviously, labor, yes, I mean, that\u2019s really the \u2013 these are less complex inductions that we would historically, otherwise have.\nGreg Anderson: And Scott, maybe I can add to that we set up Melbourne right for an induction facility, where we just went out and this is a facility that we have Helane that is just 100% focused on induction aircraft knows the tail to at all times. And so we \u2013 this was unique that we went out and did this earlier this year in anticipation to make sure that for these induction pipelines and these aircraft that we have coming that we have some buffers built in there.\nHelane Becker: Got you. And then on the labor contract that was announced today, I think you said that the cost increase associated with that is included in the guidance. But can \u2013 if it\u2019s not, can you just give us some help on that one? And I \u2013 it may not be meaningful, I don\u2019t remember how many people that contract covers.\nGreg Anderson: Yeah. Helane, it\u2019s Greg. It is included in the kind of directional guidance that we provided. And the way, I guess, I would frame it is that maintenance makes up roughly 10% to 12% of our salary and wages. And the contract\u2019s worth roughly $12 million per year to five-year contract and then it\u2019s a little bit front loaded.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Are you having \u2013 actually, are you having to pay signing bonuses to attract people?\nGreg Anderson: Yes.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s kind of what I thought, but no, that\u2019s I\u2019m hearing that. Okay. Team, thanks for your help.\nGreg Anderson: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Duane, your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Just with respect to the sequential move in CASM from 3Q to 4Q, obviously, it was more than just IROP that impacted you in 3Q with the suboptimal operation. So how much of that do you get back or are you baking in getting back in the fourth quarter. And then apologize if you mentioned it, I know you\u2019ve given us a lot of qualitative guidance here. But on that low double digit capacity, how are you thinking about CASM-X year-over-year?\nGreg Anderson: Hey, Duane, it\u2019s Greg. I\u2019ll knock off the second part of your question first. And I think on that low double digits, we think that our CASM-X could be around 2019 levels, so $0.065. And then on sequential costs and perhaps just worth excluding IROPs, because we don\u2019t anticipate those would be the same level. It\u2019s pretty close on a gross basis. Keep in mind, I think fourth quarter ASMs are down a couple percentage points versus third quarter. So you got a little bit of pressure there. And then there\u2019s some headwinds in a couple different areas, pilot training, so the other line item, you have some pilot training coming through there. So that put a little bit of pressure on that along with Sunseeker getting ramped up and some op expense there. I think we talked about it on a quarterly basis. We think Sunseeker op expense is roughly $2 million and $2.5 million. And then with the hiring too, we mentioned those 300 incremental frontline employees starting to bring those in and things like that. So I think that too would add a little bit. But on off, I think roughly it would be slightly on a gross basis, fourth quarter higher than third quarter. But then, yes, just take into account the reduction in ASMs.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. I can follow up with you offline maybe, you lost me a little bit.\nGreg Anderson: Yes, I guess the punch line\u2026\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Ex IROP, you think CASM will be up sequentially, because ASMs are lower.\nGreg Anderson: Yes. With two pressure points, one being the labor, then we talked about the 300 incremental crew members coming on board more quickly there. And then the other being the Sunseeker starting to ramp up their op costs on that. So that\u2019s about $2.5 million. And then the training pipeline associated with that labor that I just mentioned. So that would put slight pressure on that as compared to the third quarter.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Brandon, your line is now open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, guys. So thanks for taking the question. Greg, can we just follow up there? I thought I also heard you say that profitability could be better in the fourth quarter. Was that a comment backwards looking, sorry, I just wanted to clarify that?\nGreg Anderson: No. Sequentially, I think profitability, we expect to be higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. That\u2019s based on the revenue guide and capacity guide that we put out there. And then we just kind of walked through the framework on the cost.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. And then if I\u2019m hearing you correctly next year, you\u2019re thinking CASM can be close to 2019 levels. It sounds like maybe if you didn\u2019t have some of these disruptions you could be targeting something lower and is that just gauge driven?\nGreg Anderson: Yes. I mean, that\u2019s \u2013 we certainly expect that getting \u2013 we are not going to have these disruptions next year, so that\u2019s not included in that number that I talked about the 6.5%. I think, you\u2019ll see some benefit, if there is an increase in capacity, but we\u2019re not planning on that. We\u2019re planning on the low double digits and that\u2019s the number I provided. But however, if you do increase that or take that up slightly, I think for every 2 percentage points increase in ASM, that\u2019s worth a $0.10 of CASM-X, if you will. But yes, I think the short answer is, we do expect right now where we sit based on the capacity guidance, the directional guidance we put out there that we could be roughly $0.065 in 2022 CASM-X.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I appreciate that. If I can just sneak in one more strategic question. I guess, how do you guys, look at the third-party travel sales and the ramp up that you\u2019re seeing there. And compare that to the strategy with Sunseeker, are these complimentary to one another and should we be thinking, these are both avenues of growth, so you could be looking at other property development opportunities in the future as well. Appreciate it.\nScott DeAngelo: Sure. I\u2019ll go ahead and start there. Scott DeAngelo here. There\u2019s certainly complimentary. Sunseeker is a stands today is in [indiscernible] one of right the 120 some odd places you could add and we want to sell hotels in the other 119, let\u2019s say. So by and large, they steer clear of each other, I think over time, and I\u2019ll let John Redmond speak to this. If and as, there\u2019s an asset light play, that gets a lot of these properties that belong to other major brands to say, hey, I want the Sunseeker name on my hotel. And by the way, I want the Sunseeker restaurant brands in there. Then one by one, right? We\u2019re able to steer or turn on or off any given product that we sell. So we can keep the lanes, if you will nice and clear.\nJohn Redmond: In addition to what Scott said, when you look at Sunseeker beyond the standalone opportunities, which are obvious. The other synergy there is you got a load factor impact on the airline with Sunseeker being open down there. It\u2019s kind of like when you look at Orlando or Las Vegas and what happens with the demand in these markets with the products they have here. So there\u2019s an opportunity there as well as credit card opportunity signups, et cetera. I mean, Scott has some amazing signup activity we\u2019re getting now, but once you open for resort and the additional opportunities you can drive it through credit card. So those are two major synergy opportunities you can see offer resort as well. And I don\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s another part of your question I may have missed, I\u2019m sorry.\nBrandon Oglenski: No, I think you guys addressed it. Thank you.\nJohn Redmond: Okay.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Andrew, your line is now open.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the questions. I guess, Maury, bigger picture here, right, like, you\u2019ve built an airline that generates good returns. You\u2019ve been focused on buying used aircraft. You get deals on spare parts, like, you talked about earlier. With Sunseeker and the budget increases and everything that we\u2019re seeing in the construction market spend here. And at what point does the budget get too much and you decide to either you stop or change plans here.\nMaury Gallagher: Broke up a little bit there, Andrew, I think you\u2019re asking would we stop building Sunseeker if it got too expensive. Is that your question?\nAndrew Didora: Yes, that\u2019s right. I\u2019ve given you a return, you\u2019ve built such an airline generating pretty strong returns. At what point does the budget just get too much that you maybe change direction a little bit?\nMaury Gallagher: Just based on what we know now, it\u2019s certainly not even close to that. The opportunity down there what we saw this spring just the Florida and everything else leisure demand you heard my comments that everybody\u2019s up with leisure, Southwest now is half of their flights touching Florida every day. Florida is like will be gone. That\u2019s where people want to go and we\u2019re \u2013 we couldn\u2019t be in a better place.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. I guess Drew\u2026\nMaury Gallagher: Revenue will conquer any budget increases here.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. I guess Drew, I think you gave the off peak ASM commentary about what 23% or so in 4Q. But just we\u2019ve been hearing a lot about the kind of the 4Q peak versus off peak environment. I\u2019ve been getting a lot of fair sale e-mails from a lot of different airlines of late. Can you maybe talk and maybe quantify what that gap is between peak and off peak? Can you maybe give us some sense on sort of where Thanksgiving week is booking up right now versus say maybe first half of November, anything to try to like help triangulate what that difference is between those the peak versus off peak times? Thanks.\nDrew Wells: Sure. I can maybe take this at a high level. I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll necessarily get an answer that, that you\u2019re looking for here, but ballpark, you\u2019re probably looking at your Thanksgiving flights running somewhere 33% higher revenue per flight than you would in Northern in earlier November. And I expect that\u2019ll grow a little bit by the time departures hit. So there\u2019s a pretty sizeable gap.\nSherry Wilson: Operator, are you still there for Andrew?\nOperator: Yes. Shall we proceed on the next question?\nSherry Wilson: Yes.\nOperator: All right. Next question comes from the line of Catherine O\u2019Brien from Goldman Sachs. Catherine, your line is now open.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the time. I had kind of a multi-part question on the third-party. Great to see that strength continuing. I guess, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Scott or Drew, but can you just walk us through how third-party per packs is up significantly when rental card days and hotel room nights are down so materially? Is that just pricing? Is over a 100% of the increased co-brand driven? If it is pricing, is that driven by lower supply of these products or is there something different about your partnerships now than 2019? Thanks for that.\nScott DeAngelo: You bet. This is Scott. I\u2019ll start and Drew, you can add in. So certainly, a lion share of it is co-brand and the continued surge that we mentioned over the last two quarters there. However rental car revenue has also up materially and that is average daily rate. I\u2019m looking at sheet here is up about 50% versus 2019 levels up of course lower rental days, but that is a supply demand thing. And then those are the main drivers right now. I mentioned last time, we\u2019ve identified a lot of technical solves for increasing the throughput for hotel. Right now you may recall that for every 15 hotels that get put in a shopping cart only one person checks out with them. But there\u2019s a variety of things that OTAs and hotels at their own site can do that we will be able to do that we expect to unlock that. But co-brand and then rental car based not on days, but on price per day or the big drivers there.\nDrew Wells: Yes. Not a lot to add here. We talked about it a little bit in the July call and it was part of the thesis for why we thought fall would actually have a bit of a higher floor because of where daily rates were on both hotels and rental cars kind of pushing some people out of the high price summer and into the fall now with the Delta spec that didn\u2019t manifest. But the underlying piece of high margin rental cars still persevered through the entire quarter and probably into the foreseeable future until inventory right sizes.\nMaury Gallagher: Let me just give some background overview. This is a long-term relationship with enterprise that started in 2005, and we\u2019re the only carrier I know. In fact, we sell more than virtually every other airline, if not the most in this kind of space. And we do that, because we\u2019re so tightly integrated with the enterprise as a good chunk of it. And so their pricing engine is able to drive our pricing. There\u2019s no manual activities. So I think we\u2019re substantially ahead of the industry. The airline side that is in offering cars and putting packages together that are very seamless and with the best opportunity to maximize revenues. And you are seeing that with unit revenues today. And you\u2019re seeing in car, I\u2019m sure if you\u2019re going out to buy a car, you\u2019re seeing sticker price plus 10,000 same things flowing through on the rental car side.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Yes, it\u2019s remarkable. Maybe just a quick one on a little bit of a follow-up to Conor\u2019s question on the Sunseeker budget. Just on that Castlelake financing you closed on, in the case the budget moves around, it sounds like you could maybe draw less than the 350, but correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Do you also have the ability to upsize that agreement in the case the budget does increase? Thanks.\nJohn Redmond: I\u2019ll take that one for you, but the \u2013 we don\u2019t anticipate having to go back with Castlelake, we haven\u2019t had any conversations with them about upsizing, nor does the existing agreement provide for being able to upsize it. Having said that, we don\u2019t see if a budget went north of what we expected to be a significant dollar amount, where \u2013 which is beyond our capability to finance, we\u2019re in a very liquid position. As you know, we\u2019re in great shape. It\u2019s not like this budget\u2019s going to run past us by hundreds of millions. We\u2019re not talking or looking at numbers like that. As I mentioned before, it could be 10% or 15%, but we\u2019re not hearing or seeing or experiencing anything beyond those types of percentages. So we don\u2019t see anything like that ever materializing going forward.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. So would that most likely just come out of cash on hand or r you\u2019d look to do another financing deal. Thanks for that extra one. Thanks.\nJohn Redmond: We would just look at that as being something that comes out of cash on hand.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Shannon Doherty of Deutsche Bank. Shannon, your line is now open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, it\u2019s Mike Linenberg here asking a question on behalf of Shannon. So I actually\u2026\nMaury Gallagher: Mike, you got somebody \u2013 is it heavier, Michael? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\nMike Linenberg: I\u2019m getting ready to retire Maury and go work for you.\nMaury Gallagher: Yes, right.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, listen, this is actually, John on your point about the Sunseeker opening March, I guess you said first quarter 2023, and you\u2019re going to start selling this first quarter of 2022. When I kind of look at Allegiant schedule, you take, you typically sort of sell out, I don\u2019t know, six, seven months, maybe it\u2019s 200, 220 days, or so has historically been the standard. Are you planning to open and just sell hotel or resort nights and not bundle with the airline piece? Are you considering maybe extending the schedule for Allegiant and selling out 300, 330, maybe even beyond a year I think we\u2019re seeing that with what frontier in some countries.\nJohn Redmond: We\u2019re not, it driven by in the past, this is before all, obviously all this pandemic stuff. We had conversations regarding that. And we know it\u2019s an opportunity and it\u2019s something that we could explore. It\u2019s not a requirement for us to go on sale. So if we wanted to go on sale as a land only product, if you will, without the ability to package the with there. We would definitely do that.\nDrew Wells: Yes. Mike, we\u2019re not out quite as far as we would like to be where we\u2019ve historically been. So what we\u2019re trying to push that back further out to that 10 or 11-month window. I expect we\u2019ll be able to get there in the next year or so. I\u2019d say without consulting, but I expect we\u2019ll be pushing back out further than we have over the last 18, 24 months.\nScott DeAngelo: One other thing I would add, because we\u2019re also exploring tactics like this and major sporting events and music events that may be sold 6, 9, 12 months in advance. Is that at the time of buying that there\u2019s a lot of interest I can tell you from our partners in those areas of having one in effect would be a credit much like you get an F&B credit, when you book a hotel room, well, in this case, when you book a hotel room 12 months out at Sunseeker, you\u2019re getting an Allegiant flight credit that as you get closer to your stay and that schedules out drives you back to allegiant.com to book your flight at that time. So there\u2019s a variety of ways to make the connection versus needing to have both the hotel inventory and the flight schedule in perfect sync.\nMike Linenberg: Yes, I think \u2013 go ahead.\nMaury Gallagher: The other thing, Michael, well, one other thing we\u2019re sending 40 to 50 million e-mails a week out who are audience. So the power of the direct-to-consumer is going to come into play big time here. And while the airplanes are good, we\u2019ve just seen it over and over all the new hotels here in Vegas, they get the love right out of the box. So it\u2019s going to be, I\u2019m not saying we won\u2019t use the airline, but I don\u2019t know that we have to, we certainly don\u2019t have to have the airline in my opinion to fill this thing up during the first 12 months to 24 months and beyond.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. Look and I know you guys probably better than I, but I know John had mentioned an opportunity to build load factor points. And I think that one of the things we do find interesting is that when you go very far out and people want to have everything settled. That in many cases, the way the pricing curve is you\u2019d think fares are a lot, the further out you are the lower they are, but when you go out, call it a year or more, what we\u2019ll see is that be for the planners, you\u2019ll get a better fare whether it\u2019s for the college graduation, the wedding, the et cetera. And so you may be able to tap into that. With the exception being that if you\u2019re in a situation that\u2019s inflationary and you\u2019re concerned about maybe input cost being a lot higher down the road, that\u2019s where I think you could get hurt. But I think getting that on the books and allowing people to plan that far out could be a nice bill that are of and revenue and load fact.\nJohn Redmond: We don\u2019t disagree with you at all. I think the thing we always have to take a step back and remember is 2023 won\u2019t be the only year we\u2019re operating the hotel. So we know it\u2019s going to be a transitory year where we\u2019re probably going to get more land only transactions than package type transactions. But as you get into 2024 or the back end of 2023, moving into 2024 and out, there\u2019s more traction with the brand, with the awareness. I mean, that\u2019s when the package activity will accelerate. So it was not something that we ever looked at as being an absolute requirement or necessary to fill a hotel, because of this lag. We know it\u2019s something that it\u2019s part of the longer-term strategy, but not a requirement for first year of operations.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. Just a follow-up, I know this is a strategic one here and I\u2019m going to make it quick. When the DOT came out with kind of a new ruling with respect to Newark, I thought it was very interesting that you guys were at least on record and maybe I misheard, but very quick to say, we\u2019re not interested. And I think about even your own trade group talking about carriers like yourself not having opportunities to get into airports that are congested whether it\u2019s Newark Liberty and DCA, and you could argue make the point that\u2019s an expensive airport to operate from on one hand. On the other hand, you\u2019re in the airport and you\u2019ve done pretty well. And you\u2019ve done well in airports like LAX and others. I\u2019m just curious why you went out on records and it seemed like it was pretty quick to say we\u2019re not interested. And again, maybe I misheard.\nKristen Schilling-Gonzales: Hey, Michael, it\u2019s Kristen. So\u2026\nMike Linenberg: Hey Kristen.\nKristen Schilling-Gonzales: So the main reason that we came out really quick on that was just with the size of that, that slot bundle. It wasn\u2019t something that we\u2019d be able to pick up and then to operate in the \u2013 in a timely fashion. So we have worked with our trade group on maybe other options for that, but for such a large slot all at once, it just was not \u2013 it wasn\u2019t going to work for us and we wouldn\u2019t be able to fulfill the requirements.\nMike Linenberg: Fair enough. Thanks, Kristen. Thanks, everyone.\nMaury Gallagher: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Hunter, your line is now open.\nHunter Keay: Thank you. The \u2013 I\u2019m trying to square Scott DeAngelo the commentary around low cost customer acquisitions with the $22 million you spent on sales and marketing, which is up about 25% from pre-COVID with your passenger count only up about 2%. I understand the whole ecosystem here. The card acquisitions are up and the rental cars and all that stuff that\u2019s great. But should \u2013 I guess the real question is, should I think about the sales and marketing line item is being a $100 million annual cost by starting next year or just going forward?\nScott DeAngelo: No, it\u2019s definitely not the latter. There are a couple things you mentioned in there and rightly call out incentives associated with card holder, new card holder signups. They\u2019re certainly in there. There absolutely are some increased costs as we\u2019ve came out of the pandemic and battled both OTAs and certain competitors in and around paid search. And there\u2019s also some one-time things just associated with production items and related in advertising and marketing. But as a general role, no, that, that shouldn\u2019t necessarily be just straight line in there.\nHunter Keay: Got it. All Right. Thank you. And then when you think about the operational challenges Maury that you guys just had, how do you think about this once Sunseeker opens? I mean is there going to be a requirement to be number one, number two, and the operations relative your peers every single month, because you\u2019re not just asking for someone to give you their business, because you have the lowest fair. You\u2019re asking for someone to give you their entire vacation. And if they have a bad experience in the flight, they may not book Sunseeker again. So have you thought about the importance being the best in the industry on ops once Sunseeker opens in any sort of expense that might have to come with that?\nMaury Gallagher: Yes. No, we definitely considered it Hunter, and I think what you\u2019re seeing in the industry and if you go back and look at 2019 numbers, the whole industry was so tightly bunched as far as reliability and on time. I mean the whole group was like 80% to 89% on time. I think within 14 and just everybody was running a 99 mid high, 99 reliability factor. So the industry can do it and we were right there. We don\u2019t ascribe to perhaps a Delta wanting to be the best on time, because a lot of our 2 times a week markets, we don\u2019t want to leave people. So we may run a touch late historically there, but you certainly have to have a good product. And in today\u2019s social media world putting aside Sunseeker, you just can\u2019t afford to have bad excursions and bad flights and things like that because it flight. So irrespective of Sunseeker, we need a good solid operation, and you know what Hunter, it\u2019s cheaper to run a good operation than it is a bad one. At the end of the day and you make the investments, you do what you have to do. And the beauty of when you\u2019re growing is you can always have a few extra people in there because personnel seem to be the problem child these days with all the different aspects of pilots and you hear just the whole world that of in transportation, truck drivers, anything involved with logistics or whatever is tough to come by. So you\u2019re going to have to make investments to stay ahead of that track. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re us Delta, American, United everybody\u2019s going to have personnel issues for the next few years I think. So yeah, no, we\u2019re going to run a good operation regardless. Will it help Sunseeker? Absolutely. But that\u2019s just a good quality product that we think we can get. And once again, when you\u2019re running a low unit revenue is 20% better than most of your competitors that gives you a little bit of cover up room too. And so the revenue side is really where you\u2019re hearing us continuously beat the drum to be better and get more unit revenue in on a flight by flight, person by person basis.\nHunter Keay: Thanks, Maury.\nMaury Gallagher: Yes.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Chris Stathoulopoulos of Susquehanna International Group. Chris, your line is now open.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So as I realize you\u2019re still setting your plans for next year, but as we think about your routes and what\u2019s happening here, the pressures and fuel labor and the need to stabilize the network. Should we expect a sort of is, at this point, is the idea to grow your routes, perhaps, historically you\u2019ve done low teens then it depends on routes with or without competition. But is the idea at this point, given these pressures here fuel, labor and stabilizing the network is the idea to grow the network in a similar fashion that we\u2019ve seen pre-pandemic or is it about filling out the schedule? And/or is it a little bit of both? Thanks.\nDrew Wells: Sure. Yes, I think it\u2019ll be a little bit of both as it traditionally is, our planning process revolves around trying to achieve margin targets that, that float a little bit depending on the strength of the period. I would say that we\u2019re probably \u2013 we\u2019ll probably tilt a little bit more toward filling out the schedule and right sizing existing then we build new over the first part of 2022 and of the summer. And that that\u2019s just based on decisions we have to make here in the short-term. But by the time, we get to the back half who knows that, that could invert one of the main staples here is flexibility and we\u2019ll be making real time calls on this into the first part of next year. So the answer I give you today could very well change by the end of January based on how the environment\u2019s shifting.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And the second question, so you\u2019re \u2013 you described I think in your prepared remarks as running a well oiled machine here. But as you\u2019re coming out of the pressures here in the network and you\u2019re looking to stabilize operations, relative to what you\u2019ve done in the past, which has been good. Is there \u2013 what have you learned here and what do you think could ultimately carry forward into 2022, 2023, the recovery where we could see a more efficient airline or perhaps a tailwind ultimately to CASM-X. Thanks.\nMaury Gallagher: Well, first and foremost, you have to have the people to run the airplanes and make sure they\u2019re maintained or at the gate on time. And you also had the what I call the operational overload or leisure overload. We faced a lot of station problems TSA, lack of TSA people, our Destin station had \u00a310 for a \u00a35 bag. Southwest showed up and put 12 flights in on an as, so that was \u2013 there was just a lot of dislocation and we\u2019re getting, we\u2019re back, we\u2019re getting so we can get our handle on this, but our first job in the next 90 days, 120 days is to get the personnel where we need. And we know that we can show up every day and fly the airplanes without missing the people to get the job done. Scott, I don\u2019t know if anything.\nScott Sheldon: Yes. I think the only thing I\u2019ll add is we could have taken a hard line approach. Certain, especially when the Delta variant hit pretty hard, I mean, we were losing 20 points of on time performance uncontrollable. We could allow people at the gate. We could have done a lot of things. And I think some of our peers took a harder line than we did. Considering some of the markets we fly, we took, we take the delay in order to get more people on the plane. But it\u2019s going to push downstream issues such as cruise timing out. But yes, no, I think in general you need stable labor. You need to know people can show up. They\u2019re not going to be on leave, they\u2019re not going to be impacted by more COVID-related issues. It\u2019s just going to take a long time. I mean airlines aren\u2019t designed to start and stop like this and ultimately that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. All right. Thank you for the time.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. Maury, you may continue.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you all very much. Appreciate your time. And we\u2019ll talk to you in the end of this quarter sometime in January, early February. Thank you again.\nOperator: Thank you so much to our presenters and to everyone who participated. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to the Q2 2021 Allegiant Travel Company Earnings Conference Call.  As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sherry Wilson. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nSherry Wilson: Thank you, Sati. Welcome to the Allegiant Travel Company\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today are Maury Gallagher, the company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Redmond, the company\u2019s President; Greg Anderson, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Scott Sheldon, our EVP and Chief Operating Officer; Scott DeAngelo, our EVP and Chief Marketing Officer; Drew Wells, our SVP of Revenue and Planning; and a handful of others to help answer questions. We will start the call with commentary and then open it up to questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. The company\u2019s comments today will contain forward-looking statements concerning our future performance and strategic plan. Various risk factors could cause the underlying assumptions of these statements and our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. These risk factors and others are more fully disclosed in our filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements are based on information available to us today. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise. The company cautions investors not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which may be based on assumptions and events that do not materialize. To view this earnings release as well as the rebroadcast of the call, visit the company\u2019s Investor Relations site at ir.allegiantair.com. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Maury.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you, Sherry and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us again this quarter. We had an excellent Q2 quarter as our numbers showed, while we averaged only a 65% load factor in April and May on average June\u2019s 77% brought us \u2013 brought the quarter average up to 70%. As is usually the case, June dominated the quarter with over 40% of our passengers and departures in that one month. These highlights from June in the quarter provide the backdrop for our comments today and our cautious optimism for the remainder of this year and on into 2022. We peak our operations every summer for approximately 75 days from Memorial Day through mid August. In this particular quarter, we grew capacity 3.3%, while June was up 12.6% this is against 2019. This peaking also applies to the major support partners, critical to our operations. The often repeated shortage of personnel in the past 60 days was a critical problem for our operational partners including TSA, our airport contractors, fuel suppliers and others, which have resulted in less than a stellar operation.\nJohn Redmond: Thank you very much, Maury and good afternoon, everyone. First and foremost, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredible team members we have, who make it all happen and put us in this enviable position of producing these incredible results. As Maury stated, we have made the decision to restart and finish construction of Sunseeker resort. You may recall on May 12, 2020 during a Q1 earnings call, I made the comment we would suspend construction for 18 months until we had greater clarity on business impacts from the pandemic and ensuring we had a better, stronger balance sheet. 14 months since I made the comment and 17 months, since we stopped, we have that stronger balance sheet, I referenced significantly stronger, I might add. We recently signed a non-binding term sheet to borrow $350 million with the resort as collateral and Allegiant guarantee, a structure that gives us the best flexibility and cost. We expect to have final loan docs completed within the next 30 to 45 days. Now for some additional Sunseeker data points. We will announce the start date and opening timeframe at a press conference to be held at the resort site in Charlotte Harbor, Florida on August 3rd. Our media relations team will announce details to the press as we get closer to that date. This will be the only opportunity for members of the media to access the site, since it will be an active construction zone. We will host an Investor Call on August 5th to discuss all things Sunseeker. The format will be similar to an earnings call with management presentations followed by Q&A. We intend to leave enough time to answer all questions because we will provide this dedicated opportunity, we will not be taking any questions regarding Sunseeker during today\u2019s earnings call. Please save your questions for the Investor Call next week.\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, John. From a marketing perspective this past quarter, we saw the strong return of domestic leisure travel demand and we laid a foundation with major initiatives that we expect to drive continued strength throughout the remainder of this year into next year and beyond. Visits to allegiant.com were up by 5% this past quarter versus 2019, while transactions were up by 10% in the same time period. The fact that transactions increased the double the rate of web visits points to Allegiant\u2019s tightened brand awareness, increased marketing efficacy and enhanced web and app experience. All of which combined to attract and convert more new and more returning customers in the lowest cost ways.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott. Thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. Revenue momentum continued into the second quarter with total revenues down just 3.9% versus the second quarter of 2019 on scheduled service ASM growth of plus 4.5%. Essentially, all of this growth came during the peak of Memorial Day through the end of June, included in that number is incremental breakage associated with credit vouchers amounting to roughly 5% of the quarter\u2019s revenue. A huge part of this growth is the increase in our total ancillary revenue by 2%, despite carrying 11% fewer passengers in the quarter. As Maury mentioned, our bundled air ancillary program launched in fourth quarter 2019, and while ancillary more than held its own through the pandemic. The recovery is helping to showcase the significant value of the program aided by website redesign can deliver. As we continue to test product mix and pricing as well further develop the program to appeal to a broader subset of itineraries, bundles will continue to produce value. Additionally, the RM Team has done a phenomenal job alongside EHI and Scott DeAngelo team managing a unique rental car market, despite the sizeable reduction in inventory available and in turn car days sold, we recorded the highest net revenue figure in company history. These, along with the co-brand wins we\u2019ve got our fantastic story and made even better by passenger trends continuing to improve as well. Loads have improved sequentially in each of the last five months. And we\u2019ll do so again in July, as we will cross the 80% mark. All of the above sequential improvements led to total revenue in the month of June 2021, surpassing June 2019 total revenue, despite headwinds from fixed fee and other revenue. I expect the third quarter, we\u2019ll replicate this and we are guiding 3Q total operating revenues to be plus 3.5% to plus 7.5% versus the third quarter of 2019. We will accomplish this scheduled service ASM growth between plus 16% and plus 20% versus 3Q 2019. As opposed to the second quarter cadence, however, this growth percentage is relatively level across each month. We are built to follow seasonal demand trends of the leisure customer. And this year is no different as we anticipate September flying to be about 50% of July ASMs. While still early, demand trend looks fine for the off-peak and I\u2019m pleased with how capacity and demand are aligning there. A sizable part of the growth through the back half of year will come on new reps, from year-round service to hyper seasonal one weekend route end. We will have 100 new markets to begin the service between April 1 and December 31 of this year. Among those routes, our service to four new cities announced in the second quarter, Minneapolis, Amarillo, Washington Dulles and Melbourne, Florida, in addition to complimentary Phoenix services, Sky Harbor. For context, roughly 13% of third and fourth quarter ASMs will come from routes in their first 12 months. This is about on par with the distribution during our network investment and the groundwork laid in 2015 and 2016. We\u2019re not the only carrier interested in pursuing new leisure opportunities. However, as Maury mentioned, our current competitive overlap outlook is virtually identical to our 2019 position. And with that, I\u2019d like to pass over to Greg.\nGreg Anderson: Thank you, Drew and good afternoon everyone. Before I begin, I too want to echo others\u2019 comments and thank our team members for their incredible commitment, drive and hard work over the past quarter as we continue to ramp up. So looking at the current tone of our business for the second quarter, we reported GAAP net income of $95 million or $5.49 in earnings per share. Adjusted net income, excluding the impact of PSP was just under $60 million or $3.40 per year of nearly $7 per share from the previous quarter. This increase in EPS is with the added headwind of the incremental shares issued with the common stock offering during the quarter. So for the remainder of my prepared remarks, I will plan to reference adjusted numbers only, which excludes the impact from PSP. Second quarters substantial margin improvement was fueled by June\u2019s performance as its total revenue was the highest monthly revenue in our company\u2019s history. Now, this does include a tailwind resulting from recognition of incremental voucher breakage revenue, as Drew mentioned. So early in the pandemic, we extended the expiry of our vouchers to 24 months as such. We appropriately adjusted our estimated breakage rates in order to monitor for variability and customer redemption patterns. As we continue to observe sustained trends that reflect no meaningful changes to these redemption patterns, we have updated our estimates accordingly, which has also been incorporated in our forward revenue outlook. So even excluding this breakage tailwind, June was still a top three all-time revenue month. Turning to costs when comparing 2Q results with the previous quarter, our adjusted non-fuel costs increased sequentially by only 5%, which is well below our sequential ASM growth of 15%. Our reported adjusted unit costs excluding fuel came in at $5.86 for the second quarter down 1% year-over-2 and in line with expectations. Moving to liquidity adjusted EBITDA came in at $138 million just shy of our average per quarter during 2019 yet further strengthening our conviction of getting back to $6 million in annual EBITDA per aircraft. The hefty cash generation during the quarter was aided by forward booking strength as evidenced by the increase in our total ATL to $440 million, an increase of 8% sequentially. We reinvested $46 million back into the business during the quarter in the form of airline CapEx, which includes $28 million for the purchase of two aircraft, $9 million for spare engine \u2013 for a spare engine and the remaining for kits and parts for future aircraft. Adjusted free cash flow generation of $100 million during the quarter aided our total ending balance of $1.2 billion and $400 million of net debt. These balances exclude the $136 million of incremental cash we expect to receive in the coming months in the form of our NOL refund. Our already strong liquidity position was greatly enhanced by the equity raise in May, which resulted in $335 million in incremental cash to the issuance of 1.6 million shares. This opportunistic equity raise was very well timed to balance growth capital for the airline, while also limiting dilution. Our fortress balance sheet will serve us extremely well as we continue to grow the airline and take advantage of the numerous aircraft opportunities we see in front us. Turning to our second half of 2021 outlook, based on current trends, we expect the back half of 2021 capacity to be up around 18% year-over-2 using such capacity assumptions, adjusted unit cost, excluding fuel should come in around $6.3 for the back half of the year, which is 6% less than the same period in 2019. Since our last earnings call, these estimates reflect incremental costs of around $10 million per quarter, primarily spread over areas such as stations, labor, and sales and marketing. Addressing these essential areas help us stay a step ahead. So for stations a major driver are strategic wage increases, our third-party service providers need in order to remain competitive in light of staffing challenges. I might add this isn\u2019t unique to Allegiant as all carriers and other industries seem to be experiencing staffing challenges. For labor, we are hiring additional operational heads to ensure we are prepared to support not only our stated growth targets, but also future longer term opportunities. For sales, we\u2019re seeing an uptick in total credit card processing fees, that\u2019s primarily due to the higher than expected bookings, which I also might add as a high quality problem to have. And finally, for marketing, we were planning for some additional strategic marketing spend, which we believe will be accretive to the bottom line. So even with these incremental costs, I just outlined, we still expect our full year 2021 CASM-X to be around $6.2 cents, nearly 5% below 2019 levels on a capacity increase of roughly 10% year-over-2. Combining our second half 2021 cost expectations with our 3Q revenue guide and current booking trends, we expect adjusted full year EPS to be more than $5 per share. This assumes fuel at $2.11 per gallon for the back half of 2021 or $2.3 for the full year as John mentioned earlier. This also takes into account the incremental share count as a result of our equity offering. So getting back to sustained earnings enhances our flexibility around minimum cash levels and deploying excess capital, our top priority, with such excess capital is to reinvest back in the airlines, followed by de-leveraging. We expect our total full year 2021 airline CapEx to be $220 million, additionally, based on current debt maturity profiles. We expect our ending 2021 balance of gross debt to be $1.5 billion. Turning to fleet, during the second quarter, we placed into service three aircraft bringing our total in-service aircraft at June\u2019s end to 103, and expect to have an 108 aircraft in service by year\u2019s end. Since the onset, the pandemic, our fleet team has now signed up 24 A320 series aircraft 21 of them since the beginning of this year, all at an average price discounted by 30% when compared to pre pandemic levels. And in fact, I\u2019m excited to announce that just this week we finalized the deal with Air Lease for the acquisition of 10 A320 series on aircraft under a finance lease. All aircraft are expected to enter service in 2022. A press release followed by an 8-K will be forthcoming. These deliveries largely round out all the aircraft needed for next year. And our plan includes 19 incremental aircraft to be placed into service throughout 2022, bringing our total expected fleet count by the end of next year to 127 aircraft. Our fleet strategy gives us enormous flexibility in the coming months and years, as we have the optionality to pace our growth to not only match demand, but also ensure it is in lock step with our operational support. We will be finalizing our 2022 budget this quarter and expect to provide its outlook during our October earnings call. Lastly, on fleet, all the aircraft we\u2019ve signed up since the onset of the pandemic will be inducted into service at 186 seats bringing our estimated total of 186 seat aircraft ending in 2022 to 71, which equates to roughly 55% of our total fleet. By way of comparison, the 186 seat aircraft only made a 26% of our total fleet back in 2019. The higher gauge 186 produces more EBITDA per aircraft than our other two configurations of 156 and 177 seats. In closing with Sunseeker, and as John noted, we have a non-binding term sheet under our Sunseeker subsidiary to borrow capital to complete the construction of our resort. I wanted to reframe that this debt is secured only by the assets under our Sunseeker subsidiary with the guarantee from Allegiant. We believe the materially lower interest rate enhanced flexibility in larger advanced amounts by having a corporate guarantee outweigh the benefit of a non-recourse structure. So with this debt financing, this project is expected to be fully funded with no additional equity capital from Allegiant. We are excited about restarting the project along with the increased optionality its completion brings and look forward to providing further detail on August 5. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator:  The first question we have Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Joseph, your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll let someone else ask about Sunseeker and respect your wishes. Drew, I think the plan is to end 2022, you said it 127 aircraft. I guess that suggests the potential for pretty good growth in 2022. So can you just \u2013 if you put that into context, how you\u2019re thinking about ASM growth and then Greg with what seems like good growth next year, can you talk about the cost leverage that you could get off of that potentially? Thank you.\nDrew Wells: I think I\u2019ll provide a little bit of a disappointing answer. You\u2019re right. We have the potential for growth up to that, but we haven\u2019t yet said any sort of 2022 targets. We\u2019re in the final strokes of planning the spring now. And summer is obviously going to be, I think, a longer stall. So there\u2019s a wide range of options still available for 2022. We\u2019re happy with where the ceiling is, such that we can reach all that potential. But like Greg said, we\u2019re going to be moving in lockstep with the operational groups and making sure that we\u2019re growing at the appropriate measured rate.\nGreg Anderson: And Joe, just on the cost front, we\u2019ll have some more a better outlook next quarter after we have our budget finalized. But just in general high level, I think we have really good control over our costs. The unit cost will depend on the growth that we haven\u2019t yet set, but overall I think we can drive low and in the $6.10 to $6.30 kind of range for next year 2022 based on capacity growth. Some of the headwinds that I think that we might face this year as compared to \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, next year as compared to this year would be labor. Just did I mentioned, we\u2019re staffing up operational groups to support growth. Also this year, we just didn\u2019t have that much profit sharing as we normally have. So I think that too next year, we expect to be profitable, which will put some pressure headwind on that. Also I think some tailwinds there will be ownership. I think we\u2019ll get some benefit there as we continue to kind of better utilize our aircraft and we\u2019ll have to see what the capacity outlook that we put out, but there could be tailwind there. Along with stations, some of our stations costs that we\u2019re seeing, I think there\u2019ll be some benefit in particular like airport landing fees. We have right now there\u2019s some pressure there this year, just giving kind of less capacity from an industry perspective. But those we think will level out is full industry capacity starts coming back. So stay tuned. We\u2019ll have more information, but thought we just provide a little high-level there for you.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Yes. That\u2019s helpful. And then Drew, I think a couple of quarters ago, you said that the network was maybe 10% to 15% competitive and Maury, in his remarks, said its 75% non-competitive. So can you just reconcile that and maybe just, I know there are a million different ways to calculate that, but can you talk about how you\u2019re maintaining a similar level of kind of non-competition across the network with what seems to be increased competition?\nDrew Wells: Yes, I mean, it really depends on kind of the starting point that you\u2019re looking at for your frame of reference here. I mean, in the middle of the pandemic, we were down, I believe as low as 13%. I don\u2019t have that number in front of me, but about 13%. And then we just kind of moved back from that. So the amount of capacity that came out has now largely been matched by the amount coming back in to put it back at those 2019 level. So it\u2019s really just a timing element there of pandemic and changes to industry networks. In addition to all of the announcements that we\u2019ve made that have by and large been somewhere in the \u2013 I believe 5% to 10% competitive range. So we still continue to do our end of this by continuing to diversify away from competition.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: For the next question, we have Catie O\u00edBrien from Goldman Sachs. Catie, your line is open.\nCatie O\u00edBrien: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Maybe just one on the fleet. So you\u2019ve talked about that you\u2019ve sourced 21 incremental aircraft since the start of the year. But your 2021 CapEx has remained the same since February. So did you have line of sight to these aircraft deals back then? Or should we expect CapEx to step up a bit next year as the rest of those aircraft deliver?\nGreg Anderson: Hey, Catie, it\u2019s Greg, it\u2019s a great question and helpful for us to clarify that. Several of the aircraft that we\u2019ve acquired like the deal I just met mentioned with Air Lease. Those are on a finance lease. So I think from a net CapEx perspective we\u2019re roughly in line. So I think of those 10 aircraft, four will be delivered this year in 2021, and then the remaining will be next year, but under a finance lease, we didn\u2019t update our CapEx guidance to reflect that. And then but still that those 21 numbers that we put out there today for full year airline CapEx. We feel good about that from, I guess, to put it in like a cash \u2013 CapEx perspective.\nCatie O\u00edBrien: Got it, got it. Very clear. And then maybe a question for Scott, so last quarter you were kind of hinting that we had some coming asset, like co-marketing and sales channel partnerships sounds like we got one with the Live Nation announcement. I just want to better understand how these types of relationship works. So is it just like if someone buys a concert in Vegas was maybe a credit card billing address or something like that outside of Vegas? Will they get an email from Live Nation pushing Allegiant there or how does that work and then just like really high level \u2013 how does the payment structure work for that type of marketing opportunity? Thanks so much.\nScott DeAngelo: Yes, you bet. And thanks for the question. You\u2019re exactly right from the customer point of view. Two things will happen and the select Live Nation and Ticketmaster venues that we\u2019re partnered with as they buy a ticket, they will be presented with Allegiant. And of course, ultimately here at allegiant.com, we will be able to sell take an inventory to those venues and events. But moreover behind the scene, one should think about this as data, a digital and of course, as we mentioned a commerce partnership. And so it\u2019s the nature of the partnerships that enable us to reach so many more consumers in the markets that we collectively serve. And be presented up exactly, as you said, sometimes digitally, sometimes physically but gaining access to individuals and potential reaching customers in a very focused and targeted way. And this time, we\u2019ve released that it\u2019s a multiple year we look forward to having a long-term relationship but aren\u2019t disclosing any other financial arrangements other just say that it\u2019s a two-way deal where we will be looking to help them as a partner and they will be looking to help us as a partner.\nCatie O\u00edBrien: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: For the next question, we have Helane Becker from Cowen. Helane, your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, Operator. Hi everybody. And thank you very much for your time. Just kind of curious about fuel availability on \u2013 at some of your smaller airports on the West Coast, how is that working out for you? Are you able to get what you need? Are you tinkering, how should we think about that? And if you\u2019re tinkering what\u2019s the cost that we should think about that maybe not be there once this issue ends?\nScott Sheldon: Helane, this is Scott Sheldon. Yes, we\u2019re \u2013 what we\u2019ve seen really since early summers, there\u2019s upwards of 20 markets basically in the Midwest and the upper Northwest, some still to this day don\u2019t have any availability. So all this is tinkering more often than not than most missions can be accomplished just by tinkering. There\u2019s very few situations where we got to do it, fuel text up. As far as the cost, clearly \u2013 the cost of extra pounds but you\u2019re starting to see what used to be upwards of 20 markets. I want to say, I saw a list it\u2019s upwards of maybe 13. So as fuel production comes back online trucking and fuel supply logistics come back online. That stuff will be available there for normal operations.\nHelane Becker: Got you. That\u2019s very helpful. And then the other question, I have not sure who can answer this, or if it can be. But as we think about that capacity that you were talking about for 2021 and rest of 2021 and 2022 had the pandemic not happened, what would the base have been like in 2020 so that. On a \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you can do this, but on an adjusted, like pandemic adjusted basis, what\u2019s the actual growth rate versus the year-over-2 number?\nJohn Redmond: Yes, I\u2019ll take a stab. Obviously don\u2019t have the exact number off the top of my head, but we\u2019re going to be relatively close to where we expected on kind of that two year horizon. I mean, if we\u2019re 20% now, right, there\u2019s going to be just shy of 10% CAGR on both of those years. So maybe just a tick below where we had expected, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re entirely far off where we thought we\u2019d be at this point.\nHelane Becker: I\u2019m sorry. That was a better way. Go ahead.\nMaury Gallagher: We moved the first two months of the year 16%. So that gave you an indication. 2019 was not as much growth it\u2019s only 9% because we are limited airplanes coming out of 2018 when we finished our transition. But we were fast looking to pick it up a little bit as we went into 2020.\nHelane Becker: Yes. Okay. So that\u2019s really helpful. All right. Well, thanks, Maury. And thanks team. Thanks for those answers. Very helpful.\nOperator: For the next question, we have Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Mike, your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a quick one here on when you look at the markets that are the traditional Allegiant markets, now we have, I don\u2019t know, four or five carriers you seem to all be targeting some of these interesting markets, like Mesa, Arizona, Punta Gorda, Bellingham. And I\u2019m just curious on the surface, it looks like you\u2019re going to have a lot more competition on one hand. On the other, some of the city pairs are different and in fact it may actually there\u2019s a halo effect, I guess, if you will, that these airports that we\u2019re probably not on the radar screen, when you have a Southwest airlines now flying to Fresno and Bellingham and the Florida Panhandle, that there actually may be some benefit to Allegiant, especially if these markets aren\u2019t duplicated from a city pair presence. So just curious on whether or not it\u2019s driving more traffic to some of these smaller airports and there\u2019s a halo effect and you\u2019re benefiting from it. Thoughts on that. Thank you.\nDrew Wells: Sure. Yes, Drew here. At the time of announcement, we definitely see kind of a traffic halo effect. I think probably still early to say what the long-term impact of that\u2019s going to be. I\u2019m certainly going stop short thing that I embrace their presence in our airport. But in terms of traffic and awareness, I think you\u2019ll definitely see them in the short term. And we\u2019ll circle back in 12 months and talk about the long-term.\nScott Sheldon: The only thing else I would add there is depending on the carrier, as you all well know, we are all non-stop flights and in many cases where those competitive routes are really bringing someone stay to Las Vegas to connect on a flight to somewhere else. It\u2019s kind of the halo effect that is driving exposure from in that case and origination point. But it does very little actual competitive damage since the person really isn\u2019t flying to be where our endpoint is. Thank you.\nMaury Gallagher: Yes. Just finished out, Michael, we all were just everything we do is point to point. So you don\u2019t have any hub. A lot of this activity, even Southwest anymore is going through a hub. It\u2019s a connection. So if you\u2019re doing BWI to VPS, that\u2019s nice. But if they\u2019re connecting all the way up into the Northwest or into some of our cities, it\u2019s not as competitive of product we think. So we\u2019ll see.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. And then just one second question on as we think about PSP and the various restrictions that it does have on Allegiant, Greg, maybe can you just remind us, at what point did the shackles come off and I realized there\u2019s a really cheap loan that you\u2019re benefiting from. And so I\u2019m not sure sort of where things come out whether or not that has to be paid down completely before you could reinstitute a dividend potentially consider share repurchases pay executives more handsomely than in the past. What\u2019s the timing on that? And how are you thinking about that, since among all the carriers you\u2019re in the best position to kind of come away from that and to get out from under the microscope of the government.\nGreg Anderson: Mike, thanks for the question. It\u2019s Greg. Shackles come off October 1 of the next year in terms of a dividend, the ability to issue a dividend again and share repurchases and the like there. In terms of like executive comp restrictions, I think that\u2019s April 1 of 2023, just to put those two into perspective and we are in a nice liquidity position as we talked about. We have the largest shareholders sitting here to my left. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we consider returning value to shareholders, either through the form of a dividend when those shackles come off or even looking at a share repurchase, but nothing to speak to you today. It\u2019s just something we\u2019ll keep in mind back there \u2013 in the back of our minds. And then I would just say to your point about executive comp and just, I think that the company, Maury, John and the board has done a really nice job of getting creative to ensure that our executives and our senior leadership team are well taken care of through the pandemic and beyond. And so we tried to get accretive in that way. And I just \u2013 my sense is that everybody\u2019s pretty happy with what they\u2019ve been able to do.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Great. Thanks Greg. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: For the next question, we have Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore. Duane, your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. I appreciate it and congrats on these results. Just with respect to the breakage, what line does that fall in? Is it all passenger revenue or base fare and could we see more breakage in future quarters?\nGreg Anderson: Hey, Duane, this is Greg. I\u2019ll kick it off and if Drew wants to add. It\u2019s basically spread throughout, so you\u2019ll see it in Sched and third-party disproportionally. So I think about it from that perspective. And then the way I would just think about it on a go-forward basis as in the second quarter, really why you saw the number as large as you did is that we were catching up, right. And then, so I think on a go-forward basis, I would just expect it to be back at a more of a normalized run rate pre pandemic.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, great. And then in the disclosure just going back and looking at hotel room nights, so almost 73,000. Can you talk about attach rates if I recall Vegas had a higher attach rate, so maybe you could talk about, where attach rates are trending and how you see that across some of the bigger leisure destinations?\nGreg Anderson: Yes, I will kick that off, maybe then, Scott, if you have anything. The biggest thing to watch with hotel room nights and what we\u2019ve kind of tracked historically is the distribution of seats that touch Vegas. Our cash rate here is by far the best in the system, and we\u2019ve kind of slowly been drifting away from Vegas as a percentage of the whole, really over the last 10 years. And so you\u2019ve kind of seen that through the hotel results. Of course, that\u2019s offset by the higher east coast presence in a rental car, so that there\u2019s a pretty clean correlation between that.\nScott DeAngelo: Yeah. And I would say strategically, there remains a lot of upside. I provided a similar metric back in 2019, but I have an updated one. For every one hotel stay that is attached. There are 15 that are actually put in the shopping cart but not checked out on. So a lot of what we will be doing to help bridge the difference in those 14 that make it all the way to the shopping cart, but don\u2019t get checked out a variety of these initiatives, Greg referenced some strategic marketing initiatives and are part of just our continued digital evolution in the next six to 12 months.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And then just on Vegas specifically, and I don\u2019t know if you have a you\u2019re not revenue managing hotel rooms yet, but to the extent you have a view into Vegas, what are you seeing into the fall in September, specifically as some of these large conferences come back online. We\u2019ve heard anecdotally rates are very high relative to kind of where they\u2019ve been.\nScott DeAngelo: No. In general, Vegas is holding up reasonably well for us into the fall. Certainly it doesn\u2019t experience this quite the same seasonal chaos that Florida will through September and through the fall. On the hotel side, things still look fine. And in general, kind of on par with what we\u2019ve seen for the summer, I would stop short of saying that we\u2019re a big beneficiary of conferences directly, especially as it comes to the hotel. We\u2019ll see a little lift here and there, but it\u2019s not quite as clean as conference comes back, we should see a massive uptick here. I pause a little bit short of that.\nJohn Redmond: The one additional point I\u2019d make about Las Vegas is where we are a direct beneficiary and inextricably linked. We\u2019ll be on the \u2013 at least nine weekends of NFL games at Allegiant\u2019s stadium. Many have seen that six of the top 10 selling NFL games is determined by overall secondary market ticket prices. Our home games here at Allegiant stadium and Drew and Chris and team have done a terrific job of standing up capacity in those visiting markets, be it Chicago, Baltimore, et cetera. And so for the leisure traveler on those weekends and there\u2019s a variety of other major events that will be happening. One, the yield should be way up hotel to directly answer your question. And two, Allegiant does have a very natural play, and we\u2019re seeing that pay dividends with the investment with Allegiant Stadium.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks for the thoughts.\nOperator: For the next question we have Savi Syth from Raymond James. Savi your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Just curious of \u2013 I appreciate the longer term outlook here, but curious on how you\u2019re thinking about how post summer looks like in the third quarter?\nJohn Redmond: Savi, in terms of what demands or\u2026\nSavi Syth: Exactly. I mean a lot of your seats, I think, are in September. So are you expecting the load factors to drop or yields to drop? Or how should we think about how post summer looks this year versus kind of historical or even last year?\nJohn Redmond: My view on September, and keep in mind, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, September is still about 50% the size of July. So it\u2019s still the smallest portion of the quarter and really even the year. So with that, I do think that there\u2019s a chance load factor will step back a little bit. It naturally does. I do think the floor continues to lift a little bit on what it could be people that were priced out of summer trips because of hotel rates, because of rental car inventory and rates, will be kind of shifting that travel into the fall period. So I do still expect a leisure fall off as we would always expect, but I do think the floor is a little bit higher than normal.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. And then on the aircraft side, just curious how many of the aircraft that you\u2019ve secured has been since the capital raise, which is four aircraft and just kind of tied to that from an operational business by Scott or Greg, just historically, I think of Allegiant taking about one aircraft a month, and that\u2019s something that the team has been able to handle without too much disruption. So what\u2019s your view on taking 2021 aircraft next year?\nGreg Anderson: Savi, it\u2019s Greg. I\u2019ll kick it off and then turn it over to Scott or BJ. here. 13 since the capital raise is how many we\u2019ve signed out, 13 aircraft this quarter post May. In terms of bringing these aircraft in the pipeline, Scott Sheldon and Robert Neal here and their respective teams have put together a really nice facility, induction facility in Melbourne to make sure that we kind of derisk that pipeline and getting those aircraft going through. But BJ or Scott, anything you want to add on that front?\nScott Sheldon: Yes, I think the \u2013 I think in order to obviously deploy the aircraft, the hiring for pilots started early July. So we\u2019re hiring upwards of 270 pilots, upward of 360 flight attendants. And I suspect that the hiring cadence won\u2019t end. We\u2019re kind of at the upper threshold of what we can do just from a training footprint internally. And so it\u2019s \u2013 the factory is back in high gear, so to speak.\nSavi Syth: Got it. Thank you.\nMaury Gallagher: Savi, it\u2019s Maury. One other thing, too, that we\u2019ve got to get the system back in place too. The biggest surprise to me is the dislocation of everything that\u2019s going on, personnel being the number one issue. Many people are leaving bags and people at the gate because they can\u2019t get through TSA. I mean it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s an amazing kind of, as I said, the rust is still lingering around the operations. So that\u2019s going to be, to me, a marker as to how fast we can get into 2022 as well. But we certainly \u2013 if you go back and look at the operations of the industry in 2018 and 2019, it was really top notch. And the industry has not held its end of the bargain up, but so much of that, too, is not under our control. I think we\u2019re short 10,000 TSA agents, something like that. So yes, it\u2019s got to \u2013 we got to get the whole system back up, all the supply chain conversations you\u2019re hearing, we\u2019re right in the middle of one of ours.\nOperator: For the next question we have Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Hunter, your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Thank you. Hey, Scott DeAngelo, as you studied other loyalty programs in the airline industry, what are some of the biggest features obviously not of your own of competitor programs that you find people really strongly dislike the most.\nScott DeAngelo: Thank you for the question, Hunter. The biggest thing was we found \u2013 and just about 30% to 40% of our customers are members of name-your-top program, SkyMiles, Rapid Rewards, Advantage. The big thing was about 90% said they didn\u2019t benefit from those programs. They never flew enough to earn any kind of status, certainly not enough to get a free trip anywhere hence why we chose kind of the Apple Card, if you will, for those familiar with that, where you spend money, you get \u2013 in our case, points that don\u2019t affect currency and you use it anytime you want for anything you can buy at Allegiant.com. What I think they dislike the most is the moving around of \u2013 and I\u2019m going to include myself in this one. They\u2019re moving around of \u2013 some days, it\u2019s 20,000, some days it\u2019s 60,000 miles and other days, right, even if there\u2019s seats on the plane, there\u2019s blackout date that they can\u2019t use their miles. So those would be the direct answer to your question that we decided just not even to play in that space, just given the \"Allegiant money\", if you will, we don\u2019t call it that, but that\u2019s in effect what it is and let them spend it they see fit.\nHunter Keay: That\u2019s interesting. Thank you. And then Drew, the demand for leisure travel is amazing right now. I got to say all things considered. Are you starting think that maybe leisure travel is not as elastic as maybe a lot of us thought it was? Or is this just kind of a flukish situation because of this perfect storm of stimulus money and low industry supply and pent up demand? How is what you\u2019re seeing right now in informing your overall sort of decision-making on revenue management over the next couple of years?\nDrew Wells: Yes. I\u2019m certainly inclined to believe the first 19 years of our company\u2019s history over the last 12 to 18 months in terms of price elasticity and customer behavior. I think this is very much the perfect storm of virtually missing out on an entire year of travel, stimulus checks, things really coming together to kind of drive different behavior. I think this really starts to revert to normalcy really even in the back half of this year, by and large, I mean, we\u2019re even seeing it now. It\u2019s kind of \u2013 you\u2019ve seen our loads return at the expense of some yield, which was our strategy all along to hold the yield up at the expense of load. So I think we\u2019re in the midst of seeing that return to normalcy now, and we\u2019ll be back full-fledged pretty soon.\nHunter Keay: Got it. All right. Thanks a lot.\nMaury Gallagher: Thanks, Hunter.\nOperator: For the next question we have Dan McKenzie from Seaport Global. Dan, your line is open.\nDan McKenzie:  questions here, with respect to the aircraft order, the 19 new aircraft next year, suggests you could potentially hit the 2024 aircraft goal of 145 planes a year early. So I guess first question here has that fleet goal changed?\nGreg Anderson: Dan, it\u2019s Greg. I\u2019ll just say that, yes, it gets us a nice head start on that. If you take a 10% CAGR in 2023 and 2024, I think that puts you closer to 160. But as you know, we\u2019re always opportunistic here at Allegiant when it comes to acquiring aircraft. So we don\u2019t have an order out there or anything like that. We\u2019ll continue BJ Neal and his team will continue to look at the market and see what\u2019s available. But yes, it gives us a nice jump start on that and if you just take a 10% CAGR on those outer years, you\u2019re up to closer to 160.\nMaury Gallagher: Well, I think \u2013 an add-on, Dan, too, is that if we have good deals on airplanes, which are presenting quite a few, we should buy those airplanes sooner, but that doesn\u2019t translate into you\u2019re going to put them into service right away. Operations will dictate that, but a good deal is a good deal and the marketplace won\u2019t hold these deals forever so.\nDan McKenzie: Yep. Understood. Okay. And then just also a multi-year question here, as you think about the business, reverting back to the $6 million in EBITDA per aircraft. Given the digital efforts that I think past Investor Day\u2019s you\u2019ve said are 3x the profit potential of the airline operation. Could the real answer be a profit contribution that\u2019s more than $6 million per aircraft in the next cycle? And, does that include and apologies for the Sunseeker question? Does that include a Sunseeker contribution? And I guess where I\u2019m going with this is, if the goal is to have 145 or 160 aircraft, potentially in 2024, that seems to imply over $30 a share in earnings. And I guess, just big picture, is this how you\u2019re thinking about running the airline.\nGreg Anderson: Dan, it\u2019s Greg. Perhaps I\u2019ll kick it off and Drew, DeAngelo or anyone else that may want to jump in here on the EBITDA per aircraft. The first, no, it does not include Sunseeker that would be excluded from it or getting back to that number. As you think about it, I mentioned that the \u2013 we\u2019re bringing on one more 186-seat aircraft. And in 2019, those aircraft produced on average $8 million, maybe a little bit north of $8 million per aircraft EBITDA per aircraft per year. So I say that to say we believe that we can get back to that $6 million in EBITDA per aircraft. That\u2019s our goal today to get to restore that as soon as possible and I do believe that there\u2019s upside to that as well. And where we\u2019re at, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of my skis here and say we think it could be this or that. But job number one is getting back there. We feel like the cost structure is in place to support that and then Drew and Scott DeAngelo on the revenue side, see what they can do there, which would only help enhance that. Scott, Drew?\nScott DeAngelo: Yes. The only thing I would add is just strategically, I think you\u2019re spot on. I know I\u2019ve said it before, the most expensive to any business ourselves included, can do is attract customers to their store, in our case, a digital store, Allegiant.com. Once in the store, the most accretive thing we can do is have them add more things to that shopping cart. And so we talk a lot here about selling beyond the aircraft. So yes, base fare, but all the air ancillary that Drew talked about, the third party and to double emphasize what Greg said, there\u2019s absolutely upside as we\u2019re able to sell more of different things beyond the aircraft to the customers that who are already paying to come into the stores, just getting them to put more in their cart.\nDan McKenzie: Understood. And if I just squeeze one last one in here Drew, 13% of the ASMs in routes less than 12 months. I\u2019m curious one, what the resin discount, the system average resin was in the second quarter. And then as we look at 2022, what should we anticipate in terms of the percent of flying that would be in markets less than 12 months.\nDrew Wells: Thanks. Yes, I don\u2019t have the 2Q number in front of me in terms of resin than discounts. So I\u2019ll have to come back to you on that one. But in terms of route distribution, it\u2019s only 7.4% in the second quarter, there really is a back half of the year story in terms of new routes. So being 7.4% you\u2019re going to be relatively in line with what we\u2019ve done over the last three to four years. So you probably wouldn\u2019t notice anything material on a comparison basis. Going into 2022, I still anticipate a fair amount of new route growth. I think the distribution will come down a little bit as we do more same-store growth, kind of filling in some gaps there. So I\u2019d expect something south of that 13% to 14%.\nDan McKenzie: Very good. Thanks for the time you guys.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you, Dan.\nOperator: For the next question we have Conor Cunningham from MKM Partners. Conor, your line is open.\nConor Cunningham: Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. It seems like you\u2019re clearly prioritizing yields during the recovery of overload factors. Just on the other side of the pandemic, should we assume that you\u2019re willing to take a lower load going forward as maybe trying to protect yield? Or are you going to revert back to your historical norm or trying to just get people on planes and then drive revenues with the ancillary fees. Thank you.\nDrew Wells: Yes. Conor, more generally it\u2019s promoting load factor over yield as we look forward. Really the question for us came down to the size of the demand pool and as the demand pool is smaller, we thought it made more sense to prioritize the yield if we weren\u2019t stimulating enough incremental customers to fly with discounted rates. As that pool as generally returned to on par if not larger for us here into the summer it made sense to revert back to kind of older strategies of pushing that load. Now that 100% of the network is all the way there yet, and there are places where yields still make sense, but by and large the rule of thumb is pushing that load factor once again.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, great. And then you guys would just have interesting data points on your customer base. And so, I think in the first quarter you mentioned that people that have booked their phone on your airline have a vaccination rate of above 70%. So curious where that sits today? And the reason why I ask is, there\u2019s a lot of conversations going around about the delta variant mass and all that stuff that could hurt demand. And it just seems like your customer base is more insulated from any COVID-related issues kind of going forward. And I appreciate the time. Thank you.\nScott DeAngelo: Yes, I\u2019ll quickly answer that. It basically is in the high 70s, so much like we\u2019ve seen everywhere else. Three months later it\u2019s climbed up as many as 8 percentage points, but in that 80-20 long tail from here, not just our customer base, but the nation as a whole.\nConor Cunningham: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: For the next question, we have Chris Stathoulopoulos . Chris, your line is open.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. So two from me. As we work into leisure recovery here and looking at costs, are there areas that you\u2019re doing better in versus others that perhaps have come on faster than you might\u2019ve expected or might be harder to work off as you pull back up and capacity.\nGreg Anderson: Hey, Chris, this is Greg. I just want to \u2013 you broke up there for a minute there. On the cost side, you just want to know if there\u2019s areas that we\u2019re performing better as we pull up the capacity, I just want to make sure I understood it, right.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Yeah. Areas that you\u2019re doing better a few months ago when demand really started to take off relative to today, areas that you\u2019re perhaps outperforming and versus areas that there\u2019s a little bit more pressure than you expected or perhaps areas that might be harder for you to work off through productivity or other measures. Thanks.\nGreg Anderson: Okay. I got you. Okay. So some of the areas that I think we\u2019re doing a lot better on today is even as compared to the pandemic as we ramp up. In our other area and our other line item, we\u2019ve seen some benefit from things such as taxes and just training, efficiency, things like that. So we\u2019ve driven some tailwinds on that front. I\u2019ll say though, as we start to ramp up, we\u2019re going to see we bring on more pilots as Scott has alluded to, we\u2019re going to probably see some headwinds down the road on that, but I think where we sit today, we feel good about that. Some of the headwinds that I mentioned earlier, like on the airport cost, we think those are transitory. Those will go away. We also mentioned that our ground service providers in my opening comments, I talked about that, are inflationary, and we\u2019re doing what we can to make sure that they have the pay to remain competitive there. But ultimately, the other areas that we\u2019re trying to do better on, I think, from a capital perspective as well is like aircraft, I mentioned as BJ and his team are out there finding aircraft for 30% discount, that\u2019s meaningful savings in this pandemic world. To put that into perspective, if that $6 million per aircraft that\u2019s discounted, we just signed up 24 aircraft since the onset of the pandemic. That\u2019s like $150 million you\u2019re saving. Last quarter, I talked about a little bit the strategic parts initiative, where we went out, we allocated $20 million for strategic parts that we ended up getting like a 50% discount. So essentially $40 million worth of strategic parts that we paid $20 million on. I mean those are ways that we are, I think, taking the \u2013 what the pandemic has thrown at us and being more efficient, combating some of these inflationary costs and just doing the best we can in that regard. So I hope that answered your question, but let me know if anything I could follow up on with that.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay and just as a follow-up on the other side, curious \u2013 and I know what makes your model unique is you have a relatively lower route overlap, but could you comment at all on the fair dynamic you\u2019re seeing? And if possible, split that between some of the larger network peers and then versus some of your low cost and ultra-low-cost peers? Thanks.\nDrew Wells: The first thing I\u2019ll note here is our general overlap with kind of mainline legacy flying is pretty low. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to give you a great read-through on that front. That\u2019s not fairly well biased by sample there. In general, there\u2019s been a lot of commentary lately from other carriers about third quarter yields being flat as some folks even have mentioned the same thing for June. I think the pricing environment, at least from where we sit in the leisure world, primarily into leisure markets is that pricing is fairly healthy. I\u2019m not concerned with what I\u2019m saying. We pushed higher yields in all three months of the second quarter. And like I said, we\u2019ve heard the same from others. So I\u2019m not at least seeing a lot of weakness from where I sit.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Maury Gallagher for closing remarks.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you all very much. We\u2019ll see you in 90 days. Have a good evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for participating.

[Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Sherry Wilson. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nSherry Wilson: Thank you, Cherry. Welcome to the Allegiant Travel Company's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Maury Gallagher, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Redmond, the company's President; Greg Anderson, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Scott Sheldon, our EVP and Chief Operating Officer; Scott DeAngelo, our EVP and Chief Marketing Officer; Drew Wells, our SVP of Revenue and Planning; and a handful of others to help answer questions.  We scheduled today's call for 75 minutes to ensure sufficient time for questions. We will start with some commentary and then open it up for questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. The company's comments today will contain forward-looking statements concerning our future performance and strategic plans.  Various risk factors could cause the underlying assumptions of these statements and our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. These risk factors and others are more fully disclosed in our filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements are based on information available to us today. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise. The company cautions investors not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which may be based on assumptions and events that do not materialize. To view this earnings release as well as the rebroadcast of the call, feel free to visit the company's Investor Relations site at ir.allegiantair.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Maury.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you, Sherry. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you again for joining our Q1 call. First, let me take a moment and thank all of our team members, their spouses, families as they continue to fly our passengers in these difficult times. They've been the true warriors for our side of the house here. Thank you again. I'm extremely excited about our future, more so than I have been in previous quarters. I expect traffic to continue to grow in the coming months. Based on the data we're seeing, I would say we are back. 2021 and beyond, I believe, will be as good or better than I could have hoped. In Q1, we had EPS of $0.42 and EBITDA total of $68 million for the quarter, but the thing that was very positive is each month of the quarter was a positive EBITDA number. Understand both of these numbers include our PSP amounts of $92 million. I want to share with you some interesting facts that I've seen and concerning the impact of the pandemic and how it's affected us and others. One, our balance sheet is in much better shape than before we entered the pandemic, particularly as it relates to cash. By the end of Q2, our cash balance will have more than doubled to $1 billion, and this is measured since the end of 2019. While our cash balance has been growing, our net debt balance has actually declined over $50 million. By the end of the year, we could be approaching $500 million of net debt, down from $950 million at the end of 2019.  An interesting stat I was taken with last year was we generated $235 million of positive cash from our operational statement off our cash flow things for 2020 as a whole. The industry, during this time, lost $18 billion from operations. And I might add this includes $800 million of losses from the other ULCCs. Lastly as a factoid. During Q1, without any PSP, we only had a $15 million EBITDA loss or a negative 5.5% margin. The remainder of the industry's EBITDA loss for this quarter just ended was $9 billion on $15 billion of revenues or a 60% negative margin. My conclusion from that is our personnel, our model and our excellent management team have done yeoman's work during this difficult year. We were the first to get back to positive growth. We did this just this previous quarter. We were the first to achieve positive EBITDA late last year. And we are among the first to achieve positive EPS; and we did that, again, this quarter. We are fortunate to be a domestic leisure-oriented carrier. Leisure is king today. Business and international traffic continue to substantially underperform. Profile of our customer and their behavior is an important distinction in our model. Our leisure customers are made up of millions of individuals, families, small independent units that make personal individual decisions to travel and spend their funds. Business traffic has a different decision process. While there are millions of business travelers, as we know, their decision to travel in most cases is ultimately controlled by the company's senior management, namely given dramatic circumstances, company business travel is stopped. We have seen this phenomenon 3 times in the past 20 years, 9/11 obviously. The great financial crisis shut down a good chunk of business traffic. And obviously, this past year with the pandemic. These have been full-tilt stopped traveling business -- traveling decisions for business customers. This has been devastating to the airline and travel industries, particularly those focused on that business customer. Allegiant has lived through 2 of these massive shutdowns, and while we were certainly impacted by the pandemic this past year, we candidly didn't even feel the GFC. Our leisure customer profile and our flexible model allow us to bounce back faster than everyone else, including our other ULCC compatriots. This has been the backbone of how we have built this great company. We had a terrific 2019 and we're off to an excellent start in early 2020. We just had to wait a delay of a year so we could get back to it. Vaccines have been a terrific catalyst, as we all know. And combined with people's strong desire to get out and go has made for a really nice rebound that we're seeing these days. We believe our income levels for the remainder of 2021 and '22 and beyond will meet or exceed our last full year of '19. We want to be a leader in this effort and take advantage of our great model in the coming years and plant flags as we attack more than 1,000 markets that we have -- routes we have targeted. We have upped our game substantially in the past 3 to 4 years. Our brand is extremely well positioned. We've made some bold moves that have worked out extremely well, as Allegiant Stadium has been all we could have hoped for and more; and continue beating the drum for our model and its flexibility which allows us to both shrink and rebound. It continues to demonstrate its benefits, allowing us to separate ourselves from the competition. This is particularly evident when you review the industry's operating margin results for the past 20 years. From our beginning in 2001, we've averaged over 15% in operating margin during this 20-year period, while the next closest carriers, Alaska and Southwest, have been at 10% margins. Perhaps the best highlight of the past few months has been the elevation of our status from a noun to a verb. From what I've heard, we were the standard of comparison for recent IPO road show efforts as well as for the group of start-ups that are showing up at this point. 20 years ago, most in the airline space didn't consider us an airline, which was fine by me. No one paid attention to us, but today we are the model to follow. This is the ultimate compliment from your industry peers. In closing, I can't tell you how proud I am again of this group of team members, particularly those who have carried water on the front lines this past year. They have been the true heroes in our part of the world. Every day, they have boarded their airplanes and carried our passengers safely and on time during these trying days. John?\nJohn Redmond: Thanks very much, Maury. Good afternoon, everyone. As I did in previous earnings calls, I thought it would be helpful to provide some directional data points to help you understand how we see things in 2021. Given our domestic leisure-focused business model, we are in a better position than other carriers to look beyond a month without hope and a prayer being part of the commentary. Having said that, these directional guides assume no significant changes to the environment we are operating in. The industry and the country are seeing a slow and steady return to normalcy and expect that to continue as more restrictions are lifted. All financial data provided is on an adjusted basis, which excludes of course the benefits from the CARES Act and PSPs. Furthermore, fuel is assumed at $1.99 a gallon. We expect our cash balance to be around $1 billion at the end of each quarter going forward for the balance of '21 and, of course, with an ever-improving net debt. And looking at costs, we see full year CASM-X less than Q1 '21. Supporting that view, our FTEs per aircraft should be down more than 10% versus 2019 even though our average number of aircraft are expected to be up over 20% by year-end. Furthermore, our Q2 CASM-X would be less than $0.06. Greg will provide further commentary on Q1 CASM-X. Every quarter in '21 should have positive EBITDA, and Q2 EBITDA will be around $100 million. EPS every quarter for '21 should be positive as well. In regards to airline growth. I mentioned in my comments in the last earnings call we have never been more excited about the growth opportunities in '21 and beyond. To that end, it is our intention to grow the airline, by the end of 2024, to north of 145 planes. It goes without saying there is a lot of planning that goes into such growth, and we have been working on that in earnest for the last several months. Our deep knowledge of the domestic leisure customer, coupled with our aircraft acquisition experience and strong and getting-stronger balance sheet, allows us to execute on such a strategy better than anyone. In regards to Sunseeker, we've been getting quite a bit of interest of late and would hope to get something done that would allow the project to start before the end of the year. We are exploring many different approaches as to how the additional funds will be raised, so to comment on how a [indiscernible] transaction could shake out or look like would be premature. While the speed of our recovery may be surprising to some, if not all, it has come about due to the dedication, passion and hard work from our incredible employees. You are simply the best and our results are proving it.  With that, I'll turn it over to Scott Sheldon.\nScott Sheldon: Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Let me first start off by saying thanks and expressing how proud I am of the entire Allegiant team and all of our partners throughout the network. Our operational results in the first quarter were terrific despite some unique challenges. It goes without saying our team members and partners are truly the ones that make this business successful, and this entire management team salutes you each and every day. Congrats. Moving on, what a difference a quarter makes. Flying production continue to build as we turn the page on 2020. For the first time in what seems like forever, we experienced our first normalized operating quarter in more than a year as we ended up with just over 3% capacity growth compared to the first quarter of '19. Our core operating -- operational performance metrics were up virtually across the board, with the exception of controllable completion, which I'll touch on that in a second. Our team's execution produced seasonal bests for D0 and A14 at 72% and 80.7%, respectively, once again on a full schedule as compared to first quarter of '19.  Excluding the impact of extended weather delays, which was particularly bad this quarter, our controllable A14 was exceptional at 93%. Although our flying activity returned to pre-COVID levels in the first quarter, it wasn't without significant challenges. Our controllable completion percent, which ended up just north of 99.5% for the quarter, was far below our historical norms. A key driver of this were bottlenecks encountered in bringing flying assets back on the line to match first quarter capacity demand, particularly for the ramp-up in late February and March. As with most carriers, throughout 2020, we deferred as much heavy maintenance and induction work as possible to minimize cash burn until there was a much better line of sight on demand. All these deferrals created much needed cash savings. It also created a significant backlog of aircraft with enhanced work scope requirements required to return to service. During the quarter, we inducted 5 used aircraft and had as many as 32 separate heavy maintenance events, not an ideal scenario as our core MRO partners, OEM and parts suppliers and logistic companies have been slow to ramp back to full capacity. The end result was north of 85 maintenance cancellations due to lack of aircraft and drove just over $6 million in irregular ops costs. In closing. I'm excited to maintain the momentum we've built as we move into the second quarter and into the back half of the year. We've weathered the induction and heavy maintenance constraints from the first quarter; and we appear to be back on a normal cadence, which is critical. Although the back half of the year is aggressively scheduled and MRO pipelines are getting tighter, our plan has largely been derisked, thanks to the tireless efforts and creativity of our maintenance, planning, induction and engineering teams. Equally as important is looking forward to having all of our third-party suppliers and partners back online and operating at full capacity. Currently the majority of our ground-handling service providers are experiencing staffing challenges. Namely, they're finding it difficult to recruit and/or retain the necessary head count to run their businesses at pre-COVID labor rates, which is a direct result of the multiple stimulus rounds. On the direct labor front, our pilots, flight attendants, mechanics who were either furloughed or on extended voluntary time-off programs have been recalled. And we are pushing them through respective pipelines as we speak. Training classes for all disciplines will begin mid-summer and into the fall to meet March peak and summer of '22 flying. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott D.\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, Scott. Building on prior comments. This past quarter clearly marked a positive turning point in customer sentiment and demand for leisure travel. Back in the first week of January, only 1/3 of our customers said they believe things were getting better in terms of COVID-19, yet by mid-March, that number had nearly tripled and around 90% said things were getting better. This fundamental customer sentiment driven by a combination of vaccine progress and destination reopenings was highly correlated with when and with how we saw demand return. That is to say each month of the quarter showed marked improvement, with March booking levels, as already mentioned, performing around 2019 levels. However, it's worth calling out that, while demand is increasing upward, it's also expanding outward. And we're beginning to see more normalized leisure travel search and booking behaviors. Advanced purchase timing for the first week of 2021 was nearly half of what it was in 2019, yet as we finish the quarter, advanced purchase timing for the last week of March had greatly increased and was virtually identical to that same week in 2019. Further to this dynamic, the volume of flight searches being performed by customers at allegiant.com continues to outpace 2019 levels, especially for mid- to late summer months, suggesting additional waves of leisure travel demand are continuing to reenter the market and are searching for travel time periods that they're most comfortable with.  Of those customers who have already flown or booked Allegiant this year, more than 70% report having already been vaccinated. As mentioned last call, staying close to and winning back those customers who flew Allegiant in 2019 but haven't flown since the pandemic began is our priority focus. And I'm pleased to report that we've already recaptured nearly 20% of these customers and their itineraries and that those who have still not booked report overwhelmingly that they had flown no other airline during this time and consider Allegiant their top choice by a wide margin over all other airlines considered for their next trip.  Once again, our direct-to-consumer approach has remained a critical differentiator not only for selling directly to but also communicating directly with our customers, enabling us to stay close this past year. Our approach to capturing demand continues to be rooted in cost discipline by heavily leveraging our owned media channels, namely our website and e-mail marketing, both of which achieved first quarter web traffic increases versus 2019. This helped us once again achieve incredibly low sales and marketing costs on a per-booking basis that were 80% below pre-pandemic levels. And lastly, with our enhanced digital commerce assets in place that is both our new website and new mobile app, we turn our focus to launching our broad-based non-card loyalty program later this year; and to expanding our leisure offerings at allegiant.com not only in existing hotel and rental car categories but also through launching vacation rental inventory, more than 80,000 properties nationwide, with our newest partner bookingpal.com. And of course, we look forward to soon offering travel packages for Allegiant Stadium events this fall. Moreover, we continue to explore asset-light co-marketing and sales channel partnerships that enable us to broaden our leisure travel ecosystem and that give us privileged partner relationships that enable us to reach millions of new customers in markets that we and those partners collectively serve.  With that, I'll turn it over to Drew.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We continued to see sequential revenue improvement in the first quarter, with scheduled service and total revenues each down 38.2% versus the first quarter of 2019. Our ancillary revenue per passenger was down just 0.2% against the same time frame and remained a great story considering it is half of scheduled service revenue. This contributed in a large way to our total fare per passenger being down just 8.9%. We ended the quarter with significant momentum through the back half of March that carried into April. April revenue will be quite close to the March number even despite less capacity for the first time in company history. A lot of this is due to what Maury mentioned. Our April load factors were roughly 10 points higher than March. And in fact, despite moving beyond the peak spring break and Easter time frame, loads have improved in each of the last 8 weeks. Furthermore, most of those weeks were also positive ASMs year-over-2 year as we ramped into the peak. In total, April and May will be roughly flat capacity versus 2019 before the growth resumes in earnest during June, producing the 2Q ASM guide of plus 2% to plus 6% versus 2019. Some of that growth is slated for the newest Allegiant cities of Portland, Oregon, which began service in April; along with Jackson Hole, Wyoming and Key West, Florida, which take flight in June. Those are among the 51 new routes beginning service in the quarter. We are thrilled with the booking performance of our new contingent routes and what they add to the Allegiant network. Along with the ASM guide, we are guiding 2Q scheduled revenue -- scheduled service revenue to be between down 6% and down 10% versus 2019. I'm ecstatic to see numbers in the single digits, and I really look forward to flipping that sign in time. Fixed fee margins have been greatly impacted by the amount of supply and lower demand in the market, and we responded by looking to deploy more flying and in particular valuable peak-day flying to the better current returns on the scheduled service side. While we had a great run of fixed-fee flying through the college basketball March Madness tournament, that is certainly more of a one-off benefit for 2021, and fixed fee revenues are likely to remain under pressure.  The strength in demand we're seeing continues to give us conviction in the potential for the back half of the year. We have the crew and the aircraft in place to grow approximately 20%, and our current selling schedule through mid-December reflects that intention. That selling schedule includes the announcement of our newest base in Austin, Texas. We've served Austin since October 2013 and have had success growing a wide range of route opportunities and are elated to make it a stronger presence in the future of our network. And with that, I'd like to pass it over to Greg.\nGreg Anderson: Thank you, Drew. And good afternoon, everyone. We continue on our path of leading the way and restoring earnings power as we deliver on our tried and true business model that provides affordable, convenient and reliable air travel to residents of underserved cities. Over the years, we have consistently produced industry-leading returns for our shareholders. We are a long-term-focused bunch and taught to think like owners, particularly when the tone is set at the top by Maury, who since our company's inception has been -- has not only been at the helm but also our single largest shareholder. One of our key focus metrics is restoring our EBITDA production to pre-pandemic levels, which is more than $6 million in annual EBITDA per aircraft. So starting with the current tone of the business. During the first quarter, our average daily bookings came in just under 5 million per day, which translated into an average daily revenue of 3 million. The quarter ended strong as March came in like a lion, with average daily bookings exceeding 6.5 million per day, ahead of 2019 levels; and driving more cash flow as our ATL increased by 100 million or 33% from December to March, this despite the travel voucher portion being down 19%. Additionally, we saw a couple key metrics during the first quarter which already outperformed 2019 results. One is capacity. Our focus on 100% leisure, 100% domestic and our only nonstop flights, plus strength in demand, resulted in March capacity of nearly 1.9 billion ASMs, the highest single month in our history. Another is cost. Our first quarter adjusted CASM-X, which excluded PSP benefit, is $0.0636 or 5% below the same period in 2019. And perhaps worth noting, our adjusted CASM-X for the quarter is by far the lowest reported by a carrier. It is half of the industry's reported average of $0.127. We are excited in getting back to pre-pandemic results, and the catalyst that enables us to lead the way is the flexibility of the business model. Our one-of-a-kind, low-utilization and high-variable-cost structure aided us in generating $168 million cash from operations during the first quarter, which is more than the first quarter in 2019 and helped push our ending March cash balance up to $730 million. Additionally, we have $260 million in cash that comes in after March, roughly $150 million from our NOLs, $98 million from PSP3 and a $14 million top-up for PSP2. Pro forma, the $260 million in these cash proceeds brings our first quarter cash balances to nearly $1 billion, thus resulting in a March pro forma net debt position of roughly $630 million or a 33% reduction from year-end 2019 balance. Moving to our second quarter outlook. We expect to induct 5 aircraft during the quarter to bring our total in-service fleet count to 105 by June's end, an increase of 19 aircraft compared to June of 2019. These additional aircraft are already being put to work, as capacity during the second quarter is expected to be up around 4% year-over-2 year. It is also notable second quarter daily bookings haven't skipped a beat. April continued to roar with average daily bookings around 6.5 million per day, which is 8% higher than April of 2019. The strong rebound we are seeing in our business supports our second quarter scheduled service revenue guide of down 6% to 10% year-over-2 year, which translates into revenue per day of $4.8 million, nearly 60% higher per day than the first quarter and within striking distance of 2019's average revenue per day. And based on the midpoint of our capacity guide, we expect our adjusted CASM-X to come in under $0.06 during the second quarter. So combining our expected daily revenue of $4.8 million in the second quarter with our expected cost performance suggests an adjusted EBITDA margin of around 25% for the June quarter. That 25% EBITDA margin excludes the benefit of PSP.  If you include the benefit of PSP, it suggests an EBITDA margin of more than 35%. Turning to fleet. During the first quarter, we acquired 3 aircraft at an average all-in price of $16.5 million per tail. These aircraft were paid for with cash; and remain unencumbered, which brings our current unencumbered aircraft count to 29. In the used A320 market, our fleet team is in no short supply of deals coming across their desks at prices that reflect a 30% discount on average to pre-pandemic levels. Based on current commitments, we expect to end the year with 108 aircraft, which supports our ability to increase capacity in the back half of '21 by as much as 20% as Drew and his team see no shortage in opportunities to put aircraft to work. This level of capacity suggests our adjusted CASM-X for the back half of the year should be around below $0.06 level.  In the event we come across sustained weakness in demand -- in the demand environment, our highly variable cost structure, along with our fleet flexibility, provides us a built-in safety valve to let off the gas as needed. Not only is our industry-leading cost structure advantage expanded due to the structural cost savings removed during the pandemic, other carriers have increased their leverage significantly more than we have. Our expected full year '21 interest expense should be around 14% less than full year '19. And additionally, our full year '21 scheduled debt maturity and interest payments, using our 2019 passenger count, is actually $6 per passenger less than it was in 2019. You don't have to take our word on how well positioned we are. Recently, S&P upgraded our corporate rating and changed our outlook to stable; I believe, among the first rated U.S. airlines to see such a change. And in terms of CapEx, our full year '21 guide remains largely unchanged, with the exception of our other CapEx category. And that, we increased by $20 million for the opportunistic purchase of spare parts at an average price per part of 50% less than pre-pandemic levels. And I'll close with Teesnap. Recently, we completed the sale of 85% of our Teesnap subsidiary to TELEO Capital at an undisclosed amount.  We are excited to partner with TELEO, as they are committed to positioning Teesnap for a bright future with plans to further invest and accelerate growth of the business. And I'd like to take a moment to thank our Teesnap team members, who have done an incredible job building the platform, creating a deep and growing customer base and bringing the program to its next evolution. With this team and TELEO's good stewardship, the future will be very bright. And with that, we will turn it over to questions.\nMaury Gallagher: Operators around?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Good quarter. This is a question probably Maury and/or John. Look, Maury, you alluded to competition out there. What is it? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. And the fact is we do have a fairly -- several new entrants. It seems like there's more in -- waiting in the wings and they are targeting your market segments. They're not -- I don't think we're getting any carriers that are going to start flying, say, San Francisco-Tokyo. It's all about Austin and Nashville, to Florida and Vegas, et cetera, et cetera. I'm curious about how you're thinking about it. And even just in the last couple weeks, I think we've had 2 airlines announce new service to Phoenix-Mesa. We've seen someone announce additional new service into Punta Gorda, St. Pete. These are sort of the Allegiant mainstays, and so how do you think about long-term opportunities? Do you think that -- with this area becoming more fragmented, the ULCC space becoming more fragmented, that maybe consolidation is more likely over the next few years? A fairly broad question to one or both of you, however you want to answer it.\nMaury Gallagher: That's mouthful. We got half an hour.\nMike Linenberg: Maurice, we'll catch up later. We'll call later.\nMaury Gallagher: Yes, yes. Certainly -- I think I'd classify this last year as -- ironically as a financial year rather than an operational year. You're seeing opportunistic financial plays that are -- the market has been very receptive to them with the IPOs. You have a lot of money that got there, known quantities there for the most part, but on the new front, they each have their own personality. Drew has been following them very quickly. And he may have some opinions of in the near term, but Andrew, he -- we know each other. He knows how to do what we do, but we've gotten very big. While we're certainly going to pay attention to people, we're -- that's not our first thing we look at, at this point in time.  With the Breeze side of the house, they have an ambitious growth schedule, but with their airplane size and some things, I'm not terribly concerned about flying against a 110-seat airplane that they'll start with. The 220 is a good airplane, but they claim to be doing, interested in longer haul, thinner markets. So we'll just have to wait and see. I don't think it's so much us. I think the really interesting play is how does the big 3 react. They've -- I just looked at this data. They've got a ton of debt. They -- cost structure is twice [indiscernible]. I mean I just don't know how those guys kind of come down the hill, not to say they won't but long term. So the issue, I don't know, isn't so much worried about start-ups, is I think you're going to see the ULCC side able to really gain a lot of market share potentially over the next couple years. And that's what we are so bullish on because we can really stand alone in what we do and how we've done it. And we were ready for this in 2019 and into 2020, and like I said, we just took a year off, but we're stepping on the gas. I don't know, John, if you have any thoughts.\nJohn Redmond: Yes. I think, when you look at it, we've never been afraid of competition, but when -- financially where we stood sometime ago versus where we stand now -- Maury made it in his comments. We all kind of alluded to it, but we've never been stronger with a stronger balance sheet in the history of the company, frankly. So we're well positioned to take on anyone. When you look at the start-ups, they're -- literally they don't have a brand. No one knows that brand in the marketplace. So they're coming in with a brand that no one's ever heard of and, as Maury points out, maybe with a plane type that's not as cost effective as ours in some cases. So I think we're very comfortable with where we stand going forward. We're in great position to do it and growing quickly.\nMike Linenberg: Great, great. And just a quick one to Greg. Aircraft rent expense, Greg, it's a fairly new concept for you guys. As I think about -- you mentioned that the last 3 shells were financed out of cash. You're taking a few more later this year. Are they operating leases? Or should we assume kind of March quarter is a good run rate for the rest of the year on aircraft rental expense?\nGreg Anderson: Thanks, Michael, for the question, yes. And the 3 that we acquired in the first quarter are not op leases. So those are purchases. We do have a couple op leases that we'll be bringing on in the next coming 12 months or so, but what I'd say is that, that number that you saw in the March quarter, where we sit today from a rental expense perspective, is a good number for the remainder of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So your guidance implies a nice sequential improvement in RASM. We really haven't had an opportunity for a while to talk about RASM, so it's nice to see sequential improvement there. I wonder if you could comment on the balance between load factor. I mean you noted that 10-point improvement in April but the balance between load factor and yields. Because it does feel like perhaps your average fares don't drop off as much as they might normally would from 1Q to 2Q.\nDrew Wells: Yes. Thanks, Duane. Drew here. I think we're kind of in the middle of the inflection point. We predominantly try to keep fares and yields relatively in-line under the theory that -- and what we experienced. The dropping of fare wasn't stimulating enough incremental load for it to make sense for us. As the demand pool in general is growing and more seats are out there, we're seeing more and more inroads to where dropping fare and creating that stimulation makes more sense for us. And I think right now we're kind of -- the inflection point there where you'll see yields hold up really, I think, fairly well over the first probably half of this month before, as we get into summer, seeing that kind of inversion take place. I know Maury kind of alluded to some of the cadence of loads there, but I do expect to see us cross 70% in June and continue kind of that steady improvement that we've seen from March to April.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes. Sequential improvement in RASM and sequential improvement in CASM. So that feels like -- it feels like a good outcome [indiscernible] press release, but can you talk about your growth outlook for the balance of the year? And maybe relatedly, what would it take for you all to think about bringing back EPS guidance? Because we're going to have to think about positive EPS here again, really the first one to contemplate that.\nJohn Redmond: Well, on EPS front, I mean, we've had some conversation about that. I'd imagine we'd start looking at that probably next quarter.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes. That's a nice transition back to a really positive way to look at the business, so yes.\nMaury Gallagher: Agreed.\nJohn Redmond: But I did mention too that it's going to be positive every quarter for the balance of the year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: You did, John. And then just with respect to kind of the growth outlook, you gave us 2Q. Have your expectations about the second half kind of change relative to past calls?\nDrew Wells: No. I think we're still very much in line with what we suggested on -- in the January, February call. If anything, I think we have a bit more conviction in what the back half of the year can bring. I feel stronger about our ability to be near that 20% mark. So it's not providing an official guide, but you can look toward our selling schedules, at least for what we intend to be able to fly.\nMaury Gallagher: Just a quick comment, Duane. I think Las Vegas is as exemplary of a leisure marketplace in the country as any place. And we go down to the strip. I was down there last weekend. I mean I had to wait on a green light to make a left turn again. I haven't seen traffic like that in a long time. Headline today: Wynn opens 100%. 80% of their people are inoculated, 88% or something like that.\nUnidentified Company Representative: 88%.\nMaury Gallagher: So it's you're just getting this feeling in our town here that the leisure world is back. And frankly, Las Vegas has been one of the weaker cities over the last year just because it's been shut down so much. I think Orlando obviously comes back stronger with the Disneys of the world. So the idea that we're back, as a statement of the day, I think, is -- if it's not today, it's not -- it's tomorrow or the next day.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora from Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: I guess my first question is for Drew. I guess, with what you're seeing in -- just in broader leisure travel, in your booking curve lengthening and everything, do you think you're at an inflection point in your business where it kind of reverts to more normal seasonality with kind of 2Q strongest, 3Q the weakest? Or do you continue to see the ability to continue to grow revenues sort of sequentially from here based on what you're seeing from a leisure traveler?\nDrew Wells: Sure. I think we still have the ability to grow sequentially, obviously. We're making it harder and harder on ourselves with each quarter, but I don't think we're back to a fully normalized world there. As we saw even last September and October, we had a great shoulder and off-peak demand. And I think we'll see that at least here in the shorter term, as all leisure travel patterns are a little bit different. VFR patterns are a little bit different than they've been in the past. So I do think that there's at least some short-term runway to kind of maybe get some incremental lift in what would normally be an offpeak or shoulder before presumably returning to more normality in maybe a year or 2.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Interesting. And then Maury, kind of strategic question here, but with what you've seen from the leisure traveler, do you have any regret for not finishing Sunseeker on your original timetable? And I guess, what would you have to see for you to go through with it on your own again?\nMaury Gallagher: I've got a lot of regret. I wish we would have finished it. We'd be in great shape right now, with what's going on in Southwest Florida. I don't know if you all have seen the numbers down there, but a couple weeks ago, I was looking at hotel rooms. They were 3 factor higher, can't get rental cars down there. It's -- and people we have down there just have never seen anything like this. So having said that, we made the right decision not to do it. And our go-forward approach is going to be stand on its own with its own debt and things like that, but John can talk about we're seeing some good activity. And that part of the world is definitely being recognized for what it is, as a vacation destination.\nJohn Redmond: It's unbelievable. We knew it made sense some time ago, of course, when we made the decision. It makes even a hell of a lot more sense now, as everyone is seeing. I already earlier in my comments made the comment that we expect to start that project back up again before the end of the year given the conversations we're having to take. There is quite a bit of interest in the -- in seeing that project get completed, so stay tuned. And I'll have more to report down the road, but just now there's too many different directions this opportunity can take for me to make any particular comments on any one. But that's why it's just a -- pretty much a global one that we think we're going to get started back up before the end of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Just 2 questions. One is as you think about passengers coming back and airfares versus ancillaries. Obviously, without the passengers, you're not getting the ancillaries, so are you -- is there a percent that you're thinking about that you want ancillaries to grow to versus fare? And I think in the answer to somebody's question, maybe Duane's question, about loads versus yields you talked a little bit about it, but how are you thinking about ancillaries?\nDrew Wells: Sure. I would love ancillary to be 100% of the portfolio. I mean that's never going to be there. We've been fairly solidly at or above 50% now for, I believe, last 5, 6 quarters, even including pandemic time. I certainly want to see that continue to grow. We launched our bundled ancillary program shortly before the pandemic and, frankly, haven't had as much time to see that grow as we would like as we were kind of back into more scramble mode. I think there are several evolutions of that, that will help boost, as well as performance from the new website and a lot of things that Scott DeAngelo mentioned during his remarks and other things he's working on. So there's not necessarily a targeted percentage in mind other than let's get that thing as high as we can get and we'll be in the best overall position.\nHelane Becker: Got you. And then my follow-up question is you were talking about -- and I think just -- I'm not sure -- or maybe it was Scott Sheldon talking about finding it hard to attract people. Are the -- or the OEMs and your MROs that do your maintenance, are they finding that they have to raise pay to attract people? Or are they sending the work outside the country? I don't know what percent of your own maintenance -- of your maintenance you're doing in the United States versus outside, but I know most of it is third party.\nScott Sheldon: Yes. I think my comments on the labor rate itself is more above and below wing in our ground service providers. Our MRO business was spread upwards of 9 different locations in 6 different countries, so it was difficult. They were slow to ramp up. And just parts and logistics, that was probably the long pole in the tent, if you look at kits that we would use to convert to max pax, bad weather. I mean that played into it, but it's more on the ground handling side is the near-term rate constraint for us. It's not on the MRO side.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then are you -- just as a follow-up to that. Are you finding it hard to find people to work in the airports for you or some of your lower-wage workers versus your -- I imagine, the higher-wage workers, maybe not so hard.\nScott Sheldon: No, I think that you're seeing across the board. I mean obviously it's a part-time workforce. There's a lot of companies out there that are starting well north of what our hourly rates would be even if we outsource it, so at some point, you're going to have to start creeping up that direction. Florida right now, if you look at Sanford, St. Pete; Nashville is really tough. I mean some of these larger cities that we're operating into. Our service providers are having a hard time finding bodies and so we're having to chase rate up here in the near term. Whether that's sticky long term is yet to be seen.\nJohn Redmond: Yes. Helane, I think you have to look at if it's happening in all industries, especially at the lower wage levels, just because of the unemployment benefits and whatnot. So we could be seeing this problem in the U.S. through September, frankly, just because of some of these policies. So we'll have to wait and see, but you see it across industries at these rates. You can't even find an Uber driver.\nHelane Becker: Very true. I'm finding that out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Maybe for Maury or Drew. Just want to talk about kind of your bullishness on the outlook, the performance of the business through COVID and yet kind of the goal of getting to 145 aircraft by the end of '24. That's fairly measured growth. And so is that kind of what you think is appropriate over the next few years? Is that the base case, or are there kind of things that throttle growth in terms of aircraft availability or things like that? Can you grow more than that?\nMaury Gallagher: Yes, we can certainly grow more than that. We want to be measured. One of the interesting things we are finding is, as we get to the size we have, you -- we now have to go find 15, 20 airplanes a year and used. And we think that over time that could present some problems, so we don't want to get out ahead of our skis too much. The other piece of this is that, if you go back and look at Southwest, over time, they've grown 10% to 15% a year. And when you have very chunky growth where you accelerate and then you try and back off, getting the resources to accelerate quickly where you need to train the crews -- you need to have all the stuff, particularly with used airplanes. It's one thing to order a new airplane. We have to be more measured in our planning at that rate. So there's a side of me too that says the race ultimately goes to the tortoise. That's been the Southwest story continuously for 50 years. So we can certainly grow more. We think that's a good amount of growth for us in the coming years. I'll let Drew talk about markets and our ability to grow into them, but it's a good number to put out there at this point.\nDrew Wells: Yes, Joe. I mean it comes up to about just over a 10% CAGR there. In the short term, we're talking about 20% or so in the back half of this year. That would likely continue into the beginning of next year just because fleet count didn't change that dramatically. So we think there's a lot of near-term availability to grow, and there's certainly the market presence to do that. And we're built structurally right now with the aircraft, with the crew, the head count to be able to accomplish that. So kind of to echo Maury's comments: Let's get to the back half of this year right now and continue to push forward at a measured rate that the entire enterprise is comfortable with. I'll give one shoutout to Chris in my team, who told B.J. on the fleet side, If you buy it, we'll fly it. So we're ready to spool up.\nMaury Gallagher: One way to look at that too: The governor or the accelerator, depending how you want to look at it, is really the rate of retirement, right? So we can push them up or slow them down depending on how we feel and what the market feels like. So that's always a governor or an accelerator.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then Scott DeAngelo, you ran through some of the third-party revenue opportunities you're looking at. I think you all are doing around $5 per passenger in third-party products, excluding the air portion. What's the opportunity there longer term the next, call it, 3 or 4 years, when you consider kind of better selling what you're already selling and then the vacation properties, whatever Sunseeker turns into? Kind of what's the medium-term opportunity there?\nScott DeAngelo: Yes. So I think that the medium opportunity now is the digital commerce platform that enables us to showcase more inventory across hotel rental car, vacation rental but actually more importantly take a more personalized approach to that. So having more to sell, being better at getting the right thing in front of the right person. And then the third leg on that stool will be the stay tuned for bringing on additional things that we can make part of that ecosystem. I know traditionally we think about marketing and all of the traditional advertising; but if you think about what I just said, a loyalty program layered on top of that; and then the ability to, as I like to put it, interweave the Allegiant brand into the things that people love, whether that's the resort they stay at, whether that's a sporting event or concert that they go to and/or whatever other leisure activity they need air travel to. It does all the same work that a traditional advertising would do but brings with it a much tougher way to dislodge and think of Allegiant just as an airline that goes up against either new entrants and/or incumbents. So no number there, but we are -- now have the platform and certainly are going the direction in the medium term for that to improve materially.\nMaury Gallagher: Yes. Joe, just to add onto that: Our ability to improve our brand in the last couple years has really been exceptional. And that's really important for where we want to go with the third-party revenues. And hats off to Scott and all what his team has done out there for that, but the other piece that he's pushing, which is very important, I think, is we're moving towards as much frictionless efforts as you can to get into this stuff.  And we've all shopped at Amazon, and we know how friction free that is. And it's amazing to me. Today, you can't buy an airplane ticket without having to put your credit card in every time. Think about that in today's technical world, where it's just an amazing thing that you still can't have that type of customer engagement, if you will. And part of it is it's fractionalized. You've got Expedia and people going through there. You've got -- the airlines don't control their customers nearly as well as a lot of other people do. And that's our goal. It's to have that direct control. So those are just the subtleties that have become very powerful long term making -- one of Scott's big things is, once you got that guy, don't lose him. Have him keep coming back. So that's been a big piece of what we're doing as well. Anyway, so.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, that's helpful. John, if I can just squeeze in the commentary around Sunseeker. Is an option now that you will put Allegiant capital into that project to get that restarted?\nJohn Redmond: Again we're having so many different conversations and so many different term sheets being exchanged that I don't want to jump out too far and give any kind of direction. It might end up being somewhat misleading when you look at a final deal. I just know -- all right, you have a good feeling that something is going to happen that's going to allow us to get started before the end of the year. There's enough interest there. We're making a lot of progress on having conversations with these folks, but they all have different designs on how to put something together. So I think, stay tuned. I don't think you'll have to wait that long. You'll hear more out of us, but I just felt give them, ourselves till the end of the year, but it could be much sooner.\nMaury Gallagher: Yes. Joe, just the word we've used is no meaningful capital will go into it at this point. So that's not to say we won't do some, but where we -- before, it was going to be all off our balance sheet, or a good piece of it, that's not going to be the case this time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie from Seaport Global Securities.\nDan McKenzie: This actually -- I'm going to try to ask Joe's question maybe a little bit differently here, but the -- Scott, the asset-light partnerships where Allegiant benefits from a privileged relationship, I'm just wondering. What does that mean exactly? Is that a reference to Sunseeker by any chance or something else.\nScott DeAngelo: No -- yes. No, I'm happy to explain at a high level without any spoiler alerts. We look for partners that can come to the table that give us something in the leisure ecosystem to sell but, moreover, that have a bunch of customers their own -- of their own that live in the markets that we serve that they can introduce us to. So the partnerships heretofore, anything that's bigger than red box likely has both, yes, it's something that we can sell in an asset-light fashion, a high-margin fashion but also then kicks back on the other side and brings with it millions of new customers that we can go co-market to. And when they're buying their products, they can send them our way. So a perfect world is everyone in our ecosystem, whoever you go to first, it's sitting around the carousel. And in the most technically elegant environment, right, you would have an integration where someone certainly buys all those things at allegiant.com, but in the same way, when you book that hotel somewhere else, when you buy that game and/or concert ticket, digitally we know where you are. And we know, by definition of what you bought that ticket for, where you're going. And to be able to present Allegiant as the right option for air travel to that, that's what that implies. Certainly Sunseeker will be one of those things, as it will introduce itself, but no, there was no allusion to that. That was other partnerships that we hope to announce in the upcoming future that are true what I would characterize as business and channel distribution relationships.\nDan McKenzie: Just following up on that. Just can you translate that into some aspirational metrics and how they might roll up to the system metrics? Just to try and bring that home somewhat.\nScott DeAngelo: Yes. I mean the answer is not here. So like there's no number I could give you, but I can tell you how it'll translate. It will translate certainly in the new visitors we get to the website times the conversion, which will manifest themselves in both pax counts going up and then the average transaction side as you have more to sell and people attach those things. So pax counts and then that third-party revenue per itin or per pax that Joe referenced will be the 2 metrics that you would expect to be impacted by that.\nDan McKenzie: I see, okay. Second question here: It looks like, from the schedules data, 40% of the ASMs in the second quarter are going to fall in the month of June, which has implications for revenue and CASM-X for the quarter. So it looks like June could maybe account for 50% or more of the revenue in the quarter, but please correct me on that. But more interesting is the CASM-X. So with -- capacity up 16% in June, I think, is what the schedules are saying versus '19. And you're saying a CASM sub $0.06 for the full second quarter. I guess what I'm wondering is that, that seems to imply a CASM-X close to $0.055 for the month of June. And I'm just kind of wondering how that wrinkles out through the -- phases out through the remainder of the year. And I guess where I'm going with this is, is June CASM-X being impacted by heavy maintenance? And I'm just wondering if you can just provide a little bit more perspective because it seems like there should be a step down in CASM-X in the month of June that essentially gets straight-lined through the rest of the year.\nDrew Wells: So maybe -- Drew here. I'll kick it off very high level. You're right. We're looking at about 40% of the ASMs to happen in the month of June. So I think the quarter basis is going to come down in a lot of ways to how June is variable from now. I don't know if Greg wants to handle any parts of the cost component.\nGreg Anderson: Yes. Dan, thank you for the question. And the June quarter will come in really strong from a CASM-X perspective. I think, when I -- when we look at the cadence quarter by quarter, I would think the June quarter would actually be the lowest. And I say that because, as we look into the back half of the year, you're -- we're anticipating a couple things: one, increased profitability which we'd roll through in a profit sharing. So that's going to drive it up a little bit more, as compared to what we're projecting right now for the first half of the year. And then you also -- you're gearing up -- or we're anticipating gearing up for growth into the -- into 2022 and the back half of the year. So I think that too will provide a little more unit cost pressure, as compared to the second quarter, but I mean I -- we feel good about where we're coming in at the second quarter. I think an interesting data point perhaps worth noting is like on the D&A front or the fixed costs. As you look on a unitized basis, perhaps in the first quarter, that had a little bit of a headwind, but as you tick up utilization a little bit more, that's going to drive it down and provide some strength there. I think in the first quarter, from a salary and benefits perspective, you saw that's toppy in the first quarter just because -- and I think I mentioned this on the last call. We have with our pilots -- we recognize our PTO upfront in the very -- in the first quarter.  And then you just -- you run that out to the rest of the year. So it's almost $12 million in the first quarter alone in PTO. And then you'll get some benefit on that in the second quarter, but then once you get into the back half of the year, again you're starting to hire or expecting to hire some crew members to support that '22 growth. So I'm happy to add some more detail if that's helpful, but I think just at a high level that should be a good indicator of the cadence when it comes to unit costs by quarter and what some of the pressure points or tailwinds may be.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. It is -- if I can just squeeze in one last quick housecleaning question, the percent of second quarter flying that's in new routes less than 12 months. I think there's 51 new markets. I'm just curious how those yields are spooling up versus the system average. I'm thinking there's probably not a whole lot of difference actually.\nDrew Wells: There's always a little bit of difference, as you can imagine, as you're trying to introduce. You'll have varying levels of confidence by route as you move in, but either way, the core goal in the first year is to ensure that you can fill the plane. And so we'll sacrifice yields initially in order to make sure we can accomplish that. So you'll see a little bit of a headwind from that. I don't know that you'll see it, at a system level, just shy of 13% or so of our ASMs. 2Q will be on routes in their first 12 months. So happy with where it's at, but we're focused more on being able to fill the planes and build load on that than we are gaining yield initially.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Your -- it looks like you're guiding revenue excluding charter and other. Obviously you mentioned you sold the majority of Teesnap, but what does this say about charter? Why are you guiding excluding charter, when charter revenues in first quarter looks pretty fine to me. Are you saying that we should expect that business ultimately to go away at some point? Are you deemphasizing it? Why did you exclude that from the guide?\nDrew Wells: Yes, Hunter, the reason why I want to go to scheduled service only is we're putting our growth of ASMs into the scheduled service world. That's where we're seeing the better returns and I wanted to ensure a lot of focus on that piece of it. The fixed fee realm -- and I mentioned this in my opening comments. Margins are down fairly significantly across the board there. In first quarter, we had a solid amount of March Madness flying, which boosted the fixed fee number in March, but like I mentioned I think that's a one-off for '21. We won't get a lot of great insight into what fixed fee will do in the back half of the year until we get a little bit further along with college football contracts. So for now I wanted to keep focus on scheduled service ASMs are growing. Here's why. Here's the scheduled service rev guide. They kind of move with that. To your point, the other rev line will largely move to 0 as we move forward with the Teesnap sale so that become de minimis. Fixed fee is not going away. I think we're just trying to be good stewards of our assets in the short term. And the better returns are on the scheduled service side right now.\nHunter Keay: All right. That's cool, Drew. And then Maury, I realize, a little bit of an awkward question, but we've been talking about this for years. I'm wondering how you might talk about succession planning. I know it's you can't really quit in the middle of a crisis, but you sound so excited. Now it's maybe even harder to leave given the opportunities you have in front of you, so how are you thinking about your own future as CEO?\nMaury Gallagher: Well, it's guaranteed I'm going to leave. So that part is without question.\nHunter Keay: Really?\nMaury Gallagher: Yes. It's a question of when. I'm seeing my succession sitting around the table here, someplace. I'm going to do -- we'll get the spin the arrow out and we'll sit down one day and do it that way or something nice. It's certainly been a long run, and I couldn't be happier with the management team that's here. And I'm still the largest shareholder and intend on being that, so I don't know that I'll ever go away, but I don't have to be here day to day certainly. And this group here is -- are good stewards of this great business, so yes, stay tuned.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Maybe a bit of a follow-up to the medium-term more metered growth story. With spare parts and aircraft available at pretty attractive prices versus pre COVID you guys noted earlier in the prepared remarks, is there not more of an opportunity to add to your fleet here and just lock-in lower ownership costs for the coming years? Or is it really just like those maintenance bottlenecks you mentioned earlier that call that? Or just you guys really think the current fleet plan is sufficient for what demand is going to be.\nGreg Anderson: Catie, it's Greg. Perhaps I'll kick it off, and maybe others will jump in if they like. I think a way to describe when John gave that 2024 aircraft guide is -- that 10% is, I mean, we're still going to be opportunistic. And B.J. and his fleet team, they're seeing just a lot of opportunities to bring on used A320s.  And there's a bunch out there that fit our -- benefit our profile and make a lot of sense to bring on. And I mean it -- I would think of those as incremental kind of growth. And maybe it's above 10%, but we're certainly looking at that and we see a lot of opportunity there. I think, from a spare parts perspective, similarly, yes, we've seen some opportunistic purchases there where -- off of 50% of pre-pandemic levels. So we're excited about that. We'll start bringing those in to help support ramp-up of growth. I think, Scott Sheldon and his maintenance team and organization, he's done a great job of positioning us to be able to get these aircraft into the pipeline moving forward in a good amount of time, but I mean I wouldn't -- I guess ultimately what I'm saying is we're going to be opportunistic. And as we see nice aircraft deals come our way, we're going to continue to look at those. I think it's a great opportunity for us to continue to look to averaging on our ownership costs given what we're seeing here. And stay tuned, but we have quite a few irons in the fire.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great. If I can maybe just sneak 2 quicker modeling ones in at the end here. I guess, first, just a really quick clarification. Did you say 2 half CASM-X is going to be low $0.06 range? Or did I -- am I hearing things?\nGreg Anderson: No, you heard that right, Catie. So I think just the second half should be just in the low $0.06 range.\nCatherine O'Brien: All right, great. And then maybe just the second little modeling one here. It looks like on -- in terms of your ATL, current quarter, you saw positive impact of new bookings outpace some of the drawdown of credits used from prior periods. Any thoughts on how we should expect this to trend going forward [indiscernible] your car forward booking?\nGreg Anderson: Yes. I mean, do you want me to kick it off with what we're seeing, Drew, from an accounting perspective? And maybe if you see any forward, but what we saw in this last quarter, Catie, in terms of redemptions, it was just in gross numbers. I think it was like 40 million, which reduced it by 19%, that credit voucher level. So what I would say is we're not issuing nearly as many as we did last year. You're starting to see those be redeemed at a nice rate. We did extend our expiry during the middle of the pandemic -- or early on in the pandemic, I should say, to 2 years. So that's keeping them out a little bit longer, but the cadence have been coming down pretty nicely, whereas I think, by the mid of -- mid-2022, you'll kind of get back to that normal percentage of ATL in terms of credit vouchers. And then I think -- do you want to talk change fees or.\nDrew Wells: We can touch on it quickly, yes. We brought change fees back in a mitigated sense on May 1. So they came back at $25 versus our original -- previous number of $75, something was -- it was really John's idea of bringing back something that was not 0 but not all the way to just kind of help, one, with the threshold bit on our side; but two, restore some normalcy there. And thus far, very, very early; see no real pushback on that front.\nJohn Redmond: Operator -- the operator is there.\nSherry Wilson: Are you bringing Savi in?\nJohn Redmond: [indiscernible].\nMaury Gallagher: Go ahead, Savi.\nSavanthi Syth: Can you hear me?\nSherry Wilson: Yes.\nMaury Gallagher: Yes.\nSavanthi Syth: All right, great. Greg, if I can ask a little bit more on the CASM-X question. You reached the upper end of that CASM-X that you were looking to achieve. And could you kind of walk through your expectations for your major cost line items over the next couple of years or just a bit of a longer-term view? I'm trying to understand like what might get you to the lower end of that target or perhaps what might kind of cause you to move up from that low $0.06 that you're seeing in the second half.\nGreg Anderson: Sure, yes. Thanks for the question, Savi. I think an area that I get pretty excited about is in terms of helping improve -- or a tailwind to our unit costs, as I mentioned earlier, was on the ownership side. Just some of the deals that we're seeing or potential aircraft deals we're seeing coming our way as a result of the pandemic could meaningfully help us drive that down. In addition to that, from another tailwind perspective, I get pretty excited of what Sheldon and his team is doing on the ops side of the house, doing things to make sure we're running a good airline. It's expensive when you're running a not-as-good airline, so that's always helpful. We talk about Skywise and the investment in Skywise, which is our predictive maintenance platform. I think, the team today, we have about 25 aircraft that are retrofitted with complete capabilities of Skywise. By the end of the year, we think that will be up to 75% of our fleet, and then next year that'll be about 95%. I mention that, Savi, because that not only helps us run a better airline with dispatch reliability and things of that nature. It also allows us to handle maintenance when we want to, not in an unscheduled-type environment, again saving on costs. That's a really big deal for us. Where we're seeing some headwinds that we're looking at currently, and I don't know if this is here to stay, candidly, Savi, is on the station front given that -- with the pandemic and a few of our airports in which perhaps there was a budget deficit that they're going back and trying to reclaim that for the moment. We're seeing some pressures there, but I think, as industry capacity picks back up, potentially that could help kind of level that back off, all right? But what I'd say ultimately, Savi, is I think, where we're at from a cost perspective, we're in a good spot. We're not here saying we need to be at 5% -- or I'm sorry, on a 5-handle CASM-X. That's a nice to have, but candidly, if that was like our end-all, be-all, we would just increase utilization from 8 hours a day to 12 hours per day. We've been taught to look at this from a profitability perspective, and there's 2 sides to the equation. You have the revenue and the costs side. And so ultimately that's what we're doing, and we're going to focus on maximizing our profitability. And if down the road we need to spend $1 to make $2 or $3, we're willing to do that because that's where we're going to be keenly measured on, but I know that's kind of a lot of information. Maybe I'll pause there if I -- hopefully, I answered or helped answer your question or provide any other detail.\nSavanthi Syth: No, that was great, Greg. That's great. And if I might, for Scott, just quickly clarify with the new rental inventory that you're talking about. How meaningful is that? And just what are you doing that maybe your competitors can't do? Is this similar to just Allegiant being better with kind of putting people in hotels because you have a direct relationship? Or is there something differentiated about this new opportunity?\nScott DeAngelo: Yes. So at the moment obviously it's going to be crawl, walk, run, but I think what's differentiated about it is the booking window for vacation rentals is much different than hotels. On average, there's 3 to 6 months, whereas we see with hotels it's much shorter, specifically Las Vegas hotels, which could be, \"Hey, you want to go grab one this weekend?\" type booking window. So I think strategically, going forward, the big thing to think about is it gives us something to both attract and sell to a customer much further out than our hotel inventory. The second thing, real quick, is hotels have been a great story here in Las Vegas, but increasingly, as you look around all the coastal markets that we fly into and/or all the national parks that we play to, both very big success stories during and coming out of the pandemic, increasingly, vacation rentals are a big part of how you can sell to those customers, right? There's not a lot of Park Hyatts sitting right inside of Yellowstone. And so I think that those are the strategic things that it gives us. And us being able to sell it, sell it at scale, that's something that comes over time as we just optimize the digital channel to do that. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nJohn Redmond: I think the other thing that's worth pointing out too is the average trend size on that kind of transaction is much higher. And it's due to the length of stay being much longer on a vacation rental. So we make a lot more money on a \"long length of stay\" type product than you do a \"short length of stay\" product.\nScott DeAngelo: Yes. Even in the early days, it's in the several thousands versus hotels which will be more in the 100s to low single-digit thousand. So to John's point, the margins are the same and, of course, for us meaning that the net revenue margin, over 90% of that, virtually all of it, falls to the bottom line. So just a highly accretive piece of business that has no real carrying costs, just the ability to get in front of the right customer to buy it from allegiant.com.\nMaury Gallagher: She quit. She headed home. We're on our own.\nScott Sheldon: The call went past an hour. She didn't.\nSherry Wilson: Brandon, are you on the line?\nBrandon Oglenski: Yes. This is Brandon. Can you guys hear me?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes.\nMaury Gallagher: [indiscernible].\nBrandon Oglenski: I don't know what happened to the operator, but [indiscernible].\nMaury Gallagher: Join the crowd.\nBrandon Oglenski: I'll just ask one because I know it's been a long call. And I did join late, so apologies if this was already discussed, but I think you guys said, income in the remaining quarters of '21, it should exceed 2019 level. So I just wanted to confirm that. And then I guess, as a follow-up to that question: You guys did throw out some margin guidance and second quarter. How do you think about margin progression in the back half of the year, especially in relation to the ability to potentially be growing 20% above where you were in '19?\nGreg Anderson: Brandon, it's Greg. Why don't I -- maybe on your first question just as we're seeing the positivity in the back half. And I think the way we're thinking about it -- and I'll start. Maybe Drew wants to come in on the revenue front, but as we look at kind of where our guide gets you on the second quarter, and I think that gets you -- let's just call it roughly $2 in EPS. I think, if we look at the back half of the year, though, when you see that growth that we're talking about and the team has conviction around -- is 20% year-over-2 year, you're entering into the back half of the year at 70% load factors. And so I think what Drew and team are getting excited about is the ability to yield up and drive revenues there. I mean we're certainly not trying to put a forecast out there, but what we're saying is we're cautiously optimistic on where we're going to go on that front. I think, on the costs side, we're just -- we feel good where we're at there. We're pretty baked in, so yes, it'd be on the revenue side, but I think we'd bring that home. And then on your second question, I'm sorry, was just on margins second quarter and how they would compare to the rest of the year.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yes, that's right, Greg.\nGreg Anderson: Yes, okay, yes. I mean I think -- again I think this is one where I'm not trying to go out and give a guide or a forecast, but I do think the second quarter will have a strong margin. We talk about on an unadjusted basis -- 35% on an adjusted basis. So adjusted excluding the benefit of the PSP, you're at 25% margin. Can we hold that for the rest of the year? I mean we see line of sight and an ability to do that, but again I just want to be careful or cautious that we're not -- I don't want to come out here and forecast. But we like where we sit. And Drew and his team are seeing a lot of strength in the back half, I think, but I don't want to put words in your mouth, Drew, so maybe I'll pause. And anything you want to add on the revenue front or anything else?\nDrew Wells: I think seeing the strength now and seeing the booking curve normalize is giving us more and more conviction towards the back half. I wouldn't say that we have a significant line of sight to what October and November are going to look like at this point, but trying to extrapolate forward the strength we've seen and the cadence kind of gives us that conviction towards the end.\nMaury Gallagher: Just to be clear. This is climb out still without reference to last year, which will bring us back to more of a normalized. We're pretty comfortable on costs. We know what they -- we can do. We're going to spend that money to fly. So you just have to be careful. If we -- even if you hesitate a little, you could be underneath because we just don't have that ability to be -- look back a year or 2 years back. So.\nGreg Anderson: And then Brandon, maybe just a housekeeping item: All that assumes like $2 per gallon in fuel too. So fuel could be a big variable in that.\nSherry Wilson: Maury, could you, closing remarks?\nMaury Gallagher: Well, I think we're all done, folks. I appreciate your time in this call. And we will have follow-up conversations, I'm sure. So thank you again. And we'll talk to you in a couple of months. Bye-bye."}, {"symbol": "ALGT", "quarter": 4, "year": 2020, "date": "2021-02-03 23:17:03", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q4 2020 Allegiant Travel Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. \nSherry Wilson: Thank you, Towanda. Welcome to the Allegiant Travel Company's fourth quarter and full-year 2020 earnings call. On the call with me today are Maury Gallagher, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Redmond, the Company's President; Greg Anderson, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Scott Sheldon, our EVP and Chief Operating Officer; Scott DeAngelo, our EVP and Chief Marketing Officer; Drew Wells, our SVP of Revenue and Planning; and a handful of others to help answer questions. We will start with some commentary and then open it up to questions. The Company's comments today will contain forward-looking statements concerning our future performance and strategic plans. Various risk factors could cause the underlying assumptions of these statements and our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. These risk factors and others are more fully disclosed in our filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements are based on information available to us today. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise.

To view this earnings release as well as the rebroadcast of the call, feel free to visit the Company's Investor Relations site at ir.allegiantair.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Maury.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. First, let me thank all of our team members, their spouses and families, as we continue to fly through these difficult times and carry our passengers to their destinations. Thank you again for all your hard work and dedication. Last quarter, we were able to report some optimism. I qualified my statement at that time by saying some, this time I can say, more in the terms of optimism. And as it turned out though, we were a little more bullish on the call last quarter than we were able to deliver. Nevertheless, we had noticeable improvements over that quarter. My hats off to Drew Wells and his team, as he had to navigate \u2013 they had to navigated their way through the increased COVID problems in November and December. They did an excellent job maneuvering us through the declining demand during those months.\nJohn Redmond: Thank you, Maury, and good morning, everyone. We are fortunate that our model and history of flying domestic leisure customers, we don't have to sit here today and predict the timing of vaccination rollouts. We are all aware of the benefits and future upside, but the air events were happening beyond our control. We have been laser-focused on what we can control, which is cost, capacity, capital, and network, which leads to deleveraging and balance sheet improvement. Without giving specific guide, I thought it might be helpful to provide some directional data points to help you understand how we see things in 2021. These directional guides assume no significant changes to the environment we are operating in today. With all the hard work and difficult decisions, we have pulled roughly $75 million in structural changes out of our cost structure, using 2019 as the baseline, a difficult but impressive number especially for an ultra-low cost carrier. As a result, our CASM-X for full-year 2021 should be less than Q1 of 2021. Greg will provide some commentary on Q1 2021 CASM-X. Given that, our best results and margins are ahead of us not behind. On top of that, our interest expense will be lower in 2021 and 2022 than 2019. I don't think another airline can make such a statement. Our capacity will be up in every quarter in 2021 versus same quarter 2019. Drew, of course, will give a little more color on Q1 of 2021. We expect to be EPS positive in the first quarter of 2021. Our net debt each quarter end of 2021 will be less than year-end 2019. Again, all these directional guides assume no significant changes to the environment we are operating in today. In regards to the Sunseeker Resort, we will not invest any more meaningful capital. We remain incredible believers in the thesis and future opportunities and continue to explore other options including other equity investors and/or non-recourse project financing. The resort is far more valuable built out and provides greater flexibility and more option than how it sits today.\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks, John. In 2020, our commercial approach continued to stay disciplined by executing against our data-driven recovery road map, which enabled us to do multiple things. We reduced marketing costs while still capturing a disproportionately high share of the leisure travel demand that did exist in the markets we serve. We continued building out transformational capabilities in the digital commerce and customer loyalty areas and ultimately, we laid the groundwork to enter 2021 well-equipped to drive a faster and stronger recovery in the post-pandemic leisure travel era. Our direct-to-customer distribution model continues to allow us to stay close to what our customers are saying and how our customers are behaving. As recently as Sunday, more than half of the customers who responded to our weekly survey said they plan to travel this spring and nearly two-thirds said they plan to travel this summer. While we appreciate that the situation and customer sentiment will continue to be fluid, it's noteworthy that flight searches at allegiant.com for the next month for key spring break weeks and for Memorial Day week are near or above prior year levels overall. And both searches and bookings continue to show relative strength for destination like the beaches along Florida's West Coast in Panhandle as well as other small and mid-sized cities nationwide that service gateways to national parks and outdoor recreation, what we marketed as non-stop in nature.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott, and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. All things considered, I'm very pleased with the cadence of revenue results from the depths of the pandemic, especially considering the level of flying we've been able to maintain. Our yield and load factor metrics steadily improved over the third quarter and in absolute terms, our fourth quarter revenue performance of down 46.5% year-over-year was about 7.5 points better than the third quarter. We are further encouraged by our ancillary portfolio remaining in line with prior year and per passenger was down just 0.75% for the quarter, while 2020 was up 3% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter scheduled Service ASMs were down approximately 14%, as we flew heavily during the high demand weeks and cut significantly during the lower demand weeks, as mentioned in the previous call. This approach persists into the first quarter as January flight levels were quite low, while we are looking to fly decidedly more in the latter higher demand half of the quarter. Despite January ASMs being down roughly 15% versus 2019, we believe that first quarter ASMs will be between plus 0.5% and plus 5.5% versus 2019 level deploying. Our low-cost, high-flexibility model allows us to pull down capacity while setting us up well to operate when demand exists. As a matter of example, our typical Sunday has seen about 260 flights, while we haven't had a single scheduled Tuesday flight yet this year. Over the last several years, we have worked to increase resiliency through a diversified array of origination and destination profiles. Some of this is evident in the route expansion over the last 90 days with 36 routes and five new cities, including more non-traditional Allegiant destinations like Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This is assisted by the success of Scott D. and team's rollout of the nonstop nature campaign, which has not only provided a new avenue for us to pursue immediate and future network growth, but also enabled us to unlock more potential out of the existing structure. We believe with the success of these route announcements and marketing campaigns that we can continue to evolve the definition of the Allegiant network from solely serving the largest leisure destinations to serving any leisure-oriented market, a definition that is changing as rapidly as the world around us. We have a runway of over 1,000 markets that encompasses a bevy of originations and destination profiles and will make us a more resilient and stronger airline in the future. Our fleet team has done a remarkable job to put us in the driver seat toward the back half of 2021. Their efforts enabled us to announce yesterday that we will open our Des Moines crew base in July, which will allow us to further develop our Mid-Continent basing strategy. We will now have the ability to grow the second half, nearly 20% versus 2019 levels such that demand dictates that growth. We will also have the ability to strategically replace fleet with already secured aircraft if the revenue environment does not pick up in earnest. We believe that we continue to be in a great position to capture revenue upside, when and where it's manifesting and expanding our network and fleet only further solidifies that position. I'm looking towards the future with cautious optimism, knowing what we are capable of achieving while ensuring we are practical about our short-term realities. And with that, I'd like to pass it over to Greg.\nGregory Anderson: Thank you, Drew, and good afternoon, everyone. 2020 has truly reinforced our core belief and the incredible value of the flexibility inherent in our business model. Our low cost, low utilization model has allowed us to reasonably adapt to the unprecedented time of a low-fare low demand environment. On the fortunate side, we have benefited from the fact that flexibility has always been the bedrock of our model, but the pandemic environment has further highlighted its value. I think it's worth noting a few points to illustrate this. After adjusting for special charges and for the benefits of the CARES Act, we produced a full-year 2020 positive EBITDA of $35 million. Our full-year adjusted unitized cost decreased by 6% despite a decrease in capacity of 18%. These are pretty impressive full-year results given the circumstances. For the fourth quarter, our daily bookings averaged just under 2.5 million. This translates into $225 million in passenger revenue, sequentially this compares favorably with an increase of 23% quarter over the third quarter and a jump of more than 93% versus second quarter. While bookings ebbed and flowed throughout the fourth quarter, we are pleased to see strength as we moved into the peak holiday season. The result, we produced positive adjusted EBITDA, another key milestone we've reached on the road to recovery in the fourth quarter. We remain encouraged with recent trends of January averaged approximately 3.5 million in bookings per day with consistent improvements building throughout the month. On the cost front, our adjusted operating expense for the fourth quarter, which excludes special items was down 30% year-over-year despite a capacity reduction of only 15.6%. This translates into an adjusted CASM-X for the quarter of just over $0.0607, this is well below the $0.0674 averaged during the fourth quarter of 2019 and also below 2019s full-year CASM-X of $0.0648. Turning to the balance sheet and as noted in earlier calls, defending our balance sheet has been one of our top financial priorities throughout the pandemic and we are pleased with the results today achieved without issuing any equity or participating in the CARES loan program. We ended the year with just under $700 million in cash and when adjusted for the NOL carryback refunds of approximately $150 million, our pro forma liquidity would have been around $850 million. We have already filed our refund claims with the IRS and expect to receive the cash within the coming months. During the fourth quarter, we spent roughly $100 million on three aircraft and three engines, only one of which we decided to include seller financing. This is $30 million less than we expected as two late year aircraft acquisitions shifted into 2021. We ended the year with 20 unencumbered aircraft. Additionally, we ended 2020 with $1.65 billion in total debt, which reflected a fourth quarter increase of $150 million in debt proceeds offset by roughly $60 million of principal payments. Our net debt of $975 million is roughly flat when compared to year-end 2019 and would be more than 13% lower if pro forma for the remaining $150 million in NOL refunds. Looking at 2021, we have received the first half of the $92 million allocated to us as part of the second round of the federal payroll support for PSP2. As a reminder, the entire amount issued to us is a grant, as it falls below the $100 million threshold that requires a loan and warrants. We expect our full-year 2021 total CapEx to be roughly $200 million and the majority driven by aircraft acquisitions, which we will touch on in a bit. Additionally, we expect our total debt payments to be roughly $225 million, $175 million in scheduled principal payments with the remaining being interest and expect a decrease and interest expense of 30% versus 2019. Based on current booking trends and giving our amortizing debt, we expect to further reduce our net debt position during 2021. We have no intention of tapping the equity markets, capital raises in 2021 if any would likely be targeted in the debt markets associated with opportunistic aircraft acquisitions. Excluding the benefits from PSP2, we expect 1Q 2021 CASM-X to be down between 4% to 5% from 1Q 2019, and this is based on the midpoint of our 1Q 2021 capacity guide that Drew just mentioned. We expect the first quarter to be the high point of 2021 in part due to some carrying cost and adding back labor and mobilizing maintenance to get our previously parked aircraft ready to fly. The remaining quarters of 2021 should see CASM-X come in below the first quarter based on similar capacity levels. However, if the demand environment were to support as raising capacity on normalized utilization profile with the 2021 fleet plan, we should be in the low 6s and perhaps flirting with the five-handle on our CASM-X for the respective remaining quarters. These expected improvements to our CASM-X are driven in part by the $75 million in annual operating cost saving John mentioned. These structural cost savings include about $25 million in labor, $15 million in marketing, $15 million in IT, $15 million in non-airline and $5 million in other. You may note the total amount is consistent with the $75 million we outlined last quarter, however, the labor savings has been reduced by $15 million due to the recalling of our pilots, the adjustment has been offset by the savings in non-airline costs, which I will touch on momentarily. And on a quick and exciting note, we are positioning ourselves to hire pilots in the back half of 2021 to support potential 2022 growth. Back to the non-airline real quick. As a result of the pandemic, we permanently closed our family entertainment centers and liquidated nearly all of the associated assets. These actions became necessities due to the impact of the pandemic and our cash saving strategy. I want to make a point to acknowledge the hard work of all of our non-stop team members for building that enterprise and for their tremendous efforts and support through the transition. Regarding Teesnap, at the onset of the pandemic, we restructured the business with the goal of making it a 100% self-sufficient. I am pleased to report over the past nine months, Teesnap has been cash flow positive, producing a double-digit EBITDA margin on almost 50% increase in net revenue from 2019. In late 2020, we started re-running a process to sell the business. I just want to also add my deepest appreciation to our Teesnap team members for the remarkable turnaround they've accomplished particularly during this unusual time. Turning to fleet. We ended 2020 with 95 aircraft in operation and our current fleet plan has us ending 2021 with a 108 in-service aircraft, this is based on firm signed agreements. The aircraft growth in 2021 is achieved by returning three aircrafts previously parked to service, adding five aircraft signed up pre-COVID, six aircrafts signed up since the onset of the pandemic, offset by one aircraft retirement. All added aircraft and excluding one will come in at 186 seats. As we look forward into 2021 and beyond, we are not burdened with the costly fleet order, which means we can maintain enormously fleet flexibility to sign up aircraft at our discretion and the price is well discounted from pre-COVID levels. We continue to explore a significant number of opportunistic aircraft deals. Based on leading indicators, we believe our 2021 fleet plan supports the appropriate number of aircraft for both our short and long-term growth plans. However, if we encounter a situation when the environment does not support our plan, we have a built-in safety valve as up to 20 aircrafts to be moved to retirement status, also avoiding costly heavy maintenance visits. One metric we continue to keep an eye towards is restoring our industry-leading $6 million in annual EBITDA per aircraft. We believe our future fleet profile may help serve as a catalyst in getting us back to there as we increase our proportion of 186 seat aircraft, which is the highest EBITDA producing very in our fleet. To close, we believe strongly that we are positioned to thrive in a post-pandemic world, our ability to flex up and down in any environment and will continue to serve us well moving forward, adjusting for passenger demand and helping mitigate any further volatility on the path to recovery. Being as well positioned as we are, would of course not be possible without each and every one of our more than 4,000 team members and I'd be remissed if I didn't take this opportunity to not only thank them, but to highlight and for the benefit of everyone listening to this call, the importance of their work from our frontline and operational crews, who are so incredibly dedicated to ensuring every passenger can travel safely and seamlessly every day to our team members working tirelessly behind the scenes that make us strong, creative and strategic. Please note that your work, all the extra hours, preparation and efforts does not going unnoticed and please know how much it is appreciated. You are the greatest reason we have been so well prepared to meet the challenges of the pandemic in this uncertain environment, and it's because of you, we will continue to be prepared for anything the future might bring. We can't thank you enough. With that, we'll turn it over to questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up please. Our first question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Great. Thank you. Maybe for Scott DeAngelo, there's been a lot of talk about pent-up demand. What are you seeing or hearing from your customers to support or maybe not support that notion. Are you asking customers whether they plan on devoting more wallet share travel post-COVID or that they'll travel more post-COVID than they did pre-COVID because they've been unable to? Are you seeing any of that or the opposite?\nScott DeAngelo: Yes. We're hearing that. When we survey, we do ask about the financial impact, the personal financial impact the pandemic has had, and the vast majority still say that they have either not have been impacted at all or only somewhat negatively impacted. And some of the items I quoted the fact that two-thirds are saying, they have summer travel plans or they plan to make summer travel and about half are seeing the spring break are all consistent with it. One other quick anecdotal data point, while obviously the city we live in Las Vegas, continues to get hit hard, our casino operators have commented that retail high-end dining, and other high-end experiences have actually been well up over prior year suggesting maybe the tip of the iceberg on some of this forced savings as well as some of the psychology behind going on a year of realizing how valuable it is to have the ability to travel and spend freely.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe a follow-up for Scott Sheldon and Greg. I think pre-COVID, the thinking was going to induct 10 airplanes a year at most. I'm wondering if given the opportunities you're seeing in some of the favorable pricing, if you could accelerate that or if you're going to stick to kind of the 10 cap? And then Greg, were you saying that to get to a five-handle on CASM-X, you would need to fly 120% of 2019 capacity. Is that what you meant? Thank you.\nGregory Anderson: Yes. I'll kick it off there and I'll start with the last question there first, Joe. But yes, that's if you were to take and kind of max up the fleet on like a normal utilization profile, but yes, so that'd probably be about 120% of 2019 capacity would get you down into the low 6s or potentially a five-handle. And in terms of induction aircraft, I mean we were certainly capable of inducting more than 10 aircraft per year. That's been a good rule of thumb for growth for us, 10% to 15% I think just generally. But what I'd say is we'll be opportunistic in the markets like this, where there is the opportunity potentially to buy or acquire aircraft at good prices, and Drew and team have the ability to deploy those aircraft, and we can flex that up and we feel good about that and we have the infrastructure to support it.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Close enough. Thanks for the time. It's the gift that keeps on giving. Can you just repeat what you said about the first quarter CASM and then just generally to get CASM down in the fourth quarter on this level of capacity and appreciate you're a lower utilization airline to begin with, but like how do you do that? What are the reasons that Allegiant can get down CASM relative to 2019 on capacity that's down?\nGregory Anderson: Sure. Duane, this is Greg. I'll take that. And maybe I'll start on the first quarter CASM-X. And the reason that's going to be top year, the highest quarter we think in the year is really given that with the PSP2 and bringing back the labor that we're going to need to bring back, not only the pilots, but we continue to pay the management folks that were also moving \u2013 or that moved on. So that's going to put a burden there, so it's going to put a headwind there I should say. On top of that, you may recall or you may not, I can't remember if I've mentioned this in earnings call, but typically in the first quarter, we recognized an expense for all our PTO for our crew members based on the rules and their CDA agreements, and that's roughly $10 million in and of itself, so it puts some pressure on the first quarter there for that. And then I think as you're just starting to mobilize and get ready to fly, as you're running aircraft through induction and just getting things going, there are some headwinds I guess reinvestments, if you will, back into the business and that will start taking place in the first quarter along with training and things like that. On your fourth quarter comment, it's a good question, Duane, and I think the way I've been thinking about it, it's almost just like this intersection at this point in time. On the fourth quarter, we didn't have the incremental labor, right. We had that out because the CARES Act had fallen off there. And we ran just all discretionary expense throughout. What I would say is that's just unique and as we think about the future and we think about positioning ourselves for growth, both short-term and long-term, you have to have a scalable sense \u2013 scalable type of infrastructure in there to support that growth. And so you have to spend a buck to make a couple of bucks. And so I would just \u2013 that fourth quarter again, that was an anomaly. We went back and we pulled out all discretionary expenses, but I wouldn't use that as like a run rate going forward, if that makes sense.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Does make sense. And then just for my follow-up maybe for Scott and Maury both, as you look at your portfolio of big focus destinations, who do you think is doing the best job of giving people a reason to travel, right, like we are here in the New York area, once upon a time that was a big leisure destination, you can have various opinions, but I argue maybe New York is not the best advocate for giving people a reason to travel here, whether it's Vegas or just Mother Nature as you highlighted, what are the destinations that are doing the best job of giving folks a reason to travel again?\nMaurice Gallagher: Well, I'll give a high level. Scott may have more detail, but you've got to point to Florida. All your \u2013 with the international travel now that's been forced to have a test coming back, where your Latin American, your Caribbean, our testing is difficult, it's not impossible to get down there, you've got people wanting to get away the traditional spring break is coming up, Florida is the place to go, California is usually historically a good place, but it had a lot of don't come here types of messages going out, albeit they're getting better. Las Vegas is \u2013 it's still shut down for lack of a better description and interesting stat I heard the Highway-15 is back to its full numbers compared to a year ago. So coming out from LA, people want to move. We did a little analysis, where you took the bell curve of the population aged and you get from 18 to 50 is what 65% of the people in this country and you know stuff about COVID now, you know friends that have had it, may have known unfortunately someone who passed away from it, but you don't worry that much as the sense I'm getting, if you're a 30-year-old that you're going to get it. You get it, you have a cold, you move on and they just don't want to be locked down. It's human nature. We're social animals. We want to move. I was with some people from premier car manufacturer here recently and they had a, oh my God, fourth quarter and I asked them why. So, the simple as it is, people have all this extra money if they're not spending on travel going out to eat, all the stuff you used to consume money on, it's burning a hole in your pocket, so we bought a lot of cars. So, these things are going to revert back to the norm, which is leisure traffic and leisure travel and that's why I think we are so well positioned. Business traffic, I'm not in that business, but I wouldn't want to be on a business and trying to make that model come back quickly, Scott?\nScott DeAngelo: Yes. I would just simply add to that I think Las Vegas is doing a good job of laying the foundation from a health and safety perspective, because the eye is more on getting the big conventions back like the CES et cetera., but I would double down a lot more instead. Florida and specifically in these light visit Florida, visit St. Pete's Clearwater, Sarasota have been very actively and structurally partnering with airlines like us to go out and co-market together the part I mentioned about that was specifically related to those partners and others like them that beyond the health and safety and all the things required to operate are making an aggressive push to once again attract vacationers to their destinations.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the thoughts.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavanthi Syth: Thank you. Hey, good afternoon everyone. Greg, if I might, I know you're not looking at cash burn, but I know you've kind of talked to operating cash flow and you've given a lot of kind of items for us to think about, but just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on just how much of ticket sales are cash versus vouchers, the ATL seems pretty high on our voucher basis and then what level of booking, you need to see kind of to get that EBITDA breakeven or better?\nGregory Anderson: Sure, Savi. Let me kick it off and Drew may want to add some stuff on the voucher redemptions in ATL. But yes, what I'd say on ATL first is you probably didn't see or you probably noticed that we didn't reduce like as a percent of our outstanding ATL, the number of credit voucher. So I think in the third quarter, it was $220 million and I think in the fourth quarter, it was consistent. When you kind of peel that back a little bit and take a look what really happened in the fourth quarter is that you've seen, what we've seen is that there are still some issuances that are largely offsetting the redemption of the credit vouchers. So, but as we looked into the first quarter that trend, meaning the redemption of the credit vouchers is nicely outpacing the issuances or I should say in January. So we're burning that out and I think just in 2021, we'll continue to chew through that and then the one other thing I may add and then Drew wants to add some commentary, just to your kind of what we need to be EBITDA positive. I talked about the 3.5 million of what we're currently seeing and I want to highlight that's not inclusive of any voucher, so that's just true cash in the door. So that's what we're seeing there. And I think where we're at today, given some of the roll-off of the taxes, such as the FET taxes, the segment taxes and things from the CARES Act. They're now back in play in 2021. We've seen a spike in fuel, which is putting a little more headwind on your cash, I think you're probably closer to between 3 million, 3.5 million in daily bookings to get to that kind of EBITDA breakeven, give or take a little bit.\nDrew Wells: I think you've captured it.\nSavanthi Syth: Great. And then, if I might just quickly ask for a clarification on the fleet. So the fleet plan that was kind of provided in the release and that you talked about, does that include any aircraft in storage or is that just the plan kind of excludes anything kind of that's put in short-term storage?\nGregory Anderson: So I'll take it. And yes, so what it does, Savi, is we \u2013 I think we talked about six aircraft in storage last quarter, three of those have already kind of run through the pipeline and are back in service, now as of the end of the year of 2020 and then yes, for that growth, I think what we're incremental 13 aircraft, three of those incremental aircraft in 2021 are the three additional storage aircraft coming back.\nSavanthi Syth: Okay. Perfect. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Hey Maury, you have this vision of a travel sort of like ecosystem for Allegiant when you thought about Sunseeker, I'm kind of curious if the COVID crisis and then the thousand markets that you mentioned, does that open up enough growth for you organically, to the point where you're comfortable just focusing on the airline or is there still this draw to diversify the business because you just think it's sort of a good idea for your company anyway?\nMaurice Gallagher: Well, it's hard to change the spots on a leopard, Hunter, again, long term, I just \u2013 it's proving to be just it's a huge number for us. We've done $1.7 billion of third-party revenue since 2002, of which we've made close to $550 million of operating income, pushing $600 million. So you can't say that that hasn't been a difference maker for us. We do things like we have no middleman between us and our customer. You have no Expedia charges, you have no branding charges, any of those types of things. Having said that, we're focused on the airline and we're not going to short change the airline whatsoever. We want to pick up and move as much as we can towards rental cars and hotels and we're doing a lot in the new website that we just opened and that's what we're using our strength in partnering. This whole reason for this Travel Company is we have a tool that no one else in this industry has. It's \u2013 we own our own res platform, we were the leaders in the 2000s in developing seating assignments and all the ancillary revenues and you can do that when you control the tool. So all these attributes in the add them up point towards a customer-oriented get as much wallet share as you can out of that customer and as we lead the industry in operating margin, and we've done it year in and year out because we have et cetera revenue. We have more revenue than the average carrier, who is fighting over that same person with those seats and who can commoditize it to a lower price or whatever. It's a business that we don't have a lot of separation, we have some certainly and we focus on a different customer than most at the leisure level, but you need differentiation and that we're different has been a constant use in our situation, so that's a long-winded answer there that basically says we're really focused on the airline now, we're going to grow this year, I think we said 19% something like that. There is opportunity and we're going to definitely take advantage of that. As far as Sunseeker goes, that's still on the backburner, it's something that is I think a good long-term strategy for us, but near term it's \u2013 let's keep our head down and take care of business here.\nJohn Redmond: Hunter, the one thing I may add, we're not trying to guide the full year to 19% growth, simply that we have the ability to get there in the back half of the year, such that demand calls for that. So let's not run away with it.\nHunter Keay: All right, John. A follow-up for John. That land across the street from Sunseeker, how does the prospect of that getting developed impact how you're thinking about the valuation or the attractiveness of finding the equity partner and Sunseeker or selling the land to a third parties, is that factoring it at all, so the conversations that you're having?\nJohn Redmond: No, not at all. I mean, all the people we're having conversations with, I would imagine most of them aren't even aware what may happen on the other side of the street to be honest with you. It's rather insignificant in the grant scheme of things. But no one's ever raised it or brought it up in my conversation.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nJohn Redmond: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question. I guess I do want to come back to the 20% comment and I realize you guys aren't guiding to full-year growth of that level, but I guess, can you give us some of the decision factors that would actually drive you to add that level of capacity in the network. Are we talking about EBITDAR margins that are matching prior levels or cash flow levels like, give us some insight into how those capacity additions would come on if they do?\nDrew Wells: Sure. This is Drew. I'm not necessarily setting EBITDA threshold at this point, but I'd like to get back to a point where certainly we're moving past just cash profitability on flights and thinking more expanded the gross margin perspective, I'm not baking in thoughts that future PSP is going to come online and crew costs are fairly a consideration as we move forward. So while I thought should have of given you specific threshold that it's more of a hopefully normalized perspective in terms of what is making money and what is best for the company and not just simply relying on cash profitability, because that's not something we can sustain for a long period.\nGregory Anderson: Brandon, this is Greg. I might just add one quick data point to just the infrastructure for the 2021 growth was pretty much in place, right. Maybe not to the extent of the 19% growth in the back half, but if you think about it, we had \u2013 we have all the pilots and the crew to support it and then for the most part, we had the aircraft as well. So the large kind of infrastructure to support 2021 was in place.\nMaurice Gallagher: Yes. Brandon, the results will definitely do, it's as simple as that.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I guess the question was just more around, is this where we should expect the network is going to grow, once you guys attain certain level of profitability. So we don't lose that returns focus long term, is that right?\nMaurice Gallagher: Correct. Yes, I'm not \u2013 I don't think anyone here is trying to suggest that we're a long-term 20% company at this point, I think we see specific opportunity to Greg's point, we have infrastructure in place to be able to do this such that demand is there. So no by no means are we trying to reduce the margin profile of this company simply for the sake of growth, that's not at all the case.\nGregory Anderson: And that's why Brandon, we threw out as well the EBITDA per aircraft to $6 million that we want to get back there to show the balance, if that's \u2013 that's our true north so to speak and I don't think we'll be there in 2021, but that's what we're looking at long-term, is to get back to that and now there are some positive catalyst to support that, that we think and that's what Maury said, he said, hey, you know that's our target, that's where we need to be economically and so we're keeping that in mind, as well.\nMaurice Gallagher: Yes. Let me just clarify. We're not \u2013 Brandon, we're not going to grow just purely market share type of thing. One of the values I very much treasured is we keep our margins up, just to end up a bigger and cut our margins down by 30% or 40%, it's kind of like why you're doing that and there's plenty of real estate out there for us to look at longer-term, but this year to Greg's point we have infrastructure and ability to do it quicker, particularly in the first half of the year and we'll see where we go, all the numbers are pointing up, suggest we can go and do some things.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Thank you.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thanks, Brandon.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I have just two here. One quick one, Greg, just the guide to positive EPS in the March quarter. What's the underlying fuel price range that you're using?\nGregory Anderson: Yes. That's right now we're paying just about a $1.65 per gallon and it maybe worth just clarifying too, that would include that the GAAP number, so I think that would include the benefit from the PSP, which for us, Michael is $92 million all recognized in the first quarter as an offset.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Great. And then, second question it's probably to Drew and because \u2013 and maybe even Maury because he sort of mentioned it talking about the model and really flying during peak periods or peak days and not flying Tuesday's, Wednesday's, et cetera. When we look at the March quarter, excuse me, the March schedule, which I think you just loaded, there are city pairs where expect several or maybe even a decent number of city pairs, where you're operating what looks like maybe two and even in some cases three daily flights and I realize that that could be that you have Sundays or Fridays, where you're flying three or four, but the fact is it's a type of frequency that we just, we haven't seen in the past and knowing that March and especially to places like Florida can be a strong \u2013 a strong time for Allegiant, I'm just \u2013 I'm curious, you know, is this striking when the iron is hot, are you sort of deviating away \u2013 maybe I shouldn't say deviating away, but sort of expanding upon your peak strategy that you've used in the past, because I did think it was quite interesting to see the type of frequency ads in some of these markets. Thanks.\nDrew Wells: Yes. Drew here, you can certainly look historically and find those markets, where we have operated more than two times daily. I think one of the things I'm pretty keen on and my team can dodge with it is ensuring that we are rightsizing frequencies on the markets that can that can take it and so you won't see that specifically in the peak periods where there is a more resilient demand profile and we're looking to capitalize on that and part of the wide net strategy right is putting that out there, and it's a lot easier to be able to regain the customer and then you have to cancel to another fight on the same day \u2013 I think we have a little bit more flexibility as it pertains to that as well to where the wider net can be even more successful during these peak periods looking forward. So I have every intention of operating all of those on some of our thicker markets in the best of periods, but we will remain flexible in the event we need to pull down a little bit in demand in manifests quite in the way we expect it to.\nMichael Linenberg: Very good. Thanks, Drew.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\nDarryl Genovesi: Hey everybody, thanks for the time. Hey, Maury, back on your third quarter conference call in October, you talked a lot about \u2013 how important it is for customers to fly direct in this environment, how much more that's the case then it was pre-pandemic, can you or Scott DeAngelo based on your survey work help us understand is how much of an opportunity that is for you. And I guess, in particular, if I might just offer this question as a guide, do you think that the desire to go direct can meaningfully influence the passengers' O and D, specifically to markets that you serve direct versus those that you don't?\nMaurice Gallagher: Yes. So I'll give it a start. Thanks for the question. The answer is we continue to push non-stop both as health and safety benefits and not go into crowded hubs, but the reality is, it has been high, it remains the key distinction point and I'll tell you, as you may have seen in charts I showed during Investor Day, it's the reason we share a lot of customers with Delta and Cincinnati, because while they might fly one for business on their own money, they'll be happy to flying to Sanford to take the family to Universal Orlando or Walt Disney World and then same thing happened in May, rather than where they might fly business the Sky Harbor. We continue to see that and that continues to be distinctive point. I can't speak how much of that is the health benefit they proceed versus just the convenience, but there's no doubt that it remains a high reason that we share customers with a lot of other airlines that you wouldn't think would mix, just because on the leisure dollar and on their leisure time they want to get there nonstop.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess my sense, Greg, is that the fourth quarter CASM-X number came in a little bit better than you might have expected and just listening you talk about 2021, the outlook sounds perhaps a little bit more optimistic than what we heard from you in Q3, is there \u2013 and your $75 million number is the same. So I guess is there something about the more discretionary pieces of your cost profile that are perhaps coming a little bit better, both in the fourth quarter and into 2021?\nGregory Anderson: Hey, Darryl. Thanks for the question. And, yes, I think it's fair. I was pleasantly surprised before we came in on the fourth quarter of this year, but there were some items there that some benefits that we saw maybe it's one-time in nature too like we had a some insurance proceeds that came in for an event in that was helpful as well. But as we think about it in the $75 million in structural cost savings, I think that's worth about 0.5% in CASM-X, on a full year thereabouts and so that's obviously helpful but we \u2013 I think what's giving us more conviction to come out and talk about that is just, we have more line of sight on what potential capacity could be and that's kind of the other driver in us getting down into the \u2013 to the low 6-handle kind of range. And so, I think that's giving us a little more confidence or conviction behind it. I'd just leave it at that. I guess.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time, I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you all very much. Appreciate your interest and we'll talk to you after another 90 days. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

With that, I'll turn it over to Maury.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our October 2020 conference call. First, let me thank all of our team members, their spouses and families as we continue to fly in these perilous times. Our passengers are very important to us, and team members are doing a yeoman's job as always. Again, thank you. I'm happy to say we can report some optimism, some, mind you, but with the understanding there's still a ways to go. The only way back will be one step at a time as it appears. In the early days, we had little to no view on how we were going to get back to the top if we had fallen into this abyss. Today, however, we have a good sense of where we are and are beginning to believe we can return to our former state. In February, we were looking at a record year. After March 1, it turned to record losses, pre-COVID and post-COVID, respectively. This generational event has changed how we think. In the early 1980s after -- 1990s rather, after the Soviet Union fell, there was a proclamation by a certain historian that it was the end of history as we knew it at that time. So it was after March 1 this year, it's the end of our history as we know it. Year-over-year comparisons are meaningless. Month-over-month is what is important. And the further, I remind you, we get away from March, the better our results will be. But for June, each of our subsequent months has improved consecutively since that time. And we expect this trend to continue through the end of this year and into 2021. And given this new measurement approach, we had a very good quarter. In fact, September wasn't a cash burn month, but rather it was a cash flow breakeven month. Breakeven, by the way, includes jet service and other payables. Also, this is without any CARES payments. On the P&L front, excluding special items, Q3 had a breakeven operating profit. And if you take September out of that mix, by itself, we had a 17% operating margin, our best month in the past 2 quarters, with actually better margins than we had in June. This operating profit, however, was aided by our CARES payments. This climb out of this abyss has been a slow one and will continue to be slower than we would like, small percentages each week with possible setbacks in the not-too-distant future. But we are seeing a better October than September, and we believe the same can be said as we look into November and December. You will hear from Greg about how strong we are positioned with cash going forward. And I want to highlight that we might be the only carrier who has not had a dilutive equity offering nor taken the extensive government loan package. Our total debt levels have only increased $130 million from year-end 2019 levels at the end of Q3. We did, however, add $150 million number additional debt in early October. Furthermore, our aircraft debt amortizes within 5 years very quickly. And on an annual basis, we are paying approximately $200 million in principal plus our interest cost. Our Q3 debt payments were $50 million, with just over half of that total paid in September. Yet we had sufficient cash flow from operations to cover these debt payments and other special items during the final month of Q3. But perhaps the best position we find ourselves in is our future CapEx requirements. Many others have large order books in front of them priced at pre-COVID numbers. Almost everyone will want to do sale/leasebacks to finance those purchases. Terms will certainly be more difficult, I would think, than the pre-COVID numbers. We, however, have minimal obligations going forward. In our delayed May report for the first quarter, I touched on the overnight change in our industry between the suppliers and operators. Historically, there's been a natural tension between our 2 groups, a zero-sum game of sorts, if you will. For the past 15 years, aircraft demand has been incredibly strong, particularly with the economic emergence of China, India and others. As a result, suppliers have held the upper hand, witnessed the recent 7- to 8-year order backlogs between Boeing and Airbus. Fast forward to November 2020, and the advantage has changed, namely it's moved to our side of the ledger. This is particularly true for carriers such as us that trade in used aircraft. The airline industry took it on the chin this year. The leasing industry has not seen the immediate problems faced by the airlines. Early on, no one understood the depth of this malady, and we were hopeful we would be in full rebound by now. And while we are seeing a slow steady rebound in the leisure segment here in the U.S., many places in the rest of the world still haven't found bottom. As a result, it appears 2021 will be a tough year for many aircraft owners. The Far East is upside down as we understand it, particularly carriers such as AirAsia, and many aircraft have been parked in the U.S. and Europe. The hope that a significant rebound will be happening in the next year, I believe, is fading. It doesn't appear our COVID problems will leave anytime soon. International governments are making up travel rules with each passing day. Now we are fortunate here in the U.S. we have a large, robust country with a well-heeled leisure travel segment. It appears the U.S. domestic leisure space will pull itself up and out of the pandemic in the coming months, hopefully in 2021. But as the apparent pandemic fatigue is setting in, people want this exercise to be over. Additionally, they're knowledgeable about what the risks are and are judging their actions accordingly. We will be the beneficiary, I believe, of this rebound in domestic travel. An added bonus will be the availability of inexpensive aircraft and associated parts, motors, et cetera, in the coming 12 to 24 months, perhaps longer. If so, we'll be able to substantially lower our ownership costs and add capital assets with minimal cash outlays. I'll repeat my comments from our last call, namely we continue to be the best of the worst. The U.S. airline industry will struggle for years, a number of years to come, I believe, particularly with respect to business and international traffic. Allegiant, with our focus exclusively on domestic leisure traffic, our flexible model plus our excellent cost structure, you'll hear some of that from Greg in a bit, should emerge from this fray better than most in the coming 12 to 24 months. Our shareholders are fortunate to have such a capable management group, which has shown its depth and understanding of how to maneuver in this extreme environment. Speaking as a shareholder, I know I'm grateful we have this talented team. Lastly, our team members have been the true heroes in our world. I want to, again, personally thank each one for all they have done during this trying 7 to 8 months. You are the backbone of this company. In the meantime, in the airline space, we will take care of our business, and we are survivors with a great company and an excellent business model. Thank you very much. And with that, I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn Redmond: Good afternoon. Thank you, Maury, and good afternoon, everyone. Hard to imagine after all we've gone through the last 8 months dealing with an industry-devastating pandemic that we'd be sitting on the highest cash balance in the history of the company of roughly $850 million at month-end while only adding roughly $300 million in debt and no dilutive equity, as Maury mentioned. Quite an accomplishment and a testament to the efforts of the entire Allegiant team. I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to thank them for their incredible efforts during these unprecedented times. Through the combination of a resilient business model, a very broad domestic network, leisure traveler-focused, quick and aggressive cost cutting and continued financial discipline, we are weathering the storm better than anyone such that we no longer will be referring to cash burn. Not only is the term creatively defined and seemingly unique to each carrier, it no longer applies to us. Greg will get into this with more detail in his remarks. It was very important for us to get the term out of the vernacular and was a guiding principle as we level set the entire organization. Since the Q1 earnings call, we have stated the number one priority was strengthening our balance sheet. We have come a long way since then, but our focus has not and will not change. We will continue paying down debt in a meaningful way as we move through 2021. Furthermore, our cost initiatives to date will put us in a position for our CASM -- our 2021 CASM-X to be below 2019 levels. With regards to Sunseeker, I have no new updates nor has there been any change to our approach or strategy. We have spoken to many and remain open to equity investments by others. While our conversations have been encouraging and we remain optimistic, I have nothing to report at this time. Our strengthening balance sheet and improving cash position should not be a sign we are positioning ourselves to restart the project. It's all about flexibility, and we believe there will be incredible generational opportunities to purchase planes in the coming years. Cash and low leverage will be golden. Stay tuned. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott Sheldon.\nScott Sheldon: Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. First off and before I get into providing some color on the third quarter, I want to start by saying thanks and expressing how proud I am of the entire Allegiant team and all of our partners throughout the network. Our operational results in 3Q were terrific. Your continued focus on health and safety, the sensitivity and care you show our guests and each other, and most importantly, the consistency and your daily execution is making an impact in restoring customer confidence in travel. As you'll hear from the rest of the leadership team here shortly, we are certainly seeing signs of life, signs that customers are becoming increasingly confident in returning to the air and your efforts will be as critical as ever as we move into 2021. Now quickly on to the third quarter. Despite the obvious continual challenges of operating in a COVID environment, which the highlights can be seen in our press release, there are 2 areas I wanted to comment on today. First is our core operational performance, where virtually every measurable metric is up year-over-year. The operations team produced seasonal best for D0 and A14 production. And with our controllable completion factor trending back to pre-COVID levels, we produced just $2.5 million in irregular ops cost, a dramatic bounce back from our second quarter lows. In addition, the operation team received tremendous help from the planning group. Drew and team's continued strategy of casting a wide net, creating as many selling opportunities as possible and a volatile demand environment has its inherent operational challenges. That being said, this group's execution and the resulting schedule integrity for the third quarter had a tremendous downstream impact on the operation. As an example, disruptive cancellations, which we define as cancellations within 7 days of travel, were over 6,700 during the second quarter off a base of nearly 17,000 total cancellations. As we exited the third quarter, our disruptive cancellations were just under 400 off a base of 6,800 total cancellations, so a 94% decrease. This not only reduced significant costs, but coupled with better operational execution, drove our Net Promoter Score back to pre-COVID levels. Once again, a great result, a great bounce back in a very difficult environment. And secondly, I wanted to take a few moments and comment on labor. As you recall from our second quarter, we are in active discussions with both the unionized and nonunionized labor groups about a number of different cost-saving measures with varying levels of success. It's with mixed emotions I can report, although we are ultimately successful in negotiating the right deals with the right partners, many folks were -- left the organization, but we are looking forward to a successful 2021. Ops labor costs, both direct and indirect, will be substantially down and ops headcount productivity, which we define as heads per aircraft, should return to levels not seen since 2013. On the unionized front, we're able to successfully negotiate near-term deals with dispatchers, flight attendants, and as of last night, our pilot group. I'd like to thank each of our union partners and leaders for their tireless efforts. Each agreement contain attributes -- different attributes, but I can say unequivocally, all contain the right and appropriate balance of cost flexibility while maintaining near full operational capabilities. On the nonunionized front and although we have a number of cost-saving voluntary programs in place, we made the difficult decision to rightsize the organization fairly aggressively, both in restructuring and reductions in force. I want to sincerely thank those individuals who are no longer here. They were instrumental in helping make Allegiant what it is today. And for that, I thank them. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott DeAngelo.\nScott DeAngelo: Thank you, Scott. Our commercial approach remains focused on leveraging the strengths of Allegiant's unique business model, being focused solely on domestic leisure travel, selling directly to our customers and having a proprietary commerce platform. As they have so many times before, these aspects of our business model have enabled us to stimulate and capture demand in a fashion that has us outpacing the sales in terms of relative web search traffic and leisure travel bookings, while at the same time, reducing our sales and marketing cost per booking by 75% versus prior year. Ultimately, our greatest commercial advantage has been the ability of our organization to pull together and solve for the cost side of the equation, while maintaining the majority of our flying schedules and not making unnatural changes to our network strategy. Doing so has the same light at the end of this pandemic tunnel, even amidst current levels of uncertainty. While the initial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown saw our number of bookings drop as much as nearly 90% below prior year back in April, before coming back to prior year levels briefly in mid-June, each subsequent shockwave has seen about half the negativity as the one before it. In mid-July, bookings fell to as much as 50% below prior year before gaining strength again through the end of September. And even now with recent headlines of rises in the number of COVID-19 cases, bookings appear to be stabilizing around the 25% to 30% below prior year. Based both on what our customers are saying and what our customers are doing, we see a clear divergence in terms of their attitudes toward the pandemic and their intentions toward leisure air travel. That is to say, customers believe the situation may once again be getting worse, but their leisure travel activity or their travel booking intent remains largely unchanged. Corroborating our own customer insights, which are gleaned through weekly tracking surveys that our marketing analytics team began building back in March, is tremendous data analytics work by our corporate intelligence team who's been expertly translating a variety of external data. Most notably, the consumer mobility data made available by Descartes Labs. This mobility tracking data shows that consumers nationally exhibit their highest level of movement since the pandemic began toward the end of this past quarter. And even with choppiness in the past several weeks, consumer mobility remains near that high point and on the rise as we head towards holiday travel. While pandemic fatigue among consumers may certainly account for some of this dynamic, many of our customers are also feeling more confident that they can smartly and safely begin resuming important aspects of their lives. This includes everyday activities like shopping and eating out, but also leisure travel activities like visiting family and friends, taking vacations to beaches and national parks or traveling to and from their second vacation homes. But this growing confidence to travel by air, again, comes with conditions. And for many customers, the most critical condition is that the flight must be nonstop, which of course is a hallmark of Allegiant's there-and-back approach to operate. Customers we surveyed were travel booked already, regardless of the airline, told us a single factor that most impacted their purchase decision during this time was finding a nonstop flight. Also, a strong majority of customers, regardless of whether or not they had travel currently booked, made it abundantly clear that the prospect of connections or layovers typically occurring in crowded hubs has a major negative impact on their intention to fly during the pandemic. While overall visitation to our website, allegiant.com, has been down versus last year, not surprisingly, it's worth noting that the vast majority of web visitors are coming at little or no cost and without the possibility for competitive interference by either directly entering the URL, allegiant.com, or by clicking on a link from one of our targeted marketing e-mails. In fact, web visitation from direct URL and e-mail marketing was actually up by more than 15% versus last year. Conversely, web visitation from general search pools like search engines and online travel agencies, which we of course don't sell through, but we do advertise on, is down by more than half versus last year. The fact we communicate directly with and sell directly to our customers sets us apart from those who depend primarily on search engines or OTAs for leisure travel bookings. As a result, despite lower overall visitation to allegiant.com, visitors have been converting at rates that are considerably higher than pre-pandemic levels. During the third quarter, about 2/3 of our bookings were directly attributable to tactics associated with our co-branded credit card or e-mail marketing campaigns. As mentioned in past calls, these programs focus on featuring work-from-home, away-from-home air and hotel packaged offers for Las Vegas and Florida destinations, reverse travel from larger cities to less populated national park or beach areas and targeted promotions based on age groups, family composition and/or second vacation home ownership. Looking forward, web searches at allegiant.com continue to show improvement for all travel weeks through late February. And in particular, search volume improvements concentrated around Thanksgiving and the weeks of Christmas and New Year's are especially encouraging. Third quarter also saw the debut of Allegiant Stadium on Monday Night Football's MegaCast this past September 21. More than 15 million viewers tuned in and billions of impressions were generated through broadcast and digital media. In fact, sports media measurement firms reported that Allegiant was the NFL's fourth strongest performing brand on social media ahead of iconic brands such as Pepsi, Lexus and Gatorade. Most importantly, Allegiant Stadium has enabled us to build awareness during a time that our traditional advertising tactics have been virtually nonexistent and drive web traffic from our major origin cities such as Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Pittsburgh, which were each up in web business by 50% to 60%; and large new cities for Allegiant, like Chicago, Boston and Houston, which were each up in web visits by 60% to 80%. And most reassuring has been the heightened impact Allegiant Stadium exposure has had on marketing activities such as e-mail marketing. Around the games played at the stadium, we've seen web visitation from e-mail marketing increase by more than 200% above its already relatively strong levels. And finally, going the distance for health and safety remains foundational to all that we do. And that includes proudly sharing our ranking by Safe Travel Barometer as the number one airline among North American carriers and among the top 5 worldwide for best COVID-19 Traveler Safety Measures.  But that wasn't the only award we earned this quarter. For the second consecutive year, the Allegiant World MasterCard was voted by USA TODAY readers as the #1 airline co-branded card. Our card loyalty program continues to be a shining example of how Allegiant continues to provide added value and flexibility to customers during these uncertain times. And with that, I'll turn it over to Drew Wells, Head of Revenue Management and Network Planning.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. Our third quarter revenue was down just more than 50% year-over-year, with scheduled service ASMs down 6.5%. Overall, I'm quite pleased with unit metric staying relatively flat on the nearly 60% jump in ASMs versus second quarter, as Maury mentioned earlier. The third quarter was interesting in that we never saw trough as low as April nor peaks as high as June for booking demand. However, a much more metered and consistent growth provided some stability and cautious optimism throughout the quarter, especially as it correlated very well with improvements in Scott's customer sentiment data. In fact, despite the revenue peaks around the 4th of July and Labor Day, the load factor in the last 2 weeks of September were the best of the quarter. As we look ahead, October will continue the load factor expansion we experienced through September. We've maintained TSA throughput share outperformance and are roughly double where we were last year. However, there will still be uncertainty as we enter the winter. Our fourth quarter ASMs should finish around 15% below last year in total, but will continue to be quite variable. Appropriately matching capacity to demand remains our main objective, and the peak Thanksgiving and Christmas weeks should see at least 30% more flying than the weeks earlier in those months. The approach of casting a wide net continues to provide us with insight that we could not have gotten otherwise. Despite justifiable concerns around leisure demand in September, we held a significant portion of our schedule for sale and were able to record arguably our best month of the pandemic. We believe that we've been the fastest to react to the significantly changing environment, and we will continue to be nimble as we approach some potentially large demand peaks and valleys. I am very thankful for everyone's perseverance and flexibility on the Allegiant team as we slowly climb out of the canyon. And with that, I'd like to pass it over to Greg.\nGregory Anderson: Thank you, Drew. Good afternoon, everyone. And I too want to echo the comments in praise and appreciation for our dedicated team members. Their professionalism and hard work throughout this unusual period has been key in keeping us well positioned. For the third quarter, our daily bookings averaged just over $2 million, resulting in an actual cash burn of $1.3 million per day. And this compares with our cash burn expectations of just over $1 million. The month of September, typically our lowest performing month of the year, was cash flow positive for the airline. And as a reminder, our cash burn definition takes into account cash from ops, total debt payments and CapEx. It excludes aircraft CapEx and also excludes any cash and tax benefits received from the CARES Act. As Drew mentioned, we saw slow and steady improvement in demand throughout the quarter. Recent trends are encouraging. And at both September and October, each are averaging more than $3 million per day in bookings. Turning to costs. Despite a capacity reduction of only 9.4%, our cash operating costs, which exclude ownership and special items, were down more than 3x that amount at 29%. Our adjusted CASM-X, which excludes special items and benefits from CARES Act, for the quarter was $0.0625 and less than our full year '19 CASM-X of $0.065. We have worked hard to pull every lever we have in our operation to cut costs and preserve cash. The listed measures we have taken is long, extensive and innovative. Regrettably, that list does include some strategic reductions to our workforce. It is heartbreaking to lose valued colleagues and friends, and we all share in that loss. These position eliminations came as a last resort, but are also incredibly meaningful in helping us get back to a breakeven cash flow status. Turning to our balance sheet. Throughout the pandemic, one of our top financial priorities is defending our balance sheet while ensuring sufficient liquidity to withstand the weakened demand environment. We are pleased with the progress to date, as we ended the third quarter with net debt of $840 million, which is even less than our net debt at year-end 2019 of $950 million. Our ability to navigate the pandemic without a material negative impact to our balance sheet is attributable to the following year-to-date cash inflow items: employee voluntary pay reductions and leaves, PSP grants and associated loans of $177 million, NOL carryback refund to date of $95 million with an additional $125 million expected to be received in early 2021, financing of $300 million and year-to-date EBITDA, excluding special items, of slightly positive at $2 million. And as a data point, we expect EBITDA to remain positive at average daily bookings of around $2.7 million or above. These cash inflows were offset by the following year-to-date outflows: CapEx of $190 million and heavy maintenance of $40 million. And this includes the $46 million for Sunseeker. Also, Sixth Street Partners termination payment of $15 million and total debt payments of $152 million, which includes $38 million of interest. And subsequent to the third quarter, we issued $150 million private placement bond, backed only by the collateral already pledged to our existing term loan. Not having to post incremental collateral was important as it allows us to maintain greater fleet flexibility by keeping 22 of our aircraft unencumbered. Pro forma for this bond, our cash balance was roughly $850 million. And at September's and October's booking levels of over $3 million per day, we are flirting with cash flow breakeven. While the environment remains fluid and bookings will certainly ebb and flow, our data suggests these average booking levels are sustainable moving forward. As such, we believe we have ample liquidity to see us through to a full recovery in demand. Given our sound financial footing, we declined to participate in the government loan program that would have provided the company with access to an additional $270 million in borrowings. Because we no longer view liquidity as a key risk to Allegiant, we will not be explicitly providing cash burn guidance going forward. Instead, we prefer to direct our messaging towards traditional areas such as capacity, op expense and capital expenditures. We expect the fourth quarter capacity reduction of around 15%. And we expect our total operating cost to be down closer to 25%, which assumes a fourth quarter fuel cost per gallon of $1.35 and imply the total airline CASM of down 10% year-over-year. We have made a number of long-term structural cost improvements to cope with the reduced demand for airfare. And in total, we expect structural cost changes to equate to about $75 million in annual operating cost savings. These include $40 million in labor, $15 million in marketing, $15 million in IT and another $5 million in other. And as a result, we expect CASM-X fuel to be meaningfully reduced based off the 2019 capacity levels. Looking to CapEx, for the remaining 3 months of 2020, we expect total CapEx, including heavy maintenance, to be roughly $130 million. And 75% of this relates to the acquisition of 5 A320 aircraft. Options to finance these aircraft are readily available. But given our current liquidity position, additional borrowings may not be required. We expect to end 2020 with gross debt of about $1.65 billion. And based on our current booking trends, we expect to end 2020 in a net debt position of roughly $875 million, which too compares favorably to our ending 2019 net debt of $950 million. Turning to fleet. We expect to end the year with 93 aircraft in operations, 5 in temporary storage and 8 planned for permanent retirement. As we look towards '21 and beyond, we are not burdened with the costly fleet order. We believe this is a key strategic advantage for Allegiant. In addition, we continue to see an influx of potential deals for used A320ceos at prices significantly discounted from pre-COVID levels. The post-COVID environment may provide a unique opportunity to either strategically replace aircraft and/or grow our fleet depending on demand. At the economics we are seeing, such deals should lead naturally in averaging down our ownership cost, further improving our already industry-leading low fixed cost structure. In addition, by enhancing our fleet flexibility, we expect to further reduce future heavy maintenance costs. As an example, recently, we were presented with an attractive opportunity to bring in a leased A320 in 2021. And so we quickly actioned retirement of an older A319, which was due for a costly maintenance visit. The leased A320 will have lower ownership cost than the 319, more seats, and we will harvest the engines from the A319 to avoid costly heavy maintenance CapEx. As Maury mentioned, there are more potential fleet transactions where we would have the ability to minimize upfront cash requirements that's helping to keep our future CapEx at lower levels. For '21 CapEx, including heavy maintenance, we currently anticipate $125 million. This includes $40 million for 2 aircraft to be delivered in early '21. Prior to COVID, we estimated our '21 CapEx spend would have been at least $100 million higher just between the incremental heavy maintenance and other non-aircraft CapEx.  We currently expect to end 2021 with between 98 and 103 aircraft in operations, with travel demand determining when we return to service our aircraft and temporary storage. And in closing, we are very well positioned. We have sufficient liquidity to manage through the crisis. Our debt levels are modest. Our quickly amortizing debt will have offset the equivalent of around 40% of the debt we raised since the onset of the pandemic. This will happen by year-end. And then we think the remaining balance could be offset by next year -- by next year's end. We also expect our full year interest expense in 2020 to be around $55 million, which is 25% less than the $75 million interest we paid in 2019. And currently, we expect 2021's full year interest to be lower than 2020. So to the best of my knowledge, Allegiant is the only carrier since the onset of the pandemic to nearly double its cash position, lower net debt, reduce interest expense, all without issuing an equity dilutive transaction. This provides us confidence we will continue to remain very well positioned on the other side of this pandemic. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: I'm listening to this call, and I'm just thinking what planet are you guys on? Because it doesn't at all seem to reconcile with the planet that I'm on with respect to being an observer of the industry. So congratulations on getting to breakeven and really essentially positive free cash flow. I guess, a couple of questions here. And Greg, I guess, you ran through kind of the big sort of ticket items for why CASM-X in 2021 will be below 2019. You talked about the $75 million of structural change. And is there anything sort of incremental to that? Or -- you had highlighted labor. You talked about IT, marketing and other. Is that what's driving it? Or are there other elements of efficiency? And maybe it's -- you guys are building in just lower aircraft ownership cost in 2021 for any sort of incremental shells that you bring on, just given where the market is today versus where it was pre-COVID? Any additional color there?\nGregory Anderson: Sure. Thanks for the comments. Let me start with the last point. No, we're not building in any improvements in our ownership cost through some of the strategic kind of initiatives we're looking around the fleet side. We wouldn't do that until deals were actioned. So we're just taking a conservative approach on the fixed side of the cost. But no, you're spot on. I think the major areas that we're focused on: one, and Scott hit on this in his opening remarks with labor and productivity. As John mentioned, I will set the organization, and we're going to rebuild and we're going to be more productive. To put that into perspective, I think in 2019, we had roughly 50 FTEs per aircraft. In 2021, we expect to have 38. And we haven't had that level of productivity since back in 2015, I think, and before. So that's a big one. Marketing, I think I'd like to -- DeAngelo is here. I can give him and his team a shout out, because they -- through this pandemic, they find ways -- they have found many ways to be more surgical and more efficient with the capital that we can provide to them, and they're getting better. And so we feel comfortable and confident to take our marketing budget down, and that's a structural improvement. And then IT and the other areas that you mentioned, there's just -- there's a lot of improvements from there. We think we'll be more productive and just better on the other side because of this.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. And then just my second question, and this is really for Maury and John. As we come up to the election, Dems versus Republicans, and this is not me trying to call out what you're -- politically which side you're leaning toward. I'm just curious, depending on how things play out, what outcome is better to Allegiant? And what I'm really moving towards is the fact that if we do get a blue wave, the concern is that in the past, we've seen the Dems being much more aggressive in sponsoring legislation. That, to some extent, would undermine the Allegiant model, i.e., kind of a return of regulation on seat size and the like, on one hand. On the other, airline employees are their peeps and don't want to do anything that undermines the businesses that they work for and reregulation ultimately impacts profitability and ultimately impacts what union employees can earn. So there's some tension there, and that's what we've seen in the past. And the possibility maybe of additional stimulus, which is good for the overall economy. So I know it's sort of a broad question. How do you think about Allegiant, whether we get a blue wave or we end up getting something in between, what's best for Allegiant?\nMaurice Gallagher: I'll go first, and John can follow-up. In the many years I've been doing this, my goal is just to hold steady and not to go ahead, just can you hold where you're at and see what you can stay away from. Certainly, we've seen the blue side has been very much a regulation. And down here, we've got a lot of deregulation under Mr. Trump's administration with just [indiscernible] things up and allowing us to do things. I think the seats thing has been settled, but I'm not going to sit here and say it hasn't. You opened up Pandora's box if you go in and try and reregulate the seats in the airplane. I can't speak for anybody that way. I just know that you start -- kind of rolling that forward, it's going to be a huge problem. And this industry is already being subsidized by the federal government in effect. And if you want to take seats out of the airplane, the economics are pretty simple. So while we talk about that, I don't know that you'll see that happen. I think you'll see a lot of labor initiatives. They're already on record saying they want to improve the ability for people to unionize and that we're already a union industry. So there's probably not a lot of downside there. But the biggest downside would be a green movement where you want to see the older airplanes go away for improved green, which has so by neos and the new engine types. [indiscernible] would be a plus for Boeing, GE and those types -- Airbus, for that matter. So we'll have to see. But if I take our model, one thing we do well is we adapt. And we're going to make it work for [Technical Difficulty]. We're just a pass-through agent. They increase the cost, we'll pass it through. That's what we do well. And we'd probably be better at that than anybody else. John?\nJohn Redmond: All right. Yes. I mean Maury's comments, of course, I echo those, they're spot on. I think when you look at the team here, for this entire year, we've never had a conversation on what-if at all. We only deal with things that we can control, and that's what we've been focused on, right? So we've just been spending a lot of time doing everything that Greg just referenced. One of the biggest ones, of course, was just level-setting the organization from a labor standpoint. I think the further away you get from 10.1, the less likely -- there's a retroactive component to whatever may happen, right? Just because every airline has taken whatever steps it feels to be able to rightsize its organization. So labor is what it is. But our focus is just trying to control what we have control over. And I think we've moved very quickly and aggressively to deal with all that since the onset of all this.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Maybe just a network question. Obviously, preference for direct flights certainly resonates right now. It's always been a part of the model, but it certainly resonates right now. And so many dots have been taken off of the domestic map, not from an Allegiant perspective, but from a U.S. airline industry perspective. And so I wonder if you could talk a little bit about new market opportunities that may be opening up. It feels like there would just be a lot of green space for your low frequency model right now, given where capacity is.\nDrew Wells: Yes, Duane, this is Drew. And I think you're spot on. We had already communicated a significant network runway pre-pandemic and didn't have any concerns about our ability to grow, and there will certainly be incremental opportunities that stem from this. I think we're trying to kind of be level-headed about how we approach this and not trying to grow too fast into this with uncertainty, but not trying to sit back either and trying to find that right balance, I guess. So I think you'll see things from us that we know that there's going to be growth available. So I'll give you kind of a big generic answer here, saying that, yes, opportunities exist, and we will be looking for them, timing kind of TBD.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So far, it's been preserving what you have and preserving connectivity that you had and less diversifying into new markets, is that fair?\nDrew Wells: Largely fair. We've had one route announcement that was relatively small by our standards, less than 10 routes. Kind of strengthening where we're strong, particularly from a destination perspective. And those have all started off quite well. We haven't had our first flight on any of those yet, but still in the booking phase there. But certainly, I would agree that there's more that will come from this.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then just for my follow-up non-airline, I apologize if this is in the disclosure. But can you just tell us where non-airline revenue and cost and kind of loss was here in the third quarter? I imagine it's a lot skinnier. And what your outlook is going forward? It feels like what we should be solving to is sort of the airline CASM-X from 2019, not the overall CASM-X. But would appreciate your thoughts there.\nGregory Anderson: It's Greg again. Thanks for the question. And yes, I think the spirit of what you mentioned is correct. It's the focus back on the airline. But maybe I'll just run through the 3 non-airline business lines, starting with nonstop. So that's been -- for the third quarter, that was closed down, very minimal costs associated with that. Nothing to report. No revenue there. As far as Sunseeker, similarly, it was very minimal cost, maybe $1 million or so throughout the quarter that we paid just for security or just to make sure we're protecting our investment in that asset. And then with Teesnap, that still remains an asset held for sale. Team has done a really nice job of being self-sufficient there, restructuring that organization. That's actually turned to a positive position. So it's actually earning cash and it has for the past 6, 7 months. So -- but we'll still explore strategic options there, and we are. And we have nothing to report today, but once we have more, we'll report back on that front.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: Just on the fleet side, I recognize you're going to be opportunistic with things that come up. But right now, how many kind of aircraft do you have grounded? And what's your plan as you look to 2020 CASM-X being less than 2019? And is that assuming kind of 2019 levels of flying?\nGregory Anderson: Yes. I mean we're not -- we haven't come out and given capacity guidance on '21. I was just pointing or just saying as a data point based on 2019 capacity, we would expect CASM-X to be less. But as we think about the fleet, Savi, we're going to go ahead. As far as where we sit today, we have 5 that are on storage, temporary storage. We're considering all fleet -- or flexible fleet kind of, if you will. So depending on the environment and demand, we would bring those back into service. Last call, I think we mentioned we had identified 7 aircraft for retirement. But given the deal I just mentioned in my opening remarks, that's now up to 8. And we'll retire the majority of those through this year and with a few stragglers into next year.\nSavanthi Syth: Got it. And then just a quick question on the vouchers within ATL. It seems like maybe 65% of the ATL is vouchers. What are you seeing in terms of usage of those vouchers? And has that kind of trend changed as bookings have moved up?\nGregory Anderson: Yes. Definitely, we've seen the voucher redemptions trend increase. So I think like pre-COVID, it was like 1% or 2%, it was really small as compared to revenue. Right now, it's at 15% to 20%. So we've definitely seen an increase. We're working through those. So I think the last report I had, Savi, since March, through the end of the quarter, we had issued about $350 million in credit vouchers. And so we've burned through, I think we're $220 million now, so -- right? So we burned through about $130 million. I mean the cadence of those issuance of credit vouchers has come down significantly. To put that into perspective, I think March was $150 million alone. And so -- and then I think October -- October to date is much less than September, which was less than August. So we're burning through it. But there -- we will see. But yes, I think that's -- am I missing anything, Drew, on that? Anything else you want to add?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: A little bit more on Sunseeker. John, for you, you said you're optimistic. What did you mean by that? Are you just basically suggesting you're optimistic that this project can still occur, just not in the way that it was originally intended, not on your balance sheet? Is that what you're getting at when you say that -- when you use that word?\nJohn Redmond: No. It more relates to the conversations we're having with people that will be able to find some sort of a solution that hopefully would involve additional equity partners. So we've had a lot of great conversations. There's several doing due diligence work. We realize it's obviously a big project for people to look at, but we've had some great conversations. So that's all I was getting at is that we're optimistic about these conversations we've had and people's level of interest.\nHunter Keay: I got it. Okay. And then I think probably one for Scott Sheldon. Can you elaborate on the terms of the pilot agreement that you reached last night? Is this reduction in minimum pay guarantee? I mean what gives you flexibility to grow or shrink if conditions warrant, like we've been seeing from some of your competitors? Anything you could -- and is it final or do you have to vote on it? Can you just give us some more color on that, please?\nScott Sheldon: Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes. So as we said back in 2Q and we communicated this to the pilot group that there was a possibility that we could furlough up to 275 folks. That would obviously drive a number of downgrades. We had already actioned 100 of those 275. That was basically as of October 1. The next 100, we were getting ready to action basically October 31. Unfortunately, we didn't have a lot of preventative and voluntary programs in place, meaning just voluntary leads, flexibility on when schedules are at release, so we get a better idea of what Drew and team wants to fly. So these guys -- basically, we were shooting over different possibilities literally up until late last night. So basically, our furlough profile is capped at 130. If you think about the 130, 60 of those were new hires that hadn't even been bidders on the line yet. So ultimately, the impact of the 130 and the associated 30 downgrades is minimal. If you look at what we want to go fly even margin and even through the summer and targeting a 98 or 103 aircraft profile, we can do that very comfortably. If we want to bring these folks back, we can. So that's basically kind of the language in what was agreed to yesterday. But we didn't change rate. We didn't change the guarantee. But it's sizable savings when you think about the 30 downgrades and just the 130 that were on payroll that are no longer on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Maury, can you talk a little bit about kind of the timing of when you think you would start to invest more meaningfully in the business again, I guess, primarily on the aircraft side? And maybe the magnitude of the investment that you think you'd be willing to make at this point?\nMaurice Gallagher: Well, Joe, I think that we're going to feel that out as we go along with the ability to add airplanes with minimal cash approaches. It makes it easier for us to add new equipment. I think we'll also have the benefits of lower cash requirements for (technical Difficulty]. And so our cash balances should stay very, very nice. But I think in the next 3 years, we can add a good number of shelves with some minimal amount of money out there, powered by the [indiscernible] out there. We can do fixed rates that are, candidly, we can get an A320 now for a release rate that's the same as we're paying for a A319 on the depreciation stuff. The other piece of this is we like to own other planes, particularly as you get mid-level, towards the back-end of their lives. You don't want to be returning older airplanes. It's possible to do that on a lease basis. So we think we can still structure deals where we effectively reverse the purchase instead of putting your money down upfront with debt. The owner of the airplane carries the paper, and we buy it out of the backside. So when you think about that, you don't have to put much capital up, you can add the shelves. I think we'll have to just see. We debate inside and go fast, make -- just take your time. But as the data reveals itself, it appears there's opportunities out there. And 1 or 2 things we can do, we can certainly grow shelves where we can replace 319 perhaps with 186-seat airplanes. You can get an airplane with 186 seats, 30 more seats than the 319 for the same ownership cost. The marginal cost to fly that airplane is minimal. And my way of looking at it is no one at 747 runs (technical Difficulty] on a Tuesday. But I'll take the benefits of flying 747 around during the week to have those profit potential seats on the peak days.\nJoseph DeNardi: Maury, are you on the go-fast or the take-your-time side of the argument?\nMaurice Gallagher: Yes.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Okay. And then maybe a question for Drew. Just on the network side, can you talk about kind of the level of competition that you're seeing now? And then probably more importantly, what -- how much less competitive the network will be on the other side of this as you're thinking about it?\nDrew Wells: Yes. We've certainly seen level of competition come down over the last 6 to 8 months. There's been a handful of new leisure-oriented markets announced by other carriers on top of us. By and large, those have already been competitive routes, so they're incrementally new to us, just some incremental seats, which never a great thing, but not quite the same as new competition. We've been heading back down -- and maybe someone else here knows the exact number. We've down south of 15% competitive, I believe, over the last few months. So in a markedly better position than we've been in the last several years, for sure, as we began making a series of network investments that elevated that number of touch. As we move forward, all of the routes that we talked about, pre-pandemic, only about 10% of those were competitive. And we're going to enable us to kind of build that moat even deeper and wider. And I think as a lot of industry network decisions take place, that number will get even better as routes come open. So I could see us living in a world closer to 10% for a while. That might be a touch optimistic, but I think is plausible as we look forward in the short to medium term.\nJohn Redmond: I think one of the things too, just to add on what Drew said, when you look at that, even on those competitive routes, the pricing environment going forward with the levels of debt that all these carriers have added is going to be very interesting. We haven't done that. So our pricing structure is not going to be completely out of whack where the competition can't say that. I mean they're going to have interest expense that is incredible for a long time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Helane Becker of Cowen.\nHelane Becker: I'm not sure who, but the Stadium was referenced in, and it actually -- I haven't been there yet, but it does look like a really nice stadium. And I'm kind of wondering if you have been able to determine the revenue benefit versus the cost and what it's been -- and I know it's been about a month or so. What has been so far maybe? And where you see the track you see it going? So maybe the return on that invested capital?\nScott DeAngelo: You bet. This is Scott DeAngelo. Thanks for the question. I'll give you the constructs of how we think about it. There's 2 basic ways. One is I mentioned and do a bunch of goofy big numbers in terms of billions of impressions, millions of viewers. That we take and is all able to translate into what you would have to spend to get that anyway. And as Greg mentioned earlier, we've been able to pull down by $15-or-more million in marketing based on what that investment is able to get us. So that's one way we talk about that, the cost side of the value and what we're able to take down. And then conversely, on the revenue side, I mentioned the kind of lift we see in e-mail marketing. But the same thing is true of anything and everything we do. Because of that heightened sense of awareness, we measure the baseline lift. Let's say, 1% of people get our e-mails, open them and click through, and now that goes to 1.1%, 1.2% and just play that small ballgame all the way to see what that return is. And so we measure that as well. The line in the sand is that we need what is roughly 2/10 of a percentage point, 20 bps across everything that we do to get several million more people in the funnel over a year's time, meaning to the website. And then all of the things equal, that gets us over a hurdle rate of what the investment is. So without specific numbers, that's how we think about it from a construct point of view and then how we measure it.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Actually that's pretty helpful. And then I know that this question was sort of asked. For my follow-up question, but Maury was breaking up, so I didn't really get the answer other than maybe he said lease rates on A320s are about equal to what they are for A319s. So are you looking at acquiring -- I mean, any aircraft that you would bring on above maybe what's already there, the 103 that was referenced as where you can end the year? Are you looking at bringing them on as owned aircraft or as leased aircraft? I would think owned aircraft would make more sense than leased aircraft.\nGregory Anderson: This is Greg. Maybe I'll just kick it off real quick and then Robert Neal is in the room who heads -- he's our Treasurer and heads up our fleet acquisition team. The way we're looking at it is what makes the most sense and the best economics. So Maury -- I think what Maury was alluding to or getting at is there's deals out there where we don't have to put up capital upfront. We can get kind of really strong rates -- lease rates and then pay in the back-end, call it like a reverse mortgage type thing. But yes, so we're just looking at deals that make sense. We're not going out. We're looking at almost the onesies and twosies to see if it makes sense to either replace the existing aircraft that are coming up on heavy maintenance events or if they're -- if they're -- sorry, they're coming near retirement age as well. But with that, let me turn it over to B.J, if he has anything to add color on that side.\nRobert Neal: Yes. I think it's probably a little bit of both. I mean we want to own our aircraft at the end of the day, and most folks we work with know that. But I think near term, there's probably some really good opportunity for natural lease expiries from other carriers over the next 24 months, and that's where we've seen the most benefit.\nScott Sheldon: What Maury was saying, just so you have that data point correct, what he was referring to, just to give you an idea of how the market is, what he was saying is that we are seeing deals with a lease rate on a 320 that's less than the ownership cost on a 319.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That makes more sense.\nOperator: That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Maury Gallagher for closing remarks.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you all very much. Appreciate your inputs, and we'll see you again in another 90 days. Have a good week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce your host for this conference call, Ms. Sherry Wilson. You may begin, ma'am.\nSherry Wilson: Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to the Allegiant Travel Company's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Maury Gallagher, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Redmond, the company's President; Scott Sheldon, our EVP and Chief Operating Officer; Greg Anderson, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Scott DeAngelo, our EVP and Chief Marketing Officer; Drew Wells, our VP of Revenue and Planning; and a handful of others to help answer questions.

To view this earnings release as well as the rebroadcast of the call, feel free to visit the company's Investor Relations site at ir.allegiantair.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Maurice.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you, Sherry, and thank you all for joining us today. First, let me thank all of our team members, their spouses and families as we continue to fly our passengers during these difficult times. They've done yeoman's work. I'm sure you've all heard of the movie, Groundhog Day with Bill Murray and his adventures are repeating the same day over and over. That's where we find ourselves today. Each day seems to be repeating itself as we wind our way through the slow motion video called COVID. Each of us is managing through these repetitive awkward days in our own way. Bottom line, I believe things will get better, but most likely not as fast as we all would have liked. Today, we and the airline industry are putting our economic hopes on the upcoming holidays at the end of the year and 2021. Many of my colleagues have been providing you their best guesses on what will happen in the future. So let me throw a few ideas out there.  First and foremost, I don't believe we'll go back to a full shutdown. People just won't put up with it. And while we were -- made an operating profit in June, very proud of that and thought we might have -- be back to some form of normalcy, I don't believe we will get back to those numbers anytime soon. At a minimum, the near-term calendar will not allow it. At present, we believe we have a plan -- we have to plan on this current state as being the norm. The near-term problem is how do we work towards breakeven cash flow.  In the middle of August until November 15 is traditionally one of our slowest periods, particularly September. Given the problems we are seeing will be even more difficult than in past years, assuming no CARES extension, adjusting labor costs is our #1 cash flow lever available, as we work towards our breakeven cash flow goal. We will eliminate 220 jobs, including 87 personnel associated with those jobs on October 1, a difficult task, but a necessary one. We are in the late stages of discussions with our other contract personnel that will allow us to generate the needed savings in the coming months. We want to keep as many team members on board as possible to take advantage of our operating peaks. To do this in between these peaks, we need financial relief on our labor payrolls. We need to spread the pain, as we've said in the past, to save labor expense accordingly. Unfortunately, our pilots' leadership is unwilling to work with us on this approach. And as a result, we have notified the IBT management and we intend to furlough up to as many as 275 of our crew members, pilots, that is. While we're going to -- having to do this, these numbers will allow us to optimize both the peaks and valleys that we just discussed in the coming months and into 2021. You'll hear more about this from Scott Sheldon in just a moment.  With respect to liquidity, we're in good shape, given what we know today. Our cash balance was $663 million at the end of the quarter, up almost 50% from our Q1 balance. We also have other capital avenues open to us if we feel we have a need to go-to-market, including near-term prospects of an extension of the CARES Act, and Greg will fill you in with more of those specifics. I'm very happy how we have managed through our worst situations in the past 5 months. We've led the industry in most -- almost all of the new -- that are now -- what we call the now important operating areas, including we had the largest percentage of our scheduled flown compared to other carriers. We had the largest percentage of passengers carried compared to our historic market share, and we had the best negative cash burn percentage.  I've joked around the office that we are the best of the worst, given the state of the airline industry and the tourism industry overall. Once again, our model with its flexibility is allowing us to react as demand dictates. It will continue to be our strategic asset in the coming months, as we quickly adjust to the vagaries that the market allows us to experience. It has provided us with terrific financial results over the years and continues to allow us to lead the industry in near-term results.  Our financial strength has also allowed us to minimize the dilution to our shareholders during this period. As I said in our last call, we have not had to go to the equity or convert markets and have no plans to. Our $200 million plus of tax refunds from NOLs has and will provide us with the equivalent of a good-sized equity raise. Those NOL dollars are a return of our tax dollars paid on our profits from our 68 quarters of profitability in past months and years. These are difficult times, hard to believe times, frankly. Hopefully, there will be some relief in the near term by a slowdown in the virus cases. Perhaps the only better near-term news, given the increase in cases we've been experiencing is that the rate of death has dropped substantially.  Many people are working tirelessly to find ways to both control or end this terrible plague. News of vaccines are reassuring, a decline in reported cases would also be beneficial. But at the end of the day, to return to any semblance of normalcy to begin to interact with others as we used to do, people have to believe they won't become infected. This is particularly important for our industry since leisure activities involve people congregating in close quarters.  We're hearing good news about increased testing. Good. We need more of this. And while more testing is better, I'm concerned about its ability to scale to the levels we need, about the time it takes to receive results and about what one does with the information on their status. Namely, it's easy to know what to do if you have it, you quarantine yourself. If your test is negative, you're happy about the results, but what do you do with this information? How does it help the instant problem of getting together with others and feeling good about it? If you look at our medical establishment, it was not designed nor does it have the capacity to provide us the one thing we all want to need most in today's COVID environment, information.  When I get my negative test results, good information, like I said, but then what? As an important or perhaps more important, I want information that tells me the person next to me is not infected. Not a big ask until it becomes everyone, 330 million people, and it becomes an almost impossible ask. Only the federal government can manage this national task, I would hope there are plans in the offering to develop a national approach to managing this pandemic and the next one, that is sure to follow. We cannot allow this type of event to cause this level of disruption anytime in the future.  In the meantime, as I said on the last call, I believe we will continue to be one of the top performers. In my opinion, we have the ability to flex ourselves to meet the conditions better than any other carrier. Our model will continue to serve us well. Lastly, I want to again personally thank each one of our team members for all they have done for us during these trying past 5 months. You are the backbone of this company. In the meantime, in the airline space, we will take care of business. We are survivors with a great company and an excellent business model. John?\nJohn Redmond: Thank you very much, Maury, and good afternoon, everyone. Of course, I echo Maury's comments regarding our incredible team members here and the sacrifices they and their families have made through this craziest of times.  I thought I'd spend a quick couple of minutes talking about leisure travel space since those are the only people flying now and deep into 2021, if not all of '21. On most other airlines, the lucrative business traveler accumulates frequent flyer miles using a company credit card for business-related travel and then uses their accumulated miles from business travel as currency to pay for their leisure travel. The databases of these other airlines are populated with people whose leisure travel is free or substantially offset through the use of accumulated business travel miles. I am sure a lot of you are walking examples of this.  As a result, there was little to no reason for these individuals to comparison shop when traveling for leisure. As these other carriers pivot to a leisure travel-only environment, they are marketing to people who historically have not used their own wallet for leisure travel. Will some of these people fair shop going forward when using their own money? I would imagine some percentage will after burning off their accumulated points. The Allegiant database, on the other hand, is populated solely with people who have used their own money since the inception of the airline.  We have been accumulating e-mails and data on these cash-paying leisure customers for over 20 years. We have been marketing to these individuals pushing leisure-only travel options for longer than any other domestic carrier. It is not an accident that we are performing better than all the other airlines in the leisure-only environment. Speaking of leisure, I want to further expand on the $20 million settlement with Sixth Street Partners. As long as the agreement was in place, we were required to invest another $150 million in equity with a completion guarantee and date of December of '21. The settlement agreement gives us much more flexibility in dealing with the project from an outright sale, finding an additional equity partner or further borrowings, Greg will expand further in his comments.  In the COVID-19 related special charges section of the release, there was an additional salary and benefit expense relating to physician eliminations that Greg will expand on in his comments. As difficult as the decision was, it demonstrates how quickly we will move to reduce cash burn and rightsize the business model. Going forward, we will pull additional cost out, if necessary, to adjust to the revenue environment we find ourselves in. On that note, I'll turn it over to Scott.\nScott Sheldon: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I'd like to thank our 4,500 plus team members and partners across the network for their outstanding service. Your efforts since the start of this pandemic has been amazing and the sensitivity and carry you've shown our guests and each other are the reason we have and will continue to be successful.  COVID has resulted in challenging all aspects of our operation in ways we couldn't have contemplated 6 months ago, from shutting down operations, restarting operations, canceling and revising schedules, cutting costs, educating consumers creating new safety strategies and health policies have all introduced a great deal of complexity to the operation, and the team's execution has been something we should all be proud of.  From the onset of the pandemic, we had 3 immediate focus areas: The first was ensuring the safety of our passengers and Allegiant team members. This continues to be our top priority. Our customer experience leadership team and members of our emergency command center have done an amazing job rolling out initiatives related to Allegiant's going the distance for health and safety program, offering additional layers of safety throughout a guest journey, along with an enhanced educational campaign to drive consumer confidence are critical to our long-term success.  Second was rapidly adjusting our daily operations to reflect a near 0 demand environment, while positioning our operational cost structure for the long-term slow recovery. As you'll hear from Drew, our strategy of maintaining a wide selling footprint, managing cancellations close in on the 7- to 10-day cycle has resulted in our outsized 2Q performance relative to our industry peers. Unfortunately, we find ourselves at somewhat of a crossroads as we look for additional cost-saving opportunities as we exit our summer peak into what is traditionally our weakest quarter. Much more on that to follow.  And third was to develop an aircraft storage program for potential fleet management scenarios, as we progress through the recovery. As mentioned on our earlier call, our fleet, induction, maintenance and engineering teams did a tremendous job standing up flexible program that will allow us to execute any number of strategies in the back half of the year on short notice.  Despite a successful June, we all recognize how deep this pandemic really is, and it's clearly going to last longer than we had hoped. COVID hotspot, flare-ups, quarantines, state pausing, reopening plans, and in many cases, reimposing restrictions provide for a very choppy and uncontrollable demand outlook. As we move into the back half of the year, our focus now becomes how do we balance our continued approach of casting a wide selling net, maintaining base and labor structure integrity while driving much needed cost relief, particularly in soft shoulder months. No doubt costs have to come out of the organization in this current revenue environment, if we are going to approach our goal of being cash flow neutral by the end of the year. Therefore, our focus has been and continues to be driving down labor costs and improving productivity, so differently doing more with less employees in all aspects of the organization.  During the second quarter, we made strides in reducing labor costs in both unionized and nonunionized workgroups. On the nonunionized labor front, we eliminated 121 positions within the ops organization. These reductions are expected to save the company approximately $9 million in annual labor costs through voluntary or early retirement programs. Also with virtually all in line-level support teams working from home, we continue to find ways to drive productivity and consolidate areas of responsibility, which we feel confident there are more savings. In the event these savings are not attainable, we may look at a second round of headcount reductions in order to meet our goals.  On the unionized labor front, we were very transparent from the start of the pandemic on challenges we faced as an organization. We work closely with the union leadership through weekly meetings and educational town halls to specifically lay out our strategy, knowing we would need their involvement and cooperation at some point. Well, that point is unfortunately now. Despite the fact we are able to drive approximately $10 million in line level labor savings through the combination of emergency time off agreements and better scheduling practices, which essentially drove down flight crew guarantees to contractual minimums. We need additional cooperation as CARES support funds roll off October 1, if we want to eliminate network disruptions.  As Maury mentioned in his opening remarks, we've been in discussions with all unionized workgroups to drive creative solutions to reduce labor costs in much needed off-peak periods. We've made substantial progress with most of our groups and hope to have something to report shortly. That being said, we have noticed IBT leadership of our intention to furlough up to 275 pilots. Unfortunately, there appears to be little appetite within the IBT leadership to engage in constructive talks. Therefore, we have taken the first necessary step and plan to execute accordingly.  In closing, we remain focused on structuring our organization for the current reality. COVID is here to stay. It's unpredictable and relying on a stable demand outlook isn't the best strategy. Reducing controllable costs, namely labor, while maintaining maximum flexibility is what we're focused on. We plan to push forward with labor discussions and remain optimistic. We can come to some sort of creative solution, but are ready to modify our approach, if need be. All in all, this is a difficult balancing act, but I'm confident our team is up for the challenge. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott DeAngelo.\nScott DeAngelo: Thank you, Scott. Our commercial approach remains focused on going the distance for health and safety while providing value and flexibility to customers during these uncertain times. And our unique business model of all nonstop routes, which enable our customers to avoid crowded hubs, direct-to-consumer distribution, which enables us to sell at industry-low sales and marketing costs and focus on selling beyond the aircraft to third-party products, all helped us punch above our weight, so to speak, in Q2, and continue to position us well as market demand returns.  During the second quarter, despite the challenging demand environment, Allegiant saw relative highs in web traffic and load factor versus the industry. And as Maury had mentioned, our share of total U.S. passengers was nearly 3x higher than it was during the second quarter last year. In addition, our increasingly precise and predictive digital marketing approach, along with co-op funding support from many of our great airports and destination partners, enabled us to reduce our sales and marketing costs on a per booking basis by more than 90%.  There's no silver bullet to generating demand at a time like this, but there is a silver lining in getting more cost efficient and effective at capturing the demand that does exist across the markets we serve. We continue to stay close to our customers, primarily through our weekly customer sentiment tracking survey, which we've been building weekly since March. We're finding that the everyday mobility of our customers has become a leading indicator of sorts for their willingness to travel. About 2/3 of our customers currently say they feel comfortable eating on at restaurants or going to shopping centers where they live. When it comes to travel, nearly 1/3 tell us they plan to travel by air in the next 3 months and have planned to do so before the end of the year. Only 1/4 of customers say that they're actually delaying travel plans altogether. Most are closely monitoring the situation before booking or simply traveling as planned.  It certainly helps that more than half of our customers continue to report that their personal finances have not been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 situation. And an additional 1/3 said their personal finances have only been somewhat negatively impacted. For those customers who flew with us during Q2, 20% were flying between their primary residents and a second vacation home. 1/3 were visiting family or relative. And just under 1/2 were on vacation or even working remotely at a hotel or vacation rental.  To that end, we continue to be vigilant by engaging with our hotel partners across the nation to create more value for our customers and stronger economics for Allegiant. We're also addressing trends we're beginning to see emerge as part of the next normal. For example, we are working with a top Las Vegas Casino resort operator to capture opportunities presented by the rise in remote working. As John referenced earlier, the business traveler, paying on the corporate card, is now giving way to the individual traveler paying their own way to work remote, but away from home.  And last, but maybe most notable, has been Allegiant's unique ability to serve what has become a relatively strong reverse travel trend as people from larger cities, like Los Angeles, Oakland and Phoenix in the West or like Tampa, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale in the East, have increasingly planned their vacations to more natural, less crowded destination like Yellowstone National Park, Mt. Rushmore, the Smoky Mountains and Niagara falls. And with that, I'll turn it over to Drew Wells. Head of Revenue and Planning.\nDrew Wells: Great. Thank you, Scott, and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. Our approach of maintaining a wide selling footprint enabled us to capitalize exceedingly well on the increasing demand cadence throughout the second quarter. We believe our ability to match demand with supply is unparalleled in virtually every week in the quarter, saw both revenue per flight and the percentage of flying versus our pre-COVID-19 expectation increased from the previous week.  We recorded a 56.8% load factor while operating roughly 70% of our expected June schedule. We accomplished that through deep cuts on off-peak Tuesdays and Wednesdays, while growing ASMs year-over-year on many peak days. In turn, as has been mentioned, our 6% share of TSA throughput in the month was roughly 4 points higher than our prior year figure. As destinations reopened, demand improved not just for flying, but also for the third-party products that help further differentiate ourselves from the industry. Auto and hotel per passenger was higher in the month of June versus the prior year, led by Scott and teams work strengthening relationships with many great partners and creating new opportunities.  Our strategy of reviewing flights in the 7- to 10-day window, resulted in minimal closing cancellations through June and to date in July. However, we continue to review and monitor to ensure the schedule is rightsized for the demand we are seeing. Our normal seasonal variance will kick in mid-August when the schedule drops precipitously as it does every year. Even prior to COVID-19, September was scheduled to operate at less than 50% of July's departures. This will still be the case as departures will almost certainly be below 5,000 for the month, and over 90% of routes are currently scheduled to operate only 2x per week.  Bookings have trended slightly better over the last few weeks after a rough start to July. The slope is definitely shallower than the initial recovery period we experienced, but any positive slope is certainly welcome. This fall and winter have a wide range of potential results, and we look to continue to be flexible in our approach. It is too early to make any call on where the schedule will shake out or where we think daily revenues will be. We are comfortable reacting to and operating a near-full schedule as we have done throughout summer, a skeleton schedule as we did in April and anything in between. This would not be possible without all of our incredible team members and a business model structured around extreme flexibility. Thank you to all of the team members that have continued to relentlessly push forward through the stops and the starts. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Greg.\nGregory Anderson: Thank you, Drew, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. For the second quarter of 2020, revenues declined by 73%, and we recorded an adjusted net loss of $95 million or $5.96 per share. This excludes items pertaining to the impact of COVID-19, particularly the benefit of $75 million of CARES Act payroll support, offset by roughly $100 million of special charges. Simply put, our focus remains on liquidity and reducing cash burn. Thanks to our quick response to increased liquidity and reduced cash burn, we improved our total cash balance by nearly $200 million and ended the quarter with $663 million of cash.  Regarding cash burn, our second quarter average daily cash burn was $900,000, down from our original estimate of $2.1 million per day. And in fact, for the month of June, we produced a slightly positive daily cash inflow. As a reminder, our daily cash burn is defined as cash from operations, less debt and rent payments and CapEx. It excludes aircraft acquisitions, new financings and cash benefits from the CARES Act.  Also during the second quarter, we received $200 million between payroll support funds in our first installment of our 2018/'19 NOL carryback tax refund. In addition, we raised nearly $80 million in aircraft financings, $48 million of which pertains to a sale-leaseback of 4 aircraft and the remaining $31 million of the loan secured by 2 aircraft at a very low interest rate.  During July, we will receive our remaining 10% of the payroll support funds or $17 million, and we've already received a second installment of our NOL carryback refund of nearly $50 million. Beyond the liquidity sources we have tapped thus far, we expect to receive an additional $125 million by mid-2021 and a cash refund through our 2020 NOL carryback. Furthermore, we have an option to access a loan of up to $270 million available through the CARES Act, along with unencumbered assets with a market value of just under $400 million. However, managing cash burn still remains our most effective liquidity strategy.  As we look ahead, our average cash burn for the third quarter would be just over $1 million per day, assuming gross bookings per day of $2 million for the quarter. This is based on booking trends thus far in July and represents a reduction of approximately 60% from 2019 booking levels. If current booking trends do not improve and remain flat through the duration of the year, we expect our third quarter's cash burn to be the highest of any quarter moving forward as we have the ability on October 1 to further rightsize our cost structure. Managing our cash burn effectively helps us highlight the flexibility of the model we have refined over many years. In fact, back in 2004's annual letter to Allegiant team members, Mr. Gallagher here said, \"It's easy to be low fare, and that can be done almost instantaneously by lowering one's prices. The hard part is being low cost. That is an everyday commitment from each and every one of us. That's what makes the low fare bid work and an efficient cost structure is the best insurance for our success.\"  More than 16 years later, Maury's words and this core principle of our model couldn't be more true. We continue to believe we have the most variable cost structure in the airline industry. Allegiant remains the low-cost carrier built around low utilization, which allows us to nimbly adjust capacity to match the demand environment. As a recent example, during the second quarter, we reacted quickly to adjust capacity due to shifting demand. During April and May, we pulled back capacity by as much as 87% and 50%, respectively. However, in June, we only pulled back capacity by 30% due to the relative demand strength. This flexibility not only allowed Allegiant to take full advantage of the stronger demand in June, but also reduced direct operating expenses in April and May.  To further illustrate, on roughly 50% fewer ASMs during the second quarter, our adjusted operating expense was down 38% versus the same period a year ago. This was largely driven by a 77% decrease in fuel expense and reductions in other flight volume-related expenses. Additionally, total labor costs were down 17.5% year-over-year despite an increase in total airline FTEs of nearly 10%, with an even larger increase in crew members of roughly 17%. These labor cost reductions were helped in large part by our many team members who volunteered to contribute by reducing their pay and/or taking voluntary leave. Our Sincerest thanks goes out to each and every one of them.  Turning to debt real quick. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in total debt, nearly flat compared to the same period in 2019. Since that time, our average cost of debt is reduced by more than 150 basis points, and this reduction is evidenced by more than 30% reduction in second quarter interest expense versus the same period a year ago. Additionally, more than 60% of our outstanding debt relates to secured aircraft and amortizes quickly over an average of just 5 years. This rapid paydown in debt results in annual principal payments of roughly $150 million. And as a reminder, these payments are included within our cash burn definition.  Defending our balance sheet has been another top financial priority for us as we navigate this very fluid environment. Where we stand today, we believe we are well positioned to emerge on the other side of this crisis with one of the stronger balance sheets in the sector.  Looking to CapEx. For the remaining 6 months of 2020, we expect total CapEx to be roughly $165 million, of which $135 million relates to the acquisition of 5 A320 aircraft and 4 spare CFM engines. We expect all of these acquisitions to be financed. We expect full year CapEx to be approximately $375 million compared to our initial plan of approximately $750 million. We have reduced our total full year airline CapEx by $100 million from planned levels and total CapEx by over $375 million for the year.  And looking to 2021, we only have 2 committed aircraft. Currently, we anticipate total 2021 CapEx to be around $125 million. Looking over to fleet. Our flexibility here has always been critical to Allegiant's business model, and that continues today. You may recall that there were up to 22 aircraft identified for either early retirement or storage in order to defer maintenance-related costs and to rightsize the fleet. Fortunately, our flexible business model gives us the ability to make fleet decisions in a nimble manner. Adjusting as we go based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, our current and projected year-end cash position, demand trends, status of the used aircraft market and opportunities for growth when demand returns. For now, the decision has been made to retire 7 of the 22 identified aircraft, 5 will retire by year-end and the other 2 in 2021 and '23, respectively. Retirement dates for each aircraft are scheduled around their respective upcoming heavy maintenance events, this allows us to utilize remaining green time on these assets.  We maintain further flexibility with our fleet through 6 aircraft currently in storage status, and that will take place to be -- at least early 2021. In the event, we need to reduce our fleet counts due to continued weak demand, we would maintain flexibility through these aircraft. Conversely though, should we see improvements in passenger demand, our fleet planning team has identified several aircraft in the used market that would be a good fit for our fleet moving forward. And with that said, we entered 2020 with 91 total Airbus aircraft. During the year, aircraft inductions are largely offset by the aircraft retirements and storage, bringing our expected in-service fleet count to 93 at the year-end.  In regards to special charges booked during the quarter, $59 million of noncash expense related to book loss on the sale-leaseback of 4 aircraft, coupled this with accelerated depreciation related to the retirement of the 7 aircraft and write-offs on other aircraft-related assets. And just to note, approximately $16 million of additional noncash expense associated with the retirement of the 7 aircraft that will be recognized in subsequent quarters with roughly $12 million of the -- of the remaining $16 million being recognized in the third quarter of this year. Also during the quarter, and as John mentioned, we accrued $20 million minimum yield fee on the expectation to terminate our Sunseeker loan commitment with Sixth Street Partners. The fee is expected to be paid throughout the remainder of the year. The team at Sixth Street, they have been good partners, and we appreciate their continued support of the project, as evidenced by their willingness to work with us on an extension of their commitment. However, without clear line of sight of when we can resume constructions, both parties agreed the best path forward at this time would be to terminate their loan commitment.  We continue to explore various strategic options for Sunseeker. As John mentioned, all options are on the table as we look for best ways to optimize our investment there. We believe there's significant value in the land, value in the possible NOL and our value if we resume construction much later on down the road. And finally, during the second quarter and consistent with the CARES Act, we reduced 220 positions from our corporate management and support teams, many of which were voluntary and/or early retirements. These reductions are expected to save the company approximately $15 million annually in labor costs. It's very difficult for us to see so many talented, hard-working team members moving on from Allegiant. Our sincere thanks for their tireless efforts over the years. They will be greatly missed. And with that, we will turn it over to our operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. \nHelane Becker: So I'm just thinking about the network and the way it looks right now. And I'm wondering if you could just talk about Las Vegas versus Orlando and other focus cities? Because it looked like based on the Las Vegas data, there were about 120-ish thousand passengers that went through Las Vegas in the quarter versus the 1.3 million almost 1.27 million that you carried -- that you reported carrying. So I'm just kind of wondering what the network looks like or will look like in September maybe.\nDrew Wells: Certainly, this is Drew. I'll kick this one off. So we anticipate the network is going to look very similar to how it always has. We'll pull back in September. Much like we have every year, really since the inception of the company. Obviously, Florida is a bit more impacted by the seasonal swings in Vegas, which stays a bit more flat. I think that will be exacerbated this year with kind of more pent-up demand for Vegas given the shutdowns earlier this year. I think it's also fair to say that Orlando never really got the large step change we expected with the reopening of theme parks down there. My impression of that is, given the limited capacity theme parks were allowing, if you didn't already have a reservation, it was very hard to create a new one and, therefore, generate new travel down to the area. Vegas obviously being different, having the room capacity and having that elevating has created more opportunities. So I think Vegas has certainly held up better, and we'll continue to hold up better through September than Orlando for a few reasons.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then for my follow-up question on the head count. I just wanted to be clear on that. You announced 220, I think, and not including the pilots. Should we think about more -- I guess I'm a little confused. You talked about eliminating 220 jobs, but 87 people on October 1. Does that mean there are open jobs that you're just not filling? Or are there other people later on that get terminated? Sorry, I guess I got a little confused there.\nGregory Anderson: No, it is a good question and one we should clarify. So thanks for asking that, Helane. Yes, I would say there's 220 total positions of those -- some of those positions were individuals that left, let's say, from April through June. So we weren't counting those as part of the 87. The 87 are what we -- are the individuals we notified on a particular day. And then some are remaining open positions that we were just not going to backfill and those are all corporate and admin function roles. So no, that wasn't a lever on the labor side at all. So that -- thanks for the question, but hopefully, that helps with a little more color there.\nHelane Becker: Yes, that is very helpful. I appreciate it.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: I guess two quick ones here. Greg, the million -- just over $1 million burn per day in the sub Q, you indicated that, that does include a portion of the $20 million accrual? What -- how much of that accrual actually runs through the September quarter?\nGregory Anderson: We haven't finalized that yet with the Sixth Street folks, Michael. But I think what -- for modeling purposes, perhaps a way to do it is just take that and amortize it straight over the rest of the year.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then on your air traffic liability at 230 -- you were $355 million. Now is that a short-term number there? Or are your refunds -- the vouchers that you have, are they only good for 12 months? Or have you actually extended that beyond 12 months?\nGregory Anderson: Yes. No, I think you're right. We did. We extended it to 2 years. And so of the -- I think the $350 million ATL. Kind of what we're seeing today is roughly 60% are credit vouchers. That's down a little bit from when we reported in April. And so -- yes, and then the remainder would be advanced bookings, a part of that. But some of those, to your point, have been extended for -- on the credit vouchers for 2 years.\nOperator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So I don't know if you're able to speak to it, but I think about Allegiant as a carrier, which will fly as much as it possibly can, when the demand is there and not fly as much when the demand is not there. Can you talk about the flexibility or the incremental flexibility that you're seeking? And is this something that you gave up and at some point in the past when margins were super high, and clearly, the demand was there to support it.\nMaurice Gallagher: Well, I'll just chime in. I don't know that we've ever given that up. You can go back year after year with our famous graph, which shows January low going up, peaking in March, falling off in April, peak again June, July, following very noticeably almost half or more in September. And then starting to work its way back to a peak at the end of the year. And that graph is repeated kind of decade for more. As far as this one certainly, Drew -- the peaks have been what they have been historically, although who knows how much higher or lower will be in September than we otherwise would. But Drew, what's the plan?\nDrew Wells: Sure. One of the things that we've talked about in the past is coming out of MD-80 and into Airbus actually exacerbated the peaks and valleys, right? So we were able to fly significantly more in March and July, while maintaining the same -- roughly the same level of utilization in September. So we kind of stretched that out. So to echo Maury, I don't believe we've given anything up, and we maintain the ability to fly as much as we can when the demand exists. All we're trying to do right now -- I think all we're trying to communicate is that we're trying to rightsize the entirety of the organization to match where demand is as we see it and still provide optionality for what may come.\nMaurice Gallagher: I think the other component that -- Scott can touch on this a little bit, is we really dug into a lot of things that we otherwise weren't looking carefully at to save cash like scheduling, how do we optimize scheduling with crews and flight attendants and [indiscernible], particularly in the early days when we were canceling so much, we had a lot of ups and downs, but we're much more efficient, I think, Scott, than we were a couple of -- even coming into this thing with how we are able to deal with crews.\nScott Sheldon: Yes. If you kind of look at the buildup of base sizes, so if you kind of look at medium to small bases, which you're anywhere from 6 aircraft down to 1, they're inherently less cost-effective and efficient, but they contain about half of our labor, our flight crews. And so all that is built into the economics during good times, but when you're built for, call it, 30,000-plus block hours and you're flying, maybe 40%, you take a hard look at still getting through the footprint that he needs, but how do you reduce costs in a reasonable manner. But there's a point in which to get substantial savings, you really got to start pulling base structures down, and that's something that we really would not like to do, which is why we're in active negotiations, trying to get specific relief for off-peak periods.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes, that's super helpful. That's super helpful. Just on the cost reductions that you're outlining, I don't know if you can say, but what level of revenue decline sort of post these cost saves what level of revenue decline do you think you would achieve cash flow breakeven?\nGregory Anderson: Sure, Duane, this is Greg. If you bake into some of these levers, excuse me, that we're anticipating to pull, particularly in the fourth quarter. I think we could get to cash flow breakeven if year-over-year bookings are down roughly 40% to 45%. If they're elevated above that, I think the way -- I mean, you'd have to get there, and this is just kind of expanding on Scott's point as you -- you'd have to take further reductions, such as like consolidating bases and things like that to get the cost down at breakeven point. I'm not suggesting we do that. I think regardless in the fourth quarter, we're going to be rather low on the cash burn front, but I believe will be significantly lower than we are in the third quarter. And we're just going to manage the business for flexibility and the best we can. Now we have an owner here next to us, Maury Gallagher, he's looking at this every day. And he's asked the questions and making sure we're making the right decisions. So we'll continue to look and try and react as nimbly and flexibly as we can. But I think just long story short that, yes, in the fourth quarter, we'd be able to pull down quite a bit on the labor front to get near breakeven.\nMaurice Gallagher: Duane, another comment, it's an interesting question. I was asking the group. We really never looked at breakeven load factor. When you're looking at 21% operating margins, as we averaged in 2019, candidly, we didn't know the 65%. Of course, you got the vagaries in revenue because unit revenue, I think Michael and I looked and has a schedule, somebody was selling an Atlanta trip out of New York for $9. So you're going to see a lot of the unit revenue pieces are going to be problematic. But our third-party revenue is coming on strong. We've -- we're making money in June. I don't think anybody can say that take away the exceptional stuff. The model still is responsive to as all hell. And I think we're going to have to fight some unit revenue as everybody just piles back in and no one quite knows how to price things because it's all new. But I'm pretty bullish that is getting to a cash flow breakeven. We can do it as best as anybody can going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: On the loan program, the CARES Act loan program. Just wondering is this kind of stance that you still might not need to tap into that? Or are you -- has that changed? And what -- have you had a discussion on kind of what kind of collateral might be used for that?\nGregory Anderson: Savi, thanks for the question. It's Greg. Yes. So as far as whether or not we're going to take it, that's still undecided, I wouldn't read into, though, that we haven't signed an LOI that we're not still eligible for it. We certainly are. B.J. and I, we're having great discussions with the treasury team and the PJT team, their advisers, about the loan, just an interesting kind of tidbit on it. We, Allegiant, we also qualify for the Main Street lending program, say if we could find a bank to support that. So we've been talking with treasury and some banks about potentially that program, and we're not saying we're going to tap that either. Just looking at options, if you will. And the benefit to that program as compared to just the CARES Act loan is that it doesn't require warrants and then everything else is pretty similar. But in terms of collateral, just to answer that question, I think they've been pretty responsive on kind of what we can do and other possible is with collateral. We have the unencumbered aircraft and engines. Those would be kind of the prime collateral, if you will. But however, we also qualify for unsecured. If you look at the requirements on the CARES Act loan for unsecured. And so my point with that saying is if we decide to pull that lever, I think we can -- we should have the ability to raise up to the liquidity available to us under that program. But again, we're not ready to make that call at this point in time.\nSavanthi Syth: And if I might just follow-up on some of the Sunseeker comments. I'm just wondering, so what's your time line for making a decision there? I know you have a team in place. Just how should we think about kind of when certain decisions have to be made about that? Or have the steps you've taken just kind of bought you 12 to 24 months?\nJohn Redmond: Again, last call, Savi, we said we weren't going to touch anything or do anything for 18 months, and that thinking hasn't changed at all. We don't have any staff to speak of other than 3 individuals, and they're operating on significant reductions in pay. And we have a couple of people working through the construction close down, if you will. So you need to have these people. It's not like parking an airplane. When you saw the construction process when it's in process, you have to wind down payables and everything else. So there's just a handful of people that will still -- that are still remaining, all working on significant pay cuts. So our burn associated with that project is at very minimum levels.\nSavanthi Syth: And is there -- so from a -- no movement on 18 months, but is there a time line if you're kind of taking a strategic alternative to spin it off versus if you want to kind of continue with the start of the construction again, when do those decisions need to be made? Or is there no such kind of time line?\nJohn Redmond: We don't have any committed time line beyond what we've already stated. Having said that, I probably get a call a week regarding what the art of the possible is. So we're entertaining and exploring the options that I made in my comments, whether there's an opportunity for an outright sale, whether there's an opportunity to JV it or bring in another equity partner or to look at borrowing the entire amount that's left to be built, I mean all of these are options that are on the table beyond sitting and waiting and doing nothing for 18 months. So we are exploring those. We haven't ruled anything out. I think that's the takeaway should come out of here is we are open to everything. So it's not like we're seeing or saying we're not going to do this, we're not going to do that. We had to say that arguably before this call or before this last couple of weeks when we had the conversations with TSSP. But now that we have reached a settlement with them, we -- the options are wide open. We have no limitation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Maybe, Drew, just the commentary in the release about June bookings being up for a period year-over-year. Can you just talk about why that isn't a pretty bullish take point, maybe the quality of that demand in terms of price point? And what exactly does that mean? Were revenues up for a period or just kind of absolute bookings?\nDrew Wells: Sure, Joe. Yes. So it was certainly a bullish time for those few days before things changed again. It was just looking at a segment count, so the number of people buying tickets and traveling, not the revenue. So I wouldn't read that far into it. But yes, that was kind of when we were at our high point and really looking forward to what the rest of the year could be before -- about the third, fourth week of June when it turned back down that you've heard from everyone else. So that was a distant memory at this point.\nScott DeAngelo: I would simply add, the key thing there was there were some key catalysts, right? There was Las Vegas coming online, June 3. Universal Studios, Walt Disney world shortly after that. So there was that kind of grand reopening, if you will. And since then, just as Drew had mentioned, we lack kind of at least an obvious catalyst for what can push through the ceiling they currently exist, since we've already kind of reopened and now pulled back and/or quasi open. There's nothing obvious staring us in the face, like a flip, a switch like we had in early June.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe Greg or Scott Sheldon. I think the plan was last quarter that you would maybe have to shrink the fleet by 25 aircraft. Like how did the recovery in June inform that decision? And how are you all thinking about that now?\nGregory Anderson: Sure. I'll kick it off. And of course, if Scott or anybody wants to add to it, Joe. I think what I would say is, in June, we remain cautiously optimistic, but we -- shortly in July, we saw bookings coming down again. And it just goes back to flexibility and fleet flexibility. And fortunately, we're in a position in Allegiant here because of a lot of hard work in the past that we can be nimble with our fleet. And so as we think about the number of aircraft to retire in the future. We're kind of taking it day by day, so to speak, in a wait-and-see approach. We decided on up to 7 aircraft today -- or recently. And that's because those aircraft made a lot of sense for us to retire as we compared their reliability, their age, their ability to generate additional cash as we compare their investments and things of that nature, we determined that these were good aircraft to put down at this point in time. And that's going to save on cost down the road, particularly on the heavy maintenance side. And then one last thing I may add just before perhaps turning over to somebody else, is that we still have flexibility with -- that 22 number hasn't changed. We still have that flexibility, 6 are in storage, and we'll continue to evaluate 6 more of those, excuse me, on storage, and then we'll continue to evaluate the rest -- the remaining 10 on a go-forward basis and just try and be flexible and react accordingly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Wisniewski with Barclays.\nMatthew Wisniewski: So I just wanted to come back to how you -- or the management thinking about kind of adding incremental capacity back. Are you managing the load factors? Or is the idea to managing and covering variable costs or some type of profitability level as you're adding incremental flights or taking them out? Any thoughts there would be appreciated.\nDrew Wells: Sure. Yes, this is Drew here. And your latter point is exactly right. We're still thinking about a cash basis, cash profitability as we're thinking about capacity, kind of, as Maury stated. There's not necessarily one load factor that drives or necessitates whether or not that flight will make money, but that's very much where we're focused is variable costs. And as we start to gain margin on that, it becomes a lot easier to sprinkle in more peak day flying and more markets were required.\nMatthew Wisniewski: Okay. And I guess kind of as a side of that, the ancillaries per passenger stayed relatively intact year-over-year. Can you keep that rate going forward? Or is there something skewing that in the near term? Because if I'm wrong, that can set you up pretty well ticket pricing does face some competitive pressures.\nDrew Wells: Yes. Well, this has certainly been the largest test for our ancillary. Our thesis has always been that ancillary is much more sticky than the air component. And I think we've shown that over the last few months. We're still over 50 per passenger in air ancillary, third party, such that things are open and available to sell for resorts and for auto will be there. And the co-brand credit card has been a phenomenal bolstering the third-party as well. So I have confidence that the ancillary can continue to remain sticky and at levels we're seeing today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: But John, and Maury, other than price, what are some of the conditions on sale of Sunseeker or a scenario where you relinquished some portion of control of the project?\nMaurice Gallagher: Oh gosh, Hunter, it's -- there's still zero opportunities now other than the occasional call that gets logged in. Again, the focus is on the airline. Today, we probably wouldn't take much to do to get -- if it's got cash associated with it or I'd like to see us stay involved in the management because John are just so good at that stuff. But we really just don't talk about it that much, and John's got this or that offer coming across the TRASM, but in today's world, it's pretty hard to get even must -- or a reasonable offer.\nJohn Redmond: Well, I think, Hunter, you can appreciate, we kind of lose some negotiating leverage if we talked about what price we had accept over the earnings call. So we won't go that far. But I guess the takeaway, as I mentioned, earlier is that there is a willingness to have those kind of conversations and have any kind of conversation regarding any opportunity. So I think the -- and you had made some allusion to that, but we don't have any restrictions on anything. We're open to having any and all dialogue. I have a phone call tomorrow, that's an interesting one. And I have -- as I say, I get at least one phone call a week. So it's one of those stories. Stay tuned. That story is yet to be written. We just don't know how it's going to play out. And -- but we are open to any numerous options that are out there.\nMaurice Gallagher: Hunter, just a big picture statement. The strategy is solid and sound that we embarked on here. We've sold third-party revenues for 20 years. We've proven year in, year out that we could make money on that. You look at the strength of the West Coast of Florida. If all the areas in this country, it probably is among the strongest because the people going there are older and they have money and they're less affected by this, and that's going to continue. It's got a tremendous history. So the combination of that, the bread basket, the feed we can bring to it from where we fly, all the markers are incredibly strong. So while we're not going to put any capital into it at this point in time, longer term, as a strategy, I think that what we're embarked on is a diversification that's second to none in the industry. And we've got a great head start with that asset. So we certainly want to stay involved in some fashion to feed ourselves and continue to enhance third-party revenues. So that's a good strategic overview.\nHunter Keay: That's great. I appreciate that, Maury. And then Bill, I want to talk to you a second about the IBC disagreement that you talked -- you mentioned. I assume that was then just not really cooperating with your vision of facilitating voluntary early out. But more importantly, how does that impact your support or lack thereof on potential TSSP extension? Or does that factor in?\nGregory Anderson: Yes. I think if you look at the strategy, right, so we had a really wide schedule out there. First half of May, we canceled a ton off. We flew a lot more in the back half of May. June was down, but it was relatively intact. July year-over-year was down 10% maybe? Departures. So you have a workforce that on the surface, it looks like everything is good. We're flying full schedules. But then you start to see spikes, flare-ups and just as Scott D. mentioned, what's the vision? What's the expectation for the back half of the year? And you just got to assume it's going to be bumpy. And so that's kind of how we position this.  Early on, I mean, we're educating folks on what was our option. Option a, which is let's go wide and so otherwise; or b, which is consolidate. And so I think there's a middle ground there. What the issue we had in July is we couldn't really grant a lot of short-term leads. Because we needed the bodies and we are -- because we're flying such a relatively healthy schedule. And so this is just to protect the off-peaks. As far as the round two, if that does come through, obviously, that's -- that we're going to have to pivot and change the discussions. But if that doesn't hit, like I said, we still want to have these discussions. There is a solution here. We proposed a number of different kind of creative ways in order to flex down and flex up give these guys clarity on what snapback provisions would look like. And so it's just tough, like I said, on the surface, they just assume everything is great, and we're just preparing for a very soft, off-peak period.\nMaurice Gallagher: Hunter, we've managed peaks and valleys consistently for years. So the idea that we can peak up is important to us because that's -- I've discovered a long time ago, you make more money on Sunday than you do the other 7 days of the 6 days of the week, and you want to carry those seats around for your profit potential. Same analogy applies to those peak periods where you -- our March is like 20%, 25% of our operating income in historic terms. So you need the bodies to do that type of flying. But now in this period, what our ask is that we spread that cost during the bottom end, and we get less expense going forward. That's cash management 101. So that's the ask and most of our people are getting it. Some people -- they just want to leave status quo, and that's their call. That's their group to manage. And what you're basically saying is that the top guys are going to get taken care of and the bottom guys, we don't care furloughs or what happens in the industry. So anyway, different philosophies for different people.\nGregory Anderson: Yes. And kind of the number around the 275, I mean that really maintains the footprint. If you go above that, then there's going to be a consolidation of basis, which is painful. That's a longer term, different strategy. But at the end of the day, it might warrant going there. So this is kind of our first pass at it. I think until you start pushing notices and rosters of impacted folks, technically, it's not real. And so we'll see how these folks respond. But at the end of the day, the 275 folks, that's worth about $25 million to $30 million in payroll. But you give up upside from a network configuration standpoint.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Q&A portion of the conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to Maury Gallagher for closing remarks.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you all for your time. Appreciate it. Stay safe in the next 90 days. We'll talk to you in October. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation.

With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Maury.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you, Sherry and thank you everyone for joining us today, it's been a while. First, let me thank all of our team members, their spouses and families as we continue to fly our passengers during these difficult and disturbing times. Thank you all very much. As I said in our press release, these are unprecedented times we are living through. Most of you will be listening to calls from the different carriers the past few weeks, and the story from each of them is more from TRASM, CASM, CapEx and capacity changes to liquidity, liquidity and more liquidity. To that end, we\u2019ll provide you with some thoughts on where we are today and going forward. And you will hear from our management team on the specifics regarding liquidity, as well as how we are managing our schedule and how we\u2019re responding to our customers. Over the years we prided ourselves on being different. You will hear today how we continue to differentiate ourselves from our industry. A critical component for us has been our model, it\u2019s always been a core strength. Based on our model, our management team and our terrific team member we believe we will emerge stronger from this life changing experience in the coming months and years. Clearly, none of us has ever seen an environment where book revenues as well as booked future revenues disappeared in less than a month. During the last three weeks of March, each week's fall was so much worse than what we thought it might be. I tell my team members that fear is the lack of knowledge. And the lack of knowledge was definitely the case from the middle of March through April. We\u2019re starting to have some clarity from knowledge we\u2019re getting to understand the path out of this calamity that we find ourselves in. There\u2019s three main types of traffic in my opinion in this industry, international, business and leisure. I believe the first two will be slow to return. In our case, the case more business you're seeing another important evolution. The world is learning to do things online, to work from home. In our specific case, we have multiple board meetings by video conferencing and plan to do it for the foreseeable future. This would not have happened but for COVID. Will it change our habits? Some think it will. Historically, coming out of downturns, leisure customers have been the first to return. From January '09 with the onset of the GFC, we found leisure traffic responded very quite well in that first quarter. We believe that will be the case with respect to this downturn that leisure traffic will respond faster than business in international. And while we do not have any specific forecast to make, we are seeing some increases the past few weeks. I want to stress to our audience that how fortunate I feel to be involved with such a quality management team. This group has done extraordinary work capacity, not only are they talented but just as important they are working very well together. I'm comfortable stating this group will continue to shine for us in the coming months and you'll hear from most of them today, so judge for yourself. We believe we are among the first to react to the COVID situation recognizing quickly this was not a passing phenomenon. We immediately began shrinking our schedule, cutting expenses and capital investments, working with vendors on delaying payables and renegotiating our relationships with them as well. We have approximately 25% of our team members participating in some form of pay reduction program to-date, and I want to thank them for that effort. We quickly ceased all construction expenditures on Sunseeker. Scott DeAngelo, our CMO since late March, has been focused on how we are going to recover. He's been surveying our customers weekly for the past eight weeks about their opinion on the pandemic, how they feel about it, when they plan to travel next and other key questions. He'll provide you with some further detail in a few minutes. I\u2019d never wish for an event such as this pandemic, but these added to May of this year, it has dramatically altered the economic landscape. Bankruptcies have begun, as I'm sure you're aware. Avianca past weekend will operate approximately 45 A320s with CFM motors or type recently filed Chapter 11. Others will follow. U.S. carriers, as you know, that have -- will park over 2,500 aircraft in the next few weeks. In the space of 30 to 60 days what was once a robust seller's market for airplanes and equipment of the sort has been turned on in past. Most proper liquidity tool we have today is to stop cash from leaving the building, both operating expenses and capital expenditures. But for some aircraft, we've made the purchase for delivery in the back half of this year and a few in the first quarter of '21. We have dramatically reduced our CapEx. Beyond nearly 2021 deliveries, we do not have any further aircraft commitment. As a result, we will be able to exploit one of our core competences our ability to trade in the aircraft marketplace, we have a long history in trading used aircraft. Regarding our fleet near-term we are looking at what is the right size. As the cash saving move, we want to retire a number of aircraft perhaps as many as 10 to 15, because of upcoming expense and maintenance work. We will put these retired aircraft to good use in addition to saving capital for repairs, we will benefit from putting out the aircraft, particularly the motors. We're facing a great deal of expense in the coming years, particularly in motor overhauls. Now, however, between our motors from retirement and inevitable availability of tear down aircraft, we will substantially reduce cash outlays in my opinion for planned motor work and other parts cost in the coming years. My belief we will begin to see numbers of older 320s and 319s and their motors available as part of our opportunities in the not too distant future and prices will begin to react accordingly. Furthermore, we will be one of the few players I believe in the market with the wherewithal to purchase these assets. As you've heard repeatedly in the recent calls, companies are planning for the worst and hoping for the best. You will hear today our version of this truth. We are definitely planning for the worst. To that end near term we are reviewing parking as many as 10 aircraft because of demand softness. However, I believe you can [Technical Difficulty] our release and our comments today that our financial strength is among the best. The strength gives us the flexibility to respond if the market snaps back. The combination of the purchased aircraft I mentioned earlier for the rest of this year and into early 2021 and the return of our parked aircraft that we'll put down here shortly to service will give us a fleet for 2021 roughly the size it is today. So we want to go or take advantage of opportunities we believe there will be a wide variety of reasonably priced aircraft that we can pursue and purchase. As I mentioned a moment ago, our model has always been one of our core strengths. First and foremost, we maintain optionality with our parked aircraft. Annually, we expand and contract our network based on seasonal demand. We also have a simple network out and back. It is the ideal approach where one has to cancel so many of their operations given the dramatic reduction in demand that we've been seeing. By trading in used aircraft, we also have an expensive model. Over the years, no one has been able to match our combination of a low cost structure and low utilization. In the coming months, you will see our costs come in noticeably as we refocus on operational efficiencies. As I said previously, reducing costs and capital expenditures is the best way for a carrier to their liquidity. One of my favorite sayings when we operated MD80s was we were a noncapital intensive business competing in a capital intensive industry. I believe we'll be able to use this description in the not too distant future. I'm the largest shareholder in this company with almost 20% position. I want to assure you all that we are doing the necessary things to guarantee our future. We are still the same hard nosed disciplined company and industry leader you're used to seeing. We're rightsizing the company. We are managing expenses and capital outlays. We have sufficient liquidity. Our flexibility and managing capacity continues to pay dividend. 80% of our markets do not have any competition. We will continue these traditions. In closing, I have been amazed at the very options one sees and how to act during this pandemic. And my own family -- those who don't want to come out they want to stay locked down. They believe there's a virus in every hard surface and floating everywhere in the air. Others are ready to rumble, looking to get back out and resume their lives. One way to choose 100% sample perhaps 40 to 50 was one return to normal times while the balance do not. We as airline have to be able to cope with this level of uncertainty, be able to rightsize ourselves to service those 40 or 50 looking to rumble in the coming months and hopefully see remaining 50 return later this year and in 2021. In my opinion, we have the ability to size ourselves better than any other carrier. This flexibility will serve us well in the coming months and years as it has the past 19 years. Lastly, I want to personally thank each one of our team members for all they have done during this trying past six to eight weeks. You are the backbone of the company. And while we were still in the woods, the sunrise is shining through a bit more each day. Thank you. John?\nJohn Redmond: Thank you, Maury and good afternoon, everyone. Over these unprecedented times, there have been comments made by most if not all companies across industries how they will come out at the end of this a different but better company. You have to ask yourself what exactly does that mean. Our answer ensures much different than most and probably the least expected given the earnings season commentary, it's a better balance sheet. That's right. A better stronger balance sheet. The steps to get through are difficult, painful and not without emotion but required in order to come out the other side, better position, greater financial flexibility and more options. One of these difficult but required decisions was to shutdown the Sunseeker resort development. We have said from the outset the most important component of our model is the airline. We have to do everything we can to preserve the cash register, and the earnings release outlines numerous additional steps that have been taken to date. We will not put any more capital into the project for at least the next 18 months as we deliver on our expectation to have the strongest balance sheet when we come out of this. The Allegiant model has been well tested over its history, and there's no doubt COVID-19 is the ultimate hurdle. Having said that, the financial discipline, the willingness and creativity to adapt and change and our dedicated passionate Allegiant team will create opportunities this model never dreamed of. Furthermore, the power of the model and the speed at which the team has reacted to date have put us in a position to not pursue equity dilutive transactions at this time given what we are seeing to-date. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott Sheldon.\nScott Sheldon: Thank you, John and good afternoon, everyone. First, I'd like to thank our 4,500 plus team members across the network for their outstanding service and professionalism in the face of this global COVID-19 pandemic. Your efforts have been tremendous. I realized this call is mostly entirely about liquidity and capital raising efforts and cash preservation but our team members and partners across the U.S. are the backbone and the face of organization. And their unwavering commitment and loyalty to our customers is why our organization has and will continue to be successful in the future. You\u2019ve embraced the uncertainty, you\u2019ve remained flexible in the incredibly challenging times and for that all of your senior leadership thanks to you. From the onset of pandemic, we have three immediate focus areas. First was to ensure the safety of our passengers and Allegiant team members. Second is rapidly adjusting of our daily operations to reflect a near zero demand environment, while also positioning our operational cost structure for long-term slow recovery. And third was to develop an aircraft storage program for potential fleet management scenarios as the recovery curve progresses. As indicated in our release, we began to experience some booking softness in late February. And although, we hadn't experienced the COVID-19 related flight cancellation, we activated our ECC, which is our emergency command center on March 6th to coordinate all aspects of our emergency response program, an anticipatory step that proved to be invaluable from an execution standpoint over the next 60 days. Without going into too much detail, this group was responsible for developing many of the COVID related safety and health strategies, policy and procedure enhancements and overall operational execution in their first hours days of the pandemic. Some of the key highlights champion along with the marketing team, Allegiant is going the distance for health and safety, revamps our cleaning program for our aircraft to include scheduled and deep cleaning procedures, implemented the hospital grade standards across the system, established routine treatment schedule for our aircraft with advanced antimicrobial protectant that kills viruses, germs and bacteria on contact. We were the first to provide customers with the complementary health and safety kit upon boarding, which included a single use face mask, disposable non-latex gloves and sanitizing wipes. We deployed VOC filters on our aircraft, which exceed air quality standards. Social distance practices have been put in place wherever possible during check-in and at our gates and on-board aircraft. Helped acknowledgement certification during online mobile check in. Also, we extended our voucher redemption policy from one year to two years from initial booking, and that's important because for basically the 60-day period beginning 1st of March, we have returned 235 million in vouchers to consumers. So that allows them to extend for an additional year. Moving onto our near-term scheduling philosophy. We wanted to create as much selling opportunities as possible coming out of the negative to net zero demand environment. This meant keeping as wide of a selling footprint as possible. In this case, this means maintaining 18 operational basis, fully staffed for a baseline of activity that we can reasonably decline. Basically initial schedule reflecting a relatively full pre-COVID selling profile with few exceptions to take advantage of potential opportunities as states and communities come online, travel restrictions are eased and non-essential businesses and entertainment experiences present themselves. This is no way the most cost effective approach. There are lots of obstacles and challenges in executing to a public schedule that will largely go on phone and it creates significant cost that could otherwise be mitigated, but we feel the trade off is worth it in the near-term. A byproduct of this is the micromanaging of our flight schedules by our network team on a weekly if not daily basis. Looking at individual dispatch decisions based on cash profitability. At the end of the day, we ultimately have to get back to flying schedule we published. There has to be scheduled integrity given the traditional frequency profile we fly, but as low as in demands where we build, we can continue to execute on this strategy, basically low load, cancellations, equals minimal, passenger disruptions. Overall, it's proven to be successful, relatively speaking. And as we -- and we are capturing more flying than we would have otherwise captured. Drew and Scott will speak more on that in a second. And lastly, our fleet aircraft induction and maintenance and engineering teams have done a tremendous job launching an Airbus aircraft storage program on the fly to accommodate any number of fleet scenarios as we progress through the back half the year. Our teams have done a great job of positioning the majority of our fleet to be ready on short notice. This is particularly important given how we are over scheduling the airline in the near-term. Long-term as indicated in the release, we expect to retire and/or store as many as 25 aircraft, which can be action based on any number of different scenarios. Once again, thanks to all involved. You give the network and planning team the tools that they need to navigate very troubling environment. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott DeAngelo.\nScott DeAngelo: Thanks Scott. As Marty alluded to since late March, our commercial approach has been focused tightly on executing a recovery roadmap that leverages our robust monitoring of the COVID-19 situation in order to lay the foundation for recovery and the next generation of air travel post COVID-19, and ultimately to driver recovery that capitalizes on new opportunities that may arise. Our direct to customer distribution model and moreover the direct customer relationship enables us to maintain has been invaluable during this period, both in terms of gauging customer sentiment in these uncertain times and in terms of capturing customer demand as it returns to the market. We stay close to our customers and we've been continuously gauging their sentiment through proprietary tracking surveys that we filled at each of the past eight weeks. As a Sunday, our customers are telling us they overwhelmingly believe things are getting better, and they're most expected we\u2019ll take more than six months for life to return to, \u201cnormal\u201d, nearly two-thirds planned to travel by air before the end of the year. Also promising news for the leisure travel sector overall is that about half so they plan to stay in a hotel or vacation rental property, while nearly one-third plan to visit friends or relative and the remaining 20% plan to travel between their primary resident and a second vacation home. Also, when close partnership with our corporate intelligence and data science teams, we've been able to monitor health, economic and other factors impacting the cities we serve. To-date both the personal health and the economic health, as well as the overall sentiment for most of our key origin cities in the Midwest and Mid Atlantic have been consistent with a near-term recovery scenario for much of our network. The foundation for our recovery, as Scott mentioned, has been going to distance for health and safety, an integrated holistic approach to fundamentally enhancing our cleaning house and social distancing practices, complete details of which can be found at allegiant.com, and has been shared far and wide across national media. Thanks to industry leading measures, such as providing each and every passenger who boards with a free health and safety tip. Building off this strong foundation, our data driven direct-to-consumer marketing approach has enabled us to surgically identify and capture demand on a route-by-route basis, which began to lift off the bottom in mid-April. Since then, we've seen steady growth in the number of qualified flight searches being conducted by web users at allegiant.com, with some time periods in market at levels even higher than last year. More importantly, we've seen an elevated web traffic begin to translate into an uptick in bookings for select markets over the past few weeks correlated with beaches opening on Florida's West Coast and Panhandle. That being said, our two largest summer travel destinations, Orlando and Las Vegas, will need to reopen their flagship theme parks and casino resorts and for that matter, NFL stadiums for us to see the next step change in demand recovery. Finally, as we continue up the recovery curve, we're also benefiting from other aspects of our unique business model, namely the proprietary booking platform, which is enabling us to fast track development of contact lists or touch free elements of the customer travel journey, as well as offer hotel and only booking capabilities for those looking to drive to Las Vegas or Florida resorts. Right market travel is expected to recover faster than air to these destinations, and we've been working closely with the leading agencies and bureaus in both regions to play a role in their combat. Remaining true to our purpose even while flexing during these challenging time we\u2019re supporting all natural options to capture greater share of leisure travel spend as they return to the market. And with that, I'll turn it over to Drew Wells.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott. And thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. I want to build a bit on what you've heard so far and expand briefly on our approach and our differences from the industry at large. We have taken to this environment with largerly the same detailed processes that we use to assess capacity in a normal state, just at a significantly more frequent rate. We've maintained a very broad network and selling presence, and all future round trips are assessed for cash profitability. While most carriers offer less than 30% of their scheduled for May, we held about 75% of flights available. We made some hard decisions on entire routes and got in front of some low hanging fruit such lower demand Tuesday flying or consolidating flying in the event we have multiple daily flights on the same route. For the remaining 75%, we are monitoring net bookings and making decisions on a round trip basis as we have clarity to the final strength of flight a week or more in advance. As Maury mentioned, our business model is set up to quickly and appropriately respond to any level of demand. Like all others, our capacity was significantly reduced in April. As we operated just 12.6% of the expected departures. However, we completed weeks flying as low as 9.6% of the original expectations and as high as 24.6%. Our out and background in structure and relative simplicity of scheduling provided tremendous benefit when making very granular decisions. While this certainly drives a lot of work in the short term reviewing and forecasting flying that is likely to be canceled, I believe strongly that it puts us in an advantageous position to have both visibility and more importantly, the ability to react immediately whenever and wherever demand begins to return, whether in a one off or sustained form. Bookings are not there yet. However, as you\u2019ve heard today, we are seeing mild sequential improvement. There's a long way to go still but leveraging the flexibility of this business model will put us in a remarkable position when system wide demand does return. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Anderson: Thanks Drew and thanks, everyone for joining us today. For the first quarter of 2020, we reported a consolidated GAAP net loss of $2.08 per share, and this was due to an impairment charge of over $160 million related to our non-airline subsidiaries. On an airline only basis, we recorded over $50 million in op income or 12.6% in op margin. This is despite seeing a precipitous drop in revenue during March, our busiest month of the year and is a testament of the earnings power and flexibility of our unique model. Rather than discuss the puts and takes of these results, we felt it was appropriate to focus on the metrics that matter most in the current environment, maintaining sufficient liquidity and minimizing cash burn. Due to the impact from COVID-19, we took quick and aggressive action to cut costs and preserve liquidity. This is outlined in our earnings release. So far, we estimate these actions will result in nearly $375 million of total cash outflow reductions to our initial full year 2020 plan with approximately 80% of the reductions in the form of CapEx and the suspension of our quarterly dividend. The remaining balance is attributed to the removal of non-flight relating operating costs, including but not limited to, marketing, contractors, travel, subscriptions, non airline labor and renegotiating contracts with vendors. Perhaps worth noting the $375 million reduction in cash outflows does not take into account further cost reductions we achieved by flowing back capacity, such as variable costs associated with airline labor, fuel stations and maintenance. Regarding liquidity, in February, we went to the market to reprice our Term Loan B facility and achieved 150 basis point reduction to our rate. Due to strong demand, we also upsized the facility by $100 million. At the time it was unclear the importance of this move as a short couple of weeks later, the impact from COVID-19 began to put pressure on the capital markets. Including this upsize, we ended the March quarter with $464 million in total cash. In April, we obtained financing of $31 million secured by two A320 aircraft at a very low interest rates. Also in April, we received our first installment of the CARES Act Payroll Support for $86 million, and our monthly cash burn was reduced to $65 million or $2.1 million per day. The cash burn partially offsets these two liquidity inflows to bring our ending April total cash blaance to $515 million. In addition, Allegiant\u2019s portion of the Payroll Support under the CARES Act is $172 million capital, half of which we received in April and we will receive the bulk of the remaining amount in the second quarter. As we look ahead, we expect the cadence of average cash burn for the second and third quarters to be approximately $2.1 million and $1.5 million per day respectively. These average burn rates assume gross bookings per day of 750,000 for both quarters, which is based on booking trends we saw mid-April. We've continued to see modest improvements in booking since that time as Drew mentioned. This is down more than 85% from 2019 levels. In comparison, a year ago this amount would have been approximately $5.5 million per day in gross bookings. For reference, our low point in gross bookings during the last few months was about $250,000 per day. So to be clear, the 750,000 average bookings per day is not our forecast, it is just simply held constant to highlight the area we can control, our costs. However, should demand stay at these low levels in the fourth quarter, we estimate an average cash burn of well under $1 million per day. Reducing our cash burn is the most efficient liquidity strategy we can affect. Another efficient mode of increasing liquidity comes through our federal tax refunds as afforded to us by the CARES Act. This legislation allows for a five year carry back on tax net operating losses. So for Allegiant, this means a $94 million cash refund on our 2018, '19 NOLs. In early April, we submitted these NOL carry back claims with the IRS and expect to receive this cash refund in the coming weeks. We expect an even larger cash refund, more than $100 million to come in for estimated 2020 NOL early next year. We also apply for our portion of the CARES Act loan about to $276 million. We're currently evaluating our need to tap this program for liquidity. A terrific benefit of the loan program is the optionality it provides, not only because it serve as a backstop in September, it has the added benefit of being the benchmark that is for proving helpful for us in discussions with other lenders for additional financing. I would like to add my most sincere thanks to the treasury department and their advisors at PJT and they've been working tirelessly around the clock to ensure quick access to as much needed liquidity. The CARES Act alone has provided us nearly $650 million in available liquidity to Allegiant, the NOLs, PSPs and loans. Of this amount, $350 million pertaining to the NOLs and PSP does not have to be paid back. This $350 million of non-GAAP liquidity would cover more than 85% of our total cash burn from April through December. This assumes that down case scenario previously mentioned of daily bookings down 85% with an average of 1.5 million of daily cash burn throughout the period. This example helps illustrate why our number one priority in terms of liquidity is further reducing our costs. While there have been many tough decision today and likely more many to come, doing so is the best defense of our balance sheet and proves vital and coming out as healthy as possible on the other side. As it relates to the additional alternative sources of liquidity, we have several levers available and we are keeping all options on the table. However, based on our current numerous scenario planning at this time, we think it is unlikely we will need to pull any of these levers. As noted earlier, the optionality of the treasury loan provided us additional time to continue monitoring this environment. The available amount of upto $276 million through September provides this confidence we have the access to ample liquidity to make it to the other side. Turning to CapEx. For the remaining nine months of 2020, gross CapEx is now under $200 million. This amount include the potential acquisition of up to seven 320 aircraft and four CFM engines. We are in ongoing discussions with the respective counterparties of these assets by any we may take will be financed. Regarding fleet, no one knows when demand will return. Therefore, fleet flexibility is critical. Accordingly, we are working on plan to strategically part up to 25 of our existing aircraft, depending on the demand environment. Our current expectation is up to half of these aircraft may be permanently retired. We intend to maintain flexibility with the other half by either retiring or reinstating based on the recovery timing of travel demand. Retiring in or parking these aircraft allows us to meaningfully optimize spend on engine maintenance down the road. By way of example, we now expect our 2020 and '21 heavy maintenance CapEx to be reduced by $60 million to $75 million respectively. Additionally, strategically parking aircraft now will provide optionality for us to bring some of them back beginning in '21 should travel demand warranted. We have commitments for only two future aircraft next year and if we purchase we expect to finance them. Including these two aircraft, we would expect total gross CapEx for \u201821 to be less than $150 million. Core to Allegiant Travel is our are airline. Our number one priority is to ensure survival and long-term success. In order to make this happen, we have suspended construction indefinitely on Sunseeker and restructured Teesnap and Nonstop to be self sufficient in terms of cash flow. As a result of suspending construction on Sunseeker coupled with no current plans to complete, we have recognized $137 million impairment over its related assets, writing them down to a fair market value of roughly $35 million. A focus of ours coming out of this environment will be to quickly restore our balance sheet. We are planning to maintain our regular debt servicing schedule during the crisis and make nearly $300 million of principal payments from now until the end of '21. These principal payments should help to offset the incremental debt added as a result of COVID-19. In closing, we are nimble airline uniquely built on a flexible capacity strategy. We believe this will help us during this crisis. However, we will continue to maintain discipline and further rightsizing our cost structure to support any demand environment to help restore our earnings power as timely as possible. And with that, I'll turn it over for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Actually two questions here for Greg, so Sunseeker no CapEx tied to it and basically nothing for the next 18 months. And yet, there is -- isn't there some debt or is there any sort of liability, is there any sort of costs associated with it over the next 18 months keeping it in sort of this more in state? Is there going to be cash out the door any sort of charges? It's not completely zero or is it?\nGreg Anderson: As far as debt -- there's no debt that we've drawn on that so there's no debt obligations at this point. In terms of additional costs, now there is some outstanding payables that we've committed to for stopping down that we're bleeding out over the next few months. So we intend to make those payments. And that's built into our cash flow number that we provided. And then there's some minor investments or there's some minor costs I\u2019d say nominal to just secure our investment in that property but nothing to write down about.\nMike Linenberg: And on tax payments to write you have to pay, or maybe there's not. There's nothing there. I'm just thinking of property tax. Or maybe there's actually none in the State of Florida now that I think about it. So\u2026\nGreg Anderson: And everything is pretty minor. It's not a meaningful investment, or not a meaning amount of investment\u2026\nMike Linenberg: And just my second question, when you think of unencumbered assets and anything that you could potentially sort of pledge to secure additional financings, whether it's the loan program into the CARES Act. What do you currently have and can you give us just a rough estimate of what available unencumbered collateral would be?\nGreg Anderson: So all of our non-aircraft and engine collateral debt was to the term loan. So really the dry powder we have for the most part is our unencumbered aircraft and engines. And then I'd also add have we have a lot of equity in our aircraft, because it is currently under secured financing because we're paying it off so quickly. But in total our unencumbered assets, aircraft and engines, I think we have about 28 aircraft, eight spare CFM engines that are unencumbered. So that gives us $36 million. I think the fair market value currently is about $430 million to $450 million on these assets. And so depending on the LTVs between 50% to 75%, you could probably raise $250 million or so.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nCatherine O'Brien: So maybe just a couple on the cash burns. So I guess first, are you including the impact of the CARES grants in that cash burn? I just wasn't entirely clear and then I have a follow up on the cash burn as well.\nGreg Anderson: No, we're not. Those are -- the impact of the TSP grants are excluded from our cash burn number.\nCatherine O'Brien: And then just on the 750,000 daily gross bookings, is that offset at all by refunds? And so maybe the net revenue assumption is lower. And then how does that net assumption compare to what you're seeing right now? And then lastly on the cash burn. What's driving improvement on the cost side from 2Q to 3Q since you're assuming revenue assumptions are static? Thanks.\nGreg Anderson: The 750,000 gross, that's a gross number. So there was -- refunds would net that down. We've seen I think relative to others, I don't want to get into the exact amounts relative to other carriers, I think we have modest cash refunds out the door. And then as far as the cost reductions that you're seeing in the cadence, I would say a lot of the efforts that we outlined in the release that have taken place that's kind of the driver from where we've seen the second quarter average to go down to the third quarter average. But what really is driving that down are just we have outstanding payables. Maury mentioned this in his opening remarks. Once it started in early March, we reached out to all of our vendors, started working on deferred payment plans and it was a it was a monumental effort across the board. We appreciate our vendor partners and everyone. But we're committed to paying all our vendors. And so you're seeing a fleet that that outstanding payables out over the next few months, and then we'll get back to a normal rate. So that's worth about I guess 500,000 per day, if you do the quick math. And then I think the fourth quarter drop that we\u2019re alluding to is that would be just the rightsizing of our cost structure just based on where demand is at. So that 750,000 gross bookings number, we're just trying to keep that constant to show you a down case scenario, and just to really highlight where the cost puts and takes to be.\nCatherine O'Brien: And then maybe if I can just sneak hopefully on Sunseeker. So just to be clear, all these impairments were non-cash. And then on the future of Sunseeker, you\u2019re saying you're not going to receive any funds from Allegiant for at least 18 months. Two on that, if you can't find the partnership, would you be able to just pause construction for that entire period? Are there any cost of locking down the site, I think you kind of already answered that on that to Mike. And then second, if you do find a strategic partner to continue construction and start up costs. Would you move forward with that? And I guess, if you do move forward with that, would you only consider a partner that would allow you the same flexibility and bundling packages, et cetera, that you would have had without a partner? Thanks so much. \nMaury Gallagher: Katie, you're like 17 months ahead of us right now. We just had [Multiple speakers]. So it's shut down and it's not what we're doing. We had to pick a number. It's an asset, we got to do something eventually. But like I said, that moves ahead of us.\nGreg Anderson: And the impairment is non-cash, Katie, just to answer that your first part impairment, yes, that\u2019s a non-cash impairment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So one I just want to say that the commentary on declining cash burn with no improvement in underlying demand is perfectly clear, and I think that's a really interesting perspective. Regarding demand, you said it got as low as I think 250,000 a day and you're seeing 750,000 per day at some point or recover to that. Where is that now? Is it is it better than the 750,000?\nDrew Wells: No, I think that's a pretty good look at where we're at today.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then big picture 2021. Obviously, you guys can flex up, flex down, depending upon how you think this is going to play out. And my guess is July is sort of a pivot month into the rest of the year. But can you just give us a range of outcomes into 2021? And then just as a follow up, how confident are you in your ability to sort of resize the cost structure to those various scenarios?\nDrew Wells: I'll kind of kick it off with I guess scenarios and it will be kind of a non answer to that, anything is pretty much still on the table. You're right, the July is a pivot month. But to be able to give a lot of insight into what's going to happen in 3Q and 4Q depends on I guess what you think about second wave, what you think may happen with Orlando and Vegas. And I think there's so many moving parts that the spectrum of possible scenarios is gigantic, at least from my vantage point, almost others around the table have different things.\nMaury Gallagher: Well, let me just make a macro comment, Duane. This is all about cash management. And what drew is doing right now is we're cash forecasting each flight literally and it makes sense for running it certainly at a point once you get to big enough, you have to be more discerning in canceling flights with impacting customers and things like that but we're certainly in the transition. So for the foreseeable future, it's going to be a cash call on just what we're going to do going forward and that's the whole liquidity burn. The things we can control the CapEx, all those investment types of things. I think Greg put in the numbers 375 million we've taken out so far of this one time and ability to do that. We're going to continue to focus on that and we\u2019ll slowly but surely react to the marketplaces as presents itself. I'm personally optimistic, like I said in my comments, I know a lot of people that just want to get out and use the tongue in cheek rumble. People are tired of sitting at home and we just -- we travel amongst ourselves on the weekends and John can speak for it coming out of Southern California, there\u2019s just people on the beaches. Somebody told me they were down and lawful in this weekend as the river runs through that place was packed with people, as well to all people. Social distancing was not in the lexicon according to him. So you're getting all kinds of signals. And the thing that I see personally is there's really no hard data you can point out, in many ways its opinions. And some people have an opinion that they're going to go out and other people they wouldn't be caught outdoors if God came down and said it was all clear. So, it's just going to be a wait and see as we kind of feel our way through this.\nJohn Redmond: I think the only other thing worth commenting on in your question was had to do with the confidence around rightsizing our cost structure, whether or not we're confident about doing that and the emphatic answer is yes. We've demonstrated that in the past and we'll demonstrate that going forward. So you've heard it in our commentary and you can see the language in the release but we're very confident about being able to do that.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And if I could sneak one more in not that you\u2019re a Vegas story but you are there. And I think in many respects, the airlines are somewhat ahead of the resorts and the hotels. What are you hearing from Vegas? What is your view of the reopening plan? And how far before customers can sort of constantly book vacation packages in Vegas? And thanks for taking the questions.\nMaury Gallagher: I mean, I don't know that there's any visibility in that regard. I mean, the thing and you look at lot of the Vegas hotels, they were hoping to open early as you can see just by their booking windows, lot of them are allowing people to book into Memorial weekend that didn't happen. Having said that, the governor made pretty quick announcements when it came to opening up some of the local elements that we have here, didn't give a lot of advance notice in that regard. But I'd imagine listening our hope would be that when it comes to the strip and the resort corridor, that there would be a lot of advance notice on that realizing that people need this advance notice to be able to book and react to it properly, especially the operators. So my guess would be that that would happen but trying to predict anything could be very difficult in this environment as to when that would happen.\nJohn Redmond: We\u2019ve had some operators, Duane. I think Wynn gentleman Matt Maddox. He suggested he wanted to open on Memorial Day weekend, I talked to him personally but you had not had the powers to be throw the switch so they could do things. Other people suggest they want to open May 15th. So they\u2019re I think chopping out a bit and we talked to one hotel said it was fully booked for June.\nMaury Gallagher: But when you look at it too in a lot of jurisdiction, hotels are open -- the wrinkle here in Nevada is you have gaming, which is a privilege license right. So it requires not only the governor but we try the gaming control board to approve that. So that\u2019s added wrinkles that you have here in Nevada. I would imagine both bodies will act in concert nearby that decision. And I would hope that happens sooner rather than later but predicting a date would be impossible.\nJohn Redmond: For our two weakest, if you want to pick our big five or four markets, the two tougher ones right now are Orlando and Las Vegas. And they're trailing the others that we're seeing pretty good activity on. So we\u2019ve got upside and we\u2019re looking forward to that. And I would think Disney World and Orlando is going to be -- they opened Shanghai. So they\u2019ve got to be in the power or moving towards that date it\u2019s coming. I think we all understand that, you just can't pick date certain as the one that's coming. But I would be absolutely astonished that if these hotels here in Vegas are open within the next 30 to 45 days.\nDrew Wells: I would too. And I think when you look at the Florida, they\u2019ve been out in front of this opening the state so to speak and Disney, I know has -- they're taking bookings on the Disney World Resorts beginning July 1. So that's somewhat of a statement that they're kind of making that they consider probably open up around that timeframe. They have started opening up their retail locations already. So I'm sure Disney's in conversations as operators are here. So I would agree with Maury that this is probably in that 30 to 45 day timeframe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Maury, could you just opine on what you think this means for air travel demand longer term? I guess just kind of lead to any structural changes in your business. I mean, obviously you played some pretty big bets on kind of the resiliency of travel and the secular drivers of growth behind that. Does this change how you view any of that longer term?\nMaury Gallagher: Well, you right that you\u2019ve got two fundamental issues. It's how long do people's memories last and how fast does this disappear. We are a very predictable species. I think in many cases of wanting to do things and the like. I think the main structural change in many ways is going to be in the business world where you've proven that you can do a lot of work with the Zooms of the world. Having said that when times get good, people they forget these things. And you look back at the mentality going into March 1st in this country and mentality on April 1st, it was a sea change. Can you get back there? Well, it was 12 years getting to March 1. Does it happen in this week or next? Obviously, no. And I think you just go back and study your history, it's going to be structural I think around those types of things. As far as sizing and the like, who knows. I like our prospects, because we're niche and we can play in places that other people can't or aren't comfortable. I\u2019d remind of our folks in 2005 Northwest came after us and put airplanes on top of us from Fargo and Des Moines and the like into Vegas and they stayed around for a year, but they just didn't work for them, because they're not built to work like we are. So that's a plus. Is there short term problems with people coming downhill? Maybe. But long term I don't think it works that way for us. But the industry, it's got to shrink, obviously. But I'm reasonably bullish that, as a population, we're going to grow. We're going to be, I think, right now I don't see any material weakness in the economy that other than, we're spending like Drunken Sailors and whether or not that will have any problem, but they'll be short-term problems with unemployment certainly. But we're not -- Scott DeAngelo probably better in this, it doesn't seem from our surveys that it's like, Oh My God, people are doing nothing.\nScott DeAngelo: That's right. In fact, the majority of people in our surveys report their personal financial situation has largely stayed the same and/or gotten better. Obviously, most of those didn\u2019t stayed the same. Getting better are the ones that might have, that's a bigger jack. But the fact is in the Midwest and Mid Atlantic, the Upper West, I got to tell you they don't share the opinion that the evening news is putting out there. And we\u2019ve seen here that one more step or you\u2019ll follow most tracking surveys out there have asked the question about you go all in for public health, or do you balance public health with the needs of the economy. The nation as a whole has been 50-50. The Allegiant customer base has been 75/25, every time we've asked that question in favor of you balance public health with the needs of the economy and you get out there. So our footprint just don't happen to mirror one where the sentiment is very different than a general cost survey that captures New York, Dallas, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.\nJoseph DeNardi: And then maybe one for Greg or Scott. One of the key differences you guys have is the ability to flex up and down. And so can you just maybe quantify a little bit more like if you shrink the fleet by 25 aircraft. What is your OpEx do in that environment? If you shrink it by 35, like what does it do? Are there certain pain points along the way where it gets harder to scale up and down? Can you just maybe quantify that a little bit? Thank you.\nGreg Anderson: Joe, it's Greg. I'll kick it off and Scott will jump in. And just wanted to say real quick, we enjoyed your spirited debate with Hunter the other day, moderated by our good friend Mr. David. So that was interesting information on the loyalty program. But just given our cost structure, Joe and I think maybe just a tag line or punch line as a good example is like September, we just -- we don't fly in September. So we built a cost structure around fleet find usefully in low ownership costs. And if we think about the current environment we're in, say ownership costs were pretty much variable and we'll kind of rightsize that as we come out. So by that I mean the fuel, obviously, variable we're seeing low fuel costs. We're seeing on the labor for the next couple of quarters that's the pass through, if you kind of want to think about it that way. Our stations, our airports, we don't have evergreen or long-term contracts with our airports very small cost I think relative and again variable. On the maintenance side, same thing. The vast majority of that's variable. Advertising sales if you think about that pretty much we pulled all our marketing spend, and so the cost going through that will be our interchange, which is variable. And then other I think, there's some of that is fixed and variable, but we've done a good job of pulling a lot of that back. As we've alluded to about $375 million number. And then I think perhaps worth mentioning too is just our compensation strategy. Maury and team has set this up in the beginning is for a lot of our particular corporate overhead folks, we keep low base salaries and pay high variable on the upside with bonuses. And to put that into perspective, I think last year, Joe, we paid roughly 10% of our total labor costs for profit sharing and bonuses. So that obviously in this type of situation will uniquely move down. And Scott, I didn't know if you wanted to add anything else on that.\nScott Sheldon: Yes, I think the only thing I\u2019d add there's been a conscious effort to grow kind of small and midsize cities. To Greg's point, we don't have much of a long-term expense or facility footprint, it\u2019s just largely variable. But these commitments to grow in small cities is relatively expensive. Obviously, you don't get much or very good productivity flight crews, so those come on as those cities grow. So assuming demand does not snap back in a meaningful way, if you're going to get efficient on the cost structure, you'd likely reduce some of the really small cities that you have and consolidate those into larger basis where you can drive productivity. But labor is a big piece of this and we're going to see this through in the near-term to see where demand shakes out but that's definitely a lever that we're going to have to look at longer term.\nOperator: Our next question for the line of Savvy Syth with Raymond James.\nSavvy Syth: I know you're being very tactical with the planning currently, but I was wondering if you can give some high level thoughts on how you're thinking about 2Q in terms of capacity? And then also just clarification on 2020 CapEx with the reduction that you're expecting the business to spend around $380 million this year?\nDrew Wells: I\u2019ll kick it off with kind of capacity and then turn over to Greg. Like I mentioned, we're trying to keep as broad of a selling footprint as possible. We still have about 75, 70% of June available for sale and we'll monitor those as we get closer in. May has obviously come in and roughly half of month is passed and we've actioned some of those cancels. But for Memorial Day week and beyond, I think we saw over 50% on sale. But we're watching these closely that will come down, but it's hard to give a lot of guidance as we're going to be following the seven, 14 days out before making final calls on anything.\nGreg Anderson: And Savvy on the CapEx question, yes, it's about just over 300 for the full year. The kind of what's remaining left is about $200 million. The vast majority of that is through aircraft and engines, which we expect to finance. And then there's some minor amounts on the other kind of what we call other CapEx with IT and things like that, and then there's just let some minor trail off on the heavy maintenance spend.\nSavvy Syth: And then if I might follow-up on a question as we think about costs going forward. Is there kind of the changes that you're making related to COVID, the stuff that might have kind of linger on, such as cleaning procedures and things like that. Is that a significant cost burden, or is that pretty minor when you kind of think about the grand scheme of things?\nGreg Anderson: I'll kick it off and each other might want to jump in too. But I think what we've done particularly with the kind of personal safety and the maths and the kids and everything we've done, that was a good investment by our company. While I wouldn't say it's not minor, minor, I mean there's a decent amount of it, it's not going to meaningfully impact our numbers moving forward and that is built into the cash burn that we've provided.\nDrew Wells: Yes, I think the only thing I'd also add is maybe not in these times, but because the actual cost of product isn\u2019t substantial. But if you're building extra time, if you're doing kind of mid term cleaning and so if you're going to increase the duty day, it's really going to change your profile and your staffing models. So, the art of possible is how you do this while still maintaining kind of a crew productivity metric in mind. And so we're not going to set yet but you know that's something that we're mindful of as we move forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nHunter Keay: Actually Greg, what triggered the $137 million write down? Was there some sort of accounting test that that, it was just a subjective call? Just from a pure accounting perspective, what triggered that? \nGreg Anderson: So the triggering event was the suspension of construction. And I guess kind of the way to think about it is, because we have no clear line of sight of when that resumes. When you go through impairment analysis, you'll see like a cash flow recoverability test. But without the clear line of sight, we're unable to kind of come up with I think appropriate number, if you will, just because there's so much uncertainty right now. And so, what you do is then you write that down to the current fair market value.\nHunter Keay: And then Maury, I'd ask you to dream a little bit on this with me here. Is there a way to totally rethink how you pay your frontline people? Maybe you give them like higher pay on an hourly basis, but you take away minimum guarantees, or maybe you even put some of these frontline folks on annual salaries and you give them an annual bonus based on company performance. Is there anything like that that you can affect pay wise, that could give you even more variability that works out, both for you and for the company? Obviously, I realize it's all to be done in collective bargaining, of course. But is there anything that you can think about long term, about affecting long term change as it relates to compensating people out of this thing, particularly the front line?\nMaury Gallagher: Well, you hit the nail on the head. It's all tied to contracts and the way that people are paid and we're creatures of habit. And we're used to thinking the way we think and there's these contracts get build up some of them are 50-60 years old that they\u2019re built up of all the overarching little things that the average person would look to. I\u2019d like to think that the nice thing about our model is we don't interchange a lot of people. So in Orlando is a contained base, it goes out and back and the like. One of the constructive things I'd like to see us do is work with the pilots, flight attendants, in particular to see about what's a better way to compensate you in a base and test it. So you got to go back, you got to go out and test it. You got to schedule and pay or the two fundamentals for these folks appropriately solve. So if you want to do some things that enhance for both sides, you got to just -- it's hard to sit across the table and just say, let's try this, because it's easy for the whole group and that's a hard sell. But I would recommend to our folks that let\u2019s pick a base, let's try some ideas and we should be testing something all the time. It's just a good way for businesses and organizations to be continually checking what they're doing and could we do it better. But there won't be anything short term, I don't think at this point, Hunter, with people looking to change - candidly to their defense, they're scared to death too. I mean you, on February 1st, how your choice of jobs if you were a pilot, and I think we did an internal calculation that showed there'd be as many as 25,000 pilots, [how][ph] to work here in the not too distant future. That's a life changing for a lot of these folks that have never seen anything like this, that's pretty tough pill to swallow.\nOperator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Maury Gallagher for closing remarks.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you all very much. Appreciate your time. And we'll see you in July, I would guess at this point.

I'm happy to report our 68th consecutive profitable quarter. Our operating income increased 50% while earnings per share was up 43% to $14.26. By any standards this past year has been a terrific year.As I said in our calls the past four quarters we were in a good place at the end of 2018 after completing our transition. Our model is alive and well with our Airbus aircraft. In fact, in my mind we're in a better place compared to where we were with the MDs. We said we would generate $6 million of EBITDA this year per aircraft and we did it and stayed at $6.3 million, a 50% increase over our 2018 results.Again we led the industry in operating margin for both quarter and the year and for the airline only in 2019 we had a 21% operating margin and generated over $16 of EPS. Our other investments in Sunseeker and Nonstop are progressing well. Will this past year and 2020 will be investment years, the outcomes will justify the investments.Our Allegiant 2.0 implementation is progressing nicely. We have spent the past 18 years developing relationships with our leisure customers. 2.0 was focused on providing these customers with enhanced travel experiences by utilizing our direct relationship with them through our enhanced IT tools. Since particularly [ph] we are focused on bringing together our one to one relationship with our customers through better IT tools, increasing the suite of leisure products, pricing them attractively and wrapping them in our loyalty program which rewards participation in the Allegiant ecosystem.Critical to this effort is increasing our awareness among our customers. We have had an excellent year in this category, particularly with our efforts on the Allegiant Stadium and our recent announcement of our 44 new reps. As I said in the release we are truly becoming the national company defined by our leisure business. But we need more products than just our terrific air product. Additional hotel products particularly in Florida will be a critical component.We have sold over 7.5 million hotel room nights since the early days of the 2000s and we are experienced at this effort. The majority of the room nights sold have been here in Las Vegas, but we are experienced in Florida as well as that is our second largest hotel market. Sunseeker will allow us to focus our customers on our products, selling our rooms quite profitably I might add given we will sell them without intermediaries. This will allow us to generate exceptional EBITDA numbers as we have said in the previous comments.As I said earlier, we had a remarkable year last year. Others will comment on things today as to what we did and some of the specifics. I wanted to turn my comments to our personnel, our great people and our management team. We have matured nicely over the past many years. People candidly are core to what you see and hear from us and everything we do.And I can say categorically, this is the best team I have been associated with in these past 18 years, both the management and the operations level including our team members who produce our product every day. They are among the best in the industry. Our results verify this claim. We have been number one in completion factor 19 of the past 24 months. Our net promoter scores have increased 32 points during this time ranking us among the top air carriers in the U.S. and our bench strength as well in our management group is as deep as I have seen it.And this does not me, just not me saying this, we have independent verification of this support of our team members via the Glassdoor findings. They are the go to online site for people researching a company's culture and quality based on reports from its personnel. This past year for the first time we made it to the top 100 companies in the country to work for and I believe we are the only company in Nevada in this category. This is indicative of the environment our team has created inside our four walls.This quality environment where our people are both proud and enjoy coming to work is the result of many years of a conscious effort to internally develop our talent and create an environment where they can succeed and grow. And while we've had a remarkable history to date I'm convinced this team will lead us to better days in the future.Let me close by personally congratulating Scott DeAngelo on his promotion to EVP. Scott has been with us just short of two years. But during this time he has had an outsized impact. First and foremost, he is a terrific person, a great leader and manager. He has been spearheading our Allegiant 2.0 development efforts to date as well. His experience and understanding of data among other things and how it works when talking to customers will be critical building the 2.0 in the coming months and years. We are indeed fortunate to have him on board.Thank you all today and let me turn it over to John.\nJohn Redmond: Well thank you very much Maury and good afternoon everyone. Of course I echo Maury's comments when it comes to the wonderful job that our Allegiant team has done in this past year and of course the release reiterates our Investor Day guidance which demonstrates the continued high expectations we have for this amazing Allegiant team going forward. So thank you to all of our team.I'll give you a quick update on our Sunseeker. This project of course is still on time and on budget. I'll give you little bit more detail on that. The budget of course is $470 million, no change. As of year-end we had $330 million in commitments. Again these commitments mean that we have agreements in place including our schedules. Again, out of that $470 million $25 million is preopening, $4 million of which of course was spent in 2019 and the balance of that will be spent in 2020 and 2021 and Greg will give you a little more color on that in his comments.So if you take that $470 million, you back out the $25 million in the preopening you have the $445 million budget, so roughly 74% of that budget, the $330 million I referenced is committed. So we are in really good shape with where we stand. And of course if you further reduce that budget by another $45 million that relates to furniture, fixtures and operating supplies which obviously those orders are always placed towards the back end, but right before opening, you go down around $400 million and of course $330 commitments out of $400 million we're roughly 83% committed. So really in good shape. We're happy with how we're progressing and look forward to 2021.Key funding as we mentioned, we expect that to kick in around August of this year and we also still expect around June or July of this year our buildings to be all topped off and completely enclosed. In regards to the opening date, we talked about this a little bit on the Investor Day, but it is worth explaining again. We have put inventory out there for sale to the public already. The inventory we put out there in June 2021 through May 2022. We expect to open the building in April, but we have another hurricane season to deal with it and I don\u2019t want to be selling rooms only to potentially refund money.So while we believe we can open as early as April, well we are quoting at this point in time a June opening date. As I mentioned before, I will pick a new month and I expect it to be in the April timeframe, we'll pick that new month in the fourth quarter of this year. So once we get throughout another hurricane season, we'll update you on what the month is that we expect to open. And as is said before, when we get into January 2021 we will actually pick an opening day.I mentioned we are currently selling rooms, very, very soft. We're not into heavy marketing as we're testing all of our systems that we developed. So we have to date 26 bookings relating to 27 rooms. Obviously one person booked two room and the ADR so far, average daily rate that we've received to date is right around $297 and again we modeled 185, but I don\u2019t want to have anyone extrapolate just yet.We haven\u2019t sold enough rooms to do that, but we're very excited about how things are progressing in the amount of information we're getting in this relatively short period of time. And again when you look at this, people are booking 18 months to two years out. So we never expected to be selling like crazy. We just wanted a soft start so we can test all of our systems.I also wanted to mention that we will be filing a site plan for phase two next week and before anyone gets too excited about that phase two that we're going to submit is just a ground-level pool and a restaurant. So again, when you submit these types of documents for site plan approval, these don\u2019t create an obligation. When the county approves it, it just creates an opportunity.So if and when we ever choose to do this project it will be a decision for the board to make down the road, but we can't put ourselves in the position to do anything without going through the normal process of submitting these things. I want to just mention that so it is out there and it's not something that's misinterpreted when we file.And of course on that note, I'll turn it over to our recently promoted Executive Vice President, Scott DeAngelo.\nScott DeAngelo: Thank you, John. As Maury referenced in 2019 we leveraged data and technology to lay the commercial foundation for our Allegiant 2.0 vision, a vision that capitalizes on our cost-effective, direct-to-customer distribution model to achieve not only strong air and ancillary revenue performance, but also pile on top of that by generating revenue beyond the aircraft with our third-party hotel and railcar products and our co-branded credit card program.Nearly 110 million web users visited allegiant.com in 2019 a 10% increase versus the prior year. More importantly, even with the dramatic growth in web visitation we maintained our internal productivity metric of achieving an average of more than $16 of net revenue per website visitor which means that despite attracting 10 million more visitors to allegiant.com our ability to convert those visitors into Allegiant customers at comparable transaction sizes remained constant. And attracting these web visitors became more cost-effective than ever as nearly 75% came to allegiant.com without requiring any paid digital advertising helping us achieve this with our email database which grew by more than 25%.Couple of these large and growing digital audiences with the fact that nearly 85% of our customers say that air is the first purchase they make for their leisure vacations and we are well-positioned to continue growing revenue from our third-party products. We see our customers first and we know where they are traveling to before anyone else.This gives us unparalleled opportunity to present them with hotel and railcar options and in the future even sport and event tickets. In fact, we're already seeing returns from our Allegiant 2.0 approach. We ended 2019 with 20% year-over-year growth in third-party product net revenue. And please remember, this net revenue almost entirely flows through to operating income.Continuing our surgical data driven approach to generating demand for our leisure and air in new and existing market, while streamlining the direct buying experience at allegiant.com to reduce friction and achieve even greater attachment of hotel rooms and rental cars and of course continued growth of our Allegiant World MasterCard program remain key commercial focus areas this year for Allegiant 2.0.And lastly, I'll address the announcement we made today as the official airline of the Indianapolis Colts. This arrangement is simply us continuing our partnership that we began in 2015 when we entered the Indianapolis market with five routes. Since then, thanks in large part to the Allegiant brand awareness driven in conjunction with this partnership, we've established a base there and now fly to 15 destinations.We also serve three other airports in the state which also benefit from this. Like our other major sports partnerships this one has no incremental impact to our sales and marketing cost. What's more, the Indianapolis Colts are our fixed fee customer of ours, so in that sense they are not only helping us build awareness, but also contributing to the record-setting revenue levels we're experiencing in our fix fee business.And with that, I'll turn it over to Drew Wells to go deeper into our revenue and network performance.\nDrew Wells: All right, thank you Scott and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. I'm very pleased to announce the fourth quarter TRASM of plus 2.5% year-over-year on 8.3% ASM growth. As a reminder, this result is despite a roughly half point one-time benefit we received in the fourth quarter of 2018. We received large contributions from both our air ancillary and third-party revenue sources.Air ancillary surpassed $50 per passenger for the fourth consecutive quarter and as Scott mentioned third-party revenue improvement doubled ASM growth. On the air, we grew TRASM by 1.6% and plus 8.4% ASMs. Furthermore, fixed fee revenue remained the source of immense strength setting a record for the full year and a quarterly record for the third time in the last five quarters. This is largely attributable to an increase in Department of Defense flying and continued incredible work by our charter planning group.In October, we released our bundled ancillary product which we expect to be a boon through 2020. This level fit of a ramping period as we learn best practices and had a fairly small impact to 4Q results due to timing of release and our typical booking curve, but will start to pick up in earnings during the first quarter.Shifting toward 2020, lapping the MDA retirement date will drive elevated growth through the first quarter. We expect this quarter's ASM growth of plus 14% to 17% to be the highest quarterly increase since 2016. As I talked about extensively at Investor Day we will accomplish this even with our reduction in fleet utilization that is more pronounced in off-peak periods. Looking throughout the year, we will have fairly lumpy growth in order to achieve the plus 10% to 12% annual ASM guidance and I would like to add some clarity on that cadence.Throughout the second quarter we will be flat to slightly positive in the first and the front half of the quarter with gains coming in the back half for total ASM growth in the quarter of plus 6% to 9%. That ramp will continue through the summer with third quarter rivaling Q1 for the highest growth in 2020 in the plus 13% to 17% range.Lastly, we are still working to finalize the holiday portion of the 4Q schedule, but we believe the quarter is likely to be 7% to 11% up year-over-year. While we've been through the MDA retirement for over a year, we are just now beginning to grow aircraft meaningfully versus preretirement levels. This has somewhat constrained our ability to grow the network that we ideally would have. With that final phase of the transition now behind us, we were able to announce the largest slate of new routes in company history. The 44 new routes, including the additions of Boston Logan, Chicago Midway and Houston Hobby are monumental next step for Allegiant.The ability to expand our footprint to over 500 routes while maintaining all of the elements of our unique business model is an exceptional feat and certainly a very exciting time for the company. So I'd like to thank all of our employees and service providers for helping us achieve this huge milestone. It is worth noting that the increase in new market ASM will certainly put some pressure on unit revenue metrics as our network returns to higher proportion of developing markets then we've experienced for a few years.I expect 2Q will be the best quarter of the year from a unit revenue perspective while the elevated growth, increasing level of developing ASM and Peppercorns [ph] will put some pressure on the back half of the year. Despite global fears about Coronavirus, solid demand levels have persisted. Books of both new routes and the system as a whole remained strong and I'm encouraged by the current state of demand combined with the power of the Allegiant 2.0 strategy that Scott is putting into action.And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Greg.\nGregory Anderson: Thank you, Drew and hello everyone. In 2019 the airline completed its 17th consecutive profitable year by delivering not only and industry leading operating margin of 21.3% with the high income in our airline's history. This amounts to nearly $300 million of airline operating income, $130 million increase versus prior year and four consecutive quarters of year-over-year margin improvement. These results in capital was truly an exceptional year at Allegiant as the airline grew EPS by more than 40% on only 10% of top line growth.These impressive results would not have been possible without the amazing efforts of our team members to support and grow our world-class airline. Because of their tireless efforts, I'm happy to report the first time in our history we beat all of our full-year 2019 corporate wide goals and therefore our airline employees are in the maximum payout allowable under our airline profit-sharing program. This translates to a record $38 million in total profit-sharing, a year-over-year increase of nearly 80% distribution to our airline team members. I'd like to add my personal thanks to all of our team members for their tremendous efforts.We are thrilled with these results and everyone should be proud. While we expect 42% growth in 2019 EPS will lead the industry it came in on the low end of our latest guide in Q3 primarily due to a spike in the price of fuel during the fourth quarter. Our average cost of fuel during this period was $0.10 higher per gallon than the assumption in our guidance. However, back in January 2019 the midpoint of our initial full year EPS guide was $14 and we continually increased the range during the year, an example of how positive momentum grew for us through the year.As a reminder, our fuel guide is simply based on the price per gallon we paid about a week or so prior to our earnings release. That said, the difference between our 4Q fuel estimate was actual cost as to approximately $0.29 in EPS. We provided additional detail in our recent earnings release. Excluding fuel, airline cost performance for the fourth quarter came in slightly higher than our original expectations with CASM-X down only 1.5% year-over-year.Although we delivered meaningful improvements in labor productivity during the quarter, costs associated with higher than expected profit-sharing drove slightly higher than expected CASM-X. I should add it is a high quality problem when your profit sharing earned by our airline team members come in higher than planned due to a better than expected finish to the year, a further example of strength growing as we move through the year.Full year 2019 airline unit cost, excluding fuel, decreased by 3.3% versus the prior year. However, and not to belabor profit sharing, if you exclude it along with fuel, unit costs would have decreased by 4.4% versus the same metric in 2018 significantly better than the range. Based on our estimates, we are the only U.S. carrier in the U.S. to report reduction in CASM-X for the full year 2019, another benefit of being through the transition.Our 2019 exceptional cost performance provides a strong foundation for us to build upon in 2020. Our entire team is committed on costs and relentlessly searching for ways to drive the necessary wants out of the business.Now turning to the fleet, we ended 2019 with 91 Airbus aircraft in service too short of the number we had projected. The two additional aircraft are now in service and we are still on target to reach 105 aircraft by the end of 2020. The shift to the two aircraft into 2020 did not impact our 2019 capacity as demonstrated by the 8.3% scheduled ASM growth in the quarter and the 18.5% ASM growth in December. We are pleased with both the operational and economic performance of the Airbus A320 series aircraft.Flying in all Airbus fleet through 2019 aided us greatly and the airline delivering nearly $540 in EBITDA, an increase of 40% versus 2018 and on a per aircraft basis, is penciled out to $6.3 million of EBITDA. Our 2019 airline CapEx in at $65 million higher than expected. The increase is primarily related to the opportunistic purchase of seven new CFM engines and various spare parts coupled with the better than expected maintenance status on two aircraft acquired during the fourth quarter.Now moving to our 2020 guidance, we are confident in our full-year airline CASM-X projections of down 2% to flat. It is worth pointing out we expect unit cost projections to be better in the second half of 2020 versus the first half and we expect the first quarter to outperform the second quarter. This is largely correlated to the growth cadence Drew mentioned along with a more difficult second quarter comp year-over-year.Additionally, we are maintaining our 2020 EPS guide of $16.50 to $19 while increasing our full year fuel cost assumption from $2.12 to $2.15 per gallon which is the only change to our current guide. Including heavy maintenance, our total airline extremity for 2020 is expected to be approximately $390 million. Coupling our current run rate of EBITDA per aircraft and the projected aircraft growth during the year, the airline is expected to generate nearly $250 million in free cash flow during 2020.Turning to leverage, strong cash generation is helping us de-lever quickly. By way of example, we ended 2019 at 2.7 turns debt-to-EBITDA versus 3.4 turns at the end of 2018. We expect the continued downward trajectory as we grow EBITDA while quickly amortizing existing aircraft debt. Taking on secured aircraft, that was critical to support the timing of our fleet transition and expansion. If you combine our access to capital from top banks throughout the world and our ability to make money with these aircraft has provided us tremendous access to inexpensive financing.We compare this Airbus financing combination in a similar way to the acquisition of our MD-80s. Our all in cash outlay is around the same amount between the two fleet types, primarily since the MD-80 wasn't financeable. Therefore, this type of debt is an efficient tool with a different risk profile than more traditional debt. Aircraft have the ultimate flexibility and capital assets given their mobility.At the end of 2019, we drew on our revolver to provide short term liquidity to help fund the purchase of seven new CFM engines and various spare parts mentioned earlier. We intend to finance most of these engines in early 2020 with use of proceeds to pay down the revolver.Now turning to non-airline, we remain active in negotiations to sell Teesnap and given the sensitive nature we do not intend to comment any further other than a reminder the sale is not included within our EPS guide. Once the sale is complete, we plan to formally reinstate our non- airline guide. However, we will reconfirm our messaging from our recent Investor Day that our expected 2020 run rate should be similar to 2019 non-airline results.As a reminder, we still expect Sunseeker to open in the second quarter of 2021 and total project costs remained at $470 million. Included in the $470 million, as John mentioned, is $25 million of operating expense of which we project 60% to 75% will flow through our 2020 non-airline operating loss.Sunseeker CapEx is expected to pick up in earnest during 2020 and we project over $300 million in gross CapEx during the year. The first $200 million will be funded by Allegiant and the remaining by TSSP. The remainder of their funding will be drawn during the first quarter of 2021 as we complete construction. We are well positioned for a very strong 2020 as reflected in our full year guide and excited for the growth and continued improvements we expect to see throughout the organization.With that I would like to turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Savanthi Syth from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavanthiSyth: Hey, good afternoon. I really appreciate the kind of quarterly color here. Just a little bit, Drew, you know the 2Q rather than being probably the best makes sense from if I look at the capacity growth, but it's my understanding that you had some new markets open late last year. And then again, you'll have another whole bunch opening up this year. So wondering if you can talk about, the kind of the progression as a percentage of ASMs as new markets and if there's anything kind of peak versus off peak growth kind of variants that you'll see throughout this year?\nDrew Wells: Sure, yes thanks for that Savi. So there were some new routes that went through 2019. I think it's important to stress that it was significantly lower, really in the back half of 2018 into 2019, relative to any year really before that. I think I've mentioned this before, but 4Q 2018 we kind of troughed under 4% of our markets being \u2013 of our ASMs being in developing states. As we move forward into kind of to 2Q 2020 when a lot of these new markets these 44 new routes will open we will be up over 11%. That will more than double on a year over year basis, so there will be significantly more pressure on that front than we saw in 2Q 2019.\nSavanthi Syth: Again maybe I misunderstood, are you still expecting 2Q to be the best RASM quarter?\nDrew Wells: Sill expect it to be the best. Some of that remember the 2Q 2019 comp that we're dealing from, can't really run away from that. So, that's one of the larger emphasis as well as the lower overall growth rate.\nSavanthi Syth: Thanks. And then if I might ask on the, I know this is a small, very small business, but on the family entertainment center side, just kind of curious, how that business is performing versus expectations just from an earnings standpoint, but also kind of the secondary reason for it, which is kind of to build loyalty and maybe going to get more email addresses. Just kind of curious if you can provide an update now that they've been open for a while and the thoughts around that?\nMaurice Gallagher: Go ahead Scottie.\nScott Sheldon: Yes hey, this is Scott. I can tell you, it was really kind of a reset. It's a new management team in place. We had two stores open, the first one was in Clearfield, which is in Salt Lake. The second one was in Flint [ph]. If you look at January, literally month to-date the profile is similar to how we thought this business would look. Top line through I think the 25th was around kind of 575 grand and it's running about a 35% EBITDA margin.As far as emails, there isn't a significant amount of overlap between kind of Nonstop versus what was in our Allegiant Air database. Just shows that there is opportunities to kind of cross pollinate there. But no, I think, there's a lot of things that we probably didn't do right out of the gate, which is why we made some pretty dramatic changes, really stripped a lot of unnecessary costs out.There's a lot of seasonality, you have to actually see it you can believe it, so we think we've got a good handle. But that's kind of the profile I anticipate going forward. I think it's still going to be a really good business.\nSavanthi Syth: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.\nDanielMcKenzie: Hi, thanks. A couple of questions here on the 2020 plan. What's the average daily utilization you've embedded in the plan and the reason why I ask is you know to the extent higher utilization could be just simply a way to drive down costs, I know you are guiding the CASM-X field flat to down 2%, but I'm just trying to put that into context?\nMaurice Gallagher: Yes, so utilization will be down for the year. I'm pulling up the number right now. I have \u2013 the first half number will be down a little more than half an hour per plane. We\u2019ll be holding relatively steady in March and June in the peak periods like we expected, but something like an April will come down a full hour. So there's quite a bit of flexibility in that, but I would expect about a half hour to still come out for the year.\nDaniel McKenzie: I see okay. And then I guess, on the room nights, on the sold room nights, just relating to Sunseeker, I wondered if you can just expand or clarify that a little bit more, what are the total room nights available? What percent have been sold and how do you plan to revenue manage or do you plan to revenue manage the remaining inventory?\nGregory Anderson: Hi Dan. The room nights sold to-date of course are a fraction of what the total inventory is and we didn't, as I said in my opening comments, we didn\u2019t expect people to be booking rooms year and a half to two years out. The fact that we have quite a few people who have done that already, the 26 people I was mentioning it is amazing to us that people are doing that. Most people we know hotels just don't put inventory out that far in advance.But we developed all of our systems internally. So it was important for us to get out there selling as quick as possible, not doing an extensive amount of marketing, just let this traffic trickle in. And it then allows us to tweak and monitor all of our systems and processes so we can get those functioning exactly how we want them to. So when we start to heavily market.So our expectation is people will start booking in a more significant way about a year out. And of course, I think that starts to ramp up as you get more like six months out. So that's our expectation, the fact that we're getting this traffic now has just been, a great surprise to us.\nDaniel McKenzie: Very good, if I could just squeeze one more here maybe for Scott, I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on 2.0. I think Maury talked about it evolving. What capability are you looking to gain? What are you looking to do differently I guess is another way to ask that question, as you kind of think about the revenue potential, what kind of revenue potential does that unlock for you?\nScott Sheldon: You bet, so in essence the whole premise of this is the fact that, we invest dollars to make people aware of Allegiant and certainly come to our website. And the most accretive thing we can do once they're at that website or as I like to put it in our store, is to have them put as much in their shopping cart as possible and that certainly is the premise.So to directly answer your question, the things that that requires are a website and by that I mean on mobile, land or desktop, laptop, that enables all the same flexibility and personalization that an Amazon does. That makes use of all of the frictionless shopping and buying the same way that you use a streaming service or you buy from a leading internet retailer. And so ultimately, what it unlocks is today we know for every one hotel room we sell, there's another nine people that put it in their shopping cart, but for the fact that and list a bunch of reasons.But one of them is, they have to pay for it all there versus a conventional way you would pay maybe for one room night and/or just make your reservation and be able to pay at the front desk. These are all technical and/or commercial things that we're doing that we think boost the size of that cart in hotel and rental car and other items.The last quick comment is, we view the revenue potential not just directly from the customer. People around here heard it so much and because they're hot right now I'll use it again that that Apple got to a $1 trillion market cap, not just by selling iPhones and iPads to all of us. But they turned right around and sold up every software developer and media and entertainment company, because they were the way that those companies would distribute to the customer and in a very asset lightweight. Apple was happy to do that and they have their hand out for about 40% of everything they get served through there. In the same way, we believe and we've already seen this hotel partners, rental car partners, other dining establishments are willing to pay to ride along our website or email marketing.And while this is in its infancy, this becomes a net new revenue stream that doesn't come from the customer, but comes from other partners in the ecosystem that not only want to be sold in our store, but are willing to pay extra to have top, in the sort order and/or other advertising opportunities on the site or in our other digital marketing efforts.\nDaniel McKenzie: Very good, now, I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. John, just a couple of quick questions on Sunseeker. I know it's a very small sample set, but just curious of the bookings that you cited, just curious how you sourced them, where they \u2013 are they airline customers or not? And just curious what the duration of this stay is like and if that's meeting your expectations John \u2013 expectations or not? Thanks.\nJohn Redmond: Well these are all good questions. We even had a \u2013 we're getting people, a couple of people actually, both their stay by walk-in into our preview center, which is right on the site of where the construction is taking place. So, we've had some walk-ins, which is great and of course, the rest of all booked online. The longest stay we booked has been seven days and of course, the shorter stay has been one. So, and we booked a seven night stay in the suites too, which is why you're starting to see higher rate like that.So, while this traffic is slow, it's beyond our expectation that people are booked two years out, so very excited by that. We have people that are booked, almost about every month we have out there and the furthest month out is February of 2022. We have a couple of bookings that far out, believe it or not. So again, when you start paying real dollars, two years in advance or 18 months in advance, it's significant, it's appreciated, not expected.But we do expect it of course as we get, much closer to opening as I said, year to six months out as when we would start to really see that traffic pick up. And our marketing efforts will be focused around that time frame too.\nAndrew Didora: And make sense, that's all I had. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. So I just have maybe two questions. The first one is, does your agreement with the Indianapolis Colts preclude you from doing a deal with any other NFL teams?\nMaurice Gallagher: No, not at all.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that was easy. And then my second question is do you have \u2013 given that the MAX is out of service, and it probably will be for \u2013 the first half of the year, maybe longer. Why wouldn\u2019t you grow faster?\nDrew Wells: Helane it\u2019s Drew. Was the question why don't we grow faster?\nHelane Becker: Yes, why don't you grow faster to take advantage of the fact that, some other airlines can't grow because they don't have the capacity available? So, why wouldn't you think about increasing utilization or somehow adding more flights, I don't know how to think about that. But grow faster than your current plan to take advantage of the fact that, maybe you can steal some more share?\nDrew Wells: Yes, so Helane, I think the most important part to remember here is \u2013 as we have such a unique network and unique business model. We weren't really benefiting from the MAX being gone. All the routes we announced were the ones we've had our eyes on for a while and weren't dictated by the MAX being in or not in service. So I think we're marching to the beat of our own drum and exactly the cadence we want to. Hopping into routes or areas where American or Southwest are trying to expand rapidly doesn't really jive well with where our network is taking us. So I think at16 or so percent give or take one and a half points I think we're growing at a great rate, one that the entire company can kind of move forward together at. And I think I'm very satisfied with where we're at.\nHelane Becker: Okay that\u2019s great, that\u2019s helpful.\nGregory Anderson: Helane this is Greg. I\u2019m just going to add, I mean, on the MAX comment that on a fixed fee side that we definitely see opportunities to take advantage with the MAX being out, and that's something Drew and his team are hyper-focused on and taking advantage of that.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that's really super helpful. Thank you.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thanks Helane.\nHelane Becker: Of course.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon, everyone, I have two questions here. Drew, the announcement to do the 44 city pairs what is your success rate now? I mean, when you look at some of the launches, and all the new city pairs, at the end of the day, maybe after a year of operation, I'm sure there's always some pairing and some fine tuning, where some markets just maybe they look good on paper, but didn't play out.And the reason I ask is that we've seen over the last few years, other carriers make big service announcements. And then we see actually, sizable number drop out. And so, I think as you've grown in size, how has that, called it success rate, how has that evolved?\nDrew Wells: Sure. So for a long time, I believe Lucas has even quoted this before, we were hunting around 75% success rate as oil kind of came down in the back half of 2014/2015 there, it actually elevated some we're hitting close to 80% to 85%. We probably come back of that just a little bit but still hitting 75% plus at this point.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And just second question to Scott. It was good for the quick update on Allegiant Nonstop, like you mentioned Clearfield and Flint. For 2020 what's the plans there? I saw news out recently, looked like you're buying another site. I don't know if it's the third or fourth. What's the plan for expanding that business in 2020? Is it one or two new sites, three sites, how should we think about it? Thanks Scott. Thanks everyone.\nScott Sheldon: Yes, hey Michael. So, a couple things. As I mentioned we were \u2013 we really spent the back half the year unwinding some of the decisions that were made. We technically have two other locations that we just knowing what we know now we're not comfortable moving forward one and anther Utah facility in West Jordan and there's another one in Fort Wayne. The one in Fort Wayne we own it's on the market. We think we have a potential buyer.But we do plan on opening a new facility in Chesterfield, which is in St. Louis. That should be in the third quarter. So that transaction purchases is done and so we're in the throes of developing the space plan. Yes that one, just know what we know now, like I said we took some probably some unnecessary lumps on the front end.So, at a minimum, one store, maybe two. There's another, there's some other opportunities up in the Michigan area that are attractive as well. But that's kind of the way of the lands. I'm really pleased with kind of how we ended the year, but more importantly, how we're getting started in 2020. As I mentioned, through majority of January, the profile that we're seeing is similar to what we modeled a year ago, so...\nMichael Linenberg: Yes. No, thanks, 35% EBITDA is good, very good.\nScott Sheldon: Yes.\nMichael Linenberg: So, thanks everyone.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks for the questions. Drew, you mentioned in your prepared remarks it's been a while since we've seen you grow, mid to high teens. You guys have done a really nice job of flexing your capacity shaping it around demand. You mentioned that new market mix was going to pressure RASM in the second half.But I wonder if you could comment, maybe just following up on Savi's question how it's playing out here into the March quarter. The point being your new markets may not be dilutive to RASM. So, do you think you can sustain positive RASM trends into March here?\nDrew Wells: So, obviously I'm not going to comment too much on that. We're not going to guide out any sort of RASM cadence. I'll say this much. Obviously, new markets generally have a bit of a maturation curve. It all kind of depends on the type of route you launch, anything that's connecting the dots, between two cities you already operate which was the predominant percentage of our 2019 market add will flow out a bit quicker. Anything that has a new city, especially one without G4 presence, relatively close will take a bit longer. So if you think about the type of markets I think you can kind of glean some information from that, but I think that's as far down the kind of RASM guide and will balance [ph].\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay and then maybe just stepping back big picture, as you think about fuel as an input to your network plans. I think of a Allegiant as one of the better carriers at keeping a fuel tailwind when you get one. Can you talk about, if these lower fuel prices sustain how these growth projections you've given us could change?\nDrew Wells: Sure. So, within 2020 we're already kind of marching toward the top end of where we said we'd like to be long-term as kind of a, 8% to 12% annual carrier. Some of it will obviously depend on induction and the pipeline in which we're able to acquire planes. If fuel stays lower than this, maybe you can scratch out another couple of points, but I think we're hitting pretty close to the top of where we want to go.We've learned over time that that if you grow too fast, you kind of outpace some parts of the company and that puts a lot of stress either on the operation or other general infrastructure. So I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and start saying if fuel goes really low we\u2019ll go to 20% because I don't know that that's the right answer for the company as a whole.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That makes a lot of sense. And just one follow-up there on your airline CapEx of 285 at the midpoint, is that deals you hope to complete or do you have line of sight on that 285 as we sit here today?\nGregory Anderson: Hey Duane, thanks for the question, it is Greg. Now we definitely have line of sight all the aircraft that are scheduled in that CapEx or projected in that CapEx we already have firm commitments on and with strong counterparties that we've done business with in the past. And we fully expect that they deliver on it a lot of times and in fact CapEx is kind of in place.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the time. So Drew, maybe one for you, just on your recent launch, the recent announcement of launch of service to Boston, Chicago, Houston, can you tell us a little bit more about the decision making process there, not really your typical type of cities, but should we view these as more destinations than are duration markets and then any concerns on the competitive response? Thanks.\nDrew Wells: Yes Cathy. So, I think you hit the nail on the head there. These are definitely more destination type cities. If you went back to 2016 we launched into New York and [indiscernible] under very similar pretence. You had either very high fare or completely unserved markets going into both New York and [indiscernible] and now with Chicago, Houston and Boston.So there's a kind of a small niche and each of these for us to thrive each of these airports to serve it as a destination. It's going to be very expensive and very difficult to try to drive a lot of origination traffic from these cities and that's not at all what we're after here. So within our little niche we're not concerned about competitive reaction. We\u2019ll obviously watch the industry as we do anyway, but it's not something that we expect to rankle the others.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay got you. And then maybe just a follow on to that since you mentioned Baltimore and New York there. How those compare or maybe like versus system RASM or system margin? Thanks.\nDrew Wells: Yes, I'll take it. At a high level there's nothing been concerning. But we're not going to talk about specific margins for cities. But obviously, we've been there since 2016 capacity is fluxed a little bit, but there's obviously nothing overwhelmingly concerning there for us to continue to be able to put up 20% margins. There's obviously a high hurdle rate you have to clear in order to kind of continue with the schedules though, yes, no concern.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it, I had to give it a shot. Maybe just one more quick one. On Teesnap nothing, no question here on the state of the negotiation or anything like that, but can you share with us when you're assuming that sale closes, just underlying your 2020 EPS guidance, I believe you have a couple quarters of non-airline expenses associated with Teesnap in that? Thank you.\nGregory Anderson: Yes Catherine, thanks for the question. As far as the guidance, we do have a couple, well we don\u2019t give guof while we don't give guidance on the non-airline costs baked into budget for Teesnap we have it in there for the first half of the year. And as far as timing, we've spent a lot of time on it. I'd probably prefer not to disclose when we're expecting to close that transaction. We've been negotiating in earnest with a counterparty for some time, so we continue due diligence and we're just working through the process. Once we have some clear line of sight on the timing we\u2019ll certainly update you guys, but right now it's just kind of we\u2019re working through it as quickly as possible.\nCatherine O'Brien: Great, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stiefel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes, thanks good evening. Drew, can you just talk about the 44 markets you launched, how many of those were competitive versus not competitive? And then where you ended the year for the network in terms of level of competition and then which way that's going in 2020?\nDrew Wells: Sure, so among the 44 routes, 11% were competitive. We have some competition into the panhandle of Florida, as well as a couple of the routes out of Nashville and Albuquerque going over to Orlando. So that's where we have the competition there. We ended the year right around between 20% and 25% of markets competitive and it's been trending positively for us in some ways because of our announcements being more non-competitive, as well as some actions from competitors. But we've been heading in a positive direction now for about the last six to 12 months.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. And then John not sure if I missed it in your prepared remarks, but the Sunseeker spend in 2019 was below the plan. And I know you said you're still on schedule, but as some of the schedule margin being eaten into just maybe why was spend so far below plan? And then are you planning on continuing to give your \u2013 how many rooms booked, is that that something you're going to give every quarter and if so, what should we expect from that going forward? Just so there's some level of expectations? Thank you.\nJohn Redmond: Sure, thanks Joe. On the spend that doesn't have an impact on speed to be honest with you. The commitments are \u2013 the more relevant or important number. So at the end of the year, I was saying at the end of 2019, we ended up with about $330 million in commitments. From cash management standpoint, if we can delay paying, I mean, that's a great thing to do. So and trying to predict payday its way out like we have to just from a cash management standpoint.It's more art than science. So that's why you'll see it kind of move around. But the opening date, no change to it. No change to schedules. No change to anything. But if we can, delay paying cash, that's a good thing for us. So I think we ended 2019. I think as of the end of 2019 we had spent about $99 million, roughly $100 million on the project in terms of cash. And again, we had $330 million in commitments.In terms of the cadence, bookings again, I don't expect significant increase in bookings between call it now and the end of the quarter, the end the first quarter. And I do intend to update everyone \u2013 every quarter as I mentioned before. There will be complete transparency on everything we're doing, whether it's construction, spend, room nights, occupancy, all of that we\u2019ll be providing you.So again, we're happy with where we are. We expect to book a handful of more rooms in the quarter. Granted that you would like to see big numbers, but we don't expect them. The expectation again, we think it's going to start to happen in the back end of the year as opposed to the front part of the year.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks John.\nJohn Redmond: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Thank you. Just a quick clarification on the \u2013 Greg I think you said you expect to do $250 million in free cash this year. Just to be clear what CapEx number are you using in that calculation? I just want to get a sense for like a true gross CapEx number?\nGregory Anderson: Yes, that would be airline only CapEx. So that would exclude Sunseeker.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And that's not net of any like financing for aircraft, that's like a real gross CapEx number for at least for the airline?\nGregory Anderson: Yes, if you take the run rate of $6.3 million and EBITDA per aircraft, take it over the average \u2013 aircraft count that we expect in 2020. That will get you your EBITDA and then just yeah \u2013 is just subtract out the CapEx that we're showing yes.\nHunter Keay: It's gross CapEx so it's not net of like proceeds?\nGregory Anderson: Yes, yes, yes, exactly.\nHunter Keay: All right, okay. And then, how many of the 780,000 hotel room nights that you sold through third-parties are near Sunseeker or even potentially competitive to Sunseeker in some way? I'm just wondering if the Sunseeker sales effort might at all even marginally cannibalize the third-party room nights a little bit geographically. And I asked the question because obviously this is as you said, like really high margin stuff that just dropped straight to the bottom line. So couple of thousand room nights not sold in exchange for Sunseeker, I was just wondering if there's a little bit of a potential margin disruption impact we should think about?\nGregory Anderson: I don't think you'll see any impact there Hunter and of course the numbers are more I was quoting had to do with gross number of room nights we sold since the inception of the airline. But the number of hotel room nights we sell it skews Vegas, we've always said that in the past. So the concentration of rooms we sell has always been in Vegas. The second market of course is in Florida, and the room nights we were selling in Florida are scattered all over. So with a skewing there towards Orlando, the Sanford market, so everything that we're going to see down in Southwest Florida is going to be accretive. We don't see any displacement type traffic or activity that will go on down there.\nJohn Redmond: Yes, I would add that the more dominant effect you'll see and it is an opportunity is markets that have become, what I refer to is our next gen destinations, Nashville, Savannah, Myrtle Beach, those are markets that right now we do virtually no hotel business and we're scurrying to have the same type of offerings at Las Vegas or Orlando have. So, in the sense of answering the question, that may swing the other way, and represent potential upside as we get those online and start to educate customers to book there the same way they would here in Las Vegas or down in Orlando.\nHunter Keay: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.\nMaurice Gallagher: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nDarryl Genovesi: Hi guys, thanks for the time. Hey John, on the phase two stuff that you mentioned, I guess what are the milestones in your phase one plan that you'd like to pass before you do take that phase two plans to the board?\nJohn Redmond: I don't think we've established any milestones when it comes to phase two, if you will. And the reason being is because phase two doesn't add any additional room capacity. Those are metrics we would be monitoring in phase one before pulling the trigger on doing anything that relates to rooms. These are just when you look at a great level pool in a restaurant they are just added amenities and added the traffic generators and added revenue producers.So the important part of it, which is why we were looking at it first is it finishes off the entire waterfront. So it takes any construction disruption that we would have had and tries to concentrate a lot of that during the current construction process. So again, it's a decision the board will make at some point time in the future. But in order to be in a position to make that decision, there is always groundwork that you need to do.So that's what's taking place right now is all that groundwork. But again, it's adding a pool and adding a restaurant. The pool is currently in the resort project, is on the rooftop of one of the buildings. So this would give us a rooftop pool and a grade level pool and be able to create additional charge points to be able to maximize the opportunity with these guests.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay. And then just to follow up on Andrew\u2019s, and I know it's very early days all the usual caveats, but the $185 baseline that you called out for your expectation, was that associated in some way with the specific mix of rooms and suites and counter rates that were actually booked or was that just a more general assumption for everything across the entire year? Just, I know it\u2019s not that, but just wondering, if you sort of look at \u2013 conclude that ADR is running ahead adjusted for mix or if you sort of don't?\nJohn Redmond: Yes, it was just a general one. And again, that's one that time we modeled for in the very first financial projections we've put out there have to be well over a year ago, maybe even closer to two years ago and we put that information out. We've always said all along that, when we were in a position where the Board is making decisions, we wanted to be conservative in those rate assumptions even though our market is much stronger.And I think in the most recent Investor Day we had, we were pointing out just how strong those rates are in the marketplace. So while we're seeing a very strong work rate it is very early, but you could go out there and look at our inventory. I mean, we've posted rooms out there as I said from June of 2021 through May of 2022. And there is a complete - every single day and every single room has a posting for rooms and rates.So anyone who wants to go out there and look at it, pick their day. We have purposely priced below the market which is one of those things that we had mentioned on the Investor Day that would be part of our strategy. It's just the market is so strong; Maury and I've always talked about that. That's what excited us about that market is just how high those room rates are there.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay, thank you. And then if I can just squeak in a quick there, when did you open booking?\nJohn Redmond: I want to say like right at the beginning of December, so call it into the first week or two. And we've been continuing to upgrade the site just based on things we're finding, but we find it's best or in our best interest to get it out there as soon as we possibly can. It\u2019s kind of like soft opening a hotel where you sell to say a small number of rooms early on to shake out a room. This gives us some early traffic to the site, and allows us to get all of our analytic tools squared away, get all of our tweaking of the site.So we've done several changes to the site since we launched it. And we have numerous changes that will continue to happen, between now and an opening and most assuredly, even just between now and call it at the end of the first half of this year.\nMaurice Gallagher: John, one quick add on comment, that might be good to speak to as well as we certainly are talking about the hotel right now like we think about the airline with the free and independent traveler. But the reality is there's a strong pipeline at group bookings, and groups of course tend to be higher margin business less price sensitive than the individual will book much further ahead of time. And so I think in subsequent calls, there will be updates on that. And a group has the ability to take a big chunk of hotel inventory for a set amount of time and start adding up really quickly when we think about the different customer audiences that will be booking in Sunseeker.\nJohn Redmond: No it\u2019s a very good point. And I think I mentioned before that we will be providing, that level of insight as we go forward here. We have a lot of group leads, but we haven't booked a large group yet. We fully expect that that will happen before the year closes and we expect to see quite a bit of that activity at the hotel. So that's a very, very lucrative and exciting piece of the business as we move forward.\nDarryl Genovesi: Perfect, thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Maury Gallagher, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you all very much. I appreciate your interest and your attention and we'll be talking to you again in roughly 90 days. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Maurice.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you, Chris and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us again.Busy day for you all. I appreciate your time. I\u2019m happy to report our 67th consecutive profitable quarter, very profitable quarter, very profitable quarter as you saw on a year-over-year basis.And question of the day is what's caused this dramatic improvement? Two reasons. One, the one-time expenses of the transition years of 2017 and 2018 are behind us and two, the change to the all-Airbus fleet. Less than 24 months during 2017 and 2018, we added 40 new Airbus aircraft more than doubling our total to 76 at the end of last year. Today, the fleet has grown another 12, 13 airplanes to 89 aircraft. We've showed great scale during this time managing the transition. Since 2001 operating used aircraft has been one of our core competencies. Used aircraft have been and continued to be a more capital efficient asset for our lower utilization model.Since our earliest days, we have sourced aircraft in this more complex us aircraft market including negotiating the transaction and coordinating the inductions. Because of the skill our team has been recognized as one of the best aircraft traders worldwide. And it's shown in our transition BJ Neil and his team have done a tremendous job sourcing the 53 aircraft we have added since early 2017.None of today's results would have been possible without this critical component in our model. And unlike our Airbus are very financeable since 2013, and the acquisition of our first Airbus, we have, our team has been become very skilled and sourcing financing. Clearly we needed financing during the sprint of the past two years adding 53 aircraft today, including 13 new 186 C A320s. Today our aircraft acquisition pace has slowed and as a result our free cash flow is increasing.To this date, we have already exceeded last year\u2019s $373 million of EBITDA. Our paper is very much in demand given our track record in the quality of our aircraft and our solid balance sheet. We do business around the world Japan, the U.S., Europe, with as many as 16 World Class lenders, aircraft lenders fighting for our business.No airline in my 40 years in this industry to my knowledge has transitioned this percentage of their fleet in such a short time so successfully. Not only did we have to source and transition aircraft, we had to continue to run the airline. And during this 24 month period, we grew the airline by over 20% trained over 400 pilots, 300 mechanics and added 57 new routes, all while still maintaining industry leading margins.And that leads us to our second benefit. We now have one of the latest generation fleets of aircraft in the industry, a substantial improvement over our MD fleet. We understood the Airbus would materially improve our economic performance, allowing us to make more money per aircraft. Somewhere concerned our utilization sensitive model might not work with this more expensive airplane. We told you it would and the results is proving our case.Today the peaks and valleys are the same. But the Airbus has allowed us to increase the amplitude of that curve. And during our three most productive months of the year, March, June and July, this past year, we operated in an average of 9.7 hours.That's a 40% increase over the 6.9 hours that we averaged just in 2015. The September our weakest month, we reduced our flying to five hours continuing the trend that we've done for many years. But that's 48% decrease, again compared to 2015, we operated 4.2 hours, but only a 39% decrease from the 6.9 hour peak of that year. We're following exactly the same pattern we established many years ago, but are able to fly profitably more with each airplane each day.We told you at our 2016 Investor Day to expect this dramatic improvement in our financial results. When we competed, particularly when we completed the transition to all-Airbus. In comparison with 2016, that year, we had a 27% operating margin with 149 or $1.49 per gallon of fuel that generated $370 million of operating income. If you adjust this fuel that year to this year\u2019s $2.16 per gallon, the 2016 operating margin drops to a respectable 18.9%. But our year-to-date 2019 airline operating margin through the end of September is better.We're north of 20%, again the power of Airbus. We told you we would be operationally better as well with the Airbus fleet. We lead the industry in completion factor the past 18 months of the 21 months since January of 2018. This year in 2019, we have led the industry every month saved last month when we came in second because of Hurricane Dorian and its problems in Florida. The Airbus has been critical to our improved operations. But our team is also doing its part. We've substantially upped our game in the past few years and it shows.In 2017, there were concerns as well over the changeover in some of our personnel. And we would falter because of the departure of some of our senior management. We said we didn't think so. And that we had a deep and wide bench with people who could backfill these departures.Today's management group is one of the best management teams it's been my pleasure to work with, in my years here at the company. Each one has to be congratulated on their performance in the past 18 to 24 months. And growing our management team internally is one of the core competencies again, most important at Allegiant. I'm most really proud of the fact that we are able to do this. Quality of our product is shining through as well.You'll hear from others about our customer feedback that is ranking us among the best airlines in the U.S. What you have today in front of you, ladies and gentlemen, is a group of over 5,000 team members who are focused, dedicated to providing customers with safe, reliable, fun transportation for very low cost, what we've done the past 18 years.And none of this would have been possible without these team members and the management group out in front leading the way. We are hitting on all cylinders. The first major component of Allegiant 2.0 is in place. And it's providing the underpinning for the other initiatives that are coming right behind.Hang on to your hats, folks, it's going to be a hell of a ride. Thanks very much. With that, I'll turn it over to John for his comments.\nJohn Redmond: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone.Why we love the Airbus product. It all comes down to our amazing team of people with great leadership and great execution. I couldn't be more proud of what has been accomplished to-date. But the best is yet to come. More we talked about the amazing record we have going with completion.Also incredible to point out is our controllable A14 has been up year-over-year versus samemonth prior year for 21 of the last 22 months, an incredible feat again by this wonderful team of folks we have working here. I thought to take just a minute to give you a couple quick updates on some important data points as it relates to Sunseeker realizing that will provide incredible detail around all of this when we have our investor day.With regards to construction, we're on budget, with 67% of the total budget committed to-date and by end of this year, over 80% of the total project budget will be committed. You would get by the end of this year, the building should be approximately five storeys high and all towers should be topped and wrapped in April of 2020.And again, as I mentioned before, if you go out on a website and click on the project updates tab, you could look at a drone video of the site which is posted every single week. To update you just on the branding and selling opportunities we have here, we will go on sale with the resort before the end of the year. So we're very excited by that, we have approximately 800,000 active Sunseeker emails to date, which incredibly enough, we have more than 5,000 emails from over 30 different states.Of course that speaks volume about the breadth of the brand awareness and the power of a leader carrier to develop a resort brand well before a resort opens. Also worth pointing out for anyone who's been on the website, people have the ability to go beyond just given us an email and actually register their interest with full knowledge of what room rates are, as well as providing us additional detail about how long they intend to stay, what their gender is, what their age is, whether they're retired or not, et cetera.When you look at the number of those folks who have actually registered their interest, we have 148,000 of them who are registered their interest to date. So again, very excited by these numbers. Like we can't wait for the opportunity to start letting these people express their further interest by actually booking with us. And again, that'll happen before the end of this year. Now, on that note, I'll turn it over to Drew.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, John. And thanks, everyone for joining us this afternoon.I'm very pleased to announce the third quarter TRASM of plus 4.3% year-over-year and plus 5.8% ASM growth, despite a roughly half point headwind associated with Hurricane Dorian. As expected, the revenue momentum we saw building toward the end of the second quarter continue through the third and we further capitalize on right sizing capacity within the period with high July growth and negative September growth.For the first quarter in company history, air and third-party ancillaries combined to produce more revenue in the scheduled service line. There are many reasons for this including continued strength on bad performance, both online and at the airport and the best 3Q third-party revenue per passenger since 2013.All three pillars of third-party cobranded credit card, auto and hotel grew within the quarter. And we took home the Best Airline Co-branded Credit Card Award from the USA Today 10 best Readers Choice Awards, which is a huge honor for us and its program. Furthermore, we recently launched a bundled ancillaries, one of our revenue EBIT initiatives to provide additional ancillary runway. But it\u2019s far too early to comment on performance, I look forward to updating everyone at investor day.This ancillary performance was also matched with load factor expansion that improved with each month in the quarter, and I expect positive load factors to continue into the fourth. We will also begin to hit the MDA retirement comparison for growth in the fourth quarter which will create some monthly lumpiness and higher than typical growth rates.December is the first month for this and we will see growth rates close to 20%. Whereas the quarter as a whole would be between 8.5% and 9% year-over-year with lower ASM growth in the off-peak of October and early November. On a full-year basis, we have narrowed 2019 ASM guide towards the higher-end of the range and forecast growth of 8.5% to 8.9% year-over-year.As you may have noticed, we have removed system level RPMs and load factor from our releases. Non scheduled service flight in this section includes fixed fee as well as company ferry and repositioning flights. Those other flights are generally flown empty and provide no value in terms of RPM generation, fixed fee should be judged off the revenue generated as we are in the same whether five people or 105 for that flight.That being said, fixed fee revenues had a company record with nearly $20 million in revenue in the third quarter and continues the streak of incredible performance. The success would not be possible without the incredibly well run summer that our operations folks put together. Thank you for all your efforts and accomplishing this great milestone.And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Greg.\nGregory Anderson: Thanks Drew.To recap, the enterprise, including non-airline business units reported $44 million in net income for the September quarter for $2.70 in earnings per share, which is up nearly 190% versus a year ago. For the first nine months of the year, the enterprise has produced $10.54 in earnings per share, which is largely a result of our team members executing even better than initially planned across the organization.These improvements give us confidence to increase our full-year 2019 EPS range to $14.25 to $14.75. This is an increase of $0.50 per share from our original full-year 2019 guide communicated back in January, a meaningful improvement despite a $0.05 increase in full-year 2019 cost per gallon of fuel versus that original guide. As Maurice noted in his remarks, we are hitting on all cylinders and our customers are taking notice. During the third quarter Forbes named their best airlines to fly this fall.Allegiant was ranked number two. And as Drew mentioned, we were also recognized by USA Today's Reader Choice Award for having the number one airline co branded credit card. We are delighted about the recognition and the improvements we are seeing to our brand. The performance of the airline produced terrific financial results as well and operating margin of 17.9% during the third quarter, more than doubling last year's operating margin of 7.6%.This will be our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion, and since retiring our MDAD fleet late last year, we are certainly pleased with the airline's results and will remain focused on optimizing profitability. We reported airline unit costs during the third quarter down 5.6% versus a year ago.These results were better than our internal expectations and were again driven by our excellent operational performance. In addition, we are constantly drilling down in all areas throughout the organization, exploring ways to improve while maintaining cost discipline.Let me provide a couple examples that help lead to better than expected cost performance during the September quarter. Station cost, our station team had been facing pressure and increasing rates with service providers. This is largely due to stay competitive in markets because of the historically low unemployment rate. To better balance, our team has worked with our strategic suppliers on structure, which has allowed us to significantly offset these headwinds as we scale growth together.Additionally, the improved operations has resulted in lower overall costs related to interrupted trip expense and ground handling charges. In the quarter we saw fixation cost per departure decreased by almost 7% year-over-year. Another example is with our marketing costs, Scott DeAngelo and his team are continually optimizing their approach to drive decisions based on demonstrated impact at the market and the customer level.In lieu of casting a wide net, they are better utilizing customer data to be more surgical, reaching the right customers in the right market at the right time and thereby incurring less marketing spend while still receiving improved throughput.Marketing cost per passenger is down 11% versus last year. We are pleased with the trajectory of our 2019 cost performance. During our investor day back in 2016 and 2017, we provided in initial plans suggesting the airline would reduce its unit costs excluding fuel to $6.28 cents by 2020. We are happy to report we not only expect to meet this guide, but to beat it in 2019, a year ahead of schedule.Moving on to fuel, prices have moved around a bit during the quarter we paid $2.16 per gallon during this time with only one quarter remaining in the year and current prices in line with our full-year guide, we are maintaining our full-year fuel guide of $2.15, our fuel efficiency improvements continue to trend nicely as we saw year-over-year increase of 3.6% during the third quarter to 80 ASM per gallon. As such we tighten our full-year fuel efficiency guidance to the upper part of the range from 82.5 to 83 ASMs per gallon.Turning to our strong balance sheet, we ended up September quarter with total cash and investments of $442 million, which represents 25% of trailing 12-months total revenue. We have $1.35 billion in total debt and are deleveraging ahead of schedule as our debt-to-EBITDA is currently 2.8 turns and net debt-to-EBITDA is 1.9 turns. Our warehouse revolver at $81 million remains undrawn and we have increased our number of unencumbered aircraft since June 30 by four as we now have 30 unencumbered aircraft.Our ending third quarter blended interest rate was 4.8%, a decrease of nearly 17 basis points from the second quarter 2019 which was largely driven by reductions in LIBOR rates. Because of these reductions, we are reducing our full-year 2019 interest expense guidance to $70 million to $75 million. Looking to cash flow, the airline generated over $115 million of EBITDA during the quarter, an increase of 81.3% versus the same quarter last year.During the first nine months of the year, the airline has generated over $400 million of EBITDA, which equates to $4.8 million per aircraft. We are on pace to well exceed $500 million in EBITDA for the year for the first time in our company's history, and hit our 2019 target of $6 million in EBITDA per aircraft.Also during the third quarter we reinvested over $100 million back into the airline, purchasing three A320 aircraft in a spare CFM engine. We ended the quarter with 89 in service aircraft and are on pace to hit our year-end plan 93 in-service aircraft.We are adjusting down our full-year airline CapEx guidance by approximately $10 million and we are reducing our full-year heavy maintenance CapEx by $12.5 million. This reduction is largely due to better cost during engine maintenance events. Our efficiency in using and managing capital enables us to consistently return cash to our shareholders.During the quarter we paid our recurring quarterly dividend of $11 million and repurchased $14.7 million in outstanding shares, our remaining share repurchase authority is around $85 million. In regards to our non-airline initiative, we are decreasing our expected full-year $0.29 Sunseeker spend by $65 million. Our total expected project spend of $470 million remains unchanged. Included in this total is $25 million of pre-opening costs which are not capitalized.A small portion of these pre-opening costs have been expensed in this quarter\u2019s non-airline $5.2 million operating loss. Additionally, these pre-opening costs will continue to flow through the combined non-airline P&L until the opening of the resort, which is on track for the second quarter of 2021.Our family entertainment centers non-stop they continue to improve and we expect combined same-store results to produce positive EBITDA in full-year 2020. Finally, we continue to make progress towards the sale of [Camp] and are in discussions with multiple potential buyers. In closing, I'd like to add my many thanks to all of our hardworking team members as these outstanding results are attributed to their terrific effort day in and day out.And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavanthi Syth: And I think Greg, maybe a question for you, really good performance on the cost side. The full-year guide kind of tells, 4Q might be similar to maybe slightly lower year-over-year declines in the airline CASM-X just given the level of capacity growth in third quarter. I'm surprised how good third quarter was and maybe given the level of capacity growth in the fourth quarter, I am a little surprised that maybe you're not seeing more in the fourth quarter then?\nGregory Anderson: Yes, Savi. Thanks for the question. In the fourth quarter on the cost side really the headwinds we're going to face are around labor, we hired pilots or we started hiring pilots for our 2020 growth and so we've hired up to 100 pilots and so that's going to impact our fourth quarter and then in addition, profit sharing given the increase in profitability that also increases our profit sharing and so that that too is putting a drag on the quarter.Those are the major headwinds other than that we see, we do expect airline CASM-X for the fourth quarter to be down but not quite as down as much as the second or third quarter like you mentioned.\nSavanthi Syth: And just not looking for 2020 guidance or anything but just as we go into 2020, just any puts and takes that we should keep in mind and also the utilization that was kind of highlighted and how much it's improved on the kind of Airbus now that we have Airbus fleet any thoughts on just how much more that that can be pushed as well because I\u2019m guessing that is the big driver of the cost benefit as well?\nDrew Wells: Sure, I will take some of the utilization and Greg, if you want to back on. So I think as you look forward this year 2019 will be the top of utilization. I would expect the peak month like March, June, and July to remain elevated at or very near, kind of the upper ninth, almost 10 we were at. But you should see maybe close to a quarter hour, I would say if utilization come off into next year.\nGregory Anderson: Yes, and Savi on the cost side for 2020. As Chris mentioned, we have our investor day in a few weeks and plan to provide further guidance there. I would say that we're really excited about providing that guidance, we've drilled down our budget, and we're ready to go. We're at a high level or directionally, we fully expect to be under the guidance that we provided back in 2016 and 2017, that is $6.28. We expect to be under there on a cost side but I would kind of leave it at that and then we'll provide more detail in a few weeks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your question, please.\nJoseph DeNardi: Greg, can you just talk about you mentioned the, I think $6 million in EBITDA for plane goal in 2020. Can you just maybe share how many aircraft you're assuming and kind of run the fleet at the end of the year, next year? Thank you.\nGregory Anderson: Yes, so I think next year, the management presentations that we put out there have us up to about 103 aircraft by year-end on there so puts and takes to go on that. I think candidly, we expect to beat that by next year. We'll provide more detail on that at our upcoming investor day as far as the fleet plan is concerned. But what I would say we would expect to hit that $6 million per EBITDA per aircraft next year as well.\nJoseph DeNardi: And then Maurice, can you just talk about yes, just given kind of, it sounds you got some good momentum on the airline business in terms of when you got to make a decision maybe on Sunseeker 2.0. Should we assume that that\u2019s maybe a year or two down the road, or do you think you'd be in a position to say something, make a decision sooner? Thank you.\nMaurice Gallagher: On a macro basis, and we've always said we do it on performance, and I don't think we've changed our tune on that. Right now, we're certainly in the build phase. But, and John can comment in a moment here, but he's going to turn it loose and start doing advanced sale here in the next 30, 60 days.And that will tell the tale if it does really well, that's a data point. If it doesn't do as well as we liked. That's another data point. But with the data we put in there to-date, I can tell you, the board and myself are very excited having 150,000 people are there about that have specifically commented on rates, what they want for a product, size of rooms, lots of things we're doing again, we've stretched for years, we've talked directly to consumers for 18 years now we have this amazing amount of information.And we frankly didn't use it as well as we should have, until the last, I'd say 24 months, certainly 12. And but we're upping our game here. And you're seeing us able to go out and source information from folks give us data points. It's been a very, very positive thing. And so that data will drive decisions, unlike anything I know, I've had my history in this business as we go forward. So stay tuned. John?\nJohn Redmond: John, hi Joe we've always said that we're, we're very data driven, and we got an incredible group of people here that provide us that insight, so we can make very informed decisions based on this data. So even those 140,000 I mentioned to you we are talking to them about every aspect of what it is we want to do with the resort going forward. And I'll share a lot of detail around that is at the investor day, but just to give you an example, one of the data points these individuals provide us is how long they want to stay.So when you look at that the website, the length of stay that indicated is expressed in a range, but like one to three months or three to six months or four to six days like that. So if you take the midpoint of those ranges that people have selected as being, some barometer for what people will want on average in each of those ranges, we have to-date demand for almost 2 million room nights. Right, so that's pretty amazing. And again, we have somewhere between 250,000 and 280,000 room nights to sell on an annual basis.So demand is amazing. The board will react to that based on how the customer reacts when we put it on the market, but we're pretty excited because of that level of interest that we're seeing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Congrats on airline earnings. I don't want to steal any thunder from your event, but I wonder if you could just give us an update on the outlook for losses on the non-airline activities, if you have any update on the sale of Teesnap and specifically into next year. One of the things we're interested in is if all the Sunseeker expenses pre-opening expenses will continue to be capitalized, or if as we get to kind of the second half or later 2020 if you'd start to see some OpEx from Sunseeker?\nGregory Anderson: Duane, this is Greg, I'll kick it off. And then maybe John who want to provide some additional color, particularly on the Sunseeker side. As far as the non-airline cost loss that we saw this year, if we compare it to next year, I would think it'd probably be flat and why I would say that is Teesnap will likely not being in there for a full-year next year. And so that'll offset some of the perhaps increased pre-opening expenses that we could see with Sunseekers, we are nearing, getting near opening.As far as the pre-opening costs they're actually not capitalized in per se, they do run through the P&L. These are the pre-opening Sunseeker costs. And I just want to highlight that those are part of the $470 million all-in costs. But with that, I don't know if there's anything John, you want to add or?\nJohn Redmond: No, I think it's helpful just to emphasize it with those pre-opening are not capitalized, their expense, which is why between now and opening, you'll continue to see that. Just to give you some thoughts in that regard, we have $25 million we've mentioned is in the Sunseeker pre-opening, a few million of that will be spent has been spent to date throughout the rest of this year, of course, the balance of that will be in 2020 and 2021. And a lot of it, of course happens right before you open the resort and you start bringing on the greatest number of employees at that point in time.So, again, it's part of the $470 million but that amount is expensed until we open, I guess the only Sunseeker OpEx you would see is a small amount that relates to the golf course that we have there. It's a de-minimis amount and that's all you would see there.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then just for my follow-up, given the success you're having in flexing up utilization. Does it change your thinking at all regarding how far you can push it, and the types of markets you can serve? Thanks for taking the questions.\nDrew Wells: Yes, Duane, this is Drew and I think what you'll see is, is as the year combined and you'll see this as soon as 2020 kind of continuing to flex utilization, different directions. So we were very happy with how the peak month reacted to the nearly 10 hours of utilization, we'll see that again next year with increased fleet growth. So pushing those even harder but we know the demand doesn't exist as you get to late January as you get in September and there's really no reason to start to push those any higher and in fact want to pull those back.So we're not changing our mentality of markets who want to operate, we'll be able to and a lot of it is because of the power of Airbus fly a bit more on off peak days particularly Saturdays on the East Coast. But our mindset is still the same that is what route mix works and scheduling to profitability like we always have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker of Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: I have two questions. My first question is on, I guess on your unbundling initiatives, like when -- is there a point? I guess there's Part A and Part B, is there a point at which they would reach maturity? And at that point, what would the like what would the contribution be expected to be like how much opportunity is there I guess?\nDrew Wells: Yes, so it\u2019s Drew. And we've forecasted the bundle ancillary to be worth between $1 and $1.25 per passenger. I have seen nothing that makes me move off that early on. This should hit maturity far faster than say the roundtrip discounted, this is probably kind of a six to nine month run up, I would think to kind of hit that given the booking curve and just hitting the right kind of product mix and pricing.\nHelane Becker: Okay, so could it like get to $2?\nDrew Wells: I think maturity we're talking $1 to $1.25 there could be well that beyond but I think that's the mature run rate, surely not what we're hitting in week two.\nHelane Becker: And then my other question completely unrelated and off topic. There have been a lot of companies that have gone bankrupt in the past year a lot of airlines that have gone bankrupt and there have been a lot of aircraft, used aircraft and Maurice, that's always been your sweet spot, finding attractive, fully priced used aircraft. Do you have that opportunity now, would you consider more or faster growth, if you could get good aircraft into the network in a timely fashion in a timely manner but in a timely fashion?\nMaurice Gallagher: No, we've pretty well set ourselves as a corporate goal of a year 10%, if you know a couple of show up that'd be interesting we could certainly absorb those. The other thing that we do real well now is our fix the flying, so we can absorb airplanes and we have the pilots which we're going to be in good enough shape, you put those on in September and we're doing very well as the number show do for the Q3.BJ is here I don't think we're going to see any big opportunities for airplanes, maybe somebody goes bust and like but did we take advantage of the end of the year Berlin or anything like that?\nDrew Wells: Yes, handful of aircraft coming in next year from those situations.\nMaurice Gallagher: Okay. I think what it did do for us is it move forward our ability in the next year to two years to fill in, what we want to do and we're pretty well incept through next year and into 2021, for the most part are we?\nDrew Wells: Yes, that and then I would just add that there's lead times from parts and kits and other things in order to transition into the FAA any more quickly than we are.\nMaurice Gallagher: It is not an easy task coordinating all the pieces, because we're also modifying these typically the 186 seats. There's this module you have to do an FAA standardization kits for my Airbus particular each serial number.So it's, as I mentioned in my comments, it's a very involved process. And the team here is we've done this consistently since 2001. And we're very good at it, B.J. and all of our team is home grown to I might add all the guys who work with him. That's real win-win for everything we do this airplane stuff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nHunter Keay: Hi, correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But I thought I saw a report where Michael said you guys need to hire 1000 people for Sunseeker, I thought originally said 500 people feel free to correct that. But the real question is, how are you going to find these people because obviously have to be nice and they have to be service oriented. And it's a tight job market down there. So, can you talk to me about how this might be a long pole in the tent. How you're thinking about it, thanks.\nJohn Redmond: Well, we never, hi Hunter this is John. We never underestimate the challenges it takes to hire significant numbers of people. So I don't want to sit here and say that, it's a slam dunk. Having said that, I have also been around long enough where we will be the employer of choice in Southwest Florida. There's no doubt about it. There is no one down there that offers the benefit packages and the like that we will offer down in that market, we've done a lot of homework down there Mike and the team down there.We're comfortable, we're going to be able to do this. We know it's there's some challenges associated with it. But we're getting demand already. We talked to people, people are coming to our website. There's a lot of hospitality in the Southwest Florida market. And I think that people who are going to be more concerned are the existing operators, right?Because if you're working at one of these fine resorts that are down there, and you want a better place to work, just because of the volume of people, the benefits that we're going to offer, you're going to leave and that's no different than even used to happen here in Las Vegas, when the new property would open.Everyone would leave from the old because they want to be with the newest. And, of course, in our case, the best. So we know there's a challenge but it doesn't bother us, it just means we have to work a little bit harder. And we're up to that challenge.\nMaurice Gallagher: Hunter, as an observer of this for the last 25 years. Remember, when Bellagio opened up 9,000 people, they opened the doors. And it happened seamlessly, this town and the people that are coming from this town are used to doing this stuff. It's just part of the background and abilities and their challenges, as John said, but there is a high degree of comfort that the anticipation, the training, all that stuff has all been planned out.\nJohn Redmond: Yes, it's a very established market down there as all of us know whether it's from Naples, all the way north of Sarasota. There's wonderful hotels, wonderful restaurants. And all we have to do is attract people from those existing locations. So it's not like a huge training effort. We're going to find the best and brightest out of all those properties and we look forward to it.\nHunter Keay: So that's and follow-up this is on the same topic. Are you going to use a third-party to help you recruit, are you going to rely on word of mouth? And what sort of personality traits you\u2019re looking for looking to, for people that are experiencing for, people that are energetic and are you mainly looking to hire from the existing hospitality pool?I don't know just kind of curious how you're thinking about the type of people you're going to recruit and that you want work in representing it.\nJohn Redmond: Right, you love people who are in the service sector, right? That you could actually fly people who work at RSW Airport, I mean host people do some of the best jobs around and dealing with people. So it's not necessarily only those that come out of food and beverage or a hotel environment, we fully expect to get a significant number of those people, but we don't think we're going to have to hire, third-parties to do any of this for us.We have the internal resources on our own HR department here. So whether it's traditional job fairs or other approaches we will take, we are very comfortable about that, so the incredible level of excitement down there about the resort, a huge awareness of the brand and every time I'm down there and course our key people are already done, they're living there, I mean they're down living there, there and we have preview centers open, so there's a huge level of interest already come and see this, see the resort.\nMaurice Gallagher: By the way, one other thing Hunter, when you've got five, six, seven, nine, storeys in the next few months, there's not going to be a bigger advertising billboards around about what's going on. And 40,000 people a day drive past this place. So there's no secret about what's going to happen and the awareness factor even I don't do that as much as John but I joke that John they could, they could make him King down there. I mean, the impact we've had in that area, on the jobs, the economic it's incredibly beneficial to both parties, which is the way things should be win-win.So people are going to know about this place to John's point is going to be the happening place in the area.\nJohn Redmond: I'll give you one data point that I think you'll find pretty interesting. We just hired a person into a title called Reservations Manager. We had 30 applications for that one position, right. So that's just an example of what we're going to see for most of not all physicians we're going to have. And that's the experience that all of us have seen throughout our career.\nHunter Keay: Okay, thank you, John.\nJohn Redmond: Thanks.\nMaurice Gallagher: My theme in my comments is that you got a pretty good management team sitting on this side of the phone call, and that we've been down these roads before, we've done these things. And we've anticipated these problems and one of the things you pay management for, is to deal with problems and there's going to be issues and things are going to happen but this group that's running this place are world class professionals, and I don't Imagine this is going to anything's going to come up that they haven't seen before and haven't probably anticipated angle won\u2019t react appropriately. So we\u2019re really excited as we said in our comments about the quality of the group running the show here and people executing themselves anyway.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O'Brien: A question is on the EPS guidance my apologies for missing an obvious answer have sequential numbers here yet. But on the higher EPS it looks like you know is that really just kind of baking in the performance year-to-date or is that something is gone better in your 4Q outlook because we don\u2019t have quarterly guidance from you guys anymore any help that will be great? Thanks.\nGregory Anderson: Cathy, thanks for the question it\u2019s Greg. I think what \u2013 more alluded to mentioned and Drew also on his remarks said \u2013 on the revenue side it was fixed fee that\u2019s coming in of much stronger than what we had initially budgeted. Hope throughout the year cost have continued to come in much better. So that\u2019s been a very nice upside as well. But with that I mean revenue has been a nice story. And so I think it will be good jump in and talk about that.\nDrew Wells: Yes I mean I think kind of across the board fixed fee again with the record and third quarter that previously fourth quarter last year so it continues to turnout incredible results with the operation performing as well it did open a lot of opportunities. We have hit point with fixed fee where we\u2019re inserting their probabilities of success into the scheduling process to ensure that they're getting the space need to maximize what they can do.I think the other thing worth noting here is a third-party that we called out all three between cobrand, auto and hotel with great jumps year-over-year that would have exceeded the expectations though. So very enthused by all that.\nMaurice Gallagher: Yeah couple other points the Airbus is just much superior part to the MPs. So we got a lot of excess Airbus come September it\u2019s not your time for us and it\u2019s very much in demand. And to be fair while we\u2019re pretty good and very happy with what we're doing. We are also benefiting from the MAX capacity from the Southwest and United particularly in DoD. They just don\u2019t \u2013 they haven\u2019t been this year they might been in past years or maybe next year.So we had to qualify it somewhat but we\u2019ve been able to pick up the slack very nicely because of our timing having the airplanes and the quality of the airplane has been very much appreciated by our customers.\nCatherine O'Brien: May this one quick clarify one before I ask my second question Maury you meant benefitting on the fixed fee side right or are you making an overall comment on your RASM growth this year?\nMaurice Gallagher: No this is fixed fee I was talking about.\nCatherine O'Brien: And then on Drew one favor, Drew does you know solid RASM performance here notice there was kind of mix just with fare revenue down bit and yeah really the ancillaries showing strong growth. Is that an intention switch as you kind of turning on some of the new ancillaries buckets or was that fare performance really just like industry level driven? Thanks so much.\nMaurice Gallagher: Yeah so there is couple of factors there remember back 4Q last we shifted this PCB in the fare. So that\u2019s still in the affects we still see a small effect of that next quarter maybe a little bit in 1Q before we complete last set. But also as the area and claim the third-party combine and continue to creep up it\u2019s been best interest to drop fare where appropriate and build that load in order to capture that ancillary. So I think there is mixture of kind of both pieces there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg: I guess this question is just to Maury and it just sort of speaking longer term when I look at the profitability of your airline. I mean its numbers are good they are very good, they are industry-leading and I sort of think about moving to the Airbus platform, improving your operations. But I think market selection is also big part of it and the fact that 75% of your city payers it\u2019s basically just you guys. And so when I think about your mouth sort of the width of that mouth that\u2019s a big part of it.As we think out over the next 3 to 5 years and we see everybody sort of clamoring for new markets and competition sort of picking up you look at growth plans and the like. Like what is that percentage look like 3 to 5 years from now like how many more you know sort of call it Fort Collins to Las Vegas routes you know are out there and if we fast forward 3 to 5 years. Do we see similar call it 75% market city pairs where you\u2019re the only game in town, just thoughts on that Maury? Thank you.\nMaurice Gallagher: Well you're asking the wrong Michael I take all my direction from Drew and team they have prepared a long list of people who have picked routes over many years. So we\u2019re up to 490.\nDrew Wells: 470 give or take.\nMaurice Gallagher: 470 yeah I didn\u2019t know my routes but let Drew talk about that.\nDrew Wells: Yes Michael we called out in the past over 600,000 incremental routes of those we believe it\u2019s roughly 10% that are actually competitive. So I think at worse we can keep levels where we are today and under more likely Airbus scenario we can actually grow the number of noncompetitive routes that we operate. So we think we\u2019re well poised to not just stay but even \u2013 more so into the future.\nMaurice Gallagher: Yes, we\u2019re doing things \u2013 yeah Michael we\u2019re doing things that frankly number of years ago I don't think we would have thought. You\u2019re seeing travel trends change, things that are interesting we\u2019re in the early days where we really small city, mid level cities and some of the things there is just the evolution of where people want to go. We\u2019re also I think teaching people how to go other places to with some of the stuff that these guys experiment with and play with.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes, that\u2019s one of the reason I sort of through Fort Collins out there as well I think you are going back into that market, and I think that\u2019s going to be what an air traffic control operation that\u2019s remote right that\u2019s there's nobody there. You\u2019ll be able to be fly in and out so the airport cost are probably clear out?\nMaurice Gallagher: Yeah we have to get the ATC issues are still bugging us a little bit but yeah we are fully pulling in going in there very shortly?\nMichael Linenberg: Just one other and this would be to the team where are you guys with respect to pilot turn over. And I suspect that historically it's actually been pretty low for you guys. But we see the numbers of retirement this valley that the majors we know that they\u2019re really start to higher. They are pulling from all over the place are you guys are you seeing anything there or is there anything in place that are keeping your guys there for the longer-term any thoughts on that? Thank you.\nGregoryAnderson: Michael, it\u2019s Greg. No, what we see about 5% we see about 5% attrition rate and its nothing that stepped up here or there I mean it just it's been pretty level. One thing we do have in our airline its unique as we have a great quality of life for our pilots meaning they are out and back every day. And so our crewmembers and our pilots in particular I think they really appreciate that and so it's been a nice recruiting tool but kind of retention tool as well for us in Allegiant.\nMichael Linenberg: Just one quick one on that how quickly can a new pilot at Allegiant get to captain is that three, four years can it actually be that quick?\nScott Sheldon: Michael, this is Scott, new hire FOs is about 70 days of course right see and my guess at this point given the trajectory you're probably two and a half years into LLC thereafter.\nMichael Linenberg: Oh well, well okay there you go all right that\u2019s great to know thanks guys. Thanks everyone see you in November.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Wisniewski of Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatthew Wisniewski: I wanted to come back to the utilization and just really make sure I understand that. It's been a lot higher than it has been what kind of flexibility do you have around that and I think you said is coming down next year. But what kind of you know if markets are turn out a little bit better than anticipated or demand kind of weakens. Does that give you greater flexibility than you\u2019ve had in the past?\nMaurice Gallagher: Absolutely I mean one of things we always pride ourselves upon is our flexibility and the Airbus has only grown what we are able to do. And primarily to the upside it very easy to bring the MD-80 down, and we showcase that again this year that with the Airbus we are still lowering to bring it down under five hours day in September. You never would have seen us do 10 hours and in June, July, March with the MD-80.So we have even more flexibility today than we use to and we\u2019re going to continue to push the bounds both on the high-end and low-end. One thing about the September you can't just manufacture demand and the week superior. And so you're not going to see us push very high there but anywhere else we will continue to push and pull and try to find the right mix.\nScott Sheldon: Matt one other thing is kind of very low - on lower breakeven point, particularly around fuel and what's the ratio do with dollar?\nMatthew Wisniewski: I think a dollar a gallon, yes.\nScott Sheldon: A dollar a gallon better so that lets you fly down the curve more to less dense markets and or weaker yield markets that you otherwise wouldn't have thought of doing with the 80s. So that flexibility to go kind of deeper into a Wednesday perhaps or a Saturday depending again regionally where you're talking. That's just the benefits of the airplane.\nMatthew Wisniewski: Okay, great. And a kind of similar lines, if I look at cost next year perspectival that you probably not going to guide or anything, but I know if the utilization potentially comes down a little bit and then it looks like gauges coming up, what other things should we keep in mind just as far as they could be impactful to the cost outlook next year?\nMaurice Gallagher: Yes, Matt, I think just at a high level the headwind for next year would likely be ownership. So I think is - we continue to take motors and run them through our differed maintenance program, which we're capitalizing and differing. I am just starting to see depreciation spike up a little bit. But I mean, I say that cautiously. It's not too meaningful, but I think honestly that's one of the biggest headwinds we'll face.I would say some tailwinds, continue to perform while operationally. I mean, we expect that. And so that's been a nice tailwind this year, we hope to see that moving forward next year. I'd want to say marketing as well.What Scott DeAngelo and his team, if they've put some investment in our digital commerce. And so what that means is we're seeing a higher conversion rate and so we're then able to take our marketing spend down significantly because of that. And as you probably noted that we signed up to sponsor the, what is called now the Allegiant stadium, but we signed that up and we're able to keep that line item flat down because of the terrific investment that Scott DeAngelo on his team have made into the digital e-commerce world.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Maury, I would imagine the performance from your credit card has maybe wildly exceeded your expectations. So how do you ensure that you maximize the value from that business line? I think you guys broke out the revenue per PAX for the first time this quarter. What can that reasonably get to in three to four years, do you think?\nMaurice Gallagher: Well, I'll make one comment and then turn it over to the guy, who really understands it. We haven't - it's not wildly exceeding. We made this forecast four years ago and we're going to pretty much come pretty damn close to it, near as I can tell. So, we expect a lot out of the card and Scott and his team had taken ownership of it over the last couple of years, and Scott?\nScott Sheldon: Yes, you bet and thanks Joe for the question. You know, we'll go into this in a little more depth at Investor Day, but right now what I can tell you is, if you look at our new cardholders tying up growth, right? It's about as straight as you can draw a line without a ruler. We have actually accelerated new card signup so we're nowhere close to plateauing. That doesn't answer your question when it can end, but I can tell you it'll go linear for at least the foreseeable next couple of years.The other tailwind we get is both by pre-negotiate and then potentially extensions of our current agreement, which help on those variable parts of the contract, right. We get paid for signing up a new card holder, but we also get paid a variable percent of what they spend.So as we aggressively kind of address both of those cardholder acquisition, cardholder retention and spin, as those parts go up, right, we get kind of even an acceleration, and so we'll go into that in more detail, but suffice it to say, I see a pretty linear growth for the next two to three years at the very least.\nJoseph DeNardi: And then just on the stadium deals, I would just kind of curious, given that the network seems to have pivoted away from Vegas a little bit and it wasn't - I mean the headline numbers suggest that it wasn't cheap I guess, but can you explain kind of the rationale for doing that and is there a credit card tie into that at all. Thank you.\nScott Sheldon: Yes. So there's not a credit card tie in, but real quick the rationale three big things in this order. The first is awareness and it's not even so much the 42 million visitors that will drive by or fly over here in Las Vegas. It's the tens of millions, and then when you replayed games episodes on ESPN, the billion of viewers that will see it across the nation and the power of the NFL upon set, I like to throw out that, there is always a head scratch or 46 out of the top 50 television programs last year were NFL games. Right. So it gets it that national exposure live from Las Vegas.The other two real quickly will be getting into sports travel. So not only will it be a name on the side of the stadium that's called out by Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth on Sunday night, but also we will sell tickets and travel packages to fly, stay and actually attend events at Allegiant stadium.And the last that, isn't necessarily get the smallest, the B2B relationships. Right. I can't names because they haven't all been publicly disclosed, but big brewing companies, big soda companies, other like food and beverage providers have all reached out not just for promotional opportunities, but think about our airlines buy on board program, certainly Sunseeker and these relationships that started around something like the stadium that can get up to preferred deals on all of these things to reduce cost become a real big part of it that not a lot of people talk about, but now as being kind of the flagship of one of the most recognizable stadium - we have everyone from auto manufacturers to the upper mentioned companies calling us and wanting to discuss how we can do business together. So that becomes a benefit too.\nMaurice Gallagher: Why don't you call that Scott on the impressions we saw literally within a week, the newest factor?\nScott Sheldon: Yes. And I know that the obscure marketing stock price all the marketing advertising we do in a year generates about 4 billion of the impression. After the announcement August [5], within 24 hours, we were about three quarters of a billion impression then and kind of now several months later we are already at 2 billion plus impressions. So about half of what we spend on in a year was accomplished simply by the announcement and the media coverage.And the last comment about this it's great to throw impressions out there the question is well, are your customers or your prospective customers actually consuming them? One of the things that went into this was the knowledge that two-thirds of Allegiant customers and/or non-customers from the Allegiant market were avid NFL fans. That was more than double the national average.So the fact that we're throwing on a lot of impressions out there via coverage in association with the NFL, and our customer perspective, customer base consumes the NFL and droves was the match we were looking for.\nMaurice Gallagher: You know, not to keep pushing on this issue Scott, it might be helpful to use to launch and let them know immediately after all that top off and whatnot the increase in traffic to the website.\nScott Sheldon: Yes. Sure. So one of the things, Greg diluted to all these, we put a lot of science between the relationships between things we do, whether it's TV, advertising, email, you know, big events and how that impact visitation to our website. One of those postulates we usually don't relate, but when we do new route announcements, we typically would see 20% to 25% year-over-year increase in website visitors, right. Newsfeeds all over the country come on and hey Allegiant entering your market, flying to a new place.The week after the stadium announcement, incidentally, we had new route announcement. They were at 35% to a full 10 percentage points higher than our typical and not only what that for that day, it actually lasted for the following date. And the point there is simply that we don't believe that having Allegiant stadium in and of itself does anything other than that. It makes Allegiant top of mind, sets that when you see that TV ads, when you get that email, when you see that new route, right, there is some fraction. It's not double, it to the terminals 5 to 10 bps of impact across everything we do and we easily hit right our mid to aggressive hurdle rate for what this investment needs to return for us.\nOperator: At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Maurice Gallagher for closing remarks. Sir?\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you all very much. Appreciate your time and interest, go get on your typewriters and started writing. You're busy.

Finally, we are planning on having our Investor Day in Las Vegas on Wednesday, November 13. I will send out more information regarding this as we get closer. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Maury.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you again for joining us again this quarter. We had another excellent quarter, our 66th consecutive profitable quarter. Our operational and financial performances continue to shine. We're seeing the benefit of our transition to an all-Airbus fleet. We have also upped the bottom end of our EPS guidance to $13.50 per share. And this range represents at a minimum a 35% increase in our earnings this year compared to 2018. We led the industry in overall completion again in Q2 as we did in Q1. The last major component of our reliability push has been for our operational performance in our peak periods to match our off-peak performance, and I'm happy to say we have accomplished this goal. During Q2 this year, we had only 16 maintenance cancellations compared to 129 last year. This represents a 99.9% controllable completion factor and an 88% reduction year-over-year. Moreover, so far in July, we have had only three mechanicals on almost 8,800 flights month-to-date versus the over 80 maintenance cancellations at this time -- the same time this last year. In our operational performance in the past 24 months, we've benefited not only from our reputation but also our financial results. And to that end, we estimated our improved operations in Q2 same just over $7 million in interrupted trip expense. I knew you -- we would appreciate the return to a single, more modern fleet. We're only -- the only carrier in the United States in the past many years that has so radically changed their company. And even while we were in transition, we were able to generate industry-leading operating margins with our previous mix of Airbus and MDs. Our projections over the past couple of years has suggested we would be able to improve these margins when we completed the changeover. But now that we're here, it's nice to actually see the -- experience the upside. Productivity in this newer generation aircraft is proving to be all we had hoped for with respect to both reliability and profitability. While the capital outlay for an Airbus is certainly greater than we paid for our MDs, the increased cost has more than offset the fuel burn savings and the additional 20 seats in the A320. Our model of the past 20 years of low utilization and low cost focused on leisure customers is alive and well, only now we are stronger and more resilient. The past 2 quarters increase in margins has been driven by our changeover. And practically, we are still in our transition. Our fleet at the end of the year was reduced to 76 from 96 aircraft at this time last year. And while we have -- we'll add 17 aircraft during the year, we needed to ask more of our limited number of planes in the first half of the year if we wanted to grow. Last year, during the first 2 quarters, we averaged just over 7 hours per day. While this year, the average has been closer to 8.6 hours, that's an 18% increase in our daily utilization, our year-over-year for the first 6 months. But in March and June this year, we flew 9.7 hours per day in both months. While last year was 8.3 and 7.8 per day, respectively. We grew capacity 13.4% in Q2 with substantially fewer aircraft than we had last year during the same period. Reason I've delved so much into this detail is to relate to you the impact of this change. We're learning to \"manage our fleet,\" learning how much upside we can extract and still be additive to our bottom line, particularly during our peak months, which was so important to us. This almost 20% increase in utilization this year during Q1 and Q2 and 25% in March and June was extremely accretive. We have more flexibility economically to operate this aircraft at the edges. We can do more on a Wednesday or a Saturday, earlier in the morning, later in the evening. This is how we're able to operate close to 10 hours a day in March and June. But we're still learning how far we can push the schedule. In hindsight, we overplayed our hand a bit in early April. With too much capacity in the extended Easter break period, the extra 3 weeks this year do not have the demand particularly in the first 10 days of the month. But even with this capacity missed, overall, the outcome was accretive. Frankly, comparisons to 2018 metrics are not as meaningful given the structural changes we have undergone this year. As an example, if you review the fuel gallons consumed on our 6 months financial statistical summary in the release, you'll notice we consumed virtually the same amount of gallons year-over-year yet we produced an additional 600,000 passengers on 4,400 flights with 9 fewer aircraft and generated over $81 million of incremental revenue. Our total fuel expense actually declined almost $9 million year-over-year because of the $0.10 decline in our cost per gallon. On the ownership front, we spent an additional $16 million in D&A to generate this incremental $81 million of revenue. Other expenses such as labor stations, marketing -- and marketing increased to corresponding rates but while maintenance was flat year-over-year, another benefit of this aircraft. Bottom line, we traded increased ownership for an ability to generate substantially more revenue in our first two quarters. Critical reasons for these improvements in our ability to execute include, one, the aircraft is just more reliable. We're able to reliably increase utilization of this aircraft as we've demonstrated in the past 6 months. Two, we're better at what we're doing. Just because the aircraft is better once -- still have us operate it and our internal improvements over the past 24 months have been impressive. Scott will touch more on that. Today, we are one of the best in the industry in providing reliable operations, particularly now during our peak period. My head is off to our team for their great efforts in this area. The third area is the fuel burn. The increased productivity of this aircraft is self-evident. As I said earlier, we burned virtually the same amount of fuel for 4,400 additional departures and over 600,000 additional passengers during the past 6 months. Lastly, we'd become just more efficient in our cost structure, particularly with our pilot productivity. The transition teams are past. The one-off expenses associated with the move to our Airbus fleet are behind us. I'm happy to say this transition has enhanced our model, as I said earlier. We're having a better ability to peak up for our critical peak months while still maintaining our historic low utilization in our shoulder months. This coming September, where our plan is to average 4 hours a day, our traditional schedule in this off period. Going forward, the combination of our improved operations, particularly in peak months and the enhanced flexibility this fleet provides, are going to be fun to watch. Our goal is to hold the high ground when it comes to financial performance in the coming years. And now that we are through the rough patches of the past 2 to 3 years, this looks very doable. Lastly, I want to thank our 4,000-plus team members for all their efforts during this difficult transition. I know I speak for all in the management team when I say thank you. You're a difference maker, so let's keep it up. Scott?\nScott Sheldon: Yes. Thank you, Maury, and good afternoon, everyone. As Maury alluded to in his opening comments, we continue to be incredibly pleased with our performance, particularly in the second quarter and the progress we're making within every operating group. What make these results particularly unique is how we flex the model during the quarter, namely how we schedule the airline, how we deployed our fleet, how we spared the airline and increased overall customer service levels during what has traditionally been the most challenging period throughout the year. Before I jump into the 2Q op results, I want to take a quick second and just highlight what this organization and in particular, this operations team, has accomplished since they were put in place 24 months ago. As many of you may recall, our -- the second quarter of 2017 was our operational performance low point. We've just completed the quarter with over 800 -- 480 cancellations, 425 of which being maintenance related. Our completion factor was 98%, which is nearly last in the industry. Our regular ops cost for the quarter were over $20 million and accelerating. We had negatively impacted over 4% of our customer base and our on-time performance was 69%. On a trailing 12-month basis, our regular ops cost were in excess of $55 million and churning in the wrong direction. Results that are not only putting tremendous cost pressure -- or excuse me, tremendous pressure on our cost structure and our team members' ability to execute, but we're inflicting long-term damage to the Allegiant brand. Fast-forward to the second quarter of '19 results and what a difference 24 months makes. From our second quarter '17 low point, we ended second quarter '19 with just 18 controllable cancellations as compared to 449 and 156 cancellations in 2017 and '18, respectively. A dramatic improvement over a 2-year period considering we grew departures by over 24%. Our completion factor improved -- has improved 0.4 points to 99.6% year-over-year and over 1.6 points since 2Q of '17. And as Maury indicated in his opening comments, we have led the industry in completion factor for all of 2019 and 16 of the past 18 months. A direct byproduct of being able to complete our daily flying schedule is our ability to drive on-time performance, improve customer satisfaction or our Net Promoter Score and most importantly, drive unnecessary costs out of the organization. Our second quarter A14 performance has increased 2.8 points year-over-year to 77.7% and over 8 points from two years prior, which has resulted in substantial improvements to our Net Promoter Score, which is over -- which is up over 8 points year-over-year. The number of customers impacted by core ops improved 0.6 points to just over 1% of our flying capacity and has allowed us to pull over $7 million in a regular ops cost out of the business. On a trailing 12-month basis, our regular ops cost were down over $27 million and we still have a number of areas where we can improve. Looking into the back half of the year, and I know I speak for Maury and John and the rest of the management team, we're excited with the strength of the business and the trajectory of our operations, particularly in improvements in predictive maintenance. Our month-to-date July results have seen dramatic improvement year-over-year and our momentum from June has continued into what should be a record-setting third quarter. And lastly, I want to thank all of our team members, service providers and partners throughout the network for the tremendous job they do every day. The results have been nothing less than impressive. And with that, I'll turn it over to Drew.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. While second quarter TRASM was down 1.6% on a 13.6% increase in ASM, primarily driven by over 22% growth in the weeks leading up to Easter, the May performance was traveling plus 2.4% on 11% ASM and the June performance of plus 1.2% on 13.5% ASM, which is different from the earnings release due to moving a one-time $750,000 contra revenue was solid considering the utilization and general growth. The momentum continues into July, and the month is on track to finish higher than the adjusted 1.2% we saw in June. That said, we don't manage the business to maximizing unit revenue, but to drive higher earnings, which we were successful in doing. In one of the total company efforts, we were successful in creating more profitability through increased utilization of the aircraft in 3 ways. First, while off-peak days a week grew nearly 22% in the quarter, after normalizing for fuel price differences, that growth contributed an incremental $15 million of earnings versus last year, more than half of which came in June when we had 9.7 hours of utilization like Maury mentioned. Second, we were able to increase utilization on peak days a week by over 20% in June and still drive a unit revenue increase on those days of 2 1/4. Finally, the combination of the Airbus aircraft and the incredible operational performance we've exhibited opened up significant opportunities on the fixed fee side that enabled us to grow that line by 63% versus last year. Our planning methodology has remained consistent as we continue to learn how we powerful -- how powerful and highly reliable all Airbus fleet can be for us. In order to achieve margins in the 20s, each hour of planes base is extremely valuable. And to that end, we continue to schedule the profitability thresholds. Our success in deploying continually profitable flying even with elevated utilization rates gives us confidence to continue to push where appropriate. It also means remaining flexible to pull down capacity in the weaker demand periods. This is exemplified in the third quarter as we will grow July ASMs by 13% to 14% while September will actually be negative. This combines for a total quarter ASM growth rate between 5% and 7%. In terms of the full year, we have narrowed our ASM guide toward the midpoint to 8% to 9% year-over-year. With July likely to be our seventh consecutive month with air ancillary greater than $50 per passenger, the downward trend in load factors was obviously suboptimal. And while our expectation for the second year of the revenue management system was driving incremental yields, our revenue dynamic has shifted. As the split has converged on 50-50 air versus ancillary, the RM system is reoptimizing around a higher ancillary base and prioritizing load factor in order to achieve the benefits of that. I expect our load factor to flip put positive in July and throughout the third quarter, which coupled with the ASM cadence, sets us up extremely well to continue expanding upon our industry-leading margins. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Greg.\nGregory Anderson: Thank you, Drew, and good afternoon to everyone. And as Maury noted in his remarks, the airline has gone through a radical change over the past years with the outcome being a brand-new airline equipped to better optimize both operational and financial performance. We are proud to report the airline expanded its year-over-year 2Q operating margin by more than 6 percentage points from 17.5% to just under 24% and posted earnings per share of $4.81, an increase of 50% year-over-year and the second highest quarterly EPS in our company's history. Our second quarter costs were significantly better than unexpected. Unit cost excluding fuel decreased by over 6% year-over-year, which was largely driven by our outstanding operations, namely combined cost improvements from within our maintenance and supply chain areas, improved pilot productivity and lower irregular operational costs. In fact, with the exception of depreciation, each one of the cost line items for the airline decreased on a unitized basis year-over-year. This result gives us increased confidence in our full year airline CASM outlook, and we are both improving our guidance and tightening the range. Our previous range was down 3.5% to down 1.5%. We are currently guiding down 4% to down 3%. We believe the operational efficiencies we experienced during the second quarter are here to stay. By way of example, our pilot productivity, as measured in 8 block hours, continues to trend nicely in their 65% productivity compared to the 51% productivity at the peak of our inefficiency. Maintaining cost discipline is a key focus, and we expect continued improvements on this front. Moving on to fuel. Prices have decreased since around this last -- around this time last quarter with the reduction in Brent Crude oil of 13.5%. With this significant move in oil, we are reducing our full year assumption for fuel cost per gallon from $2.26 to do $2.15. Our fuel efficiency improvements continue to outperform as we saw year-over-year increase of 8% during the second quarter to 82.3 ASM per gallon. As such, we increased our full year fuel efficiency guidance by 0.5 point to 82.5% ASMs per gallon, an increase of nearly 6% for the full year. Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended the June quarter with total cash and investments of $695 million and $1.5 billion in total debt. Earlier this month, we paid off the stub on a high-yield bond of just over $100 million, reducing both our cash and debt balances by the same amount. Turning to second quarter. We refinanced 23 of our older A319 aircraft with the net proceeds of over $100 million and a reduction in margin by 40 basis points. This was a refinancing on aircraft that currently had debt balances on them and did not include any of our existing unencumbered aircraft. While we don't expect to raise any incremental debt in the near term, we continue to maintain sufficient dry powder through our 26 unencumbered aircraft and $81 million available in our undrawn revolver. Currently, our leverage is 3.2 turns debt-to-EBITDA and a comfortable 1.8 turns of net debt-to-EBITDA. We believe the high point of our leverage is behind us as we expect to continue to delever through quickly amortizing aircraft debt and expecting to increase EBITDA. Our increasing EBITDA supported by our aircraft growth as we generated approximately $3.5 million of EBITDA per aircraft during the first 6 months of 2019. During the second quarter, we placed 2 A320 series aircraft into service, bringing our total in-service aircraft to 86. We also purchased 3 A320s, which are scheduled for revenue service during the third quarter, and we expect to end the year with 93 in-service aircraft. In addition to the 3 aircraft purchased during the second quarter, we also acquired 3 spare CFM engines. These combined purchases constituted the majority of our $100 million in airline CapEx during the quarter. We are adjusting our full year airline CapEx guidance down by around $17 million to reflect lower-than-expected actual purchase price of used aircraft based on their maintenance status of delivery. We are also reducing the midpoint of our full year Sunseeker CapEx by approximately $110 million. This reduction simply represents the timing shift via quarter from the fourth quarter of 2019 into the first quarter of 2020. The total project CapEx is unchanged. In regards to other -- on the airline initiatives, you may have noticed in our release, we are evaluating strategic alternatives for Teesnap. Teesnap's all-encompassing golf course software solution is cutting-edge and has been a disruptor in the golf industry from its beginnings nearly 5 years ago. Since that time, Teesnap has signed up 600 golf courses in 49 states and has nearly 718 members continued to capture market share in a competitive landscape. We are very proud of the tremendous growth and the efforts of the Teesnap team. Fueling the continued growth of this compelling B2B software-as-a-service offering requires the sales force and resources that an organization focused in this space can best provide. As such, in order to take Teesnap to the next level, we believe it is best to acquire or to be acquired. Moreover, getting that our Allegiant 2.0 strategy is focused on B2C, not B2B as is Teesnap's model, we feel the right course of action for both Allegiant and Teesnap is a sale. Ideally, we partner with a potential acquirer, via marketing services and/or the opportunity to continually on-ramp their customer data into our Allegiant 2.0 platforms. Recently, we had a strategic conversation with the party interested in acquiring Teesnap, and we intend to open up similar discussions with additional counterparties. As a result of these discussions, our intention to sell and with all requisite criteria being met and asset held-for-sale classification for accounting purposes has been triggered and will be reflected in our Q3 financials and onward. Under this classification, we are required to stop depreciating Teesnap's assets. Additionally, we have reviewed these assets and have determined at this time no impairment is necessary as the sales price is expected to be greater than the carrying cost of Teesnap's assets. Additional criteria to meet this classification include the intent and ability to close the deal within a year. We need this criteria and we expect to close the deal within the 12-month requirement. Finally, all of Teesnap's future revenue, cost and potential gain on sale will continue to be recorded under income from operations and disclosed within our nonairline segment reporting. Teesnap makes up a significant portion of our nonairline reporting. And in order to best maximize the value of this transaction, we have decided to suspend our nonairline EBIT guidance under sale -- until the sale is complete. Given the sensitivity and relative minor impact on consolidated earnings, our nonairline commentary will largely be limited to our earnings release and future prepared remarks. With that said, we are seeing solid trends with our FECs and expect same-store results to be EBITDA positive for full year 2020. I also want to mention our full year 2019 EPS guidance incorporates both airline and nonairline expected results. And in closing, I'd like to add my thanks to all of our hard-working team members as these outstanding results are attributed to their terrific efforts day in and day out. And with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Didora from Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: I guess my first question is for Drew. I guess based on my back of the envelope calcs here, it looks like April TRASM was down about -- kind of down mid-single digits. I think -- correct me if I'm wrong, I'm calling April, you said that you're expecting having sequential improvement 1Q to 2Q in TRASM. So, I guess you kind of knew of the Easter issues at that time. I guess what kind of changed from your -- what you were looking out to in May and June from a revenue perspective?\nDrew Wells: Yes. Candidly, at that time, you have to kind of remember back to the comps of last year. And frankly, I was a bit aggressive in terms of what I thought we could recapture found those comps, and that's where a lot of the portions came from. That failed to materialize, and we ended up closer to kind of a nonrecapture state. So -- I mean candidly, that's exactly where it came from.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. And then, look, I know in your prepared remarks, you spent a lot of time talking about the fleet transition back at the end of 2017 at your Investor Day, you outlined fleet profitability by 2020 could be about $5 million in EBIT per Airbus aircraft. We're about, I think, roughly around $500 million. Now as you're going -- as you've been through the transition, kind of learning about the new fleet type, how much confidence do you have in this figure in these early days? And what do you think the Street is missing as it seems like consensus is nowhere near that right now?\nGregory Anderson: Andrew, thanks. This is Greg. We're pretty confident. If you take a look at our forward guidance for 2019, you can back end to EBITDA per aircraft of about $6 million. We roughly have about $1 million in depreciation for aircraft. So that can get you to your EBIT per aircraft of $5 million. And we're growing that. We think there's some upside to that in 2020. I would just caveat that with that's -- existing fuel prices, I think a set are about $2.12 per gallon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: On Sunseeker, I wondered if you'd comment on what spending is year-to-date and what's driving your lower view on the year, if there were some delays, if it was permitting or stuff like that.\nJohn Redmond: This is a quarter shift, Duane. This is John. I mean anything, when you're trying to predict cash flows when it comes to resorts like that, there is some uncertainty when -- between quarters. But all in all, as Greg said, the CapEx doesn't change at all. It's just a quarter shift. I forget the first part of that question.\nMaurice Gallagher: Cost.\nJohn Redmond: Oh, cost.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just what you're spending to date this year has been on it.\nJohn Redmond: Well, it's in the earnings release. I don't know the exact dollar amounts per quarter. But we have -- we don't have any -- we're not providing any information as it comes to quarter-by-quarter. But the -- we don't expect the $470 million to change at all. Everything we've been saying about it is factual. But do you have the numbers by quarter handy, Greg?\nGregory Anderson: Yes. If you kind of back into it, Duane, I think all -- the first half of the year CapEx for Sunseeker was roughly, I want to say about $20 million. And that's largely piling in the demo right on the property.\nJohn Redmond: One thing I'll mention, Duane, while we're at it, I know we did put out some progress photos of the resort. One of the things I should update everyone with is we are adding a tab to the sunseekerresorts.com website. That's a Call a Day Project update tab. That tab will be added in the first week of August, and everyone can click on that tab at any point in time then get up to the minute progress photos, including a drone video footage. So, they'll save you and everyone else some time looking at that, and I think that should help you out to the extent you wanted to keep looking at those.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's great, John. I appreciate it. Where would you expect -- like what would you expect those photos to look like kind of exiting this year? So, going from the $20 million to this $160 million, $175 million by year-end. What do you think we'll be able to sort of point to exiting 2019?\nJohn Redmond: You have on a site like that, not to get into too much detail, but there's something like 2,300, 2,400 piles that are -- that have to be put into the ground before it can come out of the ground. So, we would expect the resort to be coming out of the ground towards the middle to the back end of Q4. So, you're going to see structure coming out of the ground by that time frame. So, one other data point I'll share with you is we're going to be -- we're probably 30 to 45 days away from having been able to provide you certainty around timing and construction budget, right? So, call it by the October conference call on Q3, and most assuredly, of course, by the Investor Day, I'll be able to give you with relative certainty what the construction cost spend will be in relation to budget as well as the timing of opening. And the reason for that is we're out to bid right now with significantly more aspects of the project. We expect those bids to be coming back over the next 15 to 30 days. And in conjunction with those bids, we're able to formulate a much tighter schedule. So that's despite getting more data, which we're right on the cusp of. But I'll be able to give you with pretty high degree of certainty where we stand on that budget and where we stand on timing around opening.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: So, I guess maybe first just on that airline only CASM-X, the 6% really impressive. Congrats. I guess just what are we -- what should we be looking at through year-end there? I think on the last quarterly earnings call, you guys mentioned you're expecting deeper declines in CASM-X each quarter as you go through this year even though you've updated positively here, it would imply maybe something a little less negative than the impressive minus 6 in the coming quarters. So, I guess like is there something special about the June quarter that really drove this outside performance? Or could we potentially see similar, better-than-expected performance in the back half as we go through?\nGregory Anderson: Hey, Catie. Yes, our expectation is that the June quarter as far as decrease will be the most outperforming quarter of the year. You can back into the second half CASM-X for the airline only just by taking our guidance. And what I would do is I'll just kind of average those two, the third and fourth quarter based on that, kind of backing into it. In the June quarter, we had a couple -- it was a terrific quarter. As we mentioned, we're capturing a lot of the efficiencies primarily due to operational performance. But there are a couple kind of one-time items that did happen in the quarter. I'd say one, we had some inventory part sales for a non-Airbus part. Our supply chain team did a very good job in negotiating and getting some really good rates on those parts. So that was a one-time good guy during the second quarter. And additionally, we have some slight shift of engine maintenance cost from the second quarter into the third quarter. But other than that, a lot of the goodness that we've seen is going to be intact for years to come.\nCatherine O'Brien: Great. Then maybe one for Drew. Drew, as you're seeing this improvement on operational performance and then the corresponding improvement in Net Promoter Score, are you starting to see any uplift to your pricing structure because of that? Or would you anticipate seeing any going forward?\nDrew Wells: Yes. Thanks, Catie. So yes, one of the bigger factors we'll see and in terms of pricing structure is as we drive up utilization and capacity, that obviously take -- puts pressure on where pricing structure should go. And in terms of, I guess, direction where you will see that impact, our returning customer base is stronger than it has been, perhaps ever. Web visitation looks great. But I do think we're seeing an impact to our passenger and our customer base from the operations, from the Net Promoter Score, as you'd expect. And so, I think you'll see us perhaps have an easier time raising that utilization and capacity as kind of an effect of all the improvements.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Two quick ones here. Just to Greg, you spent some time talking about deleveraging the balance sheet. You talked about amortizing aircraft debt. From your perspective, is it important for Allegiant to have an investment-grade credit rating? Is that something that makes sense over the next couple of years or so?\nGregory Anderson: Michael, good question. It's something we're not focused on. And when you go through some of the criteria from the rating agencies, given the size of Allegiant, kind of our focus in the U.S. and not as diversified throughout the world, it's just a high hurdle for us to ever get there. So, we don't really focus on it. And what we're focused on, strengthening our balance sheet, and that's where our attention will be focused on.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Great. Okay. Great. And my next question, just -- Maury, look, I know you've spent several years getting to the single fleet type. And it's clearly paying dividends. But along the way, it seems like you have a much stronger operational foundation. So that single fleet has helped you get there. That said, is -- with that base, have you thought about maybe adding a second aircraft site to move in to maybe some of the smaller markets? And I'm just highlighting that because I know one of your competitors is looking very closely -- well, I should say, one of your competitor, ULCC, is looking very closely at a smaller aircraft site. Would that make sense in the -- with the Allegiant model?\nMaurice Gallagher: Michael, we just got the help to this first one-off period. You're making me old here before my time. In a word, we're not looking at it. We've got just a lot of work we can do with the one airplane type. Drew and team are -- I think we've said we have -- how many hundreds of markets, routes?\nDrew Wells: We have 459 routes.\nMaurice Gallagher: That, yes, we can still look out. We've gotten international, so...\nDrew Wells: And another 600 or more incremental on top of it.\nMaurice Gallagher: Yes. I mean so keep it simple, stupid. I think I really want to take a moment and put out the boys out to Scott Sheldon and the whole ops team and what they've done, and this has just been a lot of elbow grease, pulling up your sleeves. And as I said in my own comments, fixing airplanes is a job in and of itself. The best airplanes in the world are going to need work. And if you're not well organized in taking care of business, it's going to show up even with the best of airplanes. So, it's pretty impressive what we've done in 2 years, and it really was a will to just make it good and make it right. And this current management team, I know we've caught some flack in the past, management people leaving us. But I think we've demonstrated over and over again the deep and wide bench we have here and the quality of the product we're putting out. And again, with the Allegiant 2.0 and the customer focus, reputational importance is second to none. And I think you're seeing that in the industry as well. The speed of the social media post is a new today or a new world weapon, if you will, in our customers' hands that focuses some operational and marketing aspects of the company to a much greater degree than they might have been in the past.\nMichael Linenberg: Great answer, Maury. Just so you know that was a test question and you answered it correctly. So good answer.\nMaurice Gallagher: We've known each other too long, Michael, to be doing that to me.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: John, can you please do me a favor and elaborate a little bit on the Sunseeker? I know it's -- the slip. I should say in the schedule; I know it's hard to nail the -- these things down quarter-to-quarter. But the nature of the question is does this relate to anything like -- around like permitting issues? Was it something tied to engineering or design? Was it like a labor shortage issue? Just trying to understand a little more what did push that to the right a little bit.\nJohn Redmond: It's hard to point to any one thing, Hunter. It's always a good question. But the one thing I can -- I should mention is once you get started, the difficulty of predicting a start date because there's so many things that have to happen in order for us to start a project. But what I can say is once you do start the project, the end date is much more predictable because the sequential nature of construction is much easier to predict. So, the start date is always a moving target. So, this is nothing abnormal. When you look at development projects, they're always difficult to predict the start. But that's why I was mentioning by the October conference call, I'll be able to give you a relative certainty what the opening date will be or at least the opening month and some real affirmations regarding the ability to hit budget. So, it's just a -- the normal start to a project especially one of this size. This is a very large project as I'm sure you all know. Probably the largest that's -- a nongaming resort that's under construction in the U.S. So, nothing unusual. But I can understand some of the sensitivity around it.\nHunter Keay: All right. And then, Maury, how did that extra legroom product test go that you mentioned? I think you said it was in L.A. I'm kind of curious if that's done and what the results were and if there's plans to maybe roll it out further.\nMaurice Gallagher: Drew?\nDrew Wells: Yes. I'll take that one, Hunter. So, it's still underway in L.A. It will be there through the entire summer. I think we've had, let's call it mixed results so far. Nothing definitive in terms of overwhelming success and certainly nothing that's an absolute train wreck. We are going to continue to test. It will likely go up to our Grand Rapids base coming this fall through the winter. So, we know we've had more success on longer haul flights than we have shorter haul. We have some other projects that will help the merchandising and sales of the product. So, it's on forecasting nothing but better results on that moving forward. That said, if we come out of this winter and still can't piece it all together, then we'll have no problems on the plug on it. But I do think this is going to be successful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: Two follow-ups, actually. The first one on the cost side. Just trying to understand, hoping to kind of get a little help in how we model the kind of the consolidated cost line. And this quarter, I think the airline CASM-X is down about 2 points more than they -- kind of the consolidated. Is that some of that start-up costs that go -- kind of get unwound next year? Or is that just a function of you do have now kind of a growing nonairline segment that's not producing ASMs, so you don't get to give either the cost over it to get more ASMs. I'm just wondering how we should think about the difference there.\nGregory Anderson: Yes, Savi. It's probably more the latter. I mean there is some startup costs that are in there that would put pressure on it. But I mean, if you think that these nonairline components, excluding Teesnap, if they were to continue to grow, those costs would grow but you would likely see a corresponding growth in revenue. And as those costs grow, costs, you're not producing ASMs to offset it.\nSavanthi Syth: That makes sense. And then just on the revenue side questions. I know you've got a couple of questions already on that. But tied to the EPS, the top end of the EPS is brought down as well. Is that kind of a function of maybe not recapturing as much of that 2Q revenue from last year as you thought? Or is there something else that you're kind of the top end of the EPS, lower as well?\nDrew Wells: Yes. From the revenue, I think there's a lot of truth to that. Obviously, coming in lower than we communicated in 2Q is going to put some pressure on the top of the range. So, I think you're spot on it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Drew, mate, I just want to kind of clarify -- the EPS guidance seems to have been kind of benefited from lower fuel and better CASM-X as the TRASM outlook change at all kind of for the rest of the year?\nDrew Wells: No. I mean -- so as we were looking at 4Q, there's obviously a lot of variability in that from the time of budget. The ASMs have kind of come up and come back down a little bit since January. I'm more confident now in third quarter than I probably was about 3 months ago. So, I think we got a little bit of lift there. But I don't think materially, it's changed a ton for the back half of the year.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Can you just talk about how much you think your TRASM is benefiting from the reduction in industry capacity from the MAX grounding? Is it a marginal benefit? Or is it something that's more material that we should kind of consider from a year-over-year standpoint next year, assuming it comes back?\nDrew Wells: Yes. I think for us it's negligible. I mean we have a -- at least sub-2% exposure to routes where the MAX had been scheduled. It's just not a meaningful impact to us. So, I wouldn't attribute anything to our results this year nor would I expect any sort of change in results next year from that comparison base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen.\nHelane Becker: You know I noticed in the comments in the press release, you talked about going from 12 spares last year to 4 this year. And my question is really -- obviously, that's included in, I think, the numbers you cited, Maury, on terms of additional flying and incremental revenue. But can those 4 spares -- is that like the number you need? Or can that go even lower?\nMaurice Gallagher: I wouldn't put a lot of -- we're still figuring out the airplane quite a bit, Helane. And so, depending on the time of the year -- frankly, in September, we'll have a lot more spares just because of reduced line. In our peak months, kind of mid-peak months, four is probably a good number. We might even kick it up to 6 or 7 in a June period just because of the -- we're flying 430 flights a day now, which has substantially increased for us during this peak period. But it's substantially better than what we have with the MDs, there's no doubt about that. And the other piece of this is hopefully, we'll be able to get to a 3-year, I don't know, C check cadence here in the not-too-distant future, next 12 to 18 months, which matches the 737. And that will obviously help sparing as well, so you're not having to do those. But there's a lot of work we can do to enhance the sparing stuff going forward. But it's substantially improved from where we were.\nHelane Becker: And then I just have one follow-up question on ancillaries. I think someone said you're at 50-50 for ancillary and fares. Is that where you want to stay? Or can that change to, I don't know, 55, 45 or something, something not -- where a bigger percentage is coming from ancillaries?\nDrew Wells: Yes. I think 50-50 is probably the right shorter-term target. Obviously, the medium term I would love to be able to drive ancillary higher. But there's a lot that goes into that based on the economics at the time, how much we're flying, et cetera, where oil is. So, I would use 50-50 as the right kind of short-term target, and we'll just see what happens when the -- in the industry as we move forward beyond that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Susan Donofrio from Macquarie.\nSusan Donofrio: So just two questions. One is on your nonairline side. Should we assume that you are actively looking at other businesses? Or do you think it's more passive and opportunistic? Just trying to gauge whether we can expect further growth in this area.\nJohn Redmond: We're not looking at any new businesses other than what's identified to date.\nSusan Donofrio: Okay. Great.\nJohn Redmond: Current.\nSusan Donofrio: And then on the -- go ahead.\nJohn Redmond: Oh, that's it.\nSusan Donofrio: Okay. And then on the airline side. Just wondering with respect to kind of overall spare level, was there an evenness throughout your system, especially as you've added more utilization, et cetera? I'm just trying to get a gauge of the health throughout the system.\nDrew Wells: Yes. There's obviously pockets within the network that are always ebbing and flowing. We continue to see pressure on states across the Canadian border due to foreign exchange. Normally, that holds a little better with oil price. But we've been sticking around CAD 130 to CAD 132, I think in Canadian dollar there. So, continue to see pressure there. Otherwise, I think the network's very healthy. There's areas that we certainly layered on more capacity than others that will put pressure on any unit revenue metric. But there's no pockets I would cause -- or I would call out beyond just some of that border stuff related to foreign exchange.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research.\nDaniel Mckenzie: I had somewhat of a similar question. Just as you exited the second quarter. I'm just curious, Drew, how same-store sales were trending versus new store sales just given some of the volatility in the second quarter. And I'm just wondering if you can just elaborate just a little bit more around the core network versus the growth part of the network.\nDrew Wells: Sure. Yes. So new market has actually formed quite well for us through the second quarter. Exceptionally pleased, especially with some of the growth that we've seen in Nashville. It's kind of a new direction for our network without being a new destination and being able to sustain some service that was otherwise unserved. For the quarter, it was fine. There's really nothing to call out. So, they're really good or they're really bad. It kind of was flatter in terms of results there. So, nothing exotic to talk about on that front.\nDaniel Mckenzie: Understood. Okay. Second question, just getting to utilization, back to utilization here. As we look at 2020, just given the operational reliability of the fleet today and how well you guys are performing, I guess maybe, Scott, this might be for you, where can you -- how far can you push utilization next year? Could you increase block hours over and above sort of beyond what your planned growth is?\nScott Sheldon: I'll take a stab at it and I'll probably take it back to Drew. But if you look at the improvement in the operation, particularly just making sure the tails are ready, the start of the operation in the morning, we've seen over 1 point, probably 1.2% increase year-over-year. Some of the things we're really excited about is more on the predictive maintenance side. There's a lot more data than you can harvest off these planes. They start talking to you earlier. You can build in what would be kind of grounding or regular, all type events into scheduled maintenance events. So, in theory, we should be able to support kind of whatever Drew would like to go do. Whether he -- how much he wants to start early and fly late is more kind of on the demand side. I think, in general, the more we expand the day, it definitely takes away from the time that mechanics can touch the planes at night. So, you probably looked at maybe some staffing constraints. We might have to increase some headcount just given the duration of which we can actually work on planes overnight.\nDrew Wells: Yes. This is Drew. I would expect just kind of the -- your peakiest period, March and the summer, to be relatively close to where we're at today as we gain more aircraft and get back to kind of finally getting the same number of shelves, we had in 2018. You'll see a little bit of easing on that front. So, I think we're pretty close to peak of where we're at. But you'll see, especially in the first week of April, a reduction in utilization. And you're still going to see that 4 to 5 hours in September. So, I expect more of the same this year with potentially a little bit of easing at the very top end.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So just a little bit of an accounting follow-up. Your pretax income through the first half is up about 25%, yet your operating cash flow is down modestly. Can you just explain why that would be and when we should expect cash flow to grow more in line with earnings?\nGregory Anderson: I think probably the -- Duane, it's Greg. Probably the biggest driver in that operating cash flow would be our heavy maintenance. So, you're seeing some pressure on that side. For accounting purposes, although we capitalize that maintenance unit in the cash flow statement, you have to throw it in the cash flow from operations. So, without diving into detail, at the top of my head, I think that might be one of the big driver of that.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So, would we round-trip that at some point? And you'd expect cash to grow with earnings growth?\nGregory Anderson: Yes. So, what we do is we try and pull that -- no, that's right. And what we do internally though -- I mean you have to, for GAAP purposes, report it as such with heavy maintenance in there. But when we think about it, we kind of pull that out and then we classify our heavy maintenance as CapEx so you could think about it from that perspective. If you don't -- because when we report, we report heavy maintenance CapEx, you might be double-dipping.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Maury, when you guys report a 24% op margin on the airline, does that influence at all how you think about the need for Drew's team to push price? Does it create any less urgency to push yields? I mean is that a consideration for you or the team at all?\nMaurice Gallagher: Well, on a theoretical basis, I'm interested in bottom line, which is to optimize price and load factor. And at certain points, you may push on one and not the other. The beauty of this airplane though, with more utilization, is you can take down some of your yield numbers and still get an accretive benefit to it. So, Drew and team are working on that. We're figuring it out. As I said in my notes, in my comments, I'm not sure we're really comparative year-over-year this year, maybe more next year, back to this year. But it's a learning curve, and we feel pretty good on what they do. So, I wouldn't expect that we're giving up too much, if anything.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes. I guess what I'm trying to get at is if you're on track for a 20% plus margin for the year, is that too high where it attracts competition in some form and you actually want to grow into that? So, you're growing into the demand. And would you consider kind of more new airplanes given that, that seems to have been successful for you?\nMaurice Gallagher: More new airplanes meaning brand new airplanes or just growing the fleet?\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes.\nMaurice Gallagher: Yes. We're not really looking at new airplanes, and that was a one-time transaction to serve two facilities for us. One, it gave us airplanes when we needed them. And second, they were end-of-line types of offerings that we've struck a reasonable deal with Airbus on. But we've got B.J. here, and he's our hound dog, out looking for airplanes. And he's out there digging. And we've got a lot of opportunities in spite of the MAX and things like that, I'm actually somewhat surprised that there is good aircraft available. Prices aren't optimal, but they're not that bad. So, we'll just continue to grow the way we are based on -- at a high level. Drew may come to us and say, \"I can do more or less.\" But that's going to be on his comments back to the senior management. And well, one other comment to the 20%. I'm not sure how we kind of dial that down. I'm not looking to dial it down for fear of people coming in. I think we have unique factors that allow us to be profitable that others can't do, not the least of which is we're really generating some great revenue. We haven't heard from Scott DeAngelo today. We're really starting to ramp up on the marketing side. Some of the things that we -- frankly, we were order tickets in heretofore. We hung our shingle out and people came to us. Now we're really pushing the edge and doing things. And reputationally, we're moving up the ladder and we're starting to see people come to us and think about us and not just an afterthought or the last guy to fly. Perhaps, a -- some of the ULCCs might be. But more -- that's my reliable airline. So, all in all, the whole -- the tone around here is just terrific. And we're really bringing a lot of tool sets to bear. And 24%, hopefully, we're going to stay at around 20%. We've said that for a long time, it's an ideal place for us to be. If we're above it, and maybe some of that's fuel, and fuel comes and goes. But comparatively, we face competition all the time, but we're still 75% noncompetitive.\nJohn Redmond: It all comes back to -- as you know, to the model, right? I mean the model is unique. No one else has it. We've always set higher margins than anyone else. So, this is nothing new. You're just seeing a much higher because of aircraft and because of improved performance in the aircraft. So, between that and this amazing model we have, and we're starting to optimize even more, that's why there isn't a fear about people trying to match it, you can.\nMaurice Gallagher: Well, the other thing, too, we're -- we've had our head down so much in the last 24 to 36 months as we transition. It's kind of like people are looking around for things to do. So, the drill down is just getting more and more tight and granular as to what we can do to improve cost. Obviously, optimizing revenues and profitability. It's a nice place for us to be and we're excited about the -- go forward obviously with the airline in particular.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs, a follow-up question.\nCatherine O'Brien: So maybe just one on the nonairline, really, a modeling clarification question. I just want to make sure, the Teesnap nonairline impact is still baked into that player EPS. You've just pulled up a particular guidance item, is that right?\nDrew Wells: Yes. That's right, Catie.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Great. And then I guess it's just one quick follow-up to that. I think last quarter you've got on and said you expected to see a narrowing of your nonairline losses as you got through the year. And I think the result was pretty similar to last quarter. I guess just any thoughts on what drove that? Or are you just expecting more of an improvement in the back half? That will be really helpful.\nJohn Redmond: Well, again, Greg pretty much laid it out. But we're not going to break out all the various components. I think we -- we've done a good job of transparency throughout the year on all these various airline and nonairline issues. But that's why we're not revising the range, it's because of the uncertainty of any kind of value realizes in conjunction with the sale. But it's something we've been looking at. But we're very comfortable. We've given you some really good information about where we think the FECs will be next year. So that answers a lot of that question, and we gave you -- we haven't revised anything as it relates to Sunseeker. Sunseeker is going to be similar, of course, next year. Still preopening expenses without any revenue. And obviously, no change to that until we open. And when we get into the Investor Day, November this year that Chris alluded to, we're going to give you a lot of detail around all the business lines that we'll have operating for 2020.\nOperator: This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program over to Maurice Gallagher, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any further remarks.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you all very much. Appreciate your comments, and we'll see you in October. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

With that, I would like to turn it over to Maury.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 conference call and comments. Firstly, I have not commented on recent calls maybe because we were in our transition period and we didn't think there was that much the same. My analogy for this period is equivalent to one hefty remodel and mainly there isn't a great deal, the same while under construction. But now that we're living in our new home, I want to give you a tour of where we're at and what we will be able to do in the coming quarters and years. First and foremost, we reiterated our 2019 guidance in our release, including raising fuel from $2.10 to $2.26 per gallon. Very pleased about that result. We're hitting our all cylinders post the transition. You know the transitions can be risky, but in our case, very much necessary. Also want to remind everyone, our results during our transition years, we're industry-leading in operating income in the like and some are model reconstituted with Airbus, Aircraft is alive and well. We have another great quarter, our 65th consecutive profitable one. We truly see the benefit of our transition to all-Airbus fleet. We have both an excellent financial and operational performance this past quarter. We led the industry in overall completion in Q1, and we're very pleased about that. And recently, we had a stretch of over 120 days without the mechanical cancellation, a record for us I might add. Our 85% on time arrival in March our peak month of the year was only a fraction behind Delta and Spirit for the third spot. Scott Sheldon and the team have done a great job with our operations. Long term, we are focused on completing our flight safely and on time. And in today's instant information world, doing what you say you're going to do is more important than ever. Interestingly, the three ULCCs; ourselves, Spirit and Frontier or one, two and three, respectively, in completion in this past quarter, while Spirit and we were number one and three and on time. Our financial outlook for 2019 is terrific. Our traffic is very good. Q1 results came in as planned. We had a 22% airline operating margin. Furthermore, we expect Q2 results will exceed Q1, given the Easter timing and the additional capacity we will be adding. In this flip-flop of Q2 outperforming Q1 has happened only two previous times in the past 10 years. The expenses inherent in our transition are being leaned from the system; ex-fuel controllable costs were trending down. As an example, we will have 17 aircraft during the year without adding the additional pilot, completing the transition, training for -- last of our crew members. Additionally, our fuel productivity continues to improve within all-Airbus fleet. John, Drew, Scott and Greg will take you through more of the specifics. Future is bright for us, and as airline, we're one of the best in the country, it is the backbone of what we do as a corporation and what we will continue to do. As we've said previously, we want to enhance our relationship with our customers and offer them more leisure products and garner a bigger share of their leisure wallet. To do this, we must offer more non-airline leisure products. The airline industry has historically been poor at generating new sources and revenues from its customers. The only enhancement I'm aware of in the past many years in many ways has been the ancillary revenues, which were developed in the late 2000 during the desperate recession we all experienced. These are not new revenues per se, but rather a repackaging of cabin features, such as wine room, seat assignments, Wi-Fi and serving food. We\u2019ve always look for more revenue sources, including in-cabin ancillaries common in the industry, in fact, we pioneered many of these products, and we were able to develop these products because we not only control our own reservation sales platform and are focused on leisure traffic. We also developed third-party revenues in the early 2000s, including selling hotels, railcars and other attractions in addition to our airline offerings. We've proven leisure customers compared to a business customer and planning their trip who purchase additional leisure products from us. The more latest of that is our credit card offering, very pleased with that how that's going. Since 2005, we have sold over $1.3 billion in what we call third-party products, resulting in almost $400 million of incremental operating income as a result. One looks at the operating margin of the industry during the past 20 years, we are at the top with our 15.2% margin overall on average and on top by a wide margin I might add compared to number two Alaska at just under 11% and number three Southwest of 10.5%. Our third party products and the margin they have generated have been substantial difference makers during this 17 year period. We have three strategic focuses as go forward. One, continue to grow the airline as we have in the past many years. Two, continue our efforts in improving operations as we have in recent years and three, generate additional revenue opportunities from third-party products, including our golf effort, our family entertainment centers, Sunseeker Resorts, hotel management and other offerings. None of our third-party vendors will be in development for the next few years, particularly the FEC, which is beginning to come online. We have turned these efforts on non-airline for reporting purposes, and we'll provide you with updates on their progress. Today, they do not have a material impact on our results. In 2020 and 2021, we'll begin to see the benefits from these investments. As they come online, particularly the golf, FEC and Sunseeker efforts. We're also continuing our investment in our IT capabilities. As you're aware, 94% of our products are sold directly to our customers through our website and our app. Control of our automation has been pivotal in providing us with direct access to customers to sell airline products, ancillaries and our third-party products. Today, we are continuing this investment, enhancing our platform to allow customer -- customers' access to all of our products to purchase air, hotels, golf, our individually or in packages and to participate in our loyalty program all via a world-class app and through our website. We're also enhancing the platform to provide day-to-day operations and management abilities for Sunseeker and our golf program as we look for our airline. Our strategic question is how do we leverage our exceptional customer database into further revenue opportunities in the coming years? We spent many years selling other companies' products and earned substantial returns as I just mentioned. But we believe we can increase earnings by operating and selling third-party products we owned, such as the hotels and FECs and developing management programs for the golf and hotels and establishing relationships with other leisure groups such as minor league baseball. In fact, we should probably change the level of third party to first party, given we're going to own and control these products. Not only will these efforts increase earnings and will probably provide additional notes around the airline part of our world insulating us from future competition. Ultimately, this strategy is successful because of our relationship with the customer. Since the early 1990s, the airline companies have not been involved with and sold directly to their customers. There've been no middlemen with either of the airline or our third-party products, allowing us to both know who our customer is as well as capture a greater share of the economics of the transaction. Now we want further control of our non-airline products via ownership, allowing us to improve our margins yet again. We also have an outcome from investing and owning additional leisure products is to allow us to increase our touch points with our leisure customers and to further brand ourselves as a leisure travel company. And what makes this whole possible is our team. I believe, we've demonstrated the ability to execute over the past 17 years and the team in place like the categorically say is the best team we've ever had in the leisure. We have high quality focused individuals, all pulling in the same direction. It's difficult than audience as you can all could be our management group and team are tougher. They know the business intimately and are appropriately critical of our ideas. They have brought into the diversification of the company from the airline is the company to read our leisure travel company that operates in airline. Thank you very much for your time, and I'll welcome to the Allegiant 2.0 vision and we're very excited as we move forward. And John?\nJohn Redmond: Well, thank you, very much, Maury, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to keep my comments brief in the interest of the commentary my teammates have here, but you can never at least said too frequently or too often wanted to say, thank you and appreciate the efforts of our incredible group of employees that we have for Allegiant Airlines on another amazing quarter, just never ceases to amaze, just how wonderful the airline is performing on many levels. I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on the non-airline business operating loss in the quarter. I want to make sure that people shouldn't extrapolate that number out and think that's an annualized number. That would be a mistake. But if you go back to the release, you'll see that we are not revising our guidance for the non-operating -- the non-airline businesses. So stay tune. We provided some detail list of why that number was a little higher than maybe someone would have thought if they just simply took our guidance and divided by four. So I think you'll see that there. And on that note, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Scott.\nScott Sheldon: Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As Maury mentioned in his opening comments, our operational performance was exceptional in the first quarter, which is our first full quarter as an all-Airbus operator. Despite over a 12% decrease in available aircraft year-over-year, we grew departures by 4.8%, increased our aircraft utilization by nearly 17% and improved virtually all of our key operating metrics, while reducing our aircraft spend levels. For the March quarter, we produced an industry-leading completion factor of 99.2% and despite significant headwinds from weather-related delays and cancellations; we reduced our regular ops cost by $2 million and over $14 million on a trailing 12-month basis. I would like to congratulate all team members and partners throughout the network for a job well done and everyone should be proud of the results in the progress we continue to making serving our customers the right way. Turning quickly to our first quarter financial performance. The airline produced diluted EPS of $3.98, which is up 12.4% year-over-year on a 5.7% increase in total airline operating revenue, which is a strong start to what should be an exceptional year. As you'll see in our release, we provided much more commentary on 1Q and full year expectations and have reiterated our full year EPS guidance $13.25 to $14.75, despite a $0.16 increase in full year cost per gallon estimates. Our fuel efficiency in airline controllable cost performance continues to pace ahead of internal forecast. As we indicated on our January call, we expect that our CASM-X trends to be the most pressured during the first quarter, given our expected mid-single digit ASM growth, and a substantial reduction in aircraft year-over-year. From our cadence perspective, we expect to see an acceleration of airline CASM-X reductions sequentially through the remainder of 2019. In addition to the fuel costs per gallon in ASMs per gallon guidance, we make slight adjustments to ASMs and CapEx, but I'll let Greg and Drew provide more color on that. And finally, we're pleased to announce that we're going to promote Greg Anderson to EVP and CFO. As many of you, he\u2019s been our acting Senior Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer since 2015 and has proven to be an invaluable member of our management team. He is an exceptional leader for our team members and a partner to our shareholders, and I know I speak for more in John, when I say this promotion is well deserved and I can't thank him enough for his contributions. Greg?\nGreg Anderson: Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd be remiss, if I didn't mention, I'm both humble and excited I am for the opportunity to take on the CFO role here at Allegiant. I have a very big shoes to fill, but having so many terrific partners around us will certainly help me along the way. Due to the large number of puts and takes surrounding our capital plan, we thought it helpful to add some additional color around this area. Beginning with cash flow, consolidated EBITDA for the quarter was $127 million, or $1.6 million per aircraft. This marks the highest quarterly EBITDA on a per aircraft basis since the first quarter of 2016, a quarter in which we only paid $1.29 per gallon of fuel. As can be derived through our updated full year guide, we still expect to produce over $500 million in consolidated EBITDA in 2019, or nearly $6 million per aircraft. The economics and performance of the A320 series aircraft cannot go understated and we will continue to make strong investments in growing the airline as evidenced by the $100 million in capital spend during the quarter on four aircraft and three new spare engines. We expect full year airline CapEx, excluding heavy maintenance, to be roughly $400 million, down $25 million from our original guide. This downward movement is largely driven by the more clarity in the purchase price of several used aircraft based on their maintenance status at delivery. 2019 is an elevated CapEx year with the expected purchases of seven spared engines and 13 aircraft. 10 of those 13 aircraft are scheduled to be both purchased and placed into service during this year with the remaining three intended to be acquired at the end of 2019 and likely placed into service in early 2020. Our 10 aircraft scheduled to be purchased and placed into service during the year doesn't quite align with our in-service fleet plan to add 17 aircraft, so I wanted to highlight the seven of our 2019 in-service aircraft were acquired in prior years, the majority from the portfolio of aircraft we had on lease with the European carrier. Airline capital spend for full year 2019 should not be considered the run rate moving forward. The enhanced aircraft and engine growth during this year is necessary for us to level set the fleet and align with the additional crew members we had already hired to support our accelerated fleet transition. We expect to see a significant decrease in this capital spend as we get back to a more normal fleet growth rate of about 10% on an annual basis. Our Sunseeker Resort 2019 capital spend remains on target. And as a reminder, tax reform allows us to take bonus depreciation on the majority of our capital towards Sunseeker and then in addition, the capital spend on used aircraft. As such, we do not expect to be cash taxpayer in a meaningful amount over the next few years. Turning to financing. During the quarter, we announced up to a $1 billion financing partnership with TPG and a commitment of $175 million in construction financing for the development of our Sunseeker Resorts, Charlotte Harbor. This construction financing is a four-year term with proceeds being two-thirds non-recourse and last funds into the project. It was important for us. It was important to us for our construction financing to be last funds into the project as opposed to first funds in. The timing difference in this particular type of financing not only provides us greater flexibility in controlling the pace of our capital outlay. It also helps us save on total interest costs. By way of example, has the financing been structured as first funds in, a 5% of our LIBOR rate would have resulted in about the same amount of total interest during the term as compared with the actual structure of 7% over LIBOR on last funds in. Also during the quarter, we closed on $450 million term loan and a dollar-per-dollar refinancing of our high-yield bond. Under challenging market conditions, we were able to maintain the flexibility to re-price and/or repay this term loan with zero penalties, while also excluding any aircraft and engines as part of the collateral. The exclusion of aircraft in engines from the collateral pole is key as we intend to finance our 2019 aircraft engine purchases. In addition, we estimate we have borrowing capacity in excess of $350 million, the majority of which is supported by our 2018 unencumbered aircraft. We intend to tap into this dry powder during the year at an amount between $100 million and $150 million. And it's worth noting that secured aircraft finance market remains very competitive for A320 series aircraft. And during the first quarter this year, we closed the secured loan with the best financing economics in our company's history. On a related topic, we recognized $20 million in interest expense during the quarter, and maintained our full year guidance to $70 million to $80 million. The first quarter was expected to be the highest of the year, primarily due to a $3.7 million of additional interest expense associated with the tender to repurchase our $450 million high-yield bond. We expect the cadence of the interest expense to step down throughout the year largely due to the impact of capitalized interest. And may be worth noting the capitalized interest associated with capital spend from the Allegiant pertaining to our Sunseeker project results in a reduction to interest expense. The capitalized interest reduction to interest expense should increase each quarter in conjunction with the increase in non-finance CapEx. And finally, we ended the quarter with nearly $555 million in total unrestricted cash and investments, which is greater than 32% of our trailing 12-month revenue. Our liquidity ratio currently leads the industry based on most recent available data, and we have headroom to reduce our current cash balance, while maintaining a higher than industry average liquidity ratio. Our capital plan signals, our management team's confidence, and our ability to continue to generate strong results from the airline. And these results will vary meaningfully. We have retained the flexibility to pull levers, such as raising additional cash via -- additional cash via secured aircraft financing, and/or slowing the pace of capital spend. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Drew.\nDrew Wells: Thank you, and congratulations, Greg.\nGreg Anderson: Thank you.\nDrew Wells: Thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. I'm very pleased to announce our first quarter year-over-year travel of 1.8% despite a headwind of 1.5 points related to Easter shifting to late April. The biggest highlight of the quarter, was the $53.10 air ancillary per passenger result, which surpassed $50 for the first time in the company history. This marks an incredible milestone for the company, and was led by a combination of strong seasonal back performance and increases the customer conveniency. We're constantly striving at increase our performance here, and look forward to many more milestones in the coming years. Our co-brand program also set new highs in terms of revenue production, per passenger in the first quarter and continues to be on pace to exceed $50 million in EBIT in 2020. This continued strong growth is being driven across our digital and in-flight channels. And we'll soon be launching our partnership with minor league baseball just was to solicit new cardholders in more than 50 ballparks nationwide this season. As we talked about in January, our utilization will increase in 2019, as our fleet count gets back to previous levels. In March, we had 9.9 block hours per aircraft per day, which is 40% higher than our January utilization, showcasing the same flexibility that has always been keys to our business model, with the upside of being able to peak the strongest seasons more effectively than as an MD-80 operator. As a reminder, we still expect to fly roughly 5 block hours per aircraft, per day in September, which is lower than 2016 levels. Fixed fees slightly positive year-over-year results is also strong, given the reduction in the available aircraft space, driven by decreased airframes and increased scheduled service utilization. Additionally, the government shutdown in January caused the delay of a few aircraft in the service, which caused to miss out on roughly $1 million in fixed fees line late in the month. In the first full quarter, with an Airbus only fleet, we saw many of the benefits begin to show immense value. As expected, we were able to hold roughly 50% fewer space aircraft than the first quarter last year. This enabled us to grow some departures in March, roughly 6.5% despite the reduction in aircraft. Additionally, the economics of the Airbus aircraft allow us to more resourceful alternatives. For the last six weeks of the quarter, we utilized unused Saturday aircraft space in Las Vegas to boost capacity in Phoenix during peak demand periods, including all fairly cost, we generated over $1 million of gross profit on planes that would have otherwise been parked for those days. Throughout the first year of our new revenue management system, revenue gains were generally driven by load factor performance. As we are working to the second year, total fare performance is taking over as the driving factor as seen in the first quarter results. Looking forward, this week, we formally applied but the U.S. DOTs operate scheduled service line between the U.S. and Mexico. This is a monumental step for the company, and while there is still a lot of work ahead, we cannot be more excited to start the process toward the selling and operating of scheduled international flights. Turning to our second quarter, we are very encouraged by forward demand. We expect sequential improvement in year-over-year traveling performance including the 2.0 point to 2.5 point tailwind associated with the Easter shift. As a reminder, we will experience some pressure from ASMs growing 13% to 14% in the quarter, including some off-peak weeks between March and Easter. In terms of the full year, we have enough confidence to both increase our ASM guide by 0.5 to 7.5% to 9.5% per passenger year-over-year and the revenue assumption that are underlying the EPS affirmation this quarter. The bulk of ASM increases will come in the fourth quarter, as we are in the process of reviewing and refining the holiday schedule now. ASM cadence is a bit choppy to the rest of the year with third quarter looking to be lower than the full year guide and fourth quarter was higher. And with that, I would like to turn over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the time. I know the March quarter results were general in line, but can you maybe drill down to how March quarter RASM performed? Was that also in line, couple of your competitors talked about seeing some weaker leisure. Is that what you saw or just any color there that would be really helpful?\nMaury Gallagher: Yes, I'm happy to, so provide a color on that. We were right in line with where our budget was, and I believe also right in line with where our consensus was. So I don't know if there's really a ton to read through on there other than pretty much played out as we'd expected.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, great. And then we saw a much stronger performance on your non-ticket air related versus on the fare side. Can you just give us some color and the puts and takes there? Is the fare lower just because of what's out in the market and so you push non-fare higher. Or was there some sort of intentional rebalancing between those two buckets on your part? Thanks.\nMaury Gallagher: Sure. So there's a little bit of both there. First and foremost, on the customer convenient, that is basically shifting bucket, that's more or less one-for-one offset between the fare and the non-ticket there. But beyond that, I think, it's worth calling out the bad performance we did have through the first quarter and the non-convenience fee part of our non-ticket was also the highest that we'd ever seen in company history. So there was a lot of strength kind of outside that shift.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Savanthi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good afternoon. Maury, I had a high-level question. You have some European leisure companies that also operate also airline. Clearly, Allegiant operates a much better airline than these companies do. But I was just wondering if you can kind of compare and contrast your -- the Allegiant\u2019s vision for a leisure company that also runs an airline versus some of these other companies that are out there?\nMaury Gallagher: Well, there is, in particular, we've looked at a little bit of twoey who run both airline and they have acquired a number of hotels, haven't stated their numbers in depth. The irony of this industry is that there has been many airline around the hotel and people think it doesn't work, while the hotel works just fine, it was the airline that didn't work. So particular, you look back at the experiment, where they had I think Western and United and the Board decided to, as I understand the story goes, the Board decided to bring it up because some of the parts were better than the whole. And rumor has that Mr. Ferris [ph] resigned the next day. So there's the history of the airline industry not working well with the hotels but it's not because, again, the hotel does work. I think the main difference we have here today is that we are just so well enamored with customer information and customer data, John can comment, we have for instance 11,000 inquiries right now, about Sunseeker and how people are interested in the product and things of that nature. So having this data and being able to redirect people to a product that we control versus a third-party product where we're just a middleman, candidly, we've seen our hotel take rate go down because we can't get to the hotel rooms particularly in peak times, 10 years of good times and everybody that's in business is trying to eliminate expense and middlemen are differently are expensing. So we find ourselves being restricted in those areas. So we think we're going to have amazing value. We're going to be very focused on our resort called Sunseeker initially. But as I mentioned in my own note, we're going to look in Southwest Florida to do things like managing other hotels. Those are asset-like and should be very lucrative and play off the strength that John, the team he's put together are going to bring to what we're doing here, and you mix it with back in the West Coast and Florida, we have four million people in and out of St. Pete and Punta Gorda. St. Pete's 90 minutes away and Punta Gorda is 10 minutes away. That's just a terrific combination. We're very excited about the opportunity.\nJohn Redmond: I think the only thing I want to add to that Maury is the -- I mean, you take fundamental differences what we're doing is organic growth. What they have done in Europe was more acquisition, right? They go out and buy our hotels, and these are hotels with a lot excitement. They're more what we refer to as like dormitory. So that's the biggest fundamental difference is that we have a resort and it's organically done and designed and built based on the airline data.\nMaury Gallagher: And one just other comment, we're -- we've got as many as many 15 million, 16 million names in our database, of which probably 12 million are usable and we talk to. These are people we know and taken our services, know about leisure travel. And John was just telling me that we're already increasing the number of rounds at the golf course by using our e-mail database and talking across pollinating with people to sell additional activities whether they're going to be in the area. So this stuff, one plus one plus one equals five if -- when you start getting people to understand thing to put the loyalty program, again, customer centric stuff that's what you're seeing industries do, Amazon being the best example of they bring together all kinds of customer information and work with customers and understand what they want and offer many products. We're not planning to be an Amazon at this point, but we're uniquely thinking offering additional products that we can monetize and get bigger share of wallet as where we're going.\nSavanthi Syth: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And if I may just quickly follow-up on Drew's comments on 2Q RASM. Just I know there are kind of two opposing kind of trends there with the kind of the benefits from Easter, and then the pressure from some higher capacity. Should we kind of assume then kind of the deceleration in sequential RASM?\nJohn Redmond: Let me see, if I'm following correctly. So deceleration in terms of from win to win, sequentially we should be better in 2Q than we were in 1Q. I guess way for the deceleration in comparison to.\nMaury Gallagher: Savi is on. I think you both starts.\nJohn Redmond: Sure. I'll take it that. So yes, for 2Q, I do expect that sequentially we'll be better than we were in 1Q. You\u2019re right that there are some opposition there. I don't think it's fully will wash out or kind of the ASMs will fully wash out the Easter benefit. And then we'll -- I think we'll see continued acceleration to third quarter beyond that. So I don't know about any deceleration, but I think that's the best I can tell for you.\nMaury Gallagher: Well, Savi, one other thing I mentioned in my notes. 2Q our internal numbers is going to better than 1Q. Maybe RASM is little softer. I'm not going to comment on that, [indiscernible]. But this has happened twice in the past 10 years, where you have this kind of benefit and two fundamentals Easter, and we're going to have more capacity out there to do more things with. So that's the key part of the plan going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, team. Thank you very much for taking the time. Maury, as you think about CapEx requirements over the next four or five years. How do you weigh what goes into the airline versus what goes into Sunseeker or any of your other businesses?\nMaury Gallagher: Well, the airline comes first. Yes, the airline comes first. It's going to give it me, and we've said we'll grow at 10%, and that's give or take 10 airplanes a year. We're not going to be looking at 15 or 20. We maybe a little less or more, but that's the rule of thumb. And Sunseeker, we've got our budget for that, and that will come online and be done here, mostly the big strength will be out of the way this year. But the business plans suggest that we're going from $350 million of EBITDA last year of over $500 million this year. And so the business is going to be very lucrative, we think, in the coming years, now that we've got all the transition work behind us. So we'll -- I'm not worried about sources of cash. The bank debt, as Greg said, bank role for financially year plan is good or better than it's ever been. And so we'll be able to finance those, just fine. And then we've got general cash flow we're producing on top of it.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s great. That answered my only question. Thanks very much.\nMaury Gallagher: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclay. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. This is Matt actually on for Brandon, and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to kind of step back and this maybe a feet of what Savi asked earlier. But as we look at potential growth and acquisitions or investments in the non-core airline business, are there any criteria management is operating under constraints. Really just the idea just anything that can be reasonably attached on to the leisure business to maximize the customer base? Any color or any context that would be helpful.\nMaury Gallagher: Yes. We haven't looked at any acquisitions at this point. John may have some more in-depth thoughts, given he comes from a different aspect. But right now, we're kind of growing them organically, not that kind we are. And if something comes along and it makes sense, we will certainly look at it, but we've historically been an organic company for the most part. We haven't done a lot of -- haven't done any acquisitions. So we wouldn't expect anything on top of it, and nothing on the radar that we know that at this point. John?\nJohn Redmond: I think one of the best ways to look at that is when you look at capital allocation, it's really because I think to look at the history of what companies have done. And I think when you look at Allegiant, we've always been excellent stewards of capital, whether deciding between dividend and share buybacks or reinvestment of business. So that's the balancing act that we're always looking at to see where we can get the highest return. So that approach that we followed in the past would be no different going forward. We're always monitoring where we can get the greatest return. I think when you look at the airline growth that we're talking about in the 10% range, that's the growth that we think we can effectively implement. And it doesn\u2019t stretch our balance sheet, that's the same thing when you look at hotels. We're going to be a very good stewards of capital in that regard as well, and all the decisions get based on demand. I mean, in the hotel world, if you're filling it, and you're filling it very high rates and you're getting very high returns, you continue to look for opportunity. So again, it's really just a story that we're going to continue to deploy going forward as we had in the past.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then just kind of another question on -- I was interested in the recent announcement to expand to Mexico and international markets. Just maybe kind of some contexts on why there's been the right time it's kind of particularly interesting given some other carriers are pulling out of some transborder markets as well?\nDrew Wells: Sure. This is Drew. This is something that we've certainly looked at from a very, very long time, I think, something on the magnitude of seven years or eight years, we've been discussing international. And we're not always -- we're kind of finest although digging one others drag and yes, there are other locations transborder and international that are weaker. But we can't wait until things certainly become strong than react with the entire process. So internally, we're getting ourselves ready to hit the right opportunity at the right time, and we have kind of a lot of network investments that we put in place domestically that is very well, I guess, propped up to serve the international destination. So we feel like a lot of things are coming together at the right time for us. And this was the time to hit play and we still have a lot of runway in the D-48 space as well. So kind of all that coming together is what gives us all this excitement.\nScott Sheldon: I think another good segue to that provides is when you look back to the 2016 Investor Day, we actually were pretty emphatic about beginning international service by 2020. So we've delivered on everything that we put out there in the end 2016 Investor Day, I think, a lot of people forget that we have delivered on everything that we've said. Drew also made reference to the credit card and everything else. So this is just something, again, that's an execution on what we envisioned way back in 2016. Maury, did you have anything?\nMaury Gallagher: Yes, one other comment, we're already flying to Charter One to Mexico. So operationally, it's not a leap to get from here to there. We're going to be selling the same market, we're already selling in. So -- and the nice thing where we're at now is we have most of them with the customers' access so we can do non-stop service, which is important. So you take MD and Cincinnati and Pete, all these places where we're already at, it's just not a big leap to think that we can kind of sell that product. We'll see, if it works, it's great. If it doesn't work, we're real flexible and by the time and do what we need to do.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nBert Subin: Good afternoon everyone. This is actually Bert on for Joe. My first question is probably for Drew. Has the criteria to add new destinations to these changed and do you think the opportunity for new non-competitive routes is still as robust, as you guys mentioned last quarter?\nDrew Wells: Yes, so I'll just start with the end and work my way forward that we absolutely feel is as robust. I think all of the announcements you've seen us make in, in the last 18 months have showcased that and I would expect that to continue. In terms of criteria for destinations, it has changed a little bit as kind of the origin city profile of Allegiant has changed. As you get into more cities that are a little bit thicker than Cincinnati or Indianapolis some of the ones that more you mentioned previously. You don't need quite the same size of destination or for two times a week service to work well. So as you think about something like Charleston, something like Destine, a much larger origin city can fill out that center demand profile destinations quite well, and that's where you've seen a lot of our growth come like I mentioned in the last 18 months, and we expect this significant amount of growth to continue to come for us.\nBert Subin: Thanks. That's helpful. Just a follow-up to Matt's earlier question. How do you guys see Mexico fitting into the overall travel company\u2019s strategy? Are you guys already thinking about hotel other partnerships? Or is it pretty mature for that?\nMaury Gallagher: I'll kick it off and I would view more or less any international service we do as a replication of what we do domestically. We're now looking to change who we are by any means and hotels will be a huge part of that as we move forward.\nScott Sheldon: Yes, I mean, I would echo Drew's comments. I think it's safe to say that any destination city we would fly, we would look at adding all the components if you used to seeing, but we also could definitely explore is, whether it's managing or branding, those are opportunity that past obviously weren\u2019t something that we'd be looking at. Going forward, we will. The other thing we could probably sit at this point in time is we would not be looking at investing or building. I mean, in international destination, these would be locations that we will be looking at as an asset-light approach, so as branding and managing.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nHunter Keay: Hi everybody. Thanks. Greg, congratulation of the promotion.\nGreg Anderson: Thanks, Hunter.\nHunter Keay: Yes. So I'm kind of curious to know if or why you guys dropped plans for the giant pool, it looks like you did based on the rendering I've seen. And the broader question is, is that was such a big part of the project before, the broader question does PPG have any input into changes in the design, specifically the pool or anything else before they decided to invest alongside you guys?\nMaury Gallagher: I think it's just that question, but thank you for the softball. We didn't -- we never did drop plans or change plans to do a giant pool. Those plans were still there. When you look at the site and what's being built, Hunter, this is phase 1 of what potentially could be a multi-phase project. So, if you look at the design of that phase 1, for us to have a giant pool sticking across the site, it would have blocked the future development of anything on that side. So for us to build that as part of phase 1, we wouldn't have been able to access the rest of the site without a tremendous amount of cost like in the tens of millions of dollars to do something like that. And in some cases, we would have built from the water on the barge. So it's not a change in plans. It's still there. We intend if the demand properly warrants, we still intend to do that.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thank you, John. And I watched the kick-off video with you guys have with the groundbreaking ceremony, and it looks like as the idea of the projects are shifted a little bit from condos to hotels, it looks like you guys are taking on a little bit more of a corporate sort of conference retreat-type approach to the project and that's all well and good. My question is really, how are you going to sell to corporate? Because you talked about your database of 40 million, but those are all leisure travelers. How are you going to access the corporate traveler without going through third-party distributors or new distribution channel, in general, to make sure that you're accessing the right people who are planning these corporate events, or am I wrong is this not a corporate-type dynamic that's evolving here?\nJohn Redmond: It is not. And I think going forward, before you make some of those assumptions, it might easier to just reach out and ask some of these questions, because they're pretty straightforward for us. And I know it's not as intuitive for you, but this is not being designed as a corporate hotel. We are leisure company, leisure airline, focused on leisure guests. Having said that, we also know that there is some seasonality in this market, so we also want a venue that can accommodate the groups that all the hotel companies focus on in target to be able to drive rate and yield and to fill slower periods of time. Now to keep in mind that some of the demand for that space is [indiscernible]. So it's not just corporate stuff you get a lot of -- there's a lot of different opportunities that will allow us to be able to make sure that we run that hotel and resort with the highest level of occupancy and rate possibly we can. So that's what that business provides opportunity to do. You're booking at this business way up advance and there is people who approach us as opposed we're approaching them. So, we will provide some color on that, of course, as we go forward, but we'll let you know about large groups that we've booked from time to time. But when you're booking a group, normally those are booked a year to two years in advance, and we typically would not be putting a group in the building when we know we can sell that up with the leisure customer. But one of the reasons why hotel companies were focused on that is because it's much higher paying customer, these groups. So, again, we would use it off -- call it, off-peak, get back to the airline, the term off-peak times when there's floors and when we would want to sell the hotel with some of these group business.\nMaury Gallagher: And John, you might just talk about just the group business being one-to-one, this is -- there's no third-party in this resort -- sales purchasing from our hotel probably to a group manager who may have a group plan under that matter that you're planning your stuff out a year and two years.\nJohn Redmond: Yes, they approach us directly. There is absolutely no, no middleman and that's always been, of course, the Allegiant DNA is to not have the middleman that we're not changing in that regard at all going forward. You look at a large catering function, you can have inside your ballroom and the amount of business that you do and the margin that you do want to add are off the chart. So you take a large catering function, the margin on that is over 50%. So this is very, very high margin business that we're talking about here.\nMaury Gallagher: Well, I think the other point has, you've got a crowd that works for us now through John and his context, the world-class group management, the best in the world sits here in Las Vegas. This is nothing more than a group talent that lives of that type of thing, thousands and thousands of people able to hire and handle big banquets, lots of people. It's just getting the DNA of this talent, and we're taking some of that to Southern Florida. And we'll be -- we think the biggest supplier of the space available for groups in that place if there's a lot of demand for, because it's such a great destination.\nJohn Redmond: Yes, I mean, the team were putting together. Of course, they have Rolodex like no one else. So, we know other people to reach out and through all the contact points to be able to do that kind of business, and we know who's out there looking for. So, it's an exciting opportunity, stay tuned.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Maury, nice to hear more of you on the call and Greg, I echo everyone else's congratulations on the promotion.\nGreg Anderson: Thanks, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So, I wanted to ask you about flexibility and lead times for changes on the non-aircraft spend as we progress through the year. If the back half does not play out as we expect, how much wiggle room do you have on that $275 million spend? And how do you think about that versus other priorities, such as maintaining the dividend?\nJohn Redmond: Well, when you look at that, Duane, of course, I must admit I wasn't going to think a question from you just because how unprofessional and disrespectful you've been in the past, but I'll go ahead and I'll rise to your occasion. But you look at the spend, we're -- we've already said what our equity contribution is going to be for the resort and as Greg pointed out, we're all in before the end of the year or around year-end. After that is when TPG's fund started to kick-in to fund the balance for the project. So, that's covered. We know probably another quarter or two will be able to provide a lot more color in terms of a better timing and a better update, if you will, on how we're pacing our budget. But as we sit here today, everything is still on budget. We have no concerns there, and I think we talked about capital allocation already when you look at what's going to happen and we look at the highest returns out there. Once you get past the airline, I mean the other CapEx frankly is rounding error. I mean, so you look at these SECs and you look at amounts 0of capital. The only thing that's of any significant is Sunseeker, and of course, that's already been identified and explained as I just did.\nMaury Gallagher: The Board we've gotten deep and wide with John and Ben Mammina, who is building this thing and they're expertise and as far as how they approach the capital allocation based on their representation and I'm going to plan as an expert but is a qualified business guy, we're really comfortable that they're going to make their numbers and we'll have a lot more visibility at the end of the summer whenever we think is finally bid out and all that's in place. But it's kind of come in as we said based on everything we know, and again, these guys have done this many times before. So they're pretty well embedded and how they do that at all.\nGreg Anderson: And Duane, this is Greg. I mean just to add a little bit more commentary on seems 275 that you're talking about and us being able to kind of control the pace with our funds being and to begin. I mean, ideally, you keep the construction bill, you're going the pace that we have today with the majority of those funds are allocated towards, but there's other capital in there such as that you can kind of pull like we pace that down if you had to do, we don't want to, we don't expect the need to, but if things got to a point, we can pace so significant like FF&E, it will push that back or delay that to a degree.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks Greg for answering the question. Regarding non-airline businesses, $0.50 per share loss this quarter. Can you just segment that between Sunseeker, Teesnap and the family fun centers? Thanks for taking the questions guys.\nGreg Anderson: I think, when we get right down to it, individually, there are also deminimis in the aggregate, you can see the number there and 7.4 is going to skew more towards the FECs because if you had two openings. So, you have more preopening activity every time you put one of those, you're hiring people in advance of operating it. So, when you have the more facilities you open and particularly, more preopening expenses you're going to have. We won't you significant preopening for facility like Sunseeker, of course, until we start doing all the hiring, which is, of course, next year. So, it's primarily those two entities because the golf course performance of course offset a little bit of the minor preopening as you get on Sunseeker.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.\nDan McKenzie: Hey thanks guys. Couple of questions here and I might have to get back in the queue again, but just following up on Duane's question, obviously the $12 million to $17 million EBIT loss from the non-airline business this year is really small, but it is something that investors obsess about. And so I guess, I'm just wondering what you can share on revenue trends so far? What are you learning and when are you thinking the losses might inflict to a profit?\nMaury Gallagher: Well, when you look at FECs right there, their scale gain from a revenue perspective, you saw we put in the relief. During the quarter, you only had one that operated for any length of time in the quarter that was the one in the Clearfield, right? The other one, then you open until after the quarter. So, you're seeing the expense associated were facility without being related to revenue. So, both those facilities -- one, of course, will have operated all of Q2. So, you'll see more information on that regard and the other one, the one in the warrant with the open for at least a chunk of Q2. Unlike any business, the lot of time, there's a ramp-up. So, the first quarter operations -- the first full quarter of operations isn't the best. So, that's not going to be any different here as well. And if you look at Sunseeker some space on Teesnap, I would expect Teesnap becomes on a standalone business probably profitable in 2021 and I'd say, on the standalone basis because there's a tremendous amount of benefit that we as a balance of the company gets off of Teesnap primarily around emails. I started to talk about this in the last call. That database as we stand today has an excess of 2.2 million emails that are clean and to be marketed to, right? So, the opportunities to be able to use that, which we've always looked at that as being very synergistic across the airline or other business channels, I mean, that's where we're going to start to see some significant upside in advance of the company on a stand-alone basis be unprofitable. But again, that business would be profitable in 2021 would be my expectations as we sit here today. That's a scale game as well. We never racing them to get courses installed and the first year of course is installed, you're not making any money. So as the out years, years two and out, that close course really start to produce from SaaS standpoint. And Sunseeker of course, we're looking for that open in the back end of 2020 or possibly slight maybe into the beginning of 2021, but we'll be able to provide a much greater degree of certainty after Q2. And that, of course, the expectation that's profitable the day we open.\nDan McKenzie: I understood. Okay. I appreciate the perspective. Going to an airline question, 35 new routes, what percent of the ASMs are in new markets in the second quarter? And if you could just help provide some perspective around same-store sales versus markets, if we're just looking at RASM trends and the same-store sales, if you're looking at RASM trends in the newer markets, where are you seeing the strength and how should we think about that going forward?\nDrew Wells: Sure, this is Drew here. So coming out of the first quarter, we were about 5% of our ASMs on markets that were less than 12 months since start date. Getting into 2Q, that's up over 10% and we're kind of back that normalized rate that you've seen from Allegiant over the last five years. So kind of about 12% to 14% in the quarters after that. So kind of a shorter-term blip in terms of the level of maturity of the network we'll see. Same-store sales have been strong for us for probably 15-or-so straight quarters actually, feeling very, very bullish on what we're seeing there in terms of demand flushings and the market we've been in the longest. You think about a lot of the investments we made 2014, 2015 in these cities like Cincinnati, Indianapolis that have come up a few times. You're getting into the point where you're manifesting a lot of those new route launches, coming from those cities to those center destinations and having that awareness, having that build, a lot of the work that Scott DeAngelo and his marketing team have done are really shortening kind of that awareness curve that we need on some of those newer markets. So I expect that, that's the ramp you see on new markets, moving forward a little bit shorter than what we've had to indoor in the past, but nothing that that's alarming by any means in terms of new market without cadence.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Back to -- you talked about the ability to kind of flex upon aircraft utilization, I think you said you've sort of peaked that 9.9 hours and you'll be back at 5 and 5.5 hours in September. How much higher do you think you can push that before you potentially compromise the operational integrity of the carrier since -- you've obviously done such a good job in getting your operational metrics up kind of the upper quintile?\nDrew Wells: Sure, so I mean given how we perform in March with what's the highest utilization I believe we've ever run, I don't have qualms sitting here today about what our operations can handle. We're going to continue to throw complexity and increased levels of flying at it where we have I believe a number of days over 400 flights coming this summer. So I'm not still holding back any point and I don't have any qualms about how the operations going to handle this summer. So I don't know that's the number or a level that which we can want to talk about.\nMichael Linenberg: Go ahead, Maury.\nMaury Gallagher: Michael, just another qualifier our system is pretty simple. We go after out and back and so you have an a.m. shift and the p.m. shift and certainly in getting more complex so the inside turns and doing triangle and stuff like that. But where you've got 90 airplanes going you just can't do that many. So you can try, you're going to start plan more days, rather than you want to start flying it four in the morning and quit at midnight. We've just never done that, and I don't expect we will do that kind of get the daily utilization up on a Friday or a Sunday. And we're, over Tuesday and Wednesday, you take care of themselves much better than in the east and we have and the west frankly, but yes, you can push a month or something like that, but it's not a day-in and day-out thing.\nDrew Wells: Yes, I think Maury, I just want to add one I think exactly what he said is right. We're going to hit the revenue constraints where we want to go from a profitability perspective I think long before we hit our operational.\nMichael Linenberg: All right. That's very helpful. And then Just back on Mexico, I think maybe Drew, you sort of made the comment that you guys sort of -- you guys zagged where others have zigged and moving into Mexico. Is this when we think about what you've done historically a charter basis sort of medium-sized cities into big leisure destinations. Is that the Mexico plan or are there other things that you may be looking at maybe even secondary cities in Mexico and or maybe even bringing people from Mexico to the U.S. Or is it, am I getting ahead of myself?\nDrew Wells: I think you're getting a bit ahead of yourselves there. I think the first part you've talked about what midsize going to be big leisure destinations in Mexico and phase two being the Caribbean is absolutely, what we would be looking at there. It's our bread and butter and what's we do it very well domestically and so work very well internationally.\nMaury Gallagher: Michael, majority of our traffic originated in the blue called part of the world and we do by margin mostly round trips. So this is really nothing more than just having an arbitrary line south from the border, so to speak. And we'll originate a round trip there. So, like for instance, certainly, in Mexico, we do all of our own automation. There's a lot of complexity, you've got to set up a distribution network and you wonder if that return trip coming or originating in Mexico to Cincinnati. I'm not sure how deep and wide that part will there be. So I look at this personally and just adding another endpoint to Cincinnati or Pittsburgh and like albeit it's got different tax implications and some complexities, but it's fairly more what we've been doing.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now hand the conference back over to the management team for any closing comments or remarks.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you very much. See you in 90 days.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude our program, and you may now disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "ALGT", "quarter": 4, "year": 2018, "date": "2019-01-30 23:51:13", "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2018 Allegiant Travel Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Allen, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nChris Allen: Thank you. Welcome to Allegiant Travel Company's fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. On the call with me today are Maury Gallagher, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Redmond, the Company's President; Scott Sheldon, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer; Drew Wells, our VP of Revenue & Planning; and a handful of others to help answer your questions.

With that, I'd like to turn it over to John.\nJohn Redmond: Thanks very much, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the end-of-year conference call and of course one of the more interesting ones because we get to provide guidance on the following year. But, as I went through our earnings release getting ready for this call, I couldn't help to reflect on the Investor Day we had towards the end of 2016. In that Investor Day we provided guidance which was four years out 2020, which seemed at the time to provide guidance so far out. But those of you who participated or have since seen that information, the guidance we were providing was the initiatives that we were going to be working on, revenue initiatives as well as cost, to get us to 2020, which was the year that we expected to come out of this significant fleet transition and operate an all Airbus fleet. Of course, now, as you look back at that today and you ask yourself, well, what's happened over that timeframe, very difficult transition that we completed in two years instead of three years, frankly. We got done a year early. And that's why we're so excited about now going into \u201819. When you look at those initiatives, this amazing team not only has delivered on all the initiatives but the ones that we haven't delivered on yet, we are pacing to deliver all of those on schedule as we suggested or stated. So, it's been an amazing timeframe during a very difficult transition, but one that we're finally coming into an all Airbus fleet that when you look at the \u201819 guidance, you can only be excited about what's going to happen going forward. But, I couldn't be more proud of the amazing job that the entire Allegiant team has done here in getting us to this important point in the history of the Company. So, when you look at this earnings release that we put out, there's a great deal of transparency to help understand the airline and non-airline business lines as we move forward. We mentioned last call we\u2019d provide this and of course here it is. Consistent with last year, we will not comment on the 2019 data point guidance, unless there are material changes during the course of the year. And of course, that's what we followed in \u201818 year, plan doing that in \u201819. We did provide CASM-X guidance for 2019 as well. And we did that to assist in your understanding of how our costs are trending as we continue to right size the operation for a single fleet type. We'll continue to grow into our excess pilots as we add 17 aircraft throughout 2019. And I\u2019ll let Scott give you a little bit more color on all the aircraft CapEx, when he gives his presentation. One of the data points that's not in the release is the fact that we will be a non-cash federal taxpayer in both \u201819 and \u201820. And we\u2019ve made some comments on this in the past, but I wanted to reiterate that as well. So, as I talked about the fleet transition, we of course completed that in the fourth quarter as we said we did of course some time ago. And the entire Allegiant team is looking forward to operating an all Airbus fleet going forward. So, as good as the performance has been in \u201818 as we completed the transition, our best years are ahead of us. As I heard someone say, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. And that of course is very true statement for what\u2019s going to be happening here as we move forward. So, in Q4 and full-year of 2018, we outperformed on every operating metric highlighted by a controllable completion factor for the year of 99.7%. So, the complexity and challenges of the transition did not distract the focus and intention of our incredible Allegiant team here. So, as we finish up the year and look forward to next year, I couldn\u2019t be more proud being associated with the management team we have and this wonderful group of employees who should all be standing and taking a bow. It\u2019s been amazing. But, boy, I can\u2019t wait for \u201919. And on that note, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott.\nScott Sheldon: Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I want to thank all of our team members and partners throughout the network for a really tremendous 2018. I think, the combined efforts and results really should be celebrated, given the mission that was outlined at the beginning of the year. Maury tasked us with really finishing the sun-setting of our remaining 37 MD-80s. We had in the pipeline to acquire and induct as many as 29 Airbus, which were primarily from used operators, multiple operators. During the summer season, we consolidated all of our MD-80s line to Sanford base. We increased our Airbus operational reliability, which allowed us to minimize reliance on sparing aircraft. Our flight ops training did a great job at condensing the training footprint, that's really allowed us to minimize our flight crews being offline and particularly as we exited November to get to as many as 75 crew members trained on the Airbus. So, without a doubt, I think we could say we're successful in all of those areas. In addition, we targeted some pretty aggressive operating metrics that which we were -- we hope to achieve. If you look at 2018 on a full-year basis, we increased completion percentage, controllable completion percentage by 0.7 points to 99.7%. This resulted in a reduction in controllable regular ops expense by $10 million. And really with the exception of a 6-week period during the summer, these numbers would have been substantially better. We increased our [indiscernible] by 3.5 points to just over 85%, A14 by 3.5 points to 77%. We continue to be pleased with our CASM-X profile, which specifically for the airline reduced by 1.8%. So, once again, just a job well done to everyone throughout the network. And a little more on guidance. John mentioned and did a nice job laying this out, but there's a couple points that I just want to give a little clarity on. So, we can walk down page three of the earnings release, to give you forward curve, we $2.10 on a full year basis. That's off of a $2.33 full year number. We're currently paying about $2.10 a gallon. ASMs per gallon, we're guiding $0.80 to $0.82 ASMs per gallon, which on the surface appears to be a little light given the 81.5 ASMs per gallon we put up in the fourth quarter. Really, the driving factor here is the pacing of our 319s coming into the fleet. It's really first half loaded. Our fleet plan has 17 units coming in with the first half bias of 319s. So, the 6.5% increase in ASMs per gallon, \u201818 over \u201817 will fall off just a little bit into \u201819. Interest expense, we're guiding $70 million to $80 million on a full-year basis, which is up from about $54 million in 2018. It simply reflects the current leverage profile of the organization. This includes the economics of the refinancing of our unsecured bond. Tax rate, we're guiding to 24 to 25, which is up from full-year effective tax rate of just under 19%. Full-year \u201818 was impacted primarily by two issues, one was a specific Section 199 deduction. In addition, we have some impact from the dissolution of our special purpose companies related to some aircraft that we have placed in Europe. But, moving on to ASM growth we\u2019ll let Drew touch on that. Depreciation, we're guiding, $150 million to $160 million for full-year '19. This is up from about $130 million in \u201819. On the surface, it's a pretty sizable increase, but I think folks should remember that our MD-80 fleet was impaired in the fourth quarter of 2017, which effectively means that was written down to zero book value. So, for all of 2018, we had zero depreciation expense related to our entire MD-80 fleet, which produced about just under 20% of our ASMs. John mentioned our airline CASM-X. We're guiding down 3.5 to down 1.5 on single digital ASM growth. We continue to be pleased that some of the pacing items from the transition, particularly we're getting better efficiency out of flight crews and just efficiencies related to the single fleet type. So, once again, that's a full company-wide effort. John mentioned, the 2020 plan. We grew just under 6.3 cents ex-fuel. So, you can see we\u2019re reaching those levels by the end of 2019. A little bit on CapEx. Full-year CapEx for the airline is coming in around $530 million. It\u2019s really broken into three buckets, maintenance CapEx of $95 million to $115 million, which is up from about $48 million in the prior year. In addition, it's a fairly healthy aircraft CapEx year. As you can see in the release, we terminated some finance leases and backfilled them with some outright purchases. So, some of this growth is really 2020 related. And then, last but not least, our EPS guidance, $13.25 to $14.75, 30% up at the midpoint. And so, very pleased with the health of the organization, health of the franchise. And we look forward to what 2019 will bring. Drew?\nDrew Wells: Thank you, Scott, and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. I'm very pleased to announce the fourth quarter year-over-year TRASM of up 4.4%, including the impact of revenue recognition rules, which easily ends up as the best year-over-year performance in 2018 as we indicated in October. That number also includes roughly $2 million of benefit due to breakage associated with our credit card loyalty program. While we will be able to take increased breakage going forward, most of that $2 million should be considered a onetime benefit. The breakage amount also explains the variance between today's release and the TRASM range 8-Ked on January 10. Without breakage, TRASM was up 3.9%, which was slightly higher than what we expected at the beginning of the quarter. We saw fixed fee performance with $50.3 million for the year. Note that this was the amount we forecasted to hit in 2020 through EBIT initiatives laid out in 2016 and 2017 Investor Day as John mentioned. I\u2019d like to commend everyone involved in the planning and operation of these flights, for their success. As we turn the corner on our successful and unprecedented fleet transition, we expect to reap the benefits of the remaining 2020 EBIT initiatives. With a full year ASM guidance 7% to 9%, our utilization will increase in 2019, as our fleet count gets back to previous levels. However, we are set up well to drive efficient and unit revenue accretive growth through the year. Our announcement of the crew and planned base in Grand Rapids further strengthens our Mid-Continent base strategy. This will allow us to continue to better optimize passenger throughput in our busiest destinations and to grow the purchase during higher demand times of the day, which has historically been good for fares. This is peak time growth that is not dependent on aircraft growth. We will also reduce the number of spare aircraft, which will improve fleet productivity, adding growth to peak days of week. This is peak day growth that is also not dependent on aircraft growth. We started to realize the benefit of e-commerce revenue project initiatives in late-2018 through the roundtrip discount. The goal of this project is primarily to convert one way itineraries into roundtrips, which helps fill empty seats with ancillary paying passengers. The project is in the early innings still and should provide more upside to 2019. The pricing engine continued the good form we talked about in October and was instrumental in 4Q results. As we move into the second year of optimization, gains will likely be more yield-driven versus load-driven. We continue to be bullish on the revenue environment as forward demand looks strong. We will continue to benefit from the aforementioned initiatives and sort of other self help initiatives such as bundled ancillary products under development and should begin to roll out in the second half of the year. As a reminder, the later Easter is only a modest negative to Q1 about 1 to 1.5 points, but a greater benefit to Q2, about 2 to 2.5 points. Overall, I am very excited about the greater revenue opportunities in 2019 derived from the transition to an all Airbus fleet and our various self help revenue initiatives.  With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Hi, everybody. Thank you. Hey, what\u2019s up. Maybe this question is for Sheldon. I\u2019m kind of curious about this $800 million or so of CapEx and the associated strength, [ph] it\u2019s going to push into the balance sheet. Can you remind us, Scott, of the key covenants either on minimum liquidity or EBITDA ratios that we need to be mindful of, particularly considering the recent tender offer that may change anything? Thanks.\nGreg Anderson: Hey, Hunter. This is Greg. Maybe I can help tackle that one. On the key covenants, there is a maintenance covenant that\u2019ll come out on the refi of this the high yield bond. So, we just announced -- or we\u2019ll just price and allocate this term loan B that happened yesterday. So, that\u2019ll be $450 million instrument to replace the high yield bond. So, going forward, those are the covenants that we\u2019d adhere to. And really there is a maintenance covenant in there, about $300 million minimum liquidity.\nHunter Keay: Okay. That\u2019s really the only name was something around like EBITDA ratios or adjusted EBITDAR or any of that stuff.\nGreg Anderson: Yes. And that\u2019s 5 turns debt to EBITDAR.\nHunter Keay: 5 turns, debt to EBITDAR. Okay, cool. And then, would you care to tell us anything about this well-known institutional asset manager? I am kind of curious, obviously I am not going to name them. But, is this somebody that you guys have known for a long time through the airline side, is it somebody that has a lot of maybe residential real estate experience? Just generically, can you help us describe, how this came to be and what this institution might bring to the table? Thanks.\nJohn Redmond: I think we\u2019re better off not creating more of a guessing game. We\u2019ll just kind of wait till we release that information, as we said before, at the end of Q1. So, we\u2019re comfortable with that that\u2019ll be completed by that timeframe. And let\u2019s just say, it\u2019s someone that you know.\nHunter Keay: Got you. Thank you, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Sorry. Oh my God! I was so excited, I chocked. I was so excited to be following Hunter that I chocked. So, sorry about that. So, just a couple of things. One is, you talk about the profitability of all the non-airline stuff. Can you just mention how that progresses during the year, so that we would just have a good understanding of if there are losses, they\u2019re front-end loaded or back-half loaded, or how should I be thinking about that, or shouldn\u2019t I be thinking about that?\nJohn Redmond: Well, I mean, at the end of the day, we\u2019re not going to provide any detail beyond what we\u2019ve provided, which is consistent with the entire release; it\u2019s based on a full year. So, when you look at the -- say Teesnap, a lot of that of course relates to a lot of first year courses being added. So, the way the model works is they\u2019re more profitable in years two and out and less profitable in year of being added. When you look at Kingsway, that course is basically a breakeven. So, you can look at it like that. And when you look at Sunseeker and the FEC, a lot of that has to do with pre-opening related expenses, right. So, as you incur certain types of expenses that you can't capitalize, they end up being losses that you see reflected in the negative income, if you will. So, at the end of the day, it's not a significant number. So, if you want to just even straight line it, I mean, you're not going to be material off, however you want to look at it, but any one particular quarter, it\u2019s not significant.\nHelane Becker: And then, my other question is with respect to what you can say about demand kind of given all the sentiment and what we saw in the first few weeks of the year with the government shutdown. I'm just kind of wondering if you've seen any changes in a way your customers are booking up and for the next couple of months, maybe?\nJohn Redmond: Go ahead, Drew.\nDrew Wells: So, demand looks good moving forward. As has been mentioned on other calls, the first couple weeks of January tend to be kind of biggest bellwether for how 1Q is going to perform and we were looking kind of right as we expected. So, I didn't see any sort of material slowdown with relation to government shutdown or everything else. And I think the leisure space is very healthy right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Just a little bit of clarity on the CapEx side. Scott, I think you mentioned related to terminating of the aircraft and buying some really briefly. Is there any kind of early payment for aircraft in future years, or how should we think about that CapEx?\nJohn Redmond: Do you want to take that, Greg.\nGreg Anderson: Sure, yes. Savi, hi. This is Greg again. On the CapEx, maybe think about the airline CapEx including heavy maintenance for about $430 million in full year \u201819. Of that, I would think about two-thirds of that relates to aircraft. And then the remaining one-third relates to spare engines and other CapEx. And so, we're going to acquire half dozen, seven spare engines brand new during \u201819. So, that puts some pressure on the CapEx as well.\nSavi Syth: Okay. That makes sense. The engine part is probably what I was missing. And then, if I might just follow-up on the discussion about the initiatives that were laid out in 2017. Can you talk a little bit more about like just what run rate? I think, it was $365 million that was kind of laid out. What's the run rate we\u2019re at today and what\u2019s kind of yet to come over the next couple years?\nJohn Redmond: We've never really provided a breakout, Savi, by year of implementation, but most of those have been completed or well on their way. But, I don't have any breakout any.\nSavi Syth: Is it just maybe the e-commerce portion that's really left execute on? Is that a fair assumption?\nJohn Redmond: So, I think e-commerce is the biggest of the buckets that has kind of the least amount completed to-date. As you think about fleet productivity, that's going to be a big 2019 effort as we reduce the spare count and we\u2019ll collect most of the benefit there. As you think about fuel benefit from ASM production, that's simply going to be a map exercise as we move into all Airbus. So, we'll see kind of a big windfall this year as well. In terms of there is credit card, it\u2019s kind of right on the trajectory for $50 million in this year and next. I think that pretty much covers it. Is there anything else specific you want us to go through?\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s helpful.\nJohn Redmond: I mean, the big takeaway there, most of this is all being achieved by the end of \u201819 as opposed to by the end of \u201820, which is what was originally communicated back on our Investor Day.\nSavi Syth: Got it. all right. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good afternoon and thanks for the time. So, a question for Scott or Greg. Can you remind us, are there any moving pieces between quarters with respect to CASM as we go through 2019, or should we just simply assume that lower capacity quarters should see higher CASM and vice versa?\nScott Sheldon: Yes. I think it\u2019s the latter. I think, you\u2019re going to see the most pressure in the first quarter, just given that it\u2019s the least ASM growth year-over-year. And then, it's pretty consistent through Q3, Q4.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, great. Thanks. And then, can you maybe give us some color just on underlying cost assumptions to that non-airline operating income guidance just to help us to think about the Company cost structure we should think about this year?\nJohn Redmond: I'm not sure I fully understand your question. I'm sorry, Catherine. But..\nCatherine O'Brien: So, you gave us non-airline operating income. But, I was just wondering maybe you have like a margin assumption or some sort of guidance we can back into non-airline cost trend this year or just maybe year-over-year, however you want to think about that?\nJohn Redmond: Yes. I think, as you look at the impact on full-year \u201819 kind of non-airline ex-fuel cost, it\u2019s anywhere from kind of 0.2 to 0.3 cents per ASM, which is probably at 0.2 cents year-over-year, to give a little color. \nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, maybe just one more quick one if I could. What kind of benefit, if any, do you have from the improvement in revenue management system baked into your 2019 guidance or was it really the largest impact we saw from that in 2018? And thank you for the time.\nDrew Wells: Yes. So, I think -- this is Drew here. The largest impact is still going to be in 2018 of kind of similar to what was talked about before, the holidays, the spring breaks are very well defined travel periods have excelled as well as kind of the lowest of demand periods. And that kind of constitutes almost half maybe of the flight which we have. There is still a lot of upside we have through the summer, which we talked about quite bit in both July and October. So, yes, I believe the biggest chunk is out of the way in \u201818 but with more upside to \u201819 than we probably initially expected. \nCatherine O'Brien: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Fallon with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \nMichael Linenberg: Hey. It's Mike Linenberg actually in lieu of Matt. Just couple here. The $175 million of financing that you're getting for the 420, as we think about the terms of that debt, would that be similar to the terms of where you currently borrow in the marketplace? Is that a fair assumption as we think about modeling in that expense for 2019?\nGreg Anderson: Again, all level of details will come out in the release that -- when we're completed with that transaction. But, I think, just the fact that we called out some of it is being non-recourse, you really can\u2019t expect it to be something that has full collateral like say financing a plane.\nJohn Redmond: Well, the interest cost is what we capitalize as well, Michael... \nMichael Linenberg: Oh, okay you\u2019re saying that the interest cost will be capitalized?\nJohn Redmond: Yes.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. And then, of the remaining 420, the 420 less the 175, we\u2019d assume that that\u2019s going to come out of internally generated funds, or you also looking to finance the portion of that?\nGreg Anderson: That would be internally generated funds.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And then, just second question, just to Drew, calling out the Easter impact, I think it was you said 1.5 points on March, but 2.5 I think no -- in the June quarter. Why the spread there? I mean, I realize Easter was April 1st last year and the 21st this year. Is there something else there than just the way that day fell?\nDrew Wells: It\u2019s really about kind of what the comp looks like. So, late April is very low demand for our leisure customers. So, reaping any of the benefits from an Easter shift and some of that peak travel will swing the needle far more out there, than it will at the end of March when there still is a lot of really strong traffic, some spring breaks that are shifting out. So, a lot of it just based on kind of what the non-Easter part of it looks like.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. That makes lot of sense. Okay, great. Thanks Drew, thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.\nDan McKenzie: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks, guys. I just wanted to go back to kind of an earlier question on the non-airline costs. I do see that the 2019 non-airline operating income has broken out, which is very helpful. Thank you. With respect to the revenue -- the revenue side of the business, and it\u2019s kind of your full year outlook, EPS outlook. What are you -- what are the key drivers of your revenue outlook? Obviously, I heard the commentary around demand very strong, but what are the things that we should watch out for that could potentially go wrong here, or do you feel like you\u2019ve built in inadequate amount of conservatism? \nGreg Anderson: You\u2019re talking about the non-airline. So, I can\u2019t imagine anything going sideways on this for the most part. I mean, we did provide a projection on the number of golf courses that we expect to add. So, to the extent that we do not achieve a revenue target, it would just be missing the number of courses as we expect to add. But, again, it wouldn\u2019t be material.\nDan McKenzie: Sorry. I meant to clarify on the airline side of the business, just with respect to this year.\nGreg Anderson: Sure. So, the demand does look good, but of course there\u2019s always, the risk of fall off there. As you\u2019ve seen in the past from us, the leisure customer is very resilient. In the event that we do see economic downturn, we\u2019re still confident that we can put together very strong results. And generally that will mean either oil comes down and we can adjust capacity appropriately to continue to incentivize leisure customer travel. It generally just comes down to the price point at which you do that. I guess, the second piece of that is we\u2019re still relying on some self help initiatives in 2019. I mean, there\u2019s always deployment risk as to when those can roll out and whether or not we can maximize that benefit in the timeline that we expect. So, there is always that on the back end. As it pertains to fleet, I am very confident all of our counter parties and the timelines that we have in place, I don\u2019t expect to repeat some of the delivery issues we\u2019ve seen in the past. So, I don\u2019t believe that that is a material risk at this point, though it always does exist at some level.\nDan McKenzie: And then, with respect to the follow-up question here, I wonder if we could just focus a little bit more on Sunseeker. It's really an investor concern. And if I could maybe just focus on cost and how this might impact kind of the projections that you gave us back last September. I think, the $420 million estimate was a hard estimate, but did not include expenses to-date. And now, we're seeing some expenses today that are close to $51 million, so presumably higher than last year. So, I guess, one, has there been some cost creep on Sunseeker? Has anything changed about the development, and how might that change sort of how you're thinking about the Sunseeker income statement or how that might, I guess sort of rank as a percent of total EBIT as we look out to 2020?\nGreg Anderson: No change at all, Dan. I mean, when we first were talking about it, even we said 420 was a 420 going forward number. So, we\u2019ve commented we have spent in the neighborhood of 50 to-date, now you're seeing as of the end of December, we have spent 51. But that doesn't change the overall 470 total, which had of course been inclusive of everything spent up to the time we were chatting plus the 420 going forward. So, that overall 470 doesn't change, nor the 420 going forward.\nDan McKenzie: And it's how you're thinking about the contribution of Sunseeker relative to the overall operation, still in line with that initial forecast that you put together for us back in September last year?\nGreg Anderson: We're going to know a lot more here in another couple of months, but it is -- we're still hoping to be -- if you drove by the site, you see a lot of work going on. So, a lot of times people say, we haven't done anything, there's work going on now. I think what we would like to see before we start committing to a more firm timeframe is when you start going vertical. So, we're still expecting that the going vertical timeframe to be at the very back end of Q1 or early Q2, so call it the March-April timeframe. And it is still our expectation. But again, we\u2019ll no more in another couple of months that from the time that we start going vertical, we would be opening in the neighborhood about 18 months from then. So, call it in the back half of 2020 is when we\u2019d be looking to open up this project.\nJohn Redmond: Yes. On the economics that we put out, we see those being just fine, the forecast that we put out back in September, nothing\u2019s changed there. And just to be clear, none of this is expense; this is all capital outlay. So, the $50 million was not an expense item; it was a capital item. So, that number has been pretty firm for many, many months that we've talked about. Nothing's changed there, and we don't expect to exceed budget either?\nGreg Anderson: Yes. Of course, the biggest component of that which we announced a long, long time ago was land acquisition, right, which was just north of $30 million. So that was the biggest piece of the $50 that has been spent.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. It's actually Bert [ph] on for Joe. I think this question is probably for Drew. I'm just wondering United's growth strategy has been restoring some of the feed traffic share lost earlier in the decade. So, reasonable capacity grows from them has been high and will be high again next year or this year. It seems like American is sort of planning a similar strategy. Has that restoration service in smaller markets impacted you guys in many noticeable way that\u2019s pushing you to different type of markets or do you just not really think about it at all?\nDrew Wells: It's nothing that\u2019s shown up in our results at all. All this traffic still requires connection and can sometimes drive up to two to three hours of extra travel on to something that should be two and half hour non-stop on us. Additionally a big part of that feed is high price regional into the hub where they can then spoke out. Largely, they\u2019re not fishing in the same customer pond that we are in terms of leisure versus business spread. And from that perspective, I think we\u2019ve stayed out of that net all together. So, not something that we felt.\nMaury Gallagher: This is Maury. I want to reemphasize this customer that the United or American might attract is not our customer. Frankly, it's a combination of stealing traffic from the other guy and/or maybe some stimulation because of better schedules. But it's not a person getting on an airplane going to putting to Punta Gorda or something like -- place like that. Not to say that it doesn't happen, but we've just seen that over and over; it's not a zero sum game. But while they're going about their own business, they are really playing against each other. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve O'Hara with Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the non-airline operating income. That's I assume included in the earnings per share guidance and the GAAP number and same as adjusted, is that correct?\nGreg Anderson: That's correct. Yes.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. And can you just -- on the 2020 initiatives, there is some comment about them proceeding and how they were -- you're getting most of the benefit here and there. I guess, can you just clarify that? I mean, it seems like the benefit was significantly larger than that that you laid out. But, are talking about you're kind of where you had expected to be. Is that what you're saying?\nGreg Anderson: When we provided that information, the commentary around it was we expected to achieve all of those benefits in 2020. But, a lot of those benefits have been achieved to-date. And as Drew was commenting on earlier, a lot of them will be achieved throughout \u201819. So, we\u2019re not going to experience the full benefit in \u201819, but we're going to achieve them as we move through the year. So, some of those relate to being done with the fleet transition. So, the fact that we're done in -- we're done at the \u201818 so not at the end of '19, and obviously pull forward all of those benefits. So, comfortable with what trails into \u201820, but most if not all of that is done through \u201819.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. All right. And just on the ASMs per gallon and the fuel economy there. I mean, with the 319s coming in, should we expect that to kind of improve throughout the year and then improve again in 2020, assuming more 320s into the fleet?\nDrew Wells: Yes. I think that's fair. \nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. I mean, is 85 still the right number to kind of think about 80 to 85, something in that range?\nDrew Wells: I think, it\u2019s 85, I mean a larger bias of A320s. But in general that is the general direction.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. All right. Thank you\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. One clarification on the $250 million to $300 million in Sunseeker spend this year with $420 million remaining. Is it 420 remaining after that 275?\nGreg Anderson: No. So, what you have is 420 was remaining -- and we said that we\u2019re looking to finance 175. So, 420 less 175, we would be spending 245. So, anything that we would spend this year in excess of 245 would be financing that we would be announcing here by the end of the quarter.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Okay. But the 420 remaining includes anything you would spend, whether financed or paid for yourself in 2019?\nGreg Anderson: Yes.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then secondly just on the increased reporting transparency, it gets a little bit better each quarter, and really applaud you for that specifically in the context of forward guidance. But, of course, it peaks our interest a little. Why are you spending any capital and company focus on golf course software and Dave and Buster\u2019s like game rooms? I understand these things might be interesting experiments, but why do they need to be funded on balance sheet by Allegiant equity holders?\nJohn Redmond: Well, we look at the synergistic value, right? It\u2019s where one plus one is not even three, it\u2019s like four. So, sometimes when people think of golf course just for instance... \nDuane Pfennigwerth: John, sorry, I have covered Allegiant for a long time. There is no synergy between golf course management software and Allegiant Travel. So, can you just speak to the debate at the Board level regarding the next -- sort of how you debate the next dollar of investment into a Dave and Buster\u2019s versus an airline, versus a hotel? I mean, the ROIC of the airlines seems to be much higher than anything else you have going on. So, what does debate look like? \nMaury Gallagher: Duane, I\u2019m going to tell you what the debate looks like. The person that sits on an airplane, what else they do besides sit on an airplane? Do they go to a Dave and Buster\u2019s? Yes. Do they play golf? Absolutely. So, you gather information. This is an information centric era. Duane. We live in information. We want more customers, we want bigger wallet share. And so, yes, you can make an argument that maybe the maximum ROI for the next 24 months is putting it into an airplane but what about four years from now, five years from now? So, this stuff is all part of our trying to articulate this grand scheme of going more customer centric rather than tube centric. Filling up a tube is important and we will do and focus on that tremendously. But, we want to have more relationships with more customers on an individual basis and understand where they spend their money over and above just getting in the tube. So, that\u2019s the marginal spend. And just like every other investment, the early days are never going to have a better ROI than a mature business will. But we are making those investments and we\u2019ve tried again to articulate that as best as we can. So, that\u2019s what the Board is understanding, the Board is fully onboard with all of this. \nJohn Redmond: So, Duane, let me give you the deeper data point just to help understand what Maury said, because a lot of times people haven\u2019t thought about it or don\u2019t care about it. But, the golf courses for instance right now are generating emails, brand new emails, people we don\u2019t know at the rate of one-third of what the airline generates on a daily basis. So, it's actually significant number of emails that we're capturing from golf courses about people that currently aren\u2019t in Allegiant\u2019s database. So, when you add another 800 courses as we expect throughout the year, obviously, we will be generating emails from those courses at the rate of half from the rate that the airline produces. So, that's an incredible data point that goes well beyond what you thought of given your comments.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I appreciate those thoughts, Maury and John. I would just say, ex these other adventures, you're guiding to $15 in earnings for the airline. Congratulations on getting the fleet upgrade done more quickly than you initially anticipated. But, your multiple, I just wonder, to what extent you and the Board reflect upon the multiple and how your multiple has changed as you deploy capital to lower return businesses? And I appreciate you taking the comments.\nMaury Gallagher: No problem. We certainly are conscious of that, and it's a short-term hit to the multiple; long-term, win we think. That's as simple as we can say it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRajeev Lalwani: Hi, guys. It seems the tough act to follow. But just a couple of airline questions for you. One, you guys talked about 600 rounds to choose identified over next whatever years for possible growth. Are those 600 are competition levels in those markets similar to what you're seeing now? Meaning, can you attack those routes and sort of keep that 75% or so of your markets being without much competition?\nDrew Wells: Yes. Of those markets that we identify, it's actually closer about 10% competition right now. So, we would actually drop the percentage of markets that are competitive, should we get through all of those?\nRajeev Lalwani: And then, the other, as it relates to just oil prices moving around, how does it impact your fleet utilization and your network now, given all the work that you've done on the fleet transition versus years ago? I imagine, it's very different where you're not really flexing as much, based on oil and moving peak and non-peak travel around. I'd love to just get an update on how all that looks today after the various changes.\nDrew Wells: Sure. So, the core of our process is the exact same. As we forecast out all the flights you want to put out for sales six to nine months out, we're ensuring that that incremental roundtrip on a market level basis is exceeding the gross profit threshold that we need in order to have it. That existed for an MD just as it exists for an Airbus. In terms of earnings potential, there's a difference of about $1 per gallon between the MD and the Airbus to secure the same earnings and margin. So, that's kind of the flexibility we have to go there. As we plan forward, we're always using higher oils than what we expect to actually receive. So, we're already planning to have a little bit of a buffer in there to account for the fuel variations that you're talking about, such that does not arise, we have the ability to add capacity and closer in maybe 3, 4 months out to be able to capitalize on that. But again, everything is subject to hitting the internal growth thresholds that we set up.\nRajeev Lalwani: If I could sneak a last one in on the non-airline operating income, that $15 million. When does that start to go away? Is that in the next couple of years, does that turn positive, just preliminary thoughts there, for John?\nJohn Redmond: Really, as you get into the back half of \u201820, it starts to get closer of course to break even. When you start to open Sunseeker, you definitely get to that direction. You look at FECs and you look at Teesnap, it's more of a scale game. So, you really -- when you start to look at \u201821, I mean, the numbers all starts to look extremely positive. So, \u201819 of course is kind of like call it a transition year, just not with the fleet, but that transition allows you to get the scale you need to in order to get out of the negative carry and move into \u201821, 2021 where it starts to look a lot better.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is a follow-up question from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Dan McKenzie, your line is now open.\nDan McKenzie: Thank you. If I can go back to non-fuel cost, 1.5% to 3.5%, can you just remind us where the -- kind of lay out maybe the top three line items where the greatest inefficiency was in 2018? So, I think obviously there is a fleet transition. Is it that you just simply don't need to hire -- you've already hired all the pilots and flight attendants that you need for this year? If you could just kind of help us understand kind of where those the good guys are for \u201819?\nScott Sheldon: Yes. Dan, this is Scott. Yes, 2018, it was just you're carrying a lot of crews, particularly as you're really -- you're flying 37 MD-80s, you\u2019re fully staffed for that. And as it draws it down and then you put people into a 70-day cycle to transition to an Airbus, you\u2019re definitely carrying excess. I think our productivity was really around 50% locker pay. We\u2019ll have to pace. We think we'll drive maybe 5 to 6 points higher in 2019, so that will definitely be a good guy, taking utilization up a little bit from \u201818 to \u201819 will definitely help. We continue to see real positive movement in maintenance and repairs. We use the guide everything [ph] for aircraft. We think this -- historically, if you\u2019re targeting $75,000 per aircraft per month type profile, that would be a win for us and we're continuing to see movement towards that. And then maybe a bad guy is the DNA, [ph] which we highlighted and try to give color on. The impact on an asset base is definitely up and that's partly because of the write down, but just importantly as we introduced a lot of more expensive aircraft as part of the transition. So I think from a base of the financial statement, it's pretty straightforward and where the good guys are into \u201819 and \u201820. \nDan McKenzie: Yes. Very good. And then, I guess I\u2019m just wondering if I can follow-up on an earlier question. Maury, you referenced the appeal of the credit card and the information world that we live in today. And so, as we just kind of think about credit card spend, just kind of more directly with respect to how it can contribute to Allegiant, what might the credit card spend perhaps look like in three years, five years as you think about the contribution that it has with respect to revenue, third-party revenue, so to speak?\nMaury Gallagher: Scott DeAngelo will answer that. \nScott DeAngelo: You bet. Happy to add color on that. So, to build on what Drew said earlier, we reiterate again that by end of 2020, the credit card program, as we know today, will be contributing at least $50 million in EBITDA to the business. Couple of other areas and color to think about it. Above and beyond that, we\u2019ve began to leverage already existing partnerships but with minor league baseball. We\u2019re starting the season. You\u2019ll see some 44 of their largest teams exposing to 15.5 million fans the ability to get the Allegiant card. And to just quickly put that in perspective, that 15.5 million, if you think of a stadium like an airplane, appreciating the differences would be 97,000 flights, just shy of what Allegiant did in 2018. So, that\u2019s just one example of how we\u2019re scaling the exposure of it. If you take the other assets, see them, family entertainment centers, golf courses or rather existing sponsorship or partnership deals, they become very asset light ways to distribute the credit card. So, we\u2019ll keep posted on the success rate of that. But, you can begin to see that at least from an exposure point of view, we\u2019ll be doubling, tripling, quadrupling who we\u2019re exposing to the card and then expect to see continued great growth from that.\nDan McKenzie: I see. Okay. Thanks for the time, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hi. Just one question on some of these -- on the FEC and maybe Teesnap. What\u2019s the size of that while you say you kind of get to the scale? And maybe kind of the more interesting question is kind of is it in a base case assumption for these kind of various businesses pan out, in like 5 to maybe a little bit long, let\u2019s say once those business mature, what\u2019s the mix between kind of the airline side versus kind of these non-airline businesses you think from profit mix standpoint? \nJohn Redmond: When you look at that -- I\u2019ll start with Teesnap, when you look at adding the potential that 800 courses in the next year, I think I mentioned in a response to some of the earlier questions that the year one of a course life, if you will, is the install year. And the most profitable years are years two and out. Really the earnings starts to mature in three and out. So, we would have a number of courses at the end of 2019 to have a cash flow positive business, if they were in mature years. But, the fact that at the end of 2019, a lot of those courses are going to be within the first year or second year, it won\u2019t be cash flow positive right away. So, the number of courses we can be cash flow positive with is just -- it would be pushed out into the second year or a third year of their existence. That\u2019s why I say, as you move into \u201820 you start to get to a breakeven type of scenario, in \u201821 you get meaningful a cash flow positive story. The FECs, if you just opened up one for instance, you would be cash flow positive that day. The challenge you have, as you start to scale up and open more, you\u2019re always running into preopening expenses that are masking some of the earnings, right? So, that\u2019s why I\u2019d say, it takes a little bit of scale. And I am going to say like three or four of those to be open where you start to get a cash flow positive story.  So, it's a great story. It's not like it's years out. That's why we're pointing to the back end of \u201820 and into \u201821 when these start to be meaningful and they're not a cash drag.\nSavi Syth: Okay. And then, from a profitability mix standpoint, like how big can these businesses be relative to the airline side?\nJohn Redmond: It's all a guessing game at this stage as to how big they actually can get.\nMaury Gallagher: The airline is going to dominate the project for the foreseeable future. So, that's -- don't expect to change, Savi. So, at this point, we don't want to go on a record. It\u2019s just going to be this percentage or that percentage at this juncture.\nOperator: And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would not like to turn the call back to Maury Gallagher for closing remarks.\nMaury Gallagher: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

It is now pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Chris Allen, Investor Relations. Sir, you may proceed.\nChristopher Allen - Allegiant Travel Co.: Thank you. Welcome to Allegiant Travel Company's third quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call with me today are Maury Gallagher, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Redmond, the company's President; Scott Sheldon, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer; Drew Wells, our VP of Revenue & Planning; and a handful of others to help answer your questions. We will start with some commentary and then open it up to questions. The company's comments today will contain forward-looking statements concerning our future performance and strategic plan. Various risk factors could cause the underlying assumptions of these statements and our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. These risk factors and others are more fully disclosed in our filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements are based on information available to us today and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise. The company cautions investors not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which may be based on assumptions and events that do not materialize. To view this earnings release, as well as a rebroadcast of this call, feel free to visit the company's Investor Relations site at ir.allegiantair.com. With that, I'd like to turn it over to John.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: Thank you, Chris, and of course, good afternoon, everyone. So, when I read through the release again and read the opening part of that and of course Maury's comments in particular, all I can say is wow, what an impressive quarter and an impressive year-to-date. It really has been special. Starting with the fleet transition with the MD-80s coming out after Thanksgiving, that has gone off without a significant problem other than a few induction issues back in early July. Such a transition is unprecedented, of course, for a company of our size especially given the timeframe of accomplishment. Of course, transitions put a focus on the movement of planes in and out, but one can't overlook the significant hiring and training that impacts so many departments and individuals. So, incredible job by the entire team across the board. Of course, while all of that was taking place, the performance of the airline has improved beyond any of your expectations but in line with our high standards. The same incredible effort that went into the fleet transition and performance improvement is now being directed to rightsizing the organization as we move into 2019 and beyond. Of course, from time to time, I read some of the reports and I read some of the naysayers out there, those times when any of you doubt the company and its employees' ability or dedication to do something just reflect on what's been accomplished over the last 18 months. The foundation has now, of course, been set for Allegiant 2.0. Part of that foundation work in 2018 has been in our IT area which is critical to what we do. Very key management personnel have been added, organizational changes made and business processes reinvented. All the programming effort relating to the 2020 revenue initiatives laid out in the Investor Day back in 2016 will be substantially completed by the end of 2019, with the full benefits expected to be realized in 2020. Touch base a little bit on Sunseeker, of course we provided complete visibility on Sunseeker during the recent Investor Day, so nothing new to report. But wanted to touch on a couple of points given the frequent questions I get from time to time. We expect to have a marketing and preview center opened on site by the end of January 2019, so just in a couple of months. We expect vertical construction to begin in February of 2019 but the targeted opening around October of 2020. Again, these dates have all been previously communicated. Our model rooms are currently being built here in Las Vegas at our company headquarters. We're building a standard hotel guest room and a two-bedroom suite which should be completed by December 15. So, whenever any of you are in town after that date, we'd love to show you this product. Quickly, I want to touch base on disclosures and guidance. We expect to provide full 2019 guidance in conjunction with our 2018 year-end earnings release. Guidance will be provided consistent with that provided for 2018 with the added guidance disclosures for non-airline businesses. Again, you saw that in the current release, and we will continue with that. So, for the first time, we provided this non-airline disclosure in the release and I hope you find that worthwhile in your analysis of our business model going forward. With regard to the non-airline businesses, we will provide 2019 guidance for preopening expenses rather than operating results for the going concern businesses and CapEx. In addition, we will provide actuals at the end of each quarter and year-to-date similar to what we have just disclosed. And on that, I'll turn it over to Drew.\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Thank you, John and good afternoon, everyone. We continue to be pleased with load factor performance as we continued year-over-year expansion for the fourth consecutive quarter. In August, we announced eight new routes including service to three new cities Albany, New York; St. George, Utah; and Tucson, Arizona, bringing our total scheduled service airport served to 121. In the third quarter, we recorded a TRASM of negative 0.2 cents including the impact of new revenue recognition rules. I believe it's important to note that we were not involved in the heavily discounted fare environment of 2017 that would have aided in the comp this year. We talked at length during the July call about the new RM system performance during the summer. However, we are very encouraged by the return to previous performance as evidenced by the strong load factor results in September. Turning to the fourth quarter, we had talked about headwinds associated with the hurricanes and the Vegas shooting last year as we enter the quarter. But noticeable load factor gains from the RM system and a stronger bounce back for Florida bookings eased that headwind a bit. As we saw at the end of Q3, demand looks strong and I believe the fourth quarter will end up with the best year-over-year TRASM performance of 2018. Obviously, a contributor to the fourth quarter TRASM optimism is the ASM guidance at 4% to 6%. As we complete the last quarter of our aggressive MD-80 retirement and transition to a full Airbus fleet, the growth rate, particularly in December, will be limited as we are scheduled to retire the MD-80 fleet right after the Thanksgiving travel period. With that, I'd like to turn it over to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon. Just a little bit of a broader question, not a specific guidance for 2019 but the kind of the growth over the last few years has been this kind of medium sized market, you may be smaller secondary leisure destinations. And what should we expect kind of the market characteristics to be going forward, especially in a higher fuel environment?\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Sure. So, as you look out towards 2019, I think what you'll see is some of that continuing. Primarily, the growth will be connecting the dots that exist today. There's a lot of destinations and origin cities including mid-sized cities that have yet to be connected. In addition, even in a rising fuel environment, we'll constantly be looking at new cities to grow the network. We communicated before one to two mid-sized cities a year, and I think that's still the target at least in the current fuel environment. If that rises, we'll certainly reconsider.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's helpful. Thanks, Drew. And then, I don't know if Scott's around, but I'm just kind of curious, does maintenance \u2013 it looks like there were kind of a couple of \u2013 some maintenance events in 2018. Does that pull forward some from 2019? Should we expect somewhat below average maintenance next year or is that unlikely?\nD. Scott Sheldon - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. Hey, Savi. Yeah. There's some kind of unique expenses in 3Q. Some of that directly relates to the MD-80 fleet in order to get that to the end of November. There were also some kind of fleet-wide campaigns, to kind of baseline certain aspects of the plane. For instance, we're going through specifically the APU bay and the build spec to try to normalize on a fleet basis that you're seeing some \u2013 we think some baseline expenses you wouldn't expect to continue. I think directionally, we look at kind of the $75,000 per aircraft per month kind of cadence as we move forward, and that's what we expect into 2019 and beyond.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So, not below, just kind of return to average?\nD. Scott Sheldon - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. On the 4Q growth rate of 4% to 6%, can you just remind us, is there an impact from fleet delays? Was that a higher number at one point or have you accelerated MD-80 retirements?\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: I guess, it depends on your initial reference point there. But once we made the decision to go with the more aggressive timeline through November, we've been reasonably well set at this growth rate. So there may have been a small amount of pullback especially as fuel ran up on us a little bit, but not a material downward trend.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Thanks. And then on the tax rate, what accounts for the lower or, I guess, implied negative tax rate in the third quarter specifically?\nGregory C. Anderson - Allegiant Travel Co.: Hey, Duane. This is Greg. So during the third quarter, we were able to take a refund on call it like Section 199 which is domestic production activities. And effectively, what that means is some of our internally developed software, we were able to take a refund on that. So that's primarily the reduction that you're seeing.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Does that impact sort of the normalized tax rate going forward? So I think your initial guidance this year was, what, 21%, 22%. Is that kind of how we should be thinking about it on a go-forward basis?\nGregory C. Anderson - Allegiant Travel Co.: I think first for the remainder of this year, I mean, you're going to see a reduction. So that year-to-date guidance was updated to 18% to 19%. But then as we move forward to in the following years, I think more of the what we initially guided, the 22% to 23% is probably the right tax rate moving forward.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Okay. And then just did some quick math on the new disclosure which I appreciate, I think that's great. Maybe you could just add some light on what all is in the nonairline business? I mean, I assume that's some Sunseeker OpEx but maybe some other things. It looks like it actually grew from about $3 million in the third quarter last year to almost $6 million in the third quarter of this year. So maybe just give us a sense for what's in there, why it's growing, et cetera. Thank you.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. No problem, Duane. When you look at all the entities that are currently in there, you mentioned Sunseeker, you have Teesnap, you have the Kingsway golf course that we acquired in August of this year. And you \u2013 let me see, what am I missing \u2013 oh, yeah, the FEC. So I was focused on the revenue components but there is no FEC revenue yet. So what you're seeing there is strictly Teesnap from a revenue standpoint, Teesnap and Kingsway. So going forward, we'll continue to provide as much detail as we've provided now. And as those entities individually get scale, we'll consider providing a greater amount of detail for each one of them.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Not to belabor the point, but Sunseeker OpEx, I mean how would you think about that on like a 2019 basis?\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: It's not going to be material and we're going to give you the complete guidance on that. The operating expenses that you would have, another way to look at that, I mean, the industry calls it preopening. These are expenses that relate to take like the two gentlemen that you may have met or at least were introduced to at the Investor Day, Micah and Jason. When you take those two individuals, for instance, some of their time that's spent on involved with the design of the project starts to change and starts to move into operation. So you may have their pay, in essence, capitalized early on. But as you get closer to an opening date, their pay is expensed as preopening. So, that's the nature of what you start to see or start to happen as early on when people are rotating from being capitalized to being expensed. That's the payroll side of it. Then, of course, you have all the hiring expenses and marketing expenses and all those that have to be expensed as you go as opposed to being capitalized. So, it's not going to be a substantial number and we'll give complete guidance on what we think that range is going to be for Sunseeker for FY 2019.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Thank you.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: No problem.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hello. Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. Can you say what percentage of fuel recapture you've been able to do maybe year-to-date, or is that not a way we should look at your pricing structure?\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. So, as we commented before, we're not going to be able to recapture 100% of fuel simply through pricing. That's not how our customer reacts and it's not core to our business model. You will see us make some capacity trims particularly on the fringes with off-peak, day of week, and season to be able to really recapture in earnest. But one of the elements I would like to call out as part of the 4Q strength is the yield we're seeing. There are certainly some elements of fuel recapture that we're getting in there. So, I'm hesitant to put an exact percentage on there, but we are recapturing some through the pricing environment beyond what I would have expected maybe a month or two ago.\nHelane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. So, I guess my follow-up is more like, there's a percentage of recapturing through ancillaries and a percentage through fare, right? So, I mean, could you \u2013 is it reasonable to look at those combined or based on the comments you just made, does that not even make sense?\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. So, ancillary tends to be very sticky. So, with high fuel, low fuel ancillary isn't going to move a ton, air where it will have to be recaptured and part of that comes through load factor obviously. So as we drive load factor and gather the total ancillary spend, that's where we'll get that benefit and that's easy \u2013 most easily done obviously with capacity cuts, as you have fewer seats to fill. Another point that maybe is worth talking about here is the fuel efficiency of the Airbus. If we were still in a fully MD-80 fleet, you would have seen us making more cuts to this point. By our analysis, we have somewhere between kind of $0.85 and $1 per gallon more efficient right now as we shifted into the Airbus aircraft, which is going to give us a bit more buffer and flexibility before we have to make these changes in earnest.\nHelane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for putting that out. That was very helpful. And thanks very much for answering my question.\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thanks. Scott or Drew, I guess the dollar EPS range with two months left, can you just talk about maybe directionally which end of that you think you're more likely to hit at this point?\nD. Scott Sheldon - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. So, honestly it's looking probably the mid to maybe slightly lower at this point, given what fuel is doing. Still think the cost execution given the year that we've had to undertake has been great. All the trends that we thought would be there and the pressure points that we need to drive through the business as we go into 2019 and 2020, were evident. So, I'm really happy with the pace, the operation continues to execute better than expected. So yeah, I mean, I would say the midpoint to slightly lower at this point.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then maybe a question for Scott DeAngelo if he's on the call, if not, John can probably tackle it but I think you guys said at the investor presentation for Sunseeker that you've got about 350,000 itineraries into Punta Gorda. Just wondering if you could talk about how many of those are really up for grabs, not locked to Marriott or Hyatt within their loyalty programs, not second homeowners, customers that you can really try and convert into Sunseeker itineraries. Thank you.\nScott DeAngelo - Allegiant Travel Co.: You bet. This is Scott. I'll start. I can answer a part of that. So, by the time Sunseeker opens that 350,000 will be more like 400,000 and I would say right now that, conservatively speaking, assume that one out of every five is already affixed to a second home, and the other 4 out of 5 or 80% are up for grabs whether that they currently stay at a hotel, they currently rent a vacation property, and/or even involved in some flexible time share. Don't have information on who is tied with which loyalty program, but I'd offer up that it's been (00:18:55) our experience that too is more pliable than one would think as most of these customers have multiple memberships and loyalty programs. And we'll be happy to offer them ours once we have Sunseeker up.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah, most definitely and we're actually on a trailing 12 basis, the number is closer to 365,000 inbound itineraries. And just to even show you how clean that number is Joe, we've stripped out any of those inbound itineraries that may even have a Florida address. So, some people have second homes in Florida. They may originate. They could look like a round tripper, but if they have a Florida address, we stripped it out. So, that may even make Scott's numbers a little bit stronger when you look at maybe it's greater than what that data point would actually show. But the 400,000 we're comfortable believing in that number when you look at 2020, given the trajectory of what's been happening with the inbound itineraries.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And is an itinerary the same thing as one passenger? Are those interchangeable or...\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: No. If you, your significant other, and family members, the wife or someone books everyone on there, that's one itinerary. So, you can have anywhere from one to eight people on an itinerary.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Hey. I guess two questions here. So, John, you did say that it sounds like groundbreaking is going to start in February of 2019, and I think you also indicated that you'd give us a bit more detail in \u2013 on the \u2013 when the annual numbers come out, which I guess is going to be sometime in January. But kind of if we think about it at this point, some cash will go out the door for construction costs. Are we to assume that that's just coming out of internally generated funds or are you seeking like a construction loan, some sort of financing to kind of kick off that activity?\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: Michael, on those points \u2013 and I think my comments are consistent with what I've been saying in the past, but we will always look at and pursue potential financing sources. So, the fact that we have made commentary around being able to, as a company, to look at Sunseeker as we have the ability to fund that internally, that's true, that hasn't changed and that's of course given all the work done to-date and the strong performance we expect going forward. But we will continue to look at financing opportunities going forward. And if there's one we like, we'll be all over it.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then my second question, either you, John or Drew, when we think about and I know it's a little early since we'll get the data in January but just kind of an early rough feel for 2019 capacity growth. The fact that accelerating out of the MD-80s that there \u2013 you may be coming off of a lower base as you ramp up into 2019. Should we assume that growth will be less than what we saw this year? Any color around 2019 capacity growth would be great. Thanks.\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Sure. Yeah, this is Drew. I think it's fair to say that we would expect next year to \u2013 hi. I think it's fair to say we expect 2019 to be lower than 2018. As you look out, we have our first quarter schedule out for sale right now. I think that's going to be on the lower end. So I would expect 2019 to surpass that. So we have some really, really wide goalpost there, you could probably work with those.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good. Thanks. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nUnknown Speaker: Hi. This is actually Matt (00:23:08) on for Brandon. So I was just hoping you could quickly remind us, as you receive the final aircraft and taking the MD-80s out of the fleet, what kind of overhang and pilot training or any other expenses is still kind of related and kind of lingering related to the transition?\nD. Scott Sheldon - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. Hi. This is Scott. Yeah, if you look at the number of MD-80 shells, there will be some folks that will be going through training to be available for the March peak. And if you kind of back into any sort of pilot per aircraft metric back to when we had a single fleet type adjusted for the new 117 rules, you could come to a number where you're carrying $30 million to $35 million in excess labor as we grow into it over the next couple years. And so, it's pretty substantial. As far as the actual training events. Everything then is on a scheduled cadence because everyone will be trained on the same fleet type.\nUnknown Speaker: Okay. And so, that kind of comes down through the next year or so or what's the timing on that?\nD. Scott Sheldon - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah, so we bottom obviously at the end of the year. I think we have, in the release, 76 frames. And I think we're growing upwards of 12 frames to 13 frames next year. And so, you start to gain some of that efficiency back from a single fleet type perspective.\nUnknown Speaker: Okay. Great. And then just kind of on that point, as you get more shells in the fleet, and then with the capability of having \u2013 utilizing kind of the newer aircraft a little bit more, should we assume that there could be more peak growth or more kind of optimization in the schedule potentially?\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. So, there's really two ways that we can grow the peak days. One is shell growth, so that will be the biggest help. Additionally with the improved economics on the Airbus we can push the hours of the day a little bit. So, I would expect to see kind of your fleet-wide utilization particularly on peak days grow a bit, which is consistent with how we operate the Airbus today. But once you kind of get the MD-80s out of there, you'll see a bit more in earnest.\nUnknown Speaker: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks, guys. Got a few questions here. I did join the call late, so I didn't quite follow the IT changes but if I could just revert back to a prior Investor Day presentation, are you still on track to deliver the e-commerce benefits that you previously outlined in 2019 or are those likely perhaps to get pushed back?\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: No, it was \u2013 Dan, this is John Redmond. We had talked about in that Investor Day back in 2016, I believe it was, about these initiatives being done in 2020. So, the comments that we're making was that all of programming effort relating to the revenue initiatives will be done in 2019. So, we will see those benefits in 2020 as we communicated back then.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got it. But it looks like there's a fairly big step up in 2019 from those benefits. I think $70 million was targeted. And so I guess that's sort of what I'm wondering is, if that step up is \u2013 gets pushed back to 2020.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: We never provided any guidance on any of the years in between. So, we literally showed 2017 to 2020 without any middle years, if you will. Having said that, when we provide guidance on 2019, you'll see that some of the benefits will start to come through in 2019 on some of those initiatives.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Drew, I think related to this, it looks like third-party products inflected nicely in the third quarter relative to the first half of the year and even last year. And I'm just wondering what is it that you guys did differently in the third quarter and is that \u2013 how do we think about these initiatives as we look ahead into the fourth and next year?\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Sure, Dan. Really, the biggest winner we have on the third party is the credit card. It continues to exceed kind of all of our expectations both September of 2016 when we launched it up until recently. New account growth continues to churn along very nicely, and spend has become by far the biggest piece of that. So that really is a big credit card victory and I expect that to continue to expand into next year.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Good. One other question, if I can sneak one last one in here, the 186-seat project. What is the pace of the modifications currently? So what percent of the fleet was completed at the end of the \u2013 is going to be completed at the end of the fourth quarter versus, say, the third quarter? And what percent of the fleet do you expect to complete in 2019?\nGregory C. Anderson - Allegiant Travel Co.: Hey, Dan. This is Greg. We \u2013 so as we take delivery of the A320-series aircraft kind of going forward, we expect all of those to be modified to 186 seats. And also of course, the new aircraft will come delivered or have come delivered with 186 seats. So the way I would think about it from the A320 perspective as we mature the fleet, 25 will be under the 177 variant, and then the remaining will be the 186-seat variant.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And that's for what period, sorry, that 25?\nGregory C. Anderson - Allegiant Travel Co.: I think that's through the end of 2020. Yeah, 2020.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And are you, I guess, since you've got the majority of the fleet in that modification, I guess, presumably \u2013 safe to say those are seats that you're able to revenue manage or optimize that revenue at this point?\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. This is Drew again. We work very closely with the fleet team as we think about the layout and what we view the kind of the optimal to be. So we'll continue to review, but everything we look at so far suggests that 186 is the best for the revenue team.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the time you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Steve O'Hara with Sidoti. Your line is now open.\nStephen O\u2019Hara - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Can you just \u2013 within the other revenue line, can you just remind me and it picked up in the third quarter. I guess I would have thought that would have come down, I thought that was due to some aircraft you had on lease that you'll eventually take delivery of. Can you just tell me what's going on there?\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yes. So, one of the biggest drivers on that is really our Teesnap program which really exceeded I think our expectations from the beginning of the year. And to your point, we did think that other rev was going to come down more with some of the timing on the old planes. But Teesnap really filled in that gap nicely.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: And the other tick up we had in there again beginning with August of this year would have been the Kingsway golf course. So both Kingsway and Teesnap are part of that other.\nStephen O\u2019Hara - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. And then maybe just on the fuel burn for next year. I mean, should \u2013 with MD-80s out at the end of November, I guess. I mean should the $87 per gallon kind of revert to $85 or so next year?\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yes. It's definitely trending that way. I think if you look at the shells we're taking next year it's split. I think it's six or seven A319s and the rest A320s. Yes. So obviously the target continues to be $85.\nStephen O\u2019Hara - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come by Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Scott, just on the CASM ex outlook over the next couple of years, is the baseline for 2019 that CASM ex is down or do the labor efficiencies that you get from kind of completing the fleet transition not really come in until 2020? How should we think about that?\nD. Scott Sheldon - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. So, the biggest impact we can have on ex-fuel is definitely the labor side. I think you'll start to see continued movement in the right direction next year with the lion's share into 2020. We continue to like \u2013 we continue to see really nice maintenance trends, the M&E expense line item continues to come in, although there's a little noise in the third quarter. None of that should be recurring in nature. So, the things \u2013 the areas that we identified and where we thought there was going to be pressure, they're there. But the good thing is, this is quite manageable. So, if we can bring on additional shells and we can maybe pull some of that efficiency to the left, but we do have long term efficiency targets. But flight crews being the lion's share of that is where we're going to see the biggest movement ex fuel. But you'll see movement into 2019 and then the biggest movement into 2020.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Should the expectation be that CASM ex is down in 2019 or should we temper those expectations?\nD. Scott Sheldon - Allegiant Travel Co.: No. I think if you \u2013 since we've started the shell adjusted CASM ex for non-airline related expenses, you should see very nice moves in the core business. And so, that's the whole point, right, is the underlying core business continues to execute. We continue to see really positive trends in the right areas and in the areas where there might be a little problematic, that's where the focus is. So, no, we're liking what we see.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, John, I think the strategy is to build a property, run it effectively, and then use that experience to go get some management contracts. What are those properties saying to you now if you approach them without a property? I guess I'm a little bit surprised that you can't use the experience you have with the airline to develop that hotel management business and some of these smaller properties without actually building your own?\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: Look, we haven't had a conversation directly to-date yet, so that's one. And when I say conversation directly to-date, I've had some, just some periphery type fringe conversations without getting into the nitty-gritty surrounding that. There's folks that are involved in looking at new development opportunities that I started to have some conversations with. So that could be something that's an opportunity. But I think when you look at managing these properties, part of what we want to offer is several solutions. We've mentioned everything from software to management to branding, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot of things that would be part of that package and the entirety of that package won't be ready for us to roll out until we're done with a lot of the IT efforts around the resort. So that puts a little bit of a governor on how quickly we can move even if there was significant opportunity. Having said that, there is stronger marketing relationships we can have with hotel properties that we include in our booking channel. And those are ones that we're intending to strengthen, as we change out the mix of properties that are in the booking channel. We've done because of the work we did in Florida around what we want to do there. We've done work in other markets and we know that in some cases we don't have all the right product that we need on that booking channel. So we're starting to make adjustments in that regard as well and then having conversations with the properties that remain to strengthen the financial opportunities with those remaining properties. So, I think there is some baby steps there along the way. There's no doubt. I would still hope that we could nail a couple of management contracts, if you will, before we open the property. But it's always easier to point to something that you have going. And that's why I think the opportunity for us is going to be after we start to go vertical. We can actually point to a project, point to a real project that's coming out of the ground, and then I think it's \u2013 it will be easier to make those things happen. The other thing is it's hard to have any visibility on to this, the length of those contracts that are in place at those properties. The one takeaway I would have is given how old a lot of the properties are, I would think that those contracts, they may have shorter tails to them than what you would typically find of course, if you only had product that was 5 years or 10 years old. So, keep our fingers crossed that opportunities happen quicker, but we will be chasing them down. So, I'm hoping over the next couple of quarters, I can give you a lot more visibility in that regard.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, I just had a quick follow-up. On the fleet \u2013 I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand. So what do you expect the fleet \u2013 I know you've had a few aircraft slip from this year to next year, what do you expect to end your 2019? Are you still like thinking of roughly at 100 aircrafts or what should we expect there?\nGregory C. Anderson - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah, I mean, that's what we put out there probably. I mean we've seen some delays as we talked about in the last earnings call. I think by 2019, I mean, we're still expecting that number, Savi. But in \u2013 when we give our guidance for 2019, there may be some puts and takes on that a little bit.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Dan, your line is now open, please proceed.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks, operator, and thanks for the extra time here, guys. Drew, I'm just wondering if you could talk high level what you're seeing from the demand backdrop here. The stocks are incredibly volatile. I think there's a lot of worries about interest rates, the impact on the business, the stock market has been abnormally volatile here. But at least one thing that I've noticed tracking bookings is that there's not a lot of volatility in underlying demand. But I'm just wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing high level, what would worry you, what doesn't worry you from where you sit right now?\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. So, I think you hit it spot-on. I haven't seen a ton of volatility in terms of demand. We've seen a lot of strength for the last \u2013 at least the last couple of months now in terms of forward bookings. And so I don't \u2013 I really don't have a lot of concern about right now, particularly with fuel where it is. If fuel were to drop and spur even more capacity growth through the industry, I think you'll see a lot of issues in the off-peak periods, think late January. Even today, I think we're still industry-wide too heavy in capacity during those periods. And so, I anticipate we'll hear about that as we get into the April call timeframe.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And then, I guess, Drew, while I've got you, one thing I've observed over this past year is the volume of seats that the legacy airlines are pricing at \u2013 there's a lot of inventory, pardon me, that the legacy airlines are pricing out ultra-low cost carrier levels has diminished. And I'm wondering if you've seen the same thing, because I know you don't compete directly with them, but there is some sort of relative umbrella that you can price under. And I'm just wondering if you can talk about sort of what you're seeing from that perspective, whether you feel like you're benefiting from that somewhat in the back half of the year, and just how that's evolved for you guys.\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. So I'll caveat this as what you talked about and that there is very little overlap. So from the same perspective that we weren't really affected when there were a lot of seats priced at the base economy rate. We're not going to see a ton of windfall from that either. On the few select routes where we might have that head-to-head competition, you might see something on the margin but it's not going to be anything noticeable or nothing that's worthy of calling out in my opinion.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Very good. Thanks for the extra time.\nDrew Wells - Allegiant Travel Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So now, it is my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Maury Gallagher for closing comments or remarks.\nMaurice J. Gallagher, Jr. - Allegiant Travel Co.: Thank you, all, very much. Appreciate you're listening in. We'll see you in 90 days. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "ALGT", "quarter": 2, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-07-26 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2018 Allegiant Travel Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to our host for today, Chris Allen, of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nChristopher Allen: Thank you. Welcome to Allegiant Travel Company's second quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call with me today are Maury Gallagher, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Redmond, the company's President; Scott Sheldon, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer; Drew Wells, our VP of Revenue Planning; and a handful of others to help answer questions. We will start with some commentary, and then, open it up to questions. The company's comments today will contain forward-looking statements concerning our future performance and strategic plans. Various risk factors could cause the underlying assumptions of these statements and our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. These risk factors and other are more fully disclosed in our filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements are based on information available to us today. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise. The company cautions investors not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which may be based on assumptions and events that do not materialize. To view this earnings release as well as a rebroadcast of the call, feel free to visit the company's Investor Relations site at ir.allegiantair.com. With that, I'd like to turn it over to John.\nJohn Redmond: Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Of course, another great quarter, as you can see in the release we've put out. A lot of detail in there, talking about all things are happening. But first and foremost, I have to say thank you to the - all of the employees we have here at Allegiant. We - they've done a great job this quarter in executing on - the continued execution on the transition we've been going through from a fleet standpoint. And as importantly, a lot of things that you don't see are a lot of advances we've been making here operationally that aren't even reflected in the numbers as of yet. So the performances gets better and better, and we're very proud of that as we move forward. Some of that, of course, is recognized in the recent industry surveys that have been out there as of late. J.D. Power, of course, had us listed as the most improved in customer service. And then, you look at the American Customer Satisfaction Index, as well as Forrester Market Research, both of which identified the airline as having the largest year-over-year improvement. So we're very proud of the progress we've been making. And again, to be able to do it against a very difficult fleet transition that, thank God we're at the back end of that. That's great. Touch base real quick on Sunseeker. We did have a comment in the release regarding a financing and timing. We're looking at having that done in 60 to 90 days. So we'll be happy to put that behind us. But I did want to mention as part of that, that we fully anticipate having a dedicated, either roadshow or investor type day that would do nothing but explain that project in significant detail. I mean, obviously, as of to date, we haven't been able to do that for a multitude of reasons. But as we concluded -- get closer to concluding on our financing, then we will be very comfortable sharing a tremendous amount of detail and data on that project. So stay tuned. We look forward to doing that, so that'll be shortly after we get the financing done. And of course, that would be -- that information will be released as well. And on that, I'll turn it over to Scott.\nScott Sheldon: Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to thank all our team members and partners across the network for delivering another solid operational quarter. Despite some pretty significant scheduling challenges, driven by some unplanned retirements, 2 MD-80s in particular and some delays associated with the induction of 6 A320s, the team is still able to drive substantial operational improvements in virtually every area. Most notably, the team drove a 1.3-point increase in controllable completion factor to just under 99.5%; reduced the regular operations expense by just over $6 million; and most importantly, reduced the number of operationally impacted customers by over 50% year-over-year, pretty fantastic results, given the circumstances. And then, lastly, a couple of comments on changes to our full year 2018 guidance. As you can see in the release, we've provided a number of updates, which are primarily driven by changes to our fleet plan and updated assumptions on full year 2018 fuel prices. As mentioned on earlier calls, our 2018 results were going to be largely impacted by our ability to execute on a pretty aggressive fleet plan. Our initial plan called for the induction of 30 A320 aircraft and the retirement of our entire MD-80 fleet by year-end. Although the MD-80 retirement schedule remains intact, we're experiencing some delays in used Airbus deliveries and some critical Airbus kits needed for induction. That being said, our fleet plan now reflects the reduction in planned inductions from 30 to 25 units by year-end. And we plan to end the year with 77 aircraft in service. Based on reducing the number of aircraft in service and taking into consideration some potential timing events, we've reguided our ASMs per gallon. We've previously guided 77.5 to 79.5. So we've taken a point out of the top end. We have reduced our ASM growth profile from up 11% to 15% to now up 9% to 11%; recast D&A and M&A expense per aircraft per month from 115 to 120 and 80 and 85respectively. And lastly, we did take our EPS guidance from up $10 to $12 per share down to $9 to $10. So as I mentioned, this is largely driven by timing of aircraft. 2Q was impacted. There was upwards of 8 units, cost us nearly a point in ASM production in 2Q. But with that, I want to turn it over to Drew Wells. As you guys are all aware, Lukas Johnson has left the company to pursue another opportunity. Drew is the new Lukas, and he's better looking for sure. So with that, I'll let Drew talk about some of the network and pricing trends we're seeing in the environment.\nDrew Wells: Well, thank you very much, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Lukas' shoes are definitely a big one to fill, but I'm very grateful for this opportunity and look forward to furthering the commercial success that we've experienced under his leadership. Second quarter revenue results came in quite strong on the back of our third consecutive quarter of both positive year-over-year growth in load factors and air ancillary per passenger. This is the first time since 2011 that we've had such a load factor streak. We launched a total of 28 new routes in the quarter, including service to three new cities: Charleston, South Carolina; Sarasota, Florida; and Nashville, Tennessee. We are very encouraged by the early results in these markets and look forward to developing three new destinations within our network. On to the numbers. Including the impact of the new revenue recognition rule, Q2 TRASM improved by 0.5 points year-over-year. We previously assumed a 200 basis point headwind due to the Easter holiday shift. However, the next-gen RM system continued the strong success we saw in the best flights through the spring break period, and drove exceptional returns during the first 10 days of the quarter to overcome the majority of that headwind. We continue to learn about and improve the RM system on a daily basis. As we talked about from the start, this system will take time to fully develop across all of our different flight profiles. We've seen meaningful results through off-peak periods and hyper focused peaks like spring breaks and holidays. One area where we still have room to improve the system is through the summer period. While they're certainly not setting us back, it's unlikely we achieve the same gains that we've seen through the other periods. We are, however, confident enough in the results from the 75% of non-summer flights to be in pricing all flights on the next gen system starting with our winter schedule. This is a very exciting milestone and a big testament to the work put in by the team as we continue to push this forward. While we will still be growing peak capacity more than off-peak in the third quarter, that gap has narrowed for some targeted market and capacity cuts due to rising fuel and some irregular operational-driven cancels at the beginning of this month. As noted in the earnings release, and as Scott noted, we are revising our full year ASM guidance lower to a new range of 9% to 11% due to slower-than-expected aircraft deliveries, in addition to the aforementioned targeted fuel cuts. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is actually Matt on for Brandon. Sorry about that. I just wanted to talk - kind of go back to the growth, the reduction in growth this period. I wanted to understand kind of the - at the Investor Day last year, there was some talk of expanding to some smaller to middle - some of the mid-market cities. And I wanted to talk about kind of competitive capacity and what the management team was seeing in that regard.\nDrew Wells: Yes. So we're so very, very focused on the competitive capacity that's out there. And we're holding still with our range of about 80% to 75% non-competitive market. So that hasn't changed as we viewed our network moving forward, and including the network we operate today.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Just another question. I just noticed that on the press release of kind of some of the new hires on the Sunseeker team. They've kind of started referring it to as the Resorts division. I was wondering if there'd be - we'd see greater kind of division among the teams going forward and how the management structure would kind of ultimately work towards.\nJohn Redmond: Sure. We hired a gentleman by name of Micah Richins. Micah came on as the Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer of Sunseeker Resorts. So he will be responsible for everything regarding that project that we're doing, and of course, any future projects. He'll have complete responsibility for all of those. We just have a couple of other people on staff, and we would probably start to bring some additional management talent on some time probably in the next 60 to 90 days as well. But we're continuing to run as lean and mean as we can until we have to scale up. So you won't see - at the resort itself, you're going to probably have somewhere in the 500 to 600 employees, but a significant number of those would never come on until, call it, a month before opening. So we'll continue to scale in the management side, at the resort level. But those are people that are dedicated 100% to the resort and don't have any crossover responsibilities. People that have some crossover responsibilities, whether it's finance, HR, marketing, et cetera, the ones that you would expect, I mean, there's some limited time and energy going in from these various areas now, but it's not significant.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is open\nHunter Keay: Hey, thanks. It turns out you've got this new earnings EPS range. I mean, you've already earned $6.50 so far for the first half of the year. Capacity growth is slowing, but it's not that much driven in the first half. Fuel is not that much higher. I'm a little surprised to see you cut the guide. It would imply that you've got to do a pretty bad second half margin, like the worst you've done in like 4 years. Are you baking in some conservatism on this new range? Or are you just -- or if not, what do you expect to get worse, cost or revenues? Non-fuel costs or revenues, I should say.\nScott Sheldon: Hunter, this is Scott. If you kind of break it down, we're seeing - if you look at ex fuel, despite [indiscernible] and a little more than the initial guide, that still remains a good story. I think, directionally, we said we should see year-over-year reductions in ex fuel, and that we should continue on through 2020. There's just a lot - there still just a lot of moving pieces as it relates to, obviously, the fleet plan we highlighted, that's probably the single most impactful item. We hadn't addressed fuel. I think even at our 1Q earnings release, I think we took fuel up maybe $0.02 or $0.03. So this is a pretty big move from, call it, low $2.20s to mid $2.35s. So I think on a full year, that's another $35 million to $37 million. I can -- Drew kind of weighed in on kind of the inner revenue strength we're seeing. But those are kind of the bigger items. I think if you had to quantify margin performance, three is definitely lighter than four for sure. Four, at this point, is looking pretty strong. But there's really nothing else other. We're still being very conservative. Obviously, the timing [indiscernible] on some of these planes coming in. The expectation, despite the team doing a really good job managing through a pretty tight schedule with the reduced units, we still put together a pretty good operation. It's our regular [indiscernible] a little higher than we anticipated, for sure. We think there's going to be some headroom as we go through the end of the year. Drew, I don't know if you got anything on the revenue side.\nDrew Wells: Sure, I'll tack on real quick, kind of going back to the initial comments. When we're first thinking about full year revs, we have built in some of those gains from the RM system. So like I said, while it's not holding us back moving forward, especially through the third quarter. We're a little bit disappointed at where RM system ended up relative to previous expectations.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Yes, just the price you gave me, given what you said about the RM system, and the winter, and how you came out in 2Q, it just seems like you can do better than this guide. But we'll see. Okay. Thanks. And then, my second question is Sunseeker-related. John, you've got a lot of experience running casinos. People I talked to tell me you did a pretty good job doing it. So why don't you put a casino in this place? I mean, it seems like -- no, I'm serious. I mean, like you know it. I mean, there's some Native American tribes down in Florida, and I don't know anything about this business. But have you thought about -- I know you bought a golf course. You're obviously beefing this place up a little bit. Have you thought about putting a casino in there?\nJohn Redmond: It's obviously something against the law. It's kind of funny. Every time I speak anywhere in Florida, everyone -- that's like the first or second question I get. And when you tell people you can't, they always tell me I'm lying. But we can't. The Seminole tribe has rights to gaming in the state of Florida. So the only way you'd ever going to get gaming in the state of Florida is for the Seminoles to give that right up, and I don't see that happening anytime in the not-too-distant future. The only opportunity that could present itself, and we haven't even explored it, so I don't want someone to walk away that this might be something we're going to do. But I have no idea what the recent changes in the sports betting laws, whether that would open up an opportunity. Again, that's not something we've even looked into. But to the extent there was something, I would imagine, it would be limited to just that.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Redmond: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Helane Becker of Cowen. Your line is now open.\nConor Cunningham: Hey, guys, it's actually Conor Cunningham on for Helane. So there's still been some talk in the industry about peak versus non-peak unit revenue trends. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there? And maybe where the capacity adjustments are happening? I assume that's on the off-peak flying? Thanks.\nDrew Wells: Yes. Yes. Conor, this is Drew. You're exactly right on there. We haven't seen, I guess, significant capacity cuts yet, but what we have seen has come through the off-peak period. In general, I think, we're still looking at the same environment that we've largely seen for a few years, where capacity is generally right-sized during the peak periods, but still a bit high during the off-peaks that will continue to be a headwind against unit rev.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then, maybe a follow-up on Hunter's question. Just on your capacity growth commentary and the reductions kind of going on with EPS. It seems like -- maybe I'm confused. Would you have not lowered capacity growth in 2018 if it had not to do with the delays of the aircraft? Or did fuel kind of -- I would assume fuel played a role within that on some level? Thanks.\nDrew Wells: Yes. This is Drew, again. So fuel definitely did play a role. I would say, at this point, it's still outweighed on the fleet. But some portion is certainly related to fuel.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then, just to follow up on that. How are you kind of -- how are you like approaching 2019 with the context of all that? I would imagine your deliveries are going to be a little bit more elevated in 2019 now. Can you just talk about how you're viewing -- I mean, I know it's early. How are you kind of like thinking like 2019 capacity growth? Thanks.\nDrew Wells: Yes. It's obviously still a bit early, and we're not going to be guiding anything for 2019 now. We're working very closely with the fleet team to kind of align when deliveries come through. And sure, we're trying to match those up with our peak periods as best as we can. So I think we're still kind of targeting similar levels to talk about in the past, and that's probably the best we can give you for today.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yeah, thank you. Maybe just kind of following up on Hunter's question as well. It seems like if you just plug in $35 million more in fuel expense, that accounts for the guidance revision. Can you just talk about what you're doing from a revenue or cost standpoint to maybe mitigate some of that pressure? It would seem like one of the advantages of your competitive position is that you should have some pricing power in these markets. So has the revenue environment gotten any better as fuel has gone up? Has it gotten any worse? And what's the way to think about any revenue impact from your primetime television appearance?\nDrew Wells: Sure. So I'll start, and maybe I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about the network promotion there. On our front, we sell to a very price-sensitive customer. We are able to kind of slowly chip away and pass through some fare increases, but it's not going to be an immediate thing for us. The biggest thing we'll be able to do is change capacity, which will drive fare increases. And to that extent, we have trimmed out particularly off-peak periods, but also a couple of market throughout the year in anticipation of fuel rising. So from the rev front, that's really the biggest lever we could pull, and we started in earnest, really, in April and have been kind of chunking away since.\nScott Sheldon: Yes, the only thing I'll add - thank you, Drew, is that, well, obviously, the first primetime mentioned was in [indiscernible]. The second one was us launching a new brand advertising campaign. And we literally saw that in conjunction with integrated elements such as our e-mail and other related digital aspects that we were able to pull right back at where we were before that thing started. So we expect going forward to continue to plow ahead from a booking's perspective.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then, Scott, I guess, the downside of your new guidance strategy here is we're not talking about CASM as much, and CASM's finally starting to do better. Can you just talk about how sustainable these trends are maybe even into 2019?\nScott Sheldon: Yes. So a couple of things. I mean, if you look at some of the larger gains, probably the biggest gains that you can see over the next couple of years as you go from three fleet types down to one, you start to regain some of the efficiencies that we experienced in the kind of 2010 time line before we were operating three fleet types. I think you're going to see the operation get much more lean than it is now. Obviously, with so many movements this year with the incremental 25 tails minus 37, our trending pipeline continues to churn out and upgrade folks into new equipments. Ideally, when you start to get more efficient with how we deploy crews. I think one of the bigger areas you're seeing a direct result of running a much better operation is in the maintenance area. If you look at maintenance expense, we've taken the guide down, which is a good thing. If you stripped out the noise of having maintenance related to MD-80s year-over-year, you would see kind of a 10% to 12% decrease in MNE per aircraft per month. Ideally, that continues to get better. I think we're just scratching the surface on what we can attain there. We're starting to see a nice uptick in operational reliability of our MD -- or excuse me, our Airbus fleet. Yes, I mean, I think across the board, I think this is going to be a really bullish ex fuel story. Not to mention we're getting the benefit of more fuel-efficient aircraft. I think you're seeing a nice uptick in ASMs per gallon, so that will continue on. It's unfortunate we're having a couple of tail slip from 2018 into 2019. But we should be able to see that benefit as we move forward. So I'm really bullish on the cost side.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. So I guess, to sum that up, ex fuel cost in '19 probably should be down year-over-year also?\nScott Sheldon: Directionally, yes.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Savanthi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavanthi Syth: Okay. Thanks, everyone. Scott, just a little bit more on the cost side. The cost execution on safety was much better than I thought. I figured, first half, maybe kind of low single-digit type declines and maybe better in the second half, just as more of the transition takes hold. Could you give any color on the cadence from that perspective? Should we kind of expect similar in the second half? Or improving because of the transition?\nScott Sheldon: The comps -- so yes, it's a good quarter. Definitely beat internal expectations. I think the -- if you're looking kind of a full year kind of guardrail, we're probably a point or two higher than what we anticipated beginning of the year. There's still, obviously, a second half of the year. Third quarter of last year was heavily impacted by irregular operations, particularly weather. We think there's some upside in the back half of the year in that respect, assuming that new environment cooperates. Some of the teams I just mentioned, I mean, it's going to take a little bit to grow out of, particularly operational productivity related to labor. Some of the other areas should really calm down and be very repetitive and sustainable, when it's more aircraft driven than anything. And so I think that if you [indiscernible] on an asset basis, they're probably higher than what we experienced in 1 and 2Q, but the underlying theme should remain.\nSavanthi Syth: That's helpful, Scott. And just digging into that a little bit more. If I looked at the wages and benefits on a per-ASM basis, that really kind of nicely flattened out. I probably would have expected more so in the second half. Was there something unusual this quarter? Or is that kind of how we should think about it kind of flattening out this year and then start to see year-over-year the clients next year as you kind of get that -- get more efficient and less training costs and things like that?\nScott Sheldon: Yes. As far as crews, you should start to see efficiency start to come back into the operation. We're kind of at peak levels as far as staffing, whether you use an FTE per aircraft. We have a [indiscernible] effect of a new in-flight, CBA. So there's new payrolls that are in effect this year, which increases some of the noise. But yes, that's going to be one of the good guys as we go forward, as we start to grow into a lot of the infrastructure that we have to support multiple fleet types. We had to -- we have secured a lot of excess heads. We run that operation, which shoots through a lot of labor. And so you're starting to see a real, consistent, repetitive operation, allows you to be more targeted in staffing levels. So yes, I think you'll start to see -- on a unitized basis, you should see that gains come in.\nSavanthi Syth: Thank you. And then, just one quick one on the fuel efficiency. As we exit this year and all the MD-80s are out, what should we kind of expect from a fuel efficiency perspective versus the 76 you reported this quarter?\nScott Sheldon: I think, long-term, we've targeted at 85 ASMs per gallon. You should start to see that continually creep up over time.\nSavanthi Syth: So do we get into the 80s as we exit this year? Or is that a little too soon?\nScott Sheldon: I think it's too soon, definitely given the number of tales that are sliding. These are all A320s, 186-seat configured.\nSavanthi Syth: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just -- I don't want to belabour [ph] the guidance, but I just want to make sure that you intend to communicate that RASM, which was up in the first half, will be down in the back half. That's what the guide implies.\nScott Sheldon: We're obviously not going to give a specific guide on that front. So I think, as we think about 2Q, we certainly outperformed what we thought, particularly as it pertains to the RM system. And I kind of come back to talking about how RM system probably isn't giving quite the gains we wanted through 3Q. But I don't think I'm going to go further than that talking about specific numbers.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Can you speak a little bit more about what drove the fleet delays?\nScott Sheldon: Yes. I'll turn it over to B.J. He's been running point on this.\nRobert Neal: Yes. They're just delays of, I guess, it's about - during the first half of this year, there were 4 aircraft, which were late getting on the certificate, and there are a handful of aircraft coming from another transaction, which are laid out of another jurisdiction. And we took that trend and applied it to the remaining airplanes in that same deal. So we're assuming those come in during 2019 now.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So the issue is your induction or the issue is -- where is the issue? Sorry.\nRobert Neal: The issue looking forward is late arrival of aircraft from another carrier.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then, just lastly, John, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you had hoped to have the financing in place by the end of the second quarter. Can you just speak to why there are delays? Is it a function of the cost of that financing? Or is it a function of your desire to have non-recourse debt, and you just haven't been able to get a party to sort of sign off on that yet? Thank you.\nJohn Redmond: No. I appreciate it, Duane. There's a lot of complexity around it in trying to come up with the best program possible. So whether that's recourse, non-recourse, size of the project and whether we want to partner, not partner, all these things are still on the table and still being evaluated. Clearly, we would like to be in a position of all of it being non-recourse. But it's just in the complexity of evaluating everything together. So we're getting closer to a resolution on all fronts, and that's why there's been some delays. But I'm pretty comfortable with the 60- to 90-day outlook on getting this finalized.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon. Not to beat a dead horse on this guidance and the change to EPS, but I guess, just the math would imply that the 3 additional points of capacity, you're just -- you're assuming a breakeven result on that. I mean, is that safe to say or fair to say?\nScott Sheldon: It wouldn't necessarily be breakeven, but we are being very targeted on how we're approaching that, and we would be trying to take out the worst lines from a schedule that we can. So it'd be kind of directionally towards that, yes.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. And then, just my second question, and this is probably to Scott. Just, you've done a really nice job on the ops over the last 6 to 9 months, recent headlines in the press on the labor front. Anything more recently or noticeable showing up in your operational performance? Or is it steady as she goes?\nScott Sheldon: No, it's really steady as she goes. Yes, unfortunately, implementing a replacement, the PBS replacement from what we have, it takes time. I mean another CBA is different. There are subtleties to every agreement that have to be taken into consideration. In general, the tool or the application that the IBT chose is to relatively small outfits. It's not being used kind of in the nature that we're going to use it. So it's just taking a long time to develop it to more supports the contractual obligation between the company and the IBT. But two, and I think importantly, is how do we communicate how these things solves and how do we articulate it to our pilot group. And so yes, unfortunately, it's just a process. We're spending a substantial amount of time and money. That's our obligation, and that's our input to this solution. So -- but other than that, I'm really proud of the operation. I think there's some attributes to the second quarter that if they would have had happened a year ago, we probably would have melted down, so to speak. It would have been a really difficult operation. And our guys really answered the bell. I think they still put out a really good quarter, despite being down 8 tails, particularly during June. So a lot of the hard work and the structural changes that we've made, they're somewhat solidifying. And so you're seeing less variation, higher execution across the board. Some of our larger basis have seen substantial improvements year-over-year. The capital that we deployed from a parts and tailwind perspective, so it's more consistent. And we give techs and pilots the tools real-time. And you're seeing trends of opportunities in the right direction. So I'm really proud of the operation.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Well done. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Crissey of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nKevin Crissey: Hi. Thanks for the time. Maybe, Drew, can you talk about how you think about which routes to pair back? Meaning, what is the financial threshold that makes you make that decision?\nDrew Wells: Sure. So there's kind of two different ways of thinking about this. If we're getting out ahead of markets, we have the ability to find -- fund markets that have multiple frequencies across the week, maybe four or more. That's where we'll have the ability to reaccom passengers as best as we can and continue to service them. If we're talking more of a fuel-driven and kind of a long-term thing, we go back to our planning process where we're planning every round-trip at certain thresholds, depending on the season. Generally, right around 20% margin as markets start to fall consistently below that. And it could, with fuel rising, those of you, the candidates, and you saw it over the summer when we trimmed down [indiscernible] to St. Pete. We had tried to push that into a summer season, and demand just didn't come around for us. So that'll stay to the winter. But that's the kind of a tangible example of how we're addressing markets in the face of rising fuel.\nKevin Crissey: Terrific. Thank you. And maybe you could talk about Punta Gorda and how you're thinking about the airline itself, the natural profitability of the airline itself versus maybe the incentives for Sunseeker to have maybe more frequency into that market.\nDrew Wells: Yes. So we've been growing Punta Gorda extraordinarily fast. We were over 30% in the last 12 months. And as it stands right now, we're kind of growing at the pace the actual infrastructure of the airport will allow. We feel we have abundant opportunities there that will take us to the next several years as the airport allows. So I don't even think that we need the incentives from Sunseeker in the meantime. Additionally, as we've launched new plane basis kind of in the middle of a town that we're able to kind of fill in the gap in the middle of the day, whereas you're morning bank from Punta Gorda goes out, that airport will stay relatively calm for the few hours until that bank comes back. As you get bases in Asheville, soon to be [indiscernible] by the end of the year, you can fill-in those gaps at the middle of the day, to get yourself a little bit more growth. While you wait on the airport infrastructure.\nKevin Crissey: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.\nDan McKenzie: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I, too, am kind of scratching my head here at the revised EPS guide. I guess, just kind of a couple things here. If we could -- just on revenue, I'm just wondering if you can talk -- is there an uptick in competitive capacity as you look at your routes in the back half of the year? Because it does seem that there is going to be deterioration in revenue. And I'm trying to reconcile it. I'm just trying to understand if it's the core business, if there's something going on in the ancillary revenue side of the business that's maybe just not firing as strong as it should. I'm just wondering if you can add a little bit more perspective on kind of how the core business is running here.\nDrew Wells: No. I still think that the core businesses is running strong. On a competitive front, we're within 1 point of where we were last year. There's not a meaningful change on that front. Like we mentioned at the beginning, we're still over three quarters of -- consecutive quarters of air ancillary growth on a per-passenger basis. So really, the biggest meaningful thing for us was trimming out of the capacity and putting a little bit of pressure on the absolute dollars from the rev front more so than a unit basis.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. And then, I guess, if I can just kind of pursue that a little bit more. I know, Maury, one of the things you love to say is capacity drives pricing. I absolutely love that phrase. And as we think about the pricing that you need to get Allegiant back to pretax earnings growth because as I think about annualizing sort of the implied pretax earnings outlook in the back half of the year, it kind of gets us to a pretax profit that's similar to 2012. What should the right size of Allegiant -- or I guess, what profit targets are you -- do you manage the business to as we look ahead here?\nMaurice Gallagher: Well, first and foremost, fuel drives near-term profits. You go back, I was looking at last year. For '16, we had like a $1.29 fuel in the first half of -- first quarter of '16. And we were facing, I think, we have $2.40 or something in June. You just -- you can't catch up to fuel when it moves like it did this quarter. So -- but over time, you anticipate that, and we've had one diligence over the time. We've generated our profitability per route, and we'll pull the capacity accordingly. And particularly, you start with some of your longer haul stuff and pull that down because that's always weaker. And we'll catch up to it here. So fuel has been moderating around the $70 a barrel on the WTI's front and jumped up to $77, $78 there for a little bit. So we'll be responsive to that. But our pricing and how we deal with things, the strong point of this business model is you still have 75%, 80% of our routes are non-competitive, and we claim capacity based on what we think we can drive margins to be able to derivative of price. So capacity drives pricing. That's how we get there. And with where we're at right now, we're not -- we're just in this final quarter of -- 2 quarters of transition. So while we think we've got everything pretty well laid out, just like last year, within the overall year, we're in pretty good shape. There may be a bump here or there from -- in the middle of the year. But third quarter, as we go into it, is our weakest quarter. So as we transition into that, we're going to push rising fuel. So hard to kind of gauge exactly where that will come out at times.\nDan McKenzie: Understood. If I can just squeeze one more in here. I guess, Scott, if we were just to strip out the cost from everything tied to the fleet transition, how much of that impacting the cost structure this year? I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of is if this were a normal year from a cost perspective, no fleet transition, what might this year look like?\nTrent Porter: Sure. This is Trent Porter. It's difficult to strip all that away in one go, primarily because of the transition of the pilots. It would be at least 1/3 to $0.005, if you take all of the pilot, extra pilots, that we're carrying as well as the operational impacts and the additional heads and programs that we carry for these different fleet types across the board. But like I said, that's not something that just goes away with us transitioning to Airbus. It takes us growing to be able to grow into the pilot heads. And then, also disciplined executing to get the other expenses out.\nDan McKenzie: Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll hop back in the queue.\nTrent Porter: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Didora of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I think, Scott, back at Investor Day, I think you threw out a $5 million EBIT per Airbus plane figure. As you come to the end of the fleet transition here, is there anything so far that you've seen that would maybe change that number, either higher or lower?\nScott Sheldon: No. Those are kind of the guardrails that we're seeing for the A320 [indiscernible] Obviously, reduce utilization. It's a completely different profile. But I think [indiscernible] I'd be still looking at $5 million to $6 million comparably, even at this fuel environment.\nMaurice Gallagher: Yes. Even at this fuel environment, yes.\nAndrew Didora: Interesting. And how long would you say does it take to ramp up to that number? Because at $5 million per Airbus aircraft, I think that's a meaningful earnings upside?\nScott Sheldon: Yes. I mean, we're still flying 27 MD-80s with the delay and some of the Airbus units coming on, we're leaning on the 80s that much more than we anticipated, which is problematic because you're crewing for a certain level of utilization. And so that's going to be with us a bit longer than we anticipated. So definitely upside in 2019 from where we sit now.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we do have a follow-up question from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Hey, guys. A couple of more for me. Sort of on that same vein, Scott, do you see any reason -- I know you feel good about still hitting that $0.0628 of CASM-X in 2020?\nScott Sheldon: Yes. I mean, I think, short of -- are you referring to our 2020 plan? We think the cost side is going to be a really good story over the next couple of years. I think you're going to see us get back to kind of a real lean, lean airline.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And then, I just want to make something totally clear. John, did you open the door to traditional debt to finance Sunseeker that is not non-recourse debt? Is that new?\nJohn Redmond: Hunter, we're just - we're looking at everything like you never heard me in the past even mention a partner. So I think it's one of those things that it's in our best interest to make sure that everything's on the table. We have preferences like you. I mean, a preference would be non-recourse and a partner. So that's always the best approach from your standpoint, and we would like to see something like that if that ever came to fruition as well. But if we did have a partner, it would be a strategic partner that brings a lot more to the table than just a wallet. So that's why we're looking at all the options, and we want to make sure that those options are all exhausted so we end up with the best outcome possible.\nHunter Keay: Great. I just want to make sure that we're on the same page here, and this isn't another sort of change. I mean, I'm not an expert on this stuff, and I need -- I think it's important that I'm able to isolate the financial risk from this thing. So I just -- I feel uncomfortable if you're going to sort of start pledging assets from the airline to this project, which is going to be hard to rope off and isolate the upside and downside risk if we're going to change the terms of how you're going to finance it. So I guess, the nature of the question is, are you still prepared to commit that whatever financing you use isolates the risk to this resort and there's no bleed into the assets of the core airline itself?\nJohn Redmond: I just think, at this point in time, it's too early to make those kind of commitments, Hunter. I think at the end of the day, for me to say that when we're still 60 to 90 days out, I don't want to mislead in any way, whether I say we're going to have a partner than not have a partner or say recourse and then it's non-recourse, vice versa. I mean, as I mentioned, the best outcome we would like to see, if we could strip it, would be to have a non-recourse piece of paper on the resort with a strategic partner. That would be the best outcome for us. And if we can make that happen, that would be great. But we are working, trying to get this financing done. And all I can say at this point in time is we're comfortable getting it done within the 60- to 90-day time frame, but I'm not going to make any more commitments as to how exactly that's going to look at the end because I can't predict that.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes. Drew, just on your commentary around the RM system maybe not working as well in third quarter. I mean, it kind of, unfortunately, coincides with Lukas leaving. So can you talk about why that's not a factor in it? And maybe provide a little bit more detail in terms of why it's not working?\nDrew Wells: Sure. I would view it more as, we -- historically we don't have as many peak periods as we do off-peak periods. The kind of machine learning aspects of this need data in order to build up kind of proper models by which to price up the flights. Off-peak periods, we have tons throughout the year. Kind of put your holidays, your spring break together and they have such a unique pattern that it was a bit easier to beat the prior RM system in terms of the top end. With summers, it's a bit more spread out. You have 10, 12 weeks of peak periods. I think there's a bit more difference when it comes to somebody traveling, say, June 17 versus June 24, and trying to balance all of those peak periods out while maintaining the top end. I think it's something that we just really need another year of data to help feed the next-gen system in order to produce the better results.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then, maybe just a question on pricing power. Why isn't there more just core pricing power? You'd think there'd be a little bit more, given how non-competitive your network is. Is this something that you try and then it doesn't work, so you pull back? Or you're just not trying because of the TV special? Or you don't want to impact your customer loyalty? Maybe just talk about that a little bit.\nDrew Wells: Sure. I think there's a couple of responses to this. Number one, we're constantly trying. So we're pricing each flight on an individual basis and pushing and pulling on the fare that's available. So with every single flight, we're trying to push where we can. We'll see whether there comes a retraction in terms of the number of bookings relative to expectation. On the second front, well, we're not necessarily competitive with another airline. We are competitive with other options for this spend. And if we push to a point by which we're too much for what they're willing to travel for, then they'll drive to their vacation or they'll spend it on an entertainment center. We're kind of fighting against a different spend relative to most of the airline -- most other airlines.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then, John, just following up on Hunter's question a little bit. It feels like the project started out, and the first standard was you were going to sell x percent of the condos before moving forward, and that changed a little bit. Then, it was we'll do non-recourse debt. That's our preferred way to do it. Now that's changing a little bit. Can you just talk about why it seems like the standards to push forward with this project continued to go down and whether that is sending you a message that maybe just the demand isn't there? Thank you.\nJohn Redmond: Sure. No problem. The preference for non-recourse debt has not changed. That is our preference. So that remains the same. When you look at the project that we announced, that was a year ago, and there's a lot of things that have happened since then that it's prudent for us to continue to evaluate how to make the best possible project. So that's what we have done over that, call it, passage of the year is evolve that to become the absolute best possible project long term. You can make money in the short term selling a condo. That might not necessarily be the best long-term strategy for us. So we are continuing to evaluate that. That's why it's taken the time that it's taken because we're coming up with the most prudent project that's going to have the greatest long-term impact for the airline. So for us, it's not all about trying to make sure that the next 30 days, 60 days or a year are the best. This is trying to make sure that this project is going to be viable, and it's going to be a very high performer for a very long period of time. So that's why as the various data points have shifted, I mean, one data point, and it doesn't drive our decision, but it's worth mentioning. And I mentioned that the past call is a tax law change. I mean, there is significant impact that tax law changes have on analyzing some of these projects. So that in and of itself is not a driving decision. It's just a data point that wasn't there when we first announced this resort back last year. So I think when we do provide all the detail, as I mentioned I would, on the project, I think everyone is going to be impressed by the potential of this project, as I say it, long-term.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Maury, I would just throw in, maybe, to you and Scott. If you really think like you can do $5 million in EBIT per 3 20 [ph], I would maybe use some of the buyback, right?\nMaurice Gallagher: Yes. Well, that's a good point. Appreciate that, Joe. And we not only think, we have proven it so far, so.\nOperator: Thank you. We do have a follow-up question from Dan McKenzie of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.\nDan McKenzie: Hey. Thanks for the follow up here. John, I just had a couple of more questions on Sunseeker. I know in the past you'd talked about, I think, in the last call, talked about 45 signed registration agreements. And I know I think you wanted to pause that a little bit to get a sales office up. How -- is that a metric that we should be looking at to sort of assess how this -- how the project is going? And from your perspective, what are your goals as you kind of think about the ramp-up of the resort?\nJohn Redmond: Well, we -- we're not completely focused, as you mentioned, on trying to drive the numbers. We got plenty of runway to do that. When I say drive the numbers, I mean the number of registrations. We are, as of now, approaching 60 in that regard, but we're not actively trying to push that as much as we can. We also have, if you go out on line on the site, which I'm sure you and others have, there's also -- you can push a become an owner button and you provide an extensive amount of information through that channel as well. So we have -- over 900 people have done that. So we have a lot of demand for those products if we choose to sell it, but there is no doubt that you can make a lot more money off running a hotel than you can selling a condo. Because as I mentioned earlier, when Hunter was asking the question, selling a condo is a great short-term strategy, but not necessarily a great long-term strategy. So we're trying to balance the two to see what's going to be the best outcome for us long term. So we're continuing to pursue this long list of people who have an interest. We want to make sure that if that list becomes real long and there's some tension that allows us to price up, then maybe there is a greater opportunity in selling a condo hotel unit. But I guess, the key takeaway in that regard is we're maintaining the optionality to go in any direction we choose to by moving in parallel tracks in that regard. So we continue to develop the potential for units, and we continue to develop the potential for straight hotel rooms. And the combination and mix of all that is something that we will present once we have the financing done. And as I said earlier, I will do that in a tremendous amount of detail and answer every question and help out with -- as best as I'll be able to for you to model this.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. And then, the last question, really, is a simple house cleaning one. I know in the last call, you had shared that most of the expenses would be capitalized. And I just wanted to circle back, and I guess, just see if that's still how you're thinking about this, if there's going to be presumably the labor -- I think you had talked about some of the operating costs as being capitalized. Would the financing costs be capitalized as well? And does the EPS -- the revised EPS guide factor anything in incremental costs or cost headwinds from the Sunseeker development here?\nMaurice Gallagher: No. The EPS provisions have nothing to do with Sunseeker. Everything that we're doing in that regard is capitalized. So you shouldn't see anything there. When we get to a point where the resort opens from an operational standpoint mean accounting laws force type of presentation, as you know, we're going to have to make from a financial statement perspective. So you're going to see detail broken out, so you can still focus on the airline to the extent you're going to want that continued detail. And you'll be able to see the resort. So again, we're going to have accounting requirements, but we would want to do a lot of that anyway so you can have visibility on an airline standalone operation as well.\nDan McKenzie: Very good. Thanks for the time.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Maury Gallagher for any closing remarks.\nMaurice Gallagher: Thank you very much. Appreciate your time, and we'll talk to you in the next 90 days. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect.

Today, you're going to hear a great deal of good information from us. As you can see from the numbers, we had an excellent quarter and we have done this, I might add, in the middle of a substantial makeover of the company. Since the end of 2016, we have been in the midst of a number of strategic changes, enhancements to our business. Let me comment on three of them, which in particular pertain to the company or the airline. First challenge, aircraft transition. We ended 2016 with 84 aircraft in our fleet, 47 of them were MD-80s, four 75s and 33 Airbus. Our plan at the time was to transition to an all-Airbus fleet by the end of 2019, three years down the road. However, we updated our plans in the mid-2017 timeframe, namely, we wanted to speed up the transition by a year to have it done by the end of 2018, this year. At the time we had 41 Airbus and 45 MDs, indeed it was ambitious plan, but I'm happy to report we're on track to have the changeover finished by the end of this year as we have told you. This is a significant undertaking to arrange for all the necessary aircraft and to induct them onto our certificate. Scott will have some more color in a few moments on this area. Second challenge, operational improvement. You've heard us talk about operational reliability issues in the past. Basically, we and senior management did not execute as well as we should have, we did not provide the leadership. When Scott took over at the end of May last year, we doubled down on the requirements to fix aircraft timely. This meant a focus on the leadership in the maintenance organization, processes, the planning and the parts support. We and the ops team have done nine months \u2013 what they've done in nine months is extraordinary. By the way, these are the same airplanes, the same mechanics, same pilots, flight attendants, stations and operation control personnel that were there before we started this effort. I'm happy to report this past quarter we're among the best in completion factor in the industry and as well it shows in our financial results. The third challenge, revenue enhancements. In late 2016, Lukas Johnson talked to you at our annual meeting about he and his team's efforts over the next few years to improve unit revenues through the development and implementation of their next-gen tools. We're starting to see the fruits of this labor come to pass. Lukas will have some comments about where he and the team are in this effort. In conclusion, we are executing on the plan we laid out to you all in late 2016 with the exception being that we have moved up the transition of the Airbus fleet from end of 2019 to the end of this year. I'm cautiously optimistic as we look ahead to the rest of this year and in 2019, particularly after we have finished our fleet transition at the end of this coming year. I want to thank all of our team members for their efforts and let them know this last week's events are well behind us, but we won't forget. John?\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: Thank you very much, Maury, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I want to address the misleading and inaccurate reporting by 60 Minutes. We had our reliability challenges in 2015 and 2016, but that's old news. The manner and way those challenges were presented was inaccurate, misleading and not reflective of our safety culture and practices then or now. We have always had and continue to have a very strong safety culture and best-practice approach. We have the proud distinction of having the best controllable completion at 99.9% of all U.S. airlines since August of 2017. We are doing significantly better than prior year on all reliability metrics we and other airlines track. We have always had a culture of safety and these results demonstrate our focus on reliability. We have a fabulous team of dedicated, focused, and passionate men and women whose performance during this trend gives me the comfort to state these results are the new norm. The customers are obviously experiencing these improved results as reflected in the just-released American Customer Satisfaction Index, which showed Allegiant tied for third in the airline sector with American and Delta. We experienced the most significant year-over-year gain of any airline. Kudos to our CELT team whose efforts in the customer service area have had a major impact. Since this inaccurate and misleading reporting last Sunday, we've experienced cancellations and a reduction in booking. The degree of these cancellations and bookings have reduced each day to a point we are starting to reach normalcy. As a result, we are not changing our full year EPS guidance. This story is behind us and we won't be commenting any further as we move forward. Sunseeker, give you a quick update on financing. Of course, we've had numerous parties express an interest in wanting the finances project which has been extremely impressive. We are currently negotiating with multiple parties on parallel tracks and making great progress. Again, no change to what I've communicated in the past. We're looking at this as being at least 80% project cost financing, non-recourse, no pre-sale requirements and no other hook. Given the progress we're making, we expect this financing to be completed sometime in Q2. Regarding sales, we have slowed down our efforts as we concentrate completing construction plans and related content necessary to sell this product. Having said that, we still have 45 signed registration agreements and another roughly 500 people who have expressed a strong level of interest by clicking on the Become an Owner button on our website and registering. Again, extremely impressive since we have nothing to show other than a floor plan. And the other impressive data point, we average about 1,700 users a day at the Sunseeker website that peaks from time to time to around 3,700 a day, but we're averaging in that range and we have not spent to date one dime on marketing. We'll be opening up a sales center. We expect that to open in September, of course, of this year. There's about 30,000 cars, I'm sure most of you know, drive by that location each and every day, and we intend to use that sales center to do the obvious, which would be sell product, but not so obvious, also to create more focus on the brand and to also create interest in the hotel. Give you an update on some timelines. The first of numerous public improvements will start in June, June of this year, of course. That is a street called Main Street which runs from the Tamiami down to the Waterfront. That'll start in, as I said, in June and be completed in December. We will start with street closures and site work next month in May, and that'll go through May, June and July. A vertical construction on the site you'll start to see in the August/September timeframe, and when we build that sales center, we'll also start to put in the perimeter walls and landscaping to start creating that brand exposure, rhythm, design, and awareness that we want to get started with early. And of course, not much changed with the opening date. We're still looking at a February 2020 opening date. One exciting and last point to make on the Sunseeker Resorts, we have hired a Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer for Sunseeker. That individual will start with us on May 14, and we'll put out, of course, a press release and make further announcements when that happens on that date. And speaking of new hires, we have sitting here with us today the gentleman, Scott DeAngelo. He started with us just March 19. He, of course, started his career with McKinsey where he spent four years and he joined us from Worldpay where he led product, revenue and data. Of course, it's great to have him on board, and look forward to the impact he will have. And just to make sure I don't forget because I didn't state it upfront, at least to my mind, I guess, think of the obvious, he joined us as our Chief Marketing Officer. So, again, very excited by that. And on that note, I'll turn it over to Lukas.\nLukas Johnson - Allegiant Travel Co.: Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone. So, quickly reiterate a lot of what John just said as I know there's a lot of interest in our booking trends the past ten days and, as one would expect with all events of this nature, there's initial drop-off in bookings. However, each day since then has been better than the previous day in terms of year-over-year performance. Cancellations stabilized quickly within a couple of days and there's been no significant change in no-show rates, which is a good sign that the vast majority of our passengers know that safety is the top priority for us. One other positive data point is that April close-in bookings over the last ten days have been higher year over year, so those have held up significantly well. I'd like to give a little bit more detail into our revenue results for the first quarter of 2018, as this was our first quarter that we had not provided a previous forward guidance for you all. We are extremely pleased with how the first quarter ended up revenue-wise. As seen in our monthly traffic releases, this was our largest quarterly gain in load factor this decade. Our load factor has improved a staggering 2.9%. This was achieved with only a 50 basis point drop in our stage one adjusted (12:00) yield, so it wasn't through extreme discounting. And it's due to a lot of things, but we'd like to point out our next-gen RM system was able to better predict lower demand flights yielded more precisely in the peak spring break period and overall in markets that we're testing, which was over 80% of the ASMs, it was consistently found to be worth about 1 to 2 points of TRASM overall. On an apples-to-apples comparison, excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition rules, which are in the release, TRASM improved 2.5 points year over year for the quarter. One other note is, we did grow off-peak flying 21% in the first quarter compared to only 7% on peak days, which is an excellent result given that headwind. So, a job well done to all those that helped deliver these stellar results. And finally, a few puts and takes on the cadence of upcoming quarters. Easter shift to the second quarter is going to be approximately a 200 basis point headwind with the spring breaks moving for a number of markets. And in off-peak, growth update for the second quarter, we'll be growing about 15% on off-peak days and peak days will be up about 10%. So, it's a little bit slower than the first quarter, little bit less of a headwind, and then for the third quarter, we're actually going to be growing peak day ASMs for the first time \u2013 more than off-peak, for the first time in several years. And with that, here's Scott to talk about the fleet and operations.\nD. Scott Sheldon - Allegiant Travel Co.: Thanks, Lukas, and good afternoon, everyone. Yeah, just a couple of quick comments. First one to thank all of our team members, service providers and partners across the network for their tremendous efforts. Everyone should be really proud of our first quarter results. Our operational execution continues to improve. And that's a direct reflection on everyone's hard work and commitment to putting out a great product day in and day out. And to end, I want to recognize the incredible efforts of our fleet planning, fleet integration and maintenance engineering teams. Going into 2018, we knew there was significant execution risk surrounding our accelerated fleet transition. Inducting 30 Airbus aircraft and retiring 37 MD-80s in a 11-month period would be impressive for our organization. Moreover, our second quarter activity which has 16 Airbus inductions from six different operators and five MD-80 retirements is more than we would typically take on and accomplish in an entire year. Despite the number of challenges ranging from late arriving aircraft, assembly and kitting delays, induction work scope modifications, our team members continue to execute on time and on target. And with that, I think we're ready for questions.\nOperator: Our first question is from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, guys. Thank you. So, it sounds like you're back to normal on bookings, and if you look at the overall revenue performance in 1Q and the positive contribution from the load factor from the new RM system and the cost items that you gave us with maintenance and D&A and fuel being roughly the same, is it fair to assume that we can actually raise the low end of the EPS guide this year? (15:38) a big range of outcomes. Is it fair to assume that you're tracking, maybe not above midpoint, but certainly like can we shave off $0.50 on the bottom part of that EPS range at this point?\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: Hunter, I think this is the first time, of course, that we've followed this approach and just given annual guidance upfront. And I think we still think it's a little bit premature to do that. I think we were very impressed with what happened in the quarter, obviously, and that's one of the first inclinations you tend to react with. But there's still a lot of runway in the year, nine months left. So, I think that's something we'll obviously take a look at, and we chattered about before, looking at that after six months. But I think right now, it's probably a little bit too premature to do that.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. I think that's fine. And then, the near 3 point improvement year-over-year on loads, Lukas, do you think we can get back above maybe 6% in 2Q? Or maybe I'll ask the question differently, can we expect a similar degree of magnitude of increase of load factors as we move through the course of the year compared to what we saw in 1Q?\nLukas Johnson - Allegiant Travel Co.: Thanks, Hunter. I think 1Q will be the high point for that, if the worlds to be (16:54) up year-over-year in terms of load. But, as you get up to where we were through the summer, loads were a little bit better last year. So, I think we'll be focusing a little bit more on the yield side of that and I think it just depends on peak periods versus off-peak periods. We're taking a little bit different approach \u2013 or the system is taking a little bit different approach with whether you target load factors and yields. So, I'd expect some of your off-peak months towards the end of the year to have some load factor improvements and we'll focus a little bit more on yields in the peak periods.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Hey, thanks. Maybe for John or whomever, but based on some of the press reports in Florida, it sounds like the hotel is bigger, there are more condo towers and perhaps there's been some horse trading or promises of construction on behalf of the county. So, I wonder if you could just give us an update on the scope of Sunseeker versus your initial plan.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: Hi, Duane. There's no doubt there's been a lot of noise out there and some of it's driven by when we still get \u2013 we start to get more clarity on financing, we get more clarity on tax law changes and how that impacts the overall development and we looked at this, of course, a year ago and there's been a lot that's been happening and all favorable. So, it makes sense for us to take a look and see given these changes that we're seeing what's going to make the most sense to do going forward for Allegiant. So, I think we're going to be in a better position to communicate that in conjunction with any kind of a press release we would put out around the financing approval because at that point in time is when the board would be approving what the project scope would be at the same time. So, for us to say anything in advance of the board weighing in on that I think would be a little bit premature. So, for that reason, we'll hold off. But again, we do expect to get this financing done in Q2. So, I think you'll get a lot more color around what that project is going to look like. And it'll pretty much be locked down. I mean, because you're not going to see once the board approves a project, I mean, and once the financing has been approved, that's the project. So, I think we'll put a lot more definition around that sometime over the next couple of months.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: I appreciate that. I mean, there is a fair amount of commentary that's in the public domain and so, for example, just the hotel, it sounds like that's now like a 275, 300 room hotel, not saying you've committed to do it, but that is quite a bit larger than the initial presentation. Is that fair?\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: Well, I think when you \u2013 some of that commentary comes from is the initial announcement. If you go back to early on, the hotel was going to be I think 76 rooms. We were going to build out and we were going to shell the remaining expansion rooms of approximately 200, so that the total hotel size was roughly 277 rooms. So, it was always sized from day one to potentially be that large. Now, as I say, as we move through the project and understand a lot of the data points more and what's going on in the market, that's where there's probably a lot more noise as to what we may do. And, of course, a lot of it's speculation and frankly like everything we see from time to time, there's a lot of misreporting. But, we'll be able to put complete clarity on that when we do approve the financing and, therefore, the board has signed off on the final scope of the project.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Maybe Lukas or Scott, I think, at Investor Day, you guys talked about thinking of EBIT per aircraft and you had maybe $5 million for the A320s. I wonder if you could just revisit that at this point and when you look at your fourth quarter plan, once you have the MD-80s out, what is the actual EBIT per A320 in that period?\nD. Scott Sheldon - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah, Joe, yeah, that's correct, that was for A320s on our Investor Day slide. It was roughly around that $5 million in EBIT contribution and I think fuel is up a little bit, which will adjust that just a tiny hair down, although we had a $2.17 a gallon full year number in there. So, it shouldn't be adjusted too much. I think that's a pretty close number to what we are still expecting given this revenue environment.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, Scott, just on the cost side, you made it through one of the peak periods here, it seems pretty well. Can you just talk about kind of the milestones, the rest of the year, and from a guidance standpoint whether you guys see more upside on the cost side or the revenue side?\nD. Scott Sheldon - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. I think if you look at the first quarter, I think the big surprise, which definitely beat our internal expectations, although we don't guide ex-fuel, we beat it pretty handily, if we saw a nice movement in the maintenance area. So, a lot of the initiatives that were launched in 2017, these being specific strategic part initiatives, buying better, our mechanics are troubleshooting better, there's just a lot of inefficiencies and costs that are coming out of the organization as we run a better operation. I would suspect that would continue on. I think if you look at it, we used to guide maintenance per aircraft per month. If you look at that ex-heavy-maintenance, we're seeing a nice drop-off, as much as $20,000 per aircraft per month in the first quarter. Ideally, if we could keep that sort of cadence, we would see a nice move downward. Other than that, everything else relatively was in line. So, I mean, I think, like I said, since we don't guide ex-fuel, everything else is tracking fairly well. Obviously, we still are carrying a lot of flight-crew members, we're still very inefficient because we have so many folks going through the training pipeline, which will absolutely take us through the end of the year before we start to see a lot of those efficiencies come through.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nAndrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Scott, just to follow up on the unit costs. I think on the January call you mentioned that you expect your trajectory to be down in 2018. Does that still hold? And, I guess, is 1Q a good run rate for CASM ex-fuel? Are there any quarterly anomalies that we should be thoughtful of as we go through 2018?\nD. Scott Sheldon - Allegiant Travel Co.: I think, directionally, it's definitely down. I think, if you look at the year-over-year comps, the reduction in ex-fuel as a percent is probably at the low mark right now, so that should accelerate because there's obviously higher costs in the back half of the year. But I think, directionally, absolutely these costs should come in, in 2018.\nAndrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And then, John, I guess, just with Sunseeker, you talked about looking towards \u2013 for a financing approval in 2Q. Can you maybe talk about any interest you have seen from maybe being a more sophisticated and pure like real estate, private equity, or other types of entities looking to partner in this project? Do you think this could be an option that could potentially help you de-risk the project a bit and let it become more of a pure fee business for you?\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: The one thing we've always talked about, mentioned, and will pursue once we're further along in construction efforts is management contracts. But when you look at this particular project, I mean, we like the optionality that the company will have going forward. We can make any of these decisions down the road whether we want to own, sell, manage. Those are all options that we're going to, obviously, have at our disposal going forward, and those are for our board to decide out in the distant future. Right now, the financing sources that we've been talking to, they are very interested in the project. The interest rates are extremely favorable, the terms are extremely favorable. And these aren't from traditional banks like we all know and love, whether it be a Wells or a BofA, these are from, call it, these other sources that you're talking about. So, there's been a lot of interest in the project and we're excited by that. But we will start pursuing management contracts which obviously is the asset light approach to what we want to do going forward. And we will start going after those management contracts. Probably sometime in 2019, we'll start chasing them down. So, we'll have a lot of people that'll start coming on staff and being led by this new gentleman who's going to be coming on board. So, he'll have the resources at his disposal, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9, the street cred for us to start going after this.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, operator. Hi, gentlemen. Thank you for the time. Let's see, I just have two questions. One is, I look at your revenue trends over the last, say, 20 quarters. You've really moved up, right? You went from sort of in the, let's say, $350 million, $370 million range to like $425 million. So, there's sort of an A and a B. The A part of the question is probably for Lukas. Is this the revenue management system that's driving this improvement? And the B part is, are you able to cover your fuel cost increases which were substantial in the first quarter, not just for you, but for everybody, with the revenue management, and should we be thinking about this as like the new run rate going forward?\nLukas Johnson - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. That's a lot there, Helane. Thank you. So, yeah, the RM system is going to lap and in second quarter, third quarter still going to be on some pretty significant comps year-over-year that we're going to see some benefits. And as we get into the fourth quarter, you start running up into a little bit higher ASMs than we were running on the system. But having said that, the team is working continually and I think the beauty of the system is that \u2013 the way it was designed, it's built for continual improvement. So, right now, we're still about 80% of our ASMs on the system. And the reason we haven't gone to 100% is because we're still seeing enough opportunity to improve the bulk of the 80%. We think there's still plenty more than the system can do, and that's exciting. In terms of the fuel component, it's not really a revenue management system thing per se, it's more about the customer price perception about what is an affordable fare versus driving, versus other carriers. I think, typically, you'll have a pass-through a little bit on the fuel side, that if fuel is to go up X amount, you're going to recapture Y percentage and the industry will see that, in general, not just us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Just taking a little bit of a step back, compared to the past, I think there are two big differences in the model today: one is you have a younger, more fuel-efficient fleet and the other is maybe a greater presence in the mid-size market. So, kind of wondering with the run-up in field (29:37), if you could talk about two factors that \u2013 what these two factors might drive, one, in terms of capacity decisions and two, in your ability to kind of push through those fare increases.\nD. Scott Sheldon - Allegiant Travel Co.: Sure, Savi. So, in terms of capacity decisions with the fleet change, it's really we're just as flexible as we always have been. We've exited, I think, out of four cities so far this year. So, the discipline that we've always had to cut, to move markets, to redeploy our assets as best seen is still here. It's something we're really proud of in terms of the granularity that we allocate that capacity, and if I don't see that changing, I think if anything, the Airbus because it is so much more efficient, you're seeing us being able to make markets and seasons, day-of-the-week work that the MD-80 simply wasn't able to. And I think, you're always looking when you're making a capacity decision on your most marginal flights, and I'd say, fuel goes up, the revenue environment changes, macro changes, we still have just as much flexibility as before. And the mid-size market, again, you have much more destination opportunity or much more connect-the-dot opportunity out of these larger markets, where, if you look back five years ago, we didn't have any city in the system \u2013 any origination city \u2013 had more than six destinations, and now we've got a couple that are high teens or 20 destinations with are connect-the-dot. So, I think the optionality in the model continues to expand.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMichael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Oh, hey. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks. Just two questions here, I guess. One, to Lukas. Lukas, you talked about the RM system \u2013 the new RM system and the fact that it enhanced TRASM 1% to 2% in, I guess, 80% of your ASMs and you talked about a bunch of different factors like competition. And I'm just curious how markets, where \u2013 markets that are unique to Allegiant versus markets where you do have competition, how the RM system, or the results have differed, if at all? What you're seeing?\nLukas Johnson - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah, Mike. That's a great question and, obviously, in a unique market where we're the only carrier, this is \u2013 I kind of call it the economic sandbox, you're able to do almost anything you want in terms of pricing. And so, you're going to see a little bit more of an effect because typically the fare umbrella over a connecting legacy comparable roundtrip is going to be several hundred dollars higher. It's really not even a consideration outside of the schedule for our passengers in those markets. So, you're going to see a bigger effect in those markets and then in the more competitive ones, the system is still better, but it's that if there's, say, a $100 fare umbrella over you versus a $500 one, they're just not as much your ability to yield up. It still does identify kind of the off-peak flights as well, but if I had to say, it tends to perform a little bit better in the unique markets.\nMichael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great and then just a second question, this is to Scott. When I look at your tax rate and I think where you were guiding to at the beginning of the year, it looks like the tax rate is coming in a couple of hundred basis points better. Is that the right run rate for the year? And is there anything driving that? Or is it now that the dust is settled you're better able to come up with a more precise forecast for where you think your tax rate is going to be for 2018?\nGregory C. Anderson - Allegiant Travel Co.: Hey, Michael, this is Greg and I'll take that one. And yeah, you're right, that 21% of the guidance that we put in, the tax rate, that's the right run rate for the year. And if you remember back in 2014, we acquired those 12 aircraft that have been on lease to easyJet and as they were acquired, they were acquired under special purpose companies each one in Germany. And so, what we had are some tax adjustment that we kind of went through this year for the dissolution of those special purpose companies as they come back. Without getting too much into it, there's differences between U.S. GAAP and German GAAP. The U.S. GAAP required us to put a DTL up on the balance sheet in our effective tax rate and then as we're bringing those or dissolving those SPCs, we're allowed to reverse that, which is the major drive between the decrease in the effective tax rate.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Oh, hey, good afternoon. Thanks, guys. John, so the resort development is essentially go here with attractive financing sometime in the second quarter. I know you're not ready to talk specifics, but should we be thinking that there's going to be a cost/revenue mismatch just given employee wage, incremental wages and interest expense relative to revenue generation? And if so, could it be material? Or does the full year EPS guide factor in any potential mismatch here in the near term?\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: Well, it's a good question, one we've taken a look at. We think most of what we're going to see in the balance of the year is going to be capitalized. So, there's always nuances around that, but for the most part, I'd imagine a significant amount of any labor that we would have would be capitalized, as well as a lot of the expenditures relating to the project. So, I don't think that there is any change in that regard. And to the extent that there's going to be any interest impacts, which presumably if we get a deal done in the second quarter, there is going to be some element of interest. When that would start would be something that we would give clarity on when we announce the project. But again, that type of interest would be capped. And there is capitalized interest rules surrounding that whole issue. So, I think the one thing that we'll make sure that we put out there when all this is done and we are fortunate enough to announce it is all the impacts, what these numbers are going to be, what they're going to impact. But at this early stage, I think you can assume that no significant impact to EPS because of everything being, for the most part, capitalized.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that clarification. Second question, revenue coming in stronger, just kind of following up on some of the prior questions. I'm just wondering if you can talk about how demand sort of trended throughout the quarter. What we're hearing from some of the other calls is there was a pickup in demand at the end of March, but it's hard to know if that's holiday-related or if there's something really more fundamental going on to drive that as we head into the second quarter here.\nLukas Johnson - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. I would say that's accurate with what you're hearing from other carriers. The first half of the quarter, which is quite off-peak, we did have pretty significant increases in loads, but the yields weren't quite there. And as you trended further and further into March, we had some significant outperformance both in the flown dates and also booking dates for that period.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve O'Hara from Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.\nSteve M. O'Hara - Sidoti & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Just on the Sunseeker project, what's the timeline on kind of providing the total cost estimates and maybe your ROI projections and things like that? How granular do you expect to get on that topic and maybe when you expect to provide it? Thank you.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: Thank you, Steve. I think you can expect us to announce a budget at the same time we announce the financing, and of course we would be announcing at that same time the board's approval of that project. So, all of that you'll have a lot more clarity on, as I mentioned, sometime in Q2. It would not be our intention at that point in time to announce what the revenue expectations would be in that project. I mean, we've been doing our own internal homework as we continue to look at and evolve the project. But that would not be something that we would contemplate doing at that point in time. We might give you some guidance as to how we're looking at the returns, just so you have a feel for what it is and why we're doing it. But, at that stage, to give you like a revenue, expense and EBITDA type number would not be something that we will provide in that degree of detail, at least not in the Q2.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Crissey from Citi. Your line is now open.\nKevin Crissey - Citi: Thanks. Just a follow-up on that, John. Just maybe you could talk about when you do go to the board for Sunseeker, what are the financial metrics that you are going to provide them, not necessarily what those numbers are, but more what financial hurdles you are looking at for the project when you discuss it with the board?\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: I think, the one thing I should make sure I'm clear on is, we've been having conversations with our board since we started this. So, it's not like when we do make a presentation to them for a final approval, it's the first time they would've seen it or understood the project. So, these conversations \u2013 we give the board update and the board gets quite a bit of clarity at each and every board meeting. So from that standpoint, they're pretty educated on the whole project and why it is \u2013 what it is we're going to do. I think all the various metrics that you would think of, whether it's the IRRs and everything else, return on assets, return on whatever you want to use, I mean, we're using the same standard ways of evaluating this project that you or anyone else would. So, and that same type of information is what would be presented to the board. I mean, they're looking at what's the downside, what's the upside like anyone and trying to quantify all that. Of course, when you're looking at non-recourse financing, it helps get your arms around it much better and that's always been a condition of the project from the get-go. We said from day one, the idea is not to lever up the balance sheet, and we don't intend to do that. That's why we're pursuing the course that we are. But we have been pleasantly surprised by what the financing rates, terms, et cetera are out there. And that's what's been a great outcome out of all this. It wasn't expected just because we hadn't looked at it obviously until we got into the throes of it over the last couple of months, but it's been very favorable.\nKevin Crissey - Citi: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Thanks. I just didn't get enough. Just on the financing, can you comment on if you're looking for sort of first phase financing? Or would you be able to sort of take down the whole enchilada?\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: I'm going to state the obvious, but I'm going to assume you're talking about Sunseeker?\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Yes.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. So, the idea depending on \u2013 we're definitely going to have this project would be done in multiple phases, right? So, we've had some very interesting conversations with some of these sources that are looking at they're so interested in it, they want to be involved in the entire build-out of the project. So, we're evaluating what the related costs are to doing that to make sure that it's something that would be of interest to us as well. So, obviously, at a minimum would be phase one and to the extent we also would try to tie up everything that would relate to a future phase, it's just a function of terms. So, if they are extremely favorable, ones that we've put out there and all of you were wowed by them as well, you could probably envision a scenario where we would be just as wowed. So, that's how we're looking at it, phase one first, but if someone's interested in doing everything and we have had that level of interest, then we will look at it, just for no other reason not only the favorable terms, but the certainty.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: And then, does that act as a credit line? So, in other words, as you draw against it, it would show up as debt on the balance sheet? Or would it all be sort of on the balance sheet day one? Thanks for taking the questions. That's it.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: No worries, Duane. I think you could look at this as being draws. So, the balance sheet would build as we draw.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Maury, just two questions for you. I guess, it's pretty clear that you and the board spent some time trying to come up with ways to kind of leverage the airline into businesses that were less cyclical perhaps. Were there other avenues that you guys maybe considered going down and ultimately you landed on Sunseeker? I mean, what else did you guys come up with as options?\nMaurice J. Gallagher, Jr. - Allegiant Travel Co.: Well, Joe, the main thing we've talked about over the years and we've done very well with is our third-party products and that's primarily been our hotel product. And with John coming on board in 2016 September, the focus was primarily hotel. There's some other things we've done, the Teesnap, which is the golf, and we've looked at other opportunities. But that's the one that we thought had size and scale, and given where we found the land and done everything, I think \u2013 I know I am and the board are all in for all the synergies that go with this are just phenomenal. And we're really going to \u2013 it's hard now to kind of see around the corner a couple years from maybe where you all sit, but when you look at the benefits of Punta Gorda sitting 15 minutes away with 1.2 million people coming in and out, the traffic coming from vacation heaven, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, that's the west coast of Florida's backyard. All those things, the ability to cross market now with Scott on board \u2013 DeAngelo, we can offer you our loyalty programs, we can tie in perhaps golf, and some other things. I mean, just it's all building to this bigger picture of a customer is a leisure customer that does more than just fly on an airplane. They go to resorts, they go, in my case, to NASCAR events, they go to all these different things. And how do we kind of capture them and make them think of us first for a leisure event? And the Sunseeker resort is just a great anchor point to start bringing all that together.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Maury.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: One of the things we used to talk...\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sorry, John.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: No, it's okay. One of the things we used to talk about in that regard is kind of like analogous to Disney, right? If you look at someone's travel budget, we're getting 5% to 10% of it. And we're not getting the other 90%, 95%. Disney, if you look at their approach, they're getting the 90%, 95%, right, which obviously is much more significant. So, that's why, as the board looked at this, it was always something that was extremely synergistic to go after the balance of the travel budget that we are driving. I mean, we're the ones bringing all these people into all these markets. We just think it's a natural extension of our business to have hotels complete that ecosystem, if you will, to go after the entire 100%.\nMaurice J. Gallagher, Jr. - Allegiant Travel Co.: Joe, the other thing is, and this is probably the reason one, as we have the expertise sitting in the gentlemen to my right you just heard, no other company in this space has this kind of expertise that I'm aware of. And we're leveraging that. Wouldn't even begin to think of anything of this size, scale, or scope without that management expertise and the ability to, we believe very strongly, execute.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then Maury, just with the buyback, I mean, can we assume that the share count in second quarter is going to be lower than first quarter? I mean, have you been able to encourage yourself to buy back some stock here?\nMaurice J. Gallagher, Jr. - Allegiant Travel Co.: Well, we certainly can encourage ourselves. We have to obviously look at our capital demands and we're putting 30 airplanes on this year and it's unfortunate some of the timing on this is what it is. But we have to make sure we maintain some reasonably good liquidity environments, but it's a very tempting point, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, gentlemen.\nChristopher Allen - Allegiant Travel Co.: Hi, Rajeev.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Two questions for you. Actually, Lukas, I wanted to come back to some of the comments you made earlier. You gave some good data on the shifting between off-peak versus peak growth. Can you help us maybe quantify the impact of something like that, say, if in the first quarter you had more balance between peak and off-peak growth, what would be the RASM impact of that or however you're able to quantify it, or approach it if you're following my question?\nLukas Johnson - Allegiant Travel Co.: Yeah. So, the first, I think for the full year for 2018, the impact on TRASM was just over 1 point to 1.5 points and that would be weighted a little bit heavier obviously towards the first quarter and then the third quarter shouldn't see any kind of headwind because we're slightly growing peak days. So, I would say 1.5 to 2 points for the first quarter, flat for the third quarter, second quarter and fourth quarter are going to be kind of in the 1-ish range.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Yeah, that's perfect. And then just coming back to what you were describing earlier in terms of the 60 Minutes piece, et cetera, is that having any sort of impact on your interactions with the FAA, or are you going to have more inspections now? Is there anything that we have to consider from a CASM perspective as it relates to labor around getting pilots and flight attendants? Anything of that sort that you can provide color on would be great.\nJohn T. Redmond - Allegiant Travel Co.: No, there's no impact to any of that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Can you \u2013 there's a lot of moving parts with 2Q RASM number between calendar and the news story and all this other stuff that happened. Do you want to help us maybe, Lukas, give us an order of magnitude of how to think about the sequential change in RASM just for modeling purposes so consensus doesn't get kind of too wacky at either end?\nLukas Johnson - Allegiant Travel Co.: It sounds like you're asking for a guide in a sneaky way.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: We can talk about it in terms of like margin or earnings if you want. I don't really \u2013 it doesn't have to be RASM or anything...\nLukas Johnson - Allegiant Travel Co.: Okay. If I put in Easter, Easter shift is about 200 basis points. Obviously, the RM system is doing well. We've got a bit of a headwind with off-peak flying, a little bit of headwind on the story, and network is outperforming a bit, based on shifting some new market versus canceling some underperforming markets. So, I'd say that's a net positive, and I would say ask Christopher Allen...\nChristopher Allen - Allegiant Travel Co.: Oh, sure.\nLukas Johnson - Allegiant Travel Co.: If you want to get a little bit more detail about that story.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Oh, hey. Thanks for the follow-up again, you guys. This question is for Scott. I guess, congrats on your new role. I'm wondering if you can help us understand what you bring and what the initial priorities are going to be, and what the biggest concerns around execution might be from your perspective.\nScott DeAngelo - Allegiant Travel Co.: You bet. Thanks for the question. I think that \u2013 and we're talking about marketing, right... (51:17-51:23)\nScott DeAngelo - Allegiant Travel Co.: But, no. It's a great question. Traditionally, when we think about Chief Marketing Officers and marketing in this business, we think very traditionally, the top of funnel things, awareness building, driving bookings. And I think what my experience brings is really more around the areas that are really going to drive a successful ecosystem play, and that's one in and around loyalty. So, as we think about, how do we provide a functional and processing relationship benefit to our customers that makes them likely to engage, not just with the airline, not just with our current hotel and car partners, but ultimately with Sunseeker, ultimately with our sponsored partners, et cetera. And then the second, and probably the most direct from the last seven years of Worldpay, is really around how do you build a killer digital user experience that makes it easier for customers to search, to find, to plan, to book, and ultimately to buy in a very streamlined and frictionless process. And so, I'd say from the last seven years of leading product and revenue and data, and seeing data and technology come together for the likes of the Amazons and Netflix, the Ubers and the Airbnb, right and certainly even in travel and leisure, right, that confluence that makes you a winner when you look to move across the value chain and capture the type of economics that, as John put forward earlier, the likes of The Walt Disney Company are able to do.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Biggest concerns around execution?\nScott DeAngelo - Allegiant Travel Co.: I think, in general, we're in a great spot with a ton of upsides, so there are no great concerns. Certainly, the events of the past week would naturally lead one to think there are. But the bad thing a Chief Marketing Officer, and moreover, a marketing team can have on the side is the truth. And so, I think what you will see from Allegiant, ultimately from Sunseeker and our broader umbrella, is just greater visibility into not just value \u2013 that will always be our essence, but into the stories of our customers, of our employees, and then ultimately of the community that we, Allegiant, have served where other carriers have either not served or abandoned, but that we continue to expand in. So, continue to see greater positioning toward very specific segments versus one-size-fits-all and value-only positioning going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Maury Gallagher, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks.\nMaurice J. Gallagher, Jr. - Allegiant Travel Co.: Thank you all very much. Appreciate your interest and your time. We'll see you in 90 days. Thank you. Good-day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect."}]
