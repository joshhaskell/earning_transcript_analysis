[{"symbol": "ALK", "quarter": 3, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-10-19 15:33:02", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Alaska Air Group 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. After our speakers\u2019 remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session for analysts. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group\u2019s Vice President of Finance, Planning and Investor Relations, Ryan St. John.\nRyan St. John: Thank you, operator and good morning. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release along with several accompanying slides detailing our results, which are available at investor.alaskaair.com. On today\u2019s call, you will hear updates from Ben, Andrew and Shane. Several others of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. This morning, Air Group reported third quarter GAAP net income of $139 million. Excluding special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $237 million. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements about future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found within our SEC filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today\u2019s earnings release. Over to you, Ben.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Ryan and good morning, everyone. Before getting to our results, I\u2019d like to start by acknowledging the human aspect of the work we do. This past quarter, close to home, we saw wildfires bring devastation to the West Maui community. More recently, we have been horrified by the terrorist attacks in Israel and we mourn the innocent lives lost. I want to acknowledge that people are hurting and while we share in the privilege of connecting families and communities, we also share in the pain of seeing those around the world suffer. Now turning to our results. Our third quarter performance continues to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business model and our commitment to drive consistent, measured progress against our goals. During the quarter, we ran the best operation in the country, delivering a 99.7% completion rate and on-time rate of over 80%. On September 30th, we retired our last Airbus aircraft from service, marking our official return to single fleet. We drove unit costs down nearly 5% year-over-year, a strong performance that stands alone versus our peers in achieving year-over-year unit cost reductions. And our 11.4% adjusted pre-tax margin nearly led the industry despite our lower direct exposure to record international demand as well as significant fuel cost headwinds given our geographic exposure to the West Coast. Now moving to where we are today. Having been in this industry a long time, I know as well as anyone how volatile it can be and we are seeing this now. Crude oil has risen 12% from last quarter, while L.A. refining margins have increased 70% overall and 60% over Gulf Coast levels disproportionately increasing our economic fuel cost compared to peers, given the majority of our purchasing happens on the West Coast. While we expect this divergence to be temporary, it is nonetheless a near-term headwind. Absent this $50 million cost in Q3, we would have led the industry in adjusted pre-tax margin. Demand remains strong in peak periods, but shoulder periods are becoming more susceptible to lower demand without a full return of corporate travel. Despite these near-term headwinds that will likely make the next quarters more challenging, I continue to believe we have a strong fundamental long-term setup for several reasons. One, our teams continue to deliver reliability. We now have two solid quarters in a row of industry-leading performance, and I can confidently say we have our operational muscle back. I want to thank all our employees for their hard work and effort. They have done an amazing job prioritizing and delivering a safe and reliable operation for our guests. Our completion rate not only led the industry, but set 20-year company records in all 3 months of the quarter during peak summer flying continuing to surpass our planning expectations. Two, our relative cost advantage comes from decades of discipline and became a highlight in the third quarter. With visibility to another quarter of unit cost improvement year-over-year, we expect full year CASMex to be down 1% to 2%, likely the only carrier to achieve unit cost reductions for the year. Having retired our last Airbus aircraft in September, we brought our dual fleet chapter to a close and are poised to fully recognize the power of single fleet efficiencies as we move into 2024. Three, we have the most diversified revenue of domestic-focused airlines, generating 45% of our revenue outside the main cabin. Our investments in fleet and premium seating have given us a domestic product that rivals any in the industry, including first in premium class lounges and global partnerships that will continue to serve us well going forward. And four, our growth is rational and disciplined. Having closed out a strong summer operation, our teams are turning their focus to winter preparedness and continuing to deliver strong operational performance for our guests throughout the holidays. Capacity discipline is the most relevant lever our industry has and will be necessary to support off-peak periods going forward. We are focused on optimizing our flying and moderating growth as a prudent measure to deliver results. For 2024, we are actively discussing where within our long-term 4% to 8% target growth range as most optimal given the higher fuel environment. To close, we produced solid third quarter results. Without our refining margin headwind, we would have had the best results in the industry. Our product set competes with the best and as the international versus domestic demand mix and business travel ultimately normalize over time, we have the right business model to deliver strong results and outperform well into the future. Now more than ever, we are focused on extracting efficiencies from both sides of the profitability equation with all the elements in place to drive strong relative results within our evolving industry. And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Ben and good morning, everyone. Today, my comments will focus on third quarter results, recent trends and our outlook for the rest of the year. Third quarter revenues reached $2.8 billion, up 0.4% year-over-year on 13.7% more capacity, which was approximately 1 point below our revenue guidance midpoint. Unit revenues were down 11.7% versus 2022 and up 12.2% versus 2019. We had three sources of headwinds impacting third quarter revenue performance. First, the strong close-in revenue performance we saw from April through most of August moderated as we moved into September. Close-in demand for leisure looks to have normalized and without further return of business demand, shoulder periods are more challenged than they have been in the past couple of years. Second, we planned our network for relatively strong demand from summer into September as we experienced last year. However, that did not fully materialize. This led to modest load factor weaknesses in areas of our network where we deployed more capacity than we normally would during the shoulder. Third, the devastating Maui wildfires impacted third quarter revenue and therefore, profit by approximately $20 million. For reference, Hawaii represents nearly 12% of our capacity, with one-third of that deployed to Maui. Following the wildfires in early August, bookings turned negative with high rates of cancellation. This reversed at the end of August as bookings to Maui began recovering. However, September bookings were still down 45% versus last year. As we move into the fourth quarter, we are seeing continuing recovery in Maui. However, we expect revenues to be negatively impacted by approximately $18 million and anticipate it will be several quarters before demand returns to normalized levels. Having cut a full frequency from Seattle and trimmed capacity from other hubs, we will continue capacity adjustments to match supply with demand while serving the people of Maui during the recovery process. Lastly, although not a part of our baseline, we saw no upside benefit from corporate travel as revenue continues to hold at about 85% of 2019 levels. Having covered our headwinds though, there were several positive results in the quarter as well. With respect to product, our premium cabins continue to materially outperform the main cabin with first and premium class revenues up 10% and 6% year-over-year respectively. Alaska is the only primarily domestic carrier to have both first class and premium economy across 100% of our mainline and regional fleets. These premium seats represent 25% of our total seats and continue to be an area of opportunity for us in sustaining higher yields and other domestic focus competitors, especially as travel preferences continue to move in a more premium direction. Total premium paid load factor was up 3 points year-over-year, but has increased over 10 points on 12% more seats versus 2019. Today, premium revenue represents 31% of our total revenue, contributing to the 45% of total revenue we generate outside the main cabin. Putting aside premium for a moment, we have also seen success with more guests buying out from saver into our main cabin product. This buy up has occurred at 22% higher fares versus last year. Loyalty remains a strong driver of revenue performance as well. Bank cash remuneration was up 11% versus the third quarter of 2022, outpacing system revenue that was only up 0.4 point. We continue to make solid progress on our strategy of being able to directly sell our oneworld and other partners on alaskaair.com. We launched 13 partners this year, bringing our total to 18 partners with over 500 destinations worldwide now being sold direct on our website. These efforts will continue as we enable selling all cabins on our partners and continue to upgrade the digital guest experience on our website and within our native app. This is another area where we are clearly differentiated from other domestic focused carriers. We are the only primarily domestic carrier that offers access to a portfolio of global partners where we offer elite status recognition, accrual and redemption and airport lounge access. This capability, along with our premium cabin offerings, gives me confidence that we will have built the right commercial offerings to meet our guests\u2019 preferences and drive long-term value to Air Group. As we shared on our last call, we have continued to see our guests take advantage of our global partner network with total accrual and redemptions on our long-haul partners, up 26% for the third quarter versus last year. Taking a step back, as illustrated in the supporting slides we published today, when comparing our unit revenue performance versus a 2019 baseline, it\u2019s clear that the differentiation of our products including our premium offering and international connectivity is a very positive story, which has resulted in unit revenues, up 12% on capacity growth of 6%. This is a testament to the soundness of our business model and the success of changes we have made since 2019. Now turning to fourth quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be up 1% to 4% on capacity that is up 11% to 14% year-over-year. In terms of bookings, holidays are in line with our expectations with load factors up a couple of points and yield up double-digits versus 2019. As I mentioned, non-peak shoulders are weaker than 2022\u2019s historic demand levels in part driven by a return to more normal seasonality and a continued, but we believe temporary demand shift towards international travel. Today, we have approximately 58% of November and 35% of December revenue booked. Given our fourth quarter outlook and current demand backdrop, we are narrowing our full year revenue guide to up 7% to 8%. Our guide implies that our unit revenue trajectory is improving sequentially in the fourth quarter versus 2022, up 3 points. And we believe the gap to legacy unit revenue performance is also closing sequentially. Our most significant step-up in capacity occurred during the third quarter as we work to restore our pre-pandemic network. However, in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2024, our growth follows more in line with normal seasonal patterns. After growing 6% above 2019 levels in Q3, our growth moderates to less than 3% above 2019 levels from the fourth quarter through February of 2024, which we believe should better support supply and demand dynamics in our market versus the industry. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our commercial plan and cognizant of our environment. Our team has taken a hard look at our first quarter network amidst high fuel prices as part of our commitment to improving Q1 profitability. We are focused on managing capacity prudently, including capitalizing on leisure destinations, including 15 new routes such as Seattle and Los Angeles to Nassau, which will bring in new revenue while also constraining our total capacity growth to low levels, and reducing business heavy routes and frequencies. For example, we have trimmed our higher frequency Pacific Northwest and California business seats 22% versus January and February of last year. To wrap up, we have a solid commercial plan that is producing results. Our combination of premium products, valuable loyalty program and global offerings through our partnerships in oneworld allows us to provide guests with what they want while producing strong financial results. And we are looking forward to building on that moving forward. And with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Andrew and good morning, everyone. As we discussed on previous calls, for the past year, we have prioritized returning Alaska to operational excellence. This is what our guests deserve and it allows us to have more predictability across the company, which we can ultimately leverage to improve efficiency and cost performance. It was encouraging to see during the quarter that as we have delivered the industry\u2019s most reliable operation, our teams have begun to turn the corner on our cost profile as well. And while we acknowledge a more challenged near-term setup with temporary, but elevated West Coast jet fuel refining margin costs and a more typical demand profile in shoulder periods, we remain confident our business has the right configuration to deliver financial performance over the long-term. For the third quarter, adjusted EPS was $1.83 and we delivered an adjusted pre-tax margin of 11.4%. Unit costs were down 4.9% and economic fuel cost per gallon was $3.26, which was materially impacted by refining margins on the West Coast that averaged $0.30 higher than the rest of the country, which we believe will prove to be an anomaly, but materially impacted our performance relative to others. Absent this refining margin differential or the $20 million of lost profit due to the tragedy in Maui, Alaska would have led the industry in margin despite not enjoying the current surge in international demand or a further rebound of corporate traffic. Our balance sheet and liquidity, long-time pillars of strength for us through many cycles, remain stable and healthy. We generated approximately $270 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter while total liquidity inclusive of on-hand cash and undrawn lines of credit stood at a healthy $3 billion. Debt payments for the quarter were approximately $93 million and are expected to be $45 million in the fourth quarter. Our debt to cap remains at 48%, unchanged from last quarter, while net debt to EBITDAR finished the quarter at 1.1x, both within our target range. We have also revised our full year CapEx expectation to $1.7 billion for 2023 and fully expect 2024 to be below this amount as we are currently reshaping our near-term delivery stream with Boeing to accommodate a more conservative 2024 capacity plan. Our share repurchase program has, as intended, offset dilution year-to-date, with spend reaching $70 million, while our trailing 12-month return on invested capital ended at 10.7% this quarter. Moving to costs. The third quarter marked a turning point for us in terms of our performance. CASMex ended down 4.9% year-over-year, coming in below our guided range of down 1% to 2%. This result includes the impact of a larger than initially anticipated market rate adjustment for our pilots, which added approximately $20 million to the third quarter and will annualize at $90 million. Speaking of labor deals during the quarter, we also reached a tentative agreement with our aircraft technicians and we are in the process and looking forward to reaching the deal with our flight attendants. Our unit cost performance was the result of nearly every department of the company coming in on or below their plan, which has been no easy feat to do over the past 3 years as we have re-ramped our operation. We saw productivity improve 2% year-over-year and we will continue to work toward returning to 2019 levels. Other areas, we saw good performance relative to our plan included maintenance aircraft ownership and selling expenses. ASMs were slightly ahead of guidance on the continued outperformance in our completion rate, providing a small additional benefit to unit costs. And lastly, we have lowered our anticipated performance-based pay accruals given the tougher setup in Q4, which also benefited CASMex fuel this quarter. However, absent both of these last two impacts, unit costs would have still closed below our guide. As Ben mentioned, we crossed a significant milestone to end the third quarter as we retired our last Airbus from service. And in wrapping up our Airbus era, we announced this morning that we reached an agreement to sell the 10 A321s to our partner, American Airlines and expect deliveries to occur over the next two quarters. Lastly, as I mentioned, fuel became a significant headwind during the third quarter. L.A. refining margins diverged materially from Gulf Coast levels moving from less than $0.08 difference on average for the first half of the year to $0.30 during the third quarter and at times exceeding $0.90. While we have every expectation this divergence is temporary, it has created a material headwind to our near-term profitability. Our economic fuel costs increased from the midpoint of our original guide, adding approximately $110 million of total cost to the quarter with $50 million coming from refining margin disparity or an approximately 2 point margin headwind for the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect fuel price per gallon to be between $3.30 and $3.40 per gallon, which is an approximate 4-point impact to margin compared to our expectations back in July. Fuel, combined with pricing moderation, have led us to revise our full year adjusted pretax margin to 7% to 8%, approximately 3 points lower than the midpoint of our prior guide. We expect CASMex to be down 3% to 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and our full year CASMex to now be down 1% to 2% on capacity, up 12% to 13%. To close, we have run an excellent operation for several quarters. Our pretax margin exceeded peers with greater international tailwinds despite a refining margin disadvantage and sizable impacts from the Maui wildfires. We delivered a strong unit cost result for the quarter and have visibility to another strong result next quarter. We remain focused on and very intentional about setting targets and ensuring we take the right steps to deliver against them. Our commercial offering with premium cabins and global access through our alliances is configured to compete in a way other domestically focused carriers cannot. Our operational strength has returned and our cost management is outperforming the industry, all of which are fundamental drivers of sustained long-term success. And with that, let\u2019s go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So you gave an update, I think, a week or so into September. Can you just talk about what shifted over the latter part of the month? How that played out relative to kind of what you thought what, September 9?\nAndrew Harrison: Hi, Duane, it\u2019s Andrew. Yes, I think there was like at the beginning of September, I think we had reiterated our guide. I think two things. We were still getting our hands around Hawaii, which was deeply negative bookings, and we\u2019re trying to get clarity about where that was going to end up. And I think the other part was there was also right around that time with sort of that transition coming off the back end of a peak summer demand and also close in moving into the more traditional business season. And I think those couple of things combined. I think on $2.8 billion, it was probably like $15 million we\u2019re off. So that\u2019s the main reason. But fundamentally, the business was where we thought we were going to be.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then just segue to Hawaii. Can you maybe play back some history and talk about the current picture and maybe delineate between Maui and non-Maui bookings, that would be very helpful.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think like Maui obviously stands out significantly different, and we\u2019re making some of the capacity adjustments there. We did see during this horrible period of time, some bookings continue to move to other islands. But, as you know, Hawaii books well in advance. So essentially, pretty much the rest of the year Maui, we were sort of reset, but as we go into next year, we don\u2019t see any reason that Maui won\u2019t continue to recover, and we won\u2019t see traditional good solid demand to our Hawaii franchise.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Sorry to be deliberate there. Hawaii bookings ex Maui, would you characterize that as stable/normal?\nAndrew Harrison: They\u2019re a little softer than historical, but we\u2019ve seen that for some time. I think just as \u2013 just the capacity into the islands and, of course, some of the pricing presses in Hawaii, the cost of going to Hawaii. But overall, we feel pretty good about it being somewhat stable.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. I wonder if you could talk about the revenue trend where you are seeing kind of a better improvement of some of the \u2013 your peers that have reported. And you talked about some of the components like how your capacity is developing, but I was curious if you can kind of provide a little bit more color on the contributors of that sequential improvement and how we should think about it then as you go into the first quarter and you make more adjustments as well?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, thanks, Savi, it\u2019s very interesting. I think what\u2019s really positive and some of the sequential improvement is you just look at our capacity in the third quarter and how much higher it was versus \u201819 versus the fourth quarter. And then some of the \u2013 as I shared in my prepared remarks, where we had pushed summer capacity out into the fall in some of these Mid-Con markets and some of these other key areas. We brought that capacity back down starting in October, and we\u2019re already seeing the positive effects of doing that.\nSavi Syth: Got it. That\u2019s the big driver. And if I might, on the growth plans that you kind of mentioned for next year, it sounds like you\u2019re still kind of evaluating between 4% and 8%. The first half kind of maybe on the lower end of that 4%, it seems like? Or how should we think about maybe early indications? I know you\u2019re probably not ready to give a full guide.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I mean that\u2019s correct. And we\u2019ve been clear as we go into the first quarter, we\u2019re going to be around 3% or so over \u201819 levels. And again, we\u2019ve looked really hard at our lowest demand period for Alaska at least in the January, February time period, and we feel like we\u2019ve made some pretty good reductions there, and we made that well ahead of the bookings of those flight. So we feel really good about the setup as we go into the first quarter.\nSavi Syth: Helpful. Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Savi.\nOperator: We will move next to Andrew Didora with BofA Global Research.\nAndrew Didora: Hey, good morning, everyone. Andrew, in your prepared remarks, you said your \u2013 it seems like you\u2019re booked well ahead for November than another airline that reported earlier today is the 58% book sort of a normal cadence for you, or is it more of how you\u2019re looking at close in trending today and just wanting to book more of that a little bit further out than usual.\nAndrew Harrison: I think our comments were a little bit related to when you compare it back to, say, 2019 sort of Thanksgiving sort of falls within the month. So \u2013 but if you average it out between Thanksgiving and Christmas sort of in November and December. We\u2019re probably a little higher on the bookings, but not very much. And right now, we\u2019re just making sure that we manage that coming in with good solid yield to close out the year.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. Understood. And then also, Andrew, on the last call, I thought you shared some good statistics on the shift you\u2019re seeing to international bookings on your partners over the summer, curious if you\u2019ve begun to see more of a normalization there and maybe share shift back to domestic, or do you continue to see that elevated international demand booking on your partners. Thanks.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Thanks. I think we\u2019re seeing exactly actually what we saw on the domestic front, whereas last year pushed well into the shoulder season. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, at least from our members on the international. So just to remind folks, in the summer, we reported in that we were up sort of 50% of our members year-over-year accruing and redeeming internationally. That number is only 26% for the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re certainly seeing it coming down. And so of course, the question will be, will that get normalized by next year. What we\u2019re seeing right now is it\u2019s on its way to normalization.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: And we will move next to Helane Becker with TD Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi, everybody. Two questions. One, when you talk about \u2013 maybe this is for Andrew, when you talk about optimization of the network, can you just describe maybe more fully what you\u2019re talking about? I know some of it is not flying as much in the first quarter in \u201824 as you did in \u201823 because of the shifts in the way people are flying and the fact that corporate probably back as far as it\u2019s going to go, right? I can\u2019t imagine that there are a lot of day trips between Seattle and Portland or Seattle and San Fran or L.A. anymore given the unreliability of exogenous pressures, right? So how do we think about what optimization exactly means?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, Helane, I think, what I would say, when I talk about optimization, look, we\u2019re at a place now where we see where fuel is at elevated and has been for some time. The whole industry has a new set of structural unit costs. And we\u2019re also seeing sort of a settling down of overall capacity across the country. So given those things, we\u2019re looking much harder where we \u2013 and business as you raise as another point, we\u2019re looking much harder about where we\u2019re putting our airplanes in high-frequency routes, leisure versus business time of year. Just to be frank, we\u2019ve probably been less concerned about being more surgical during summer. But the reality is this past summer, you can certainly see as we get back to normalized booking patterns, there is definitely between July and September, very significant changes in demand profile. So we\u2019re going to do a much better job going forward, and we\u2019re already on it, is just realigning our supply of aircraft. So I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m basically saying, and I think there\u2019s only good news from doing that.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s sort of helpful. Until things kind of revert to more normalized behavior, and you have to fix it again. But that\u2019s not a problem. My other follow-up question on the A321s that are being \u2013 I thought those were actually going to be leased in aircraft, but they\u2019re being transferred over to American. So I didn\u2019t see it in the press release, but that doesn\u2019t mean anything. It just means I didn\u2019t see it. Can you talk about the accounting for that? Can you comment on the cost of what they\u2019re paying you or any information that would help us think about that for you guys.\nMatt Grady: Hi, Helane, it\u2019s Matt. Thanks for the question. I\u2019d say this transaction is probably one of the more complicated ones that I\u2019ve seen in my 25 years of doing this. But our thinking on it is really simple. We\u2019ve been public in that there\u2019s 6 to 8 years left on these above-market leases that Alaska acquired as part of the Virgin transaction. And our objective was just to find a transaction and build it that economically offset those remaining obligations. We\u2019ve been working it for 12 to 18 months and just happy to get this process to a close because as you know, this is the last unlock to truly get us to single fleet. Just like we don\u2019t comment on pricing on \u2013 in the airline. I\u2019m not going to comment on pricing of what American is paying us, but we feel good about the economics. And again, covering what our PV of lease obligations was through the extended period of those leases. And then I\u2019m going to kick it to Emily on the accounting side, just where that is.\nEmily Halverson: Thanks, Matt. Helane, we have taken the vast majority of which are depicted with these transitions to P&L already. You\u2019ve seen those in special charges over the last 12 to 18 months, as Matt noted. Cash-wise, we\u2019re about two-thirds of the way through the cash that we\u2019re going to incur with is, of course, as we\u2019ve purchased the lease or the planes from the lessors and then we sell the planes to America, and there will be cash inflows and outflows. So about two-thirds of the $300 million to $350 million total cash exposure that we\u2019ve shared with you guys previously, we\u2019ve already incurred that. And then the remaining one-third will happen over the next two quarters.\nHelane Becker: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Emily. Thanks, Matta and Andrew.\nMatt Grady: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: And we will hear next from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Helane, maybe you can submit those notes on the accounting. [Technical Difficulty] year, it seems like on cost side. Could you just talk about some of the moving parts as you think about headwinds, maybe in the content, so productivity offsets that you, that are clearly in the cost structure now. Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Hey, Conor, thanks. It\u2019s Shane. Bringing up a tiny, but I think you were asking about 2024 sort of puts and takes on costs. I\u2019ll be high level, I think we\u2019re not quite ready to fully discuss \u201824 or cost guidance or anything like that. But the areas that we will have headwinds won\u2019t be a surprise. I think there\u2019s continued investment in airport infrastructure that we will see come into the P&L next year. really across all of our major hubs, and that\u2019s just a generational reinvestment that is needed in these airports. There\u2019ll still be some labor cost headwinds. We\u2019ve got to annualize the market rate adjustment we did with the pilots. We\u2019re really hopeful we get the TA with our mechanics fully ratified. We will have that in the cost base next year. And then pretty much the entire industry needs to get contracts done with flight attendants, which we\u2019re really anxious to do and actively in the process of negotiating. I think on the other side, we\u2019ve now got truly a single fleet. We should have almost every Airbus pilot trained over to the Boeing by the end of the year. And really, we need to start looking at leaning out the operation and focusing again on productivity. That we started to do this quarter. I think we\u2019ve got a good trend through the end of the year. We\u2019ve been waiting for these trends. We\u2019re happy to see them now, and we just need to leverage them into next year. So it\u2019s really about making the more efficient, taking some of the buffer out that we\u2019ve got in there today. We will go slow on it. We\u2019re not going to risk operational resilience at all. It took us a lot to get to where we are in the operation, we\u2019re going to keep operating well, but lots of opportunity to get more productive over the next couple of years.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you guys are being pretty rational in \u201824, it seems versus an industry that\u2019s really not at the current moment. Like when you think about potential share losses versus protecting margins. Does that matter to you in the near term if it\u2019s potentially just a temporary thing? Just curious how you think about it given the fact that you\u2019re pulling on so much growth relative to some of the others out there. Thank you.\nBen Minicucci: Conor, it\u2019s Ben. Of course, market share matters to us, especially in our key hubs. So we will protect our key hubs fiercely and maintain the market share. Of course, we\u2019re going to look at areas where there won\u2019t be such an impact to us. But again, this industry is very capacity-dependent, and it has a huge leverage on profitability. So we\u2019re going to take a hard look. The teams are out there looking at next year\u2019s capacity. And like Andrew said, we\u2019re going to look at Q1 really hard, fringing on days where we have to fringe and flying hardware, we can fly hard. So it\u2019s a delicate balance, but we\u2019re determined to get as close to right as we can on this.\nConor Cunningham: Appreciate, thank you.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks. Thanks so much, Conor.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, everyone. So I know we\u2019re all chasing what normal seasonality is, and they\u2019re already on a couple of questions on the call. But I\u2019m wondering to what extent do you think it\u2019s return to office that\u2019s kind of impacted shoulder season compared to the last couple of years? And kind of maybe that\u2019s restricting the ability of the so-called leisure travel, if you will, and that actually sets up for peak year peaks in the next couple of go-arounds.\nAndrew Harrison: Ravi, so I just \u2013 you mentioned returned to office. And I think we all see the public statistics sort of think sort of slowly climbing its way back, but still a long way off. What I would share is that we have seen between September and October, especially in high tech, where we\u2019ve started to see in some places for some accounts, a decent uptick in travel, albeit overall general yields and not where we have seen them historically. So I think this is still a moving subject. But I think if you just look at the macro size of our network and traditional business versus leisure, I think for us, specifically, I think it\u2019s just beyond more \u2013 some of these bleeder traveler type conversation. But what we are seeing is beginning to see a little more strength come in on the corporate side. And again, we just have a lot of opportunity on our core high-frequency rates, getting those to a place where they can support the current demand as well as the new unit cost of production that the industry now faces.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. And maybe as a follow-up, kind of you kind of \u2013 you spoke about how you\u2019re being more rational than many of your peers and capacity growth for next year. But you also kind of mentioned a few headwinds. So if you were to rank the current softness in the domestic demand environment, extreme capacity growth plans by our competitors or fuel headwinds? Like what\u2019s the order of those three headwinds that would make you kind of question your capacity growth plans next year relative to what you currently have in mind?\nBen Minicucci: I think fuel for us is a big one, Ravi, especially with like we talked about, the LA refining margins on the West Coast, we\u2019re paying $0.30 a gallon more than everyone else across the country. So that is a huge headwind for us. In terms of capacity, we can\u2019t control what our competitors do. What I can say is we\u2019re confident with our business model. Andrew talked about it in the prepared remarks, we have a remarkable premium product. We are not we may be low cost, but we\u2019re a premium brand airline. And I believe that we can always extract the higher revenues because of the brand we have, our premium offerings, lounges and global access. So I would say fuel is the biggest headwind. The other thing I would say, when we cost up, we have cost discipline in our DNA. And we\u2019ve shown this year that we brought unit costs down. This is something that we\u2019re wired for. We\u2019re wired for high productivity of resources and assets. And so I feel confident we\u2019re going to get back to the place that we\u2019ve been in single fleet, I am just ecstatic starting October 1st that we\u2019re now back to an all-Boeing fleet, and I think you\u2019re really going to start seeing those synergy fees come in. So those are the things, I think, for us, that we can control. And I think we have the right setup in the business model to go execute\nRavi Shanker: Excellent. Thanks, guys.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Ravi.\nOperator: We will move next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good morning, everyone. Andrew, you talked about \u2013 as you look out towards holiday travel, you mentioned that loads are up a couple of points, yields are up double digits. So obviously, that looks very good for the latter part of the year. Does that hold or do you think some of that also reflects the shifting of the booking curve or maybe in the past, we saw people booking closer in and maybe this holiday season? As you have said before, seasonality is returning, booking curves are becoming more elongated. How much of that is possibly going to shift or change because of those factors?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Thanks Mike. Just for clarity, the comments that you just shared that I had made was versus 2019. I think yes, because last year, obviously, was very different, very different fare environment capacity set up. So, we just wanted to anchor back in on 2019, which is a very stable, normalized year. And so we have been very encouraged by what we have seen. And I think as we have seen, I think when you look at the industry right now, when you look at 2019, our unit revenues sequentially flat Q3 to Q4, where the industry is down anywhere from 1 point to 5 points. And then if you look at \u201823, as we said, we are up 3 points where the industry is sort of flat to up 1 point. So, we feel like, number one, I would say that what we are seeing at least in our network is outside of this business travel matter, back to sort of normal booking curves, normal demand environment. And I think some of the reduced capacity and reallocation of capacity is serving us very well.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Great. And then just a quick second one. I don\u2019t know if you mentioned this or it was Shane, who said, look, the goal next year is to return back to 2019 levels on a productivity basis, a little bit different than sort of a network optimization. But if we get back to 2019 productivity, help me translate that into like a CASM benefit. Is that like a point or 2 points of CASM tailwind? And how long does it take to actually get to 2019 productivity? Is that through the year, or is that a \u201825-type objective? Any color on that would be great. Thanks.\nShane Tackett: Hey Mike, it\u2019s Shane. Yes.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey Shane.\nShane Tackett: One thing, let me \u2013 yes. Hi. I will clarify. I think it\u2019s going to take us a couple of years to 2019. We are going to work it methodically. And like I said a couple of answers ago, we are not going to overly stress the operation now that we have got it working really well. It\u2019s worth at least a couple of points, all else equal, of unit costs. If there were no other puts and takes, I mean I would say, minimally, it\u2019s worth that. I think we saw single fleet alone at $75 million of benefit, and then we have less productivity in many areas, whether it\u2019s aircraft utilization or other work groups. And all of those are opportunities to get better from where we are. I think we are doing better than the rest of our competitors generally. And I think our focus has been, will continue to be to come out of all of this with the best relative change in cost structure. And I think we are well on our way to doing that.\nMichael Linenberg: Alright. Great. Thanks Shane. Thanks Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey. Good morning everybody. So, the 45% of revenue outside of main cabin, can you break that down into various buckets. Is it as simple as premium being 31% and then the rest is just loyalty in cargo. Also, as part of the main cabin, so it was part of the 55%. Any color on how basic \u2013 sorry, Sabre contribution has changed year-on-year?\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks Jamie. We are not going to go into the details of that, obviously. I think you have heard other airlines quote. We don\u2019t have MROs and other things, but we feel very diversified as it relates to what is not the main cabin. I think in our slides, we provide some of that breakdown there, about 35% of it is premium cabins and some carriers have 0%. So, I think as we have shared all along, we feel like we live more in the group right now that has premium product and global reach as it relates to our business model versus those that do not.\nBen Minicucci: Yes. I think Jamie, I think the point in here with those stats is just to differentiate us among domestic carriers. We are the only domestic carrier with that suite of offerings with the premium, again, lounges, the global access, this equivalent redemption of miles, we do separate ourselves from I think what do you call them low.\nJamie Baker: LMA, low-margin airline.\nBen Minicucci: You came up with a new acronym. Like my point here is we are not in that group based on the offerings. We invested heavily in our product. We have over 300 airplanes in our fleet. Every airplane in our fleet, including regional has a first class, has a premium product. And again, when you add our oneworld membership, our global access, our lounges, it is a compelling product. And to be honest, Jamie, it\u2019s why our margin is equivalent to Delta and United in Q3 despite not having the international tailwinds and having the headwinds of Maui and the refining margins. So, the business model is resilient.\nShane Tackett: And last, Jamie, you asked about Sabre, it\u2019s doing quite well, too. It\u2019s up strong double digits year-over-year. And I think it also speaks and you have heard this from other airlines, we can access the price-sensitive part of the market really well, too. So, we have been able to\u2026\nJamie Baker: That was one reason I asked. Yes. No, listen, I appreciate the color. But so let me press on premium, you cited \u2013 you are obviously enthusiastic about it. It\u2019s an area for growth. You leaned into this when you answered Robbie\u2019s question a couple of moments ago, should we think about premium growth more as yield upside, or as you think about that 4% to 8% capacity number, are you considering possibly expanding the cabin? I ask in part because American spoke to this just a couple of hours ago, so it\u2019s top of mind.\nShane Tackett: Yes. I will take that. I think I don\u2019t think you are going to see like a wholesale refurbishment of the interiors. I will say that we are still working on our MAX 8 interior, and we would love to get 16 first-class seats, and that our 8s carry 12 today. The rest of the mainline fleet carries 16. And it\u2019s relatively small, but could have\u2026\nAndrew Harrison: 59 airplanes.\nShane Tackett: Yes, 59 airplanes. And it could have a good impact, obviously, for us once we get there, but that\u2019s a couple of years off if we end up getting it done.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Cool. Thanks gentlemen. Appreciate it. Take care.\nShane Tackett: Thanks Jamie.\nOperator: We will hear next from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. So, I just want to go back to this fourth quarter RASM re-acceleration just given the implied September trends. So, I just want to understand, are you seeing this already show up in October, or is this more of a November, December? And I guess that\u2019s a direct question. Just philosophically, like if we are slowing capacity and we are seeing sort of an immediate RASM benefit, like why you even think about 4% to 8% for next year? Why isn\u2019t it like we are not going to grow until we actually start grow at all until we see positive RASM again?\nShane Tackett: Yes, I will let that Andrew. Yes. No, I think it\u2019s a good question, Scott. Andrew can speak to the \u2013 where we are seeing the sequential improvement if it\u2019s already on the books or sort of to come. I think on the capacity, I think the way to think about it is we have been pretty clear about our first quarter capacity being relatively modest, certainly versus 2019. Andrew mentioned in the script, we were up 6 points versus 2019 and Q3, 2 points in Q4. So, at least from our view, Scott, I think what you are asking is exactly what we are doing. We are not ready to talk about full year next year yet. But right now, given fuel and where we see pricing, we are making the right decisions in terms of capacity management.\nAndrew Harrison: And the only other thing I would add there, Scott, and you don\u2019t see this obviously in the details, but even the reduction in growth relatively speaking has been helpful for sure. We also had some regions with some very significant growth. And I mean very significant. And I think we have abated those back down to more normalized levels, and that\u2019s where we are seeing the greatest upside with some of this slowing capacity. So, there is micro regions which we have really dialed it back, and we are seeing immediate help from that.\nScott Group: So, you are seeing some of it already in October.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes.\nScott Group: Okay. And then, Shane, you talked about working on some pushing out some deliveries. What does that mean for overall CapEx next year?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Thanks Scott. Just for color, so you guys sort of understand, and I had mentioned this high level in the prepared remarks. We are going to be at $1.7 billion this year, down from our original thoughts about CapEx in 2023. And it\u2019s going to be under that next year. I think we are not quite ready to say how much, but I would think in the couple of hundred million dollar range minimally. We will say more about that in the January call. Matt can just very briefly speak to what we are doing with on the great partners in this. And it speaks to the flexibility that we were able to build into this order book with them.\nMatt Grady: Hey Scott. We are working with Boeing just to reshape \u201824 and even into \u201825 a bit to a capacity level that we think maximizes profitability. One of the other variables that we are managing is the MAX 10 certification. So, better playing, originally scheduled to come to us next year. Certification, obviously, is its own story and pushing out to the right. So, good common ground with us and Boeing to sort through when does that airplane come. The economics, we have been really clear on how much we like the MAX 10, and we want to take as many of those as we can. So, it gave us to join impetus to then let\u2019s reshape \u201824 and as a result, manage our capacity down a little bit. You have heard us talk before, we leveraged the proximity with Boeing. We talk to them all the time, and it\u2019s really good partnership with great flexibility.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nMatt Grady: Thanks Scott.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I heard some comments earlier about trying to be disciplined around growth. And I know you guys have mentioned that you are going to try to slow growth in the first quarter next year. But I guess just thinking through some of these trends that you are talking about with lower corporate shoulder demand being a little bit less than you would have thought. Is this just \u2013 looking forward, should we expect margins at Alaska are just going to be lower in 4Q and 1Q structurally? I mean they have historically, but should we expect even more volatility in the future? And does that reshape your commercial focus, I guess during your peak periods? Do you take more price then? I mean how do you reshape the formula to get the prior margin targets that you guys have set out?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Thanks Brandon. I actually think about it a little bit the opposite. I think the work that Andrew is doing and his team are doing in the first quarter is meant to improve the margin profile of the first quarter. I think we talked two calls ago that Ben had given the commercial team a challenge over the course of a few years, move back towards breakeven in the first quarter. We are the most seasonal airline, the sort of peakest airline. We have been through basically all cycles. So, we understand when and where we make all of our money. And I think we are really good at managing capacity in the peak environments. Q4, honestly, I think this Q4 is a bit of an aberration. I think the results are really a consequence of this refining margin differential in fuel price and the continued but normalizing surge in international demand. And I think once that normalized business we are set up really well to do good. In Q4, we will probably be somewhat lower than some of the other carriers who tend to have less peakiness in the year, but I think we will be more competitive on a relative basis as we move forward.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I appreciate that response. But I guess as you reshape the first quarter, that\u2019s kind of at odds with the prior view that long-term CASM could actually decline in the out years, right? Is that why I heard you say it\u2019s going to be \u2013 take a couple of years to get back to those productivity targets.\nShane Tackett: Well, look, I think it\u2019s very correct to think that there is a correlation between capacity deployment and unit costs. The more we deploy capacity, the easier it is to see the cost decline. But we haven\u2019t lifted it off of the idea of unit cost ultimately going down over time. We will say more about 2024 and the trajectory when we are talking about guidance for next year, Brandon, but this is something we are thinking about a lot. I will just reiterate as we come out of all of this, we are going to have exposure to all segments of demand, including premium. We are going to increasingly be attractive from an international perspective to our partners. And I think we are going to have the best relative cost structure story of anybody in the industry. And so I think our setup is really good to continue to be a margin and financial performance leader over the long-term.\nBrandon Oglenski: Alright. Thank you, Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks Brandon.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for the time. So, we have heard from two of your peers so far that the tech sector in San Francisco in particular have seen a recent uptick in corporate travel. It sounds like you didn\u2019t see that in the third quarter. I think your comment was stable. But then just mentioned to Ravi, there has been some momentum in October. Can you just help us size order of magnitude, that that improvement you have seen? And is that coming from San Francisco in tech or anything else you would want to highlight the recent improvement? Thanks.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks Katie. Yes, I mean and certainly some of the larger technology companies have seen quite a significant movement in volume. And of course, it depends where they fly. As I have said, some of the yield environment right now has offset some of those volumes. But for sure, there has been positive movement in California, Pacific Northwest, these big techs cover both regions actually. So, some promising signs there.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Great. And then maybe for Shane, pardon the modeling question, but just trying to get a sense of the aircraft rent tailwind into next year. Is there further downside to 3Q, $48 million in aircraft rent and some of those aircraft exit in September? Can you just help us think about what the right exit rate is for this year on that line item? And are there any additions on lease aircraft, we should be thinking about into next year? Thanks so much.\nEmily Halverson: Hey Katie, this is Emily. What you saw this quarter in terms of aircraft point was a pretty good normalized level. We have now removed all the Airbus leased aircraft from the book, so you are not seeing that rent come through. We have taken delivery of all the MAX lease aircraft that we are going to have, which is the 13, I believe, 13 over the last year. So, that\u2019s pretty normalized now. You will start to see from an ownership perspective, depreciation will tick up to offset some of that as we have taken on so many new MAX aircraft and those will start depreciating through the book.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global.\nDan McKenzie: Hey. Thanks. Good morning guys. Andrew, when I look at Alaska\u2019s network in California, it looks like the state is only about 80% recovered relative to the footprint that was there in 2019. So, it looks like a pretty big revenue hole that has yet to recover. And if I am not mistaken, I believe it accounts for about 23% of Alaska seats. So, my question really is that, that part of the network were fully restored, what is the size of that revenue hole that could eventually go away, or however you can size it would be helpful.\nAndrew Harrison: Well, I think if I am understanding your question, Dan, I think again, we are not going to put seats into a state where there is no demand. So, your observations are absolutely correct as far as capacity, and we are down. And I think other carriers are down as well. I think what I am still seeing here is even on tech and non-tech, and I repeat non-tech business recovery has not been as good at all versus what\u2019s happening in the Pacific Northwest. So, we are going to \u2013 again, we talked about the network, we are going to be very disciplined and thoughtful about how we maintain our network and where we fly our seats. But again, as we have maintained for some time, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be forever, and we are going to be very prepared and in a good position as demand begins to strengthen and crawl back up that demand curve back to 2019 levels to be able to serve that demand.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Understood. And then, Shane, I think I might risk of kicking a dead horse here. My question is really the same as others here, and that\u2019s just to \u2013 really just to close the circle on the path back to low-double digit pretax margin. I think you touched on fleet commonality at $75 million. It looks like Maui annualized might be close to $80 million or so. So, it looks like maybe 1.5 points to pretax margins there, or please correct me. But from where you sit, what are the biggest revenue and cost opportunities that get you where you want to be?\nShane Tackett: Thanks Dan. And I want to underscore what Andrew said a second ago, just so we don\u2019t lose the point. One of the things I think you all should be thinking about in terms of Alaska setup is we are still in the least recovered portion of the country and still fighting for industry\u2019s best margins. So, I just think there is goodness to come overall for the company. In terms of your question, yes, the cost side is really leaning out the company, getting rid of the \u2013 not all of the buffer we have put in, but starting to work that back, getting closer to the 2019 productivity levels. I think there is opportunity to further leverage technology and automate more of what the guests do, and we are certainly going to be working on that over the next few years as I think every company is going to be doing. On the revenue side, like once we see sort of where demand normalizes, and in addition to the recovery we expect in the international demand or international-domestic demand mix in the West Coast recovery and business recovery, there is a lot more that Andrew and his team are starting to think about and look at from a commercial initiative perspective. They have done a great job delivering, and we don\u2019t get to talk a lot about them on the calls, but delivering on many initiatives this year, we are selling things like exit row seats now that we have not done before, a huge uptick in first class and premium class load factors while yields in those cabins are going up. That is both demand and things that the e-commerce and distribution and pricing team are doing. And there is more of those types of things that we are thinking about for the next year or 2 years. And we will talk more about that as we firm plans up and include them in our guidance and/or get to an Investor Day at some point in 2024.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Pretty good. Thanks for the time guys.\nRyan St. John: Thanks Dan and thanks everyone for joining us for our call. We will see you next \u2013 or talk to you next quarter. For those we didn\u2019t get to, our IR team will be in contact with you. Thanks everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time all participants have been placed on mute to prevent background noise. Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. After our speakers\u2019 remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session for analysts. I would like to now turn the call over to Alaska Air Group\u2019s Vice President of Finance, Planning and Investor Relations, Ryan St. John.\nRyan St. John: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, which is available at investor.alaskaair.com. On today\u2019s call, you\u2019ll hear updates from Ben, Andrew and Shane. Several others of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. This morning, Air Group reported second quarter GAAP net income of $240 million. Excluding special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $387 million. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements about future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found within our SEC filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today\u2019s earnings release. Over to you, Ben.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks Ryan and Good morning, everyone. Our solid second quarter results reflect the strength of the leisure demand environment to date, as well as our team\u2019s unwavering commitment to operational excellence and reliability. I am thankful for their focus, which has helped us capitalize on this busy travel season to produce these great results. Our 18.3% pre-tax margin will likely lead the industry coming in above 2019 margins, despite higher fuel and structurally higher costs. Our earnings per share of $3 was $0.83 higher than 2019 levels, bringing us above 2019 on a year-to-date basis, and beating consensus by 11%. The strength of demand this quarter was evident on June 30th when we flew the most passengers in a single day in Air Group\u2019s history. And at a 99.5% completion rate, we ran one of the best operations in the country as we continued to prioritize completing flights and serving our guests with care. This was 1.7 points better than 2022 and 0.3 points better than 2019. Heading into the busy summer period, we have planned and prepared our airline for peak flying and our teams are executing. Over the 4th of July weekend, we led the industry in completion rate at 99.8%, and on time performance at 85.1% while flying a 90% load factor. As we approach the rest of the year and beyond, it is clear our environment is evolving as domestic leisure fares have recently started to come down from their peaks. Delivering on our targets will not be without challenges, but we remain focused on restoring the tenets of our resilient business model, driving improvements in efficiency and productivity and controlling unit costs to continue to deliver strong financial performance. We remain confident in hitting our financial targets this year, including our adjusted pre-tax margin of 9% to 12% and earnings per share of $5.50 to $7.50. Now turning to an update on our business priorities and progress. We have chosen to prioritize reliability and are running a strong operation like we have historically done. Not only do our guests deserve this level of commitment and excellence but it is imperative to restoring stability, improving predictability, capturing revenue, and building a foundation to drive further improvement to the business. Our investments in training, aircraft, and staffing have enabled us to meet a higher level of flying. Higher completion rate performance has surpassed our initial expectations, driving approximately half of the 3-point increase of capacity in our full year guide. Productivity is also improving as we adjust to new work behaviors, amidst a more stable operating environment and work to close the gap to 2019 levels. Boeing has also continued to be a great partner, delivering according to expectations despite continued disruptions within their supply chain. Earlier this month, we welcomed our 53rd MAX into the fleet. The upgauging benefit of these aircraft are significant. While departures were down 1.3% year-over-year this quarter, higher gauge coupled with mainline utilization exceeded 2019 levels by 4% at 11.5 hours per day and drove capacity up 9.9% year-over-year as we continue to leverage our fixed cost assets as much as possible. As we transition to a fully Boeing fleet at Alaska, the sufficient growth has helped us de-risk our growth plan within a constrained industry operating environment. Given our expectation of continued strong operational execution, adequate staffing and efficient growth, we have raised our full year capacity guide to 11% to 13% versus 2022. As we work to restore all areas of our network to pre-pandemic levels, we are confident in our resources to meet this higher level of flying and balance our growth aspirations with a consistent commitment to excellence. Our business is configured to compete and we\u2019ve doubled down on these core advantages to reinforce our foundation for profitable growth. We are returning to our historical strength as a single fleet operator and have rebuilt our foundation of operational excellence. We continued to push incrementally more on productivity and costs and still expect to be one of the only in the industry to drive unit costs lower year-over-year even when factoring in our industry-leading performance based pay, which several of our peers exclude. We are executing on our commercial roadmap and making progress on revenue initiatives. Our balance sheet remains unimpaired coming out of the crisis with leverage well within our long-term target range, and we have line of sight to full year earnings per share on par with 2019, despite structurally higher labor costs and at least 30% higher fuel costs. For decades, Air Group has adapted and will continue to do so to produce consistent profitable growth. As you well know, this industry is challenging, yet we remain focused on the drivers of our long-term success, restoring and strengthening our competitive advantages, operational excellence, cost discipline, and high productivity in a consistent and measured way will continue to position us well now and far into the future. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks Ben and good morning everyone. My comments today will focus on second quarter results, as well as our revenue outlook for the rest of the year. We produced very solid second quarter results. Our record high revenues of $2.8 billion were up 6.8% versus the second quarter of 2022 and above the high end of our guide, driven by strong leisure and close-in demand. To close out the quarter, on June 30th, we recorded our second best revenue day in our history, only to be outperformed by the Sunday of Thanksgiving last year. Capacity for the quarter was up 9.9% versus the second quarter of 2022, and our planes continued to fly full with load factors increasing from 85.5% in April to 86.4% in May, and 89.1% in June, the second highest monthly load factor in our history. Turning to unit revenues. Changes are noisy on a year-over-year basis at down 2.9% given both, volatile pricing and capacity in 2022. However, when compared to a more stable 2019, we saw improvement in unit revenues of 23% for the quarter, with June up 25%. We still expect July to produce the highest total revenue of any month in 2023, which is consistent with pre-COVID trends, but for the second straight year, June has supplanted July as the peak yield month for us. Regarding product, strength in premium cabin revenues continued to support our revenue momentum. We launched the sale of exit row seats in mid-March, and I\u2019m pleased to report sales have been strong right out of the gate. Including exit rows, First and Premium Class revenues were both up approximately 12% year-over-year, outpacing Main Cabin by 8 points. In the second quarter, 31% of total revenues came from Premium Class products, up from 2022 and up 7 points from 2019. On the loyalty side, performance remains strong with bank cash remuneration up 15% versus the second quarter of 2022, outpacing our system revenue growth rate by 2x. As always, we continue to prioritize delivering value to our guests through our loyalty program, and we are proud to have been named the number one best airline reward program for 2023, 2024 from U.S. News earlier today. Lastly, we are now selling 9 of our partners on alaskaair.com and anticipate bringing on our 10th partner this fall. Phase 1 is to sell and service main cabin tickets. But later this year, we will add the ability to sell premium cabins on our website, helping us to achieve our vision of providing our guests a seamless ticketing capability on our portfolio of global partners with access to any major region of the world. Now, I\u2019ll turn to our outlook and forward-looking guidance. Demand remains very strong, even as we\u2019ve come off the peak of historically high fares, a trend we knew would happen at some point. Notwithstanding this evolution, yield is still meaningfully above 2019 levels on industry capacity that has now surpassed 2019 levels by an estimated 6% for the second half of 2023. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be flat to up 3% on capacity that is up 10% to 13% versus 2022. This implies unit revenues down approximately 9% at the midpoint. Our revenue guide is based on the environment we see today with 67% of third quarter revenues on the books. When comparing our Q3 revenue guide to our Q2 results, this implies a 6-point sequential deceleration in unit revenue performance. Of that 6 points, roughly half is directly related to the pricing environment, while the other half is a combination of domestic industry capacity growth tracking to be up 10% year-over-year, our stage length growth and holiday timing shifts. As a primarily domestic leisure carrier, this summer presents a unique situation with the unprecedented surge in international demand, not dissimilar to the domestic surge last year. We believe pent-up international demand has had the effect of a larger pool from would be domestic travelers than has historically been the case. Long-haul international seats off the West Coast are up 31% year-over-year this June. Our loyalty members alone in June, as evidenced by accrual and redemption activity, we\u2019re filling the equivalent of 18 787s on a daily basis across our international partner network, up over 50% year-over-year, while our lounges experienced a 68% increase in visits from guests traveling internationally. While we believe this will ultimately normalize, there is a disproportionate impact on our realized domestic fares in the third quarter, which we estimate could impact our Q3 revenue performance by approximately 0.5% to 1%, which is reflected in our guide. Close-in demand is another important dynamic to address. Having improved recently, the percentage of passengers booked and flown within months during Q2 surpassed both, 2022 and 2019 levels. This is particularly significant when compared to 2019, given our stage length has increased 7%, where passengers skewed to more advanced booking patterns and business volumes remain down 25%. Although currently not in our forecast, if this trend persists, this represents an additional 100 basis points of revenue upside to our current third quarter guide. Lastly, as it pertains to managed business travel, we have not seen any meaningful change, remaining around 75% recovered by volume with both California and the technology sector still accounting for the largest gap to full recovery. However, we have seen more return to office efforts at major tech companies and are incrementally more optimistic that we might finally break through the 75% recovered ceiling. Although we have not baked any of this into our guidance, we will continue to watch this closely as we move into the fall. For the full year, our revenue guide remains unchanged at up 8% to 10% versus 2022, but on higher capacity growth of 11% to 13%. While our capacity is taking a step up in the third quarter and full year, in part due to strong operational performance, it is primarily driven by Alaska\u2019s gauge and stage growth as we benefit from the replacement of the Airbus fleet with larger, more efficient MAX aircraft. As a reminder, by September 30th, we will have replaced all 72 Airbus aircraft at an average gauge of 150 seats with brand-new MAX 9s that have 28 more seats. The benefits of upgauging are clear in our June results as gauge has grown 7% year-over-year, yet our load factor was only down 0.4 points year-over-year from what was the highest load factor ever flown in our history. At a system level, we have restored ASMs in the second half of the year to approximately 103% of 2019, but there are still areas within our network, including Portland and California that are not fully restored. The West Coast is still the least recovered geography across the industry, and we are focused on restoring our pre-pandemic network, especially where we have opportunities to provide feed for international partners. In a period of historically high demand in yields, the right economic decision has been to fly and maximize ASMs within our fleet and crew capabilities. That said, if we identify pockets of relative softening, we will adjust as needed to deploy our capacity, thoughtfully. While the industry continues to normalize and work towards a new, more predictable environment, we have confidence in our commercial plan with business travel still below historical levels and the West Coast lease recovered, we believe there is more upside to come as we head towards 2024. We are focused on pursuing and implementing our longer-term strategic drivers of profitable growth, specifically, our partnership in oneworld and the West Coast International Alliance, our premium products and our loyalty program. Our value proposition is significant, our initiatives tangible and our product well suited to traveler needs post-pandemic, positioning us well to continue to serve guests and build on our strong results going forward. And with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As both Ben and Andrew shared, we saw continued strong demand throughout the second quarter, carrying a record number of passengers, both to end the period and into the 4th of July holiday. Our teams have done an excellent job this summer delivering a safe, reliable operation in the midst of full flights and very busy airports. Now that we\u2019ve restored operational excellence, which we viewed as our first priority, we now look forward to added focus on driving consistent improvement to our unit cost profile. Ultimately, operational excellence leads to cost-efficient operations, and coupled together, they will allow us to continue to deliver strong relative financial results within the industry. Turning to results. Our balance sheet and liquidity positions remain healthy and a core strength of ours. Debt to cap finished the quarter at 48%, while our net debt-to-EBITDA remains below 1 turn and better than where it stood in second quarter 2019 at 0.9 times. Debt payments were approximately $50 million for the quarter and are expected to be $100 million in the third quarter. With a strong demand backdrop and start of summer travel, we generated approximately $600 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter. Total liquidity, inclusive of on-hand cash and undrawn lines of credit remains very healthy and within our target liquidity range at $2.8 billion. Also, our share repurchases for the year have reached approximately $60 million year-to-date and our trailing 12-month return on invested capital reached nearly 12% this quarter. Turning to costs and capacity results. As I noted, our operation has been running extremely well. For the second quarter, capacity was up 9.9% versus Q2 2022, above the high end of our guided range which was primarily driven by a higher completion rate than we had originally planned. Our completion rate has been 99.7% over the last few months. And given this, we\u2019ve assumed higher completion for the balance of the year, resulting in slightly higher capacity forecasts for the third quarter which we expect to be up 10% to 13% and for the full year, which we expect to now be up 11% to 13% versus 2022. Moving to costs. Our second quarter CASMex was up 2.4% year-over-year, within our guided range, albeit on higher incremental capacity. While we did not miss our range, we, of course, expect to be at midpoint or better when we outperform on capacity. The drivers away from midpoint or better are predominantly not structural. They are relatively small misses against what we know were aggressive cost and productivity targets. To be clear, our cost profile continues to improve, both sequentially and year-on-year. And in comparison to the rest of the industry, we believe we have the best cost trends, especially given we are growing at a somewhat slower rate than many of our primary competitors. Areas where we saw elevated costs relative to expectation remain related to running a solid operation, including staffing levels modestly higher than planned and elevated overtime and premium pay. The Ben and our leadership team have been clear with the company that operational excellence and consistency is the first priority, and having now established that, we will incrementally focus on working these cost areas down appropriately. We also have slightly higher than forecasted crew costs associated with our transition out of the Airbus fleet. We assume higher levels of attrition from the fleet and are, as expected, incurring significant training costs related to transitioning Airbus pilots to Boeing. Turning to unit cost guidance. We expect third quarter CASMex to be flat to down 2%. For the full year, we still expect to see unit costs down 1% to 3% year-over-year. As a reminder, our CASMex guide includes profit sharing, and we anticipate that we may be the only airline that will achieve unit cost reductions year-over-year. And we will do this on less incremental capacity versus our peers. Finally, fuel trended positively falling below our previously guided range and finishing at $2.76 for the second quarter. Based on current trends, we expect fuel price per gallon to be $2.70 to $2.80 for the third quarter. While this offers a benefit compared to last year, fuel prices are still up approximately 30% above 2019. To wrap up, it feels like we are finally getting back to normalized operations after over three years of unprecedented challenges. We have work to do and opportunity to improve further, but we are delivering results within our guided ranges. As Ben mentioned, we are still tracking to deliver our 9% to 12% adjusted pretax margin this year with visibility towards an EPS restored to 2019 levels at the midpoint of both higher fuel and structurally higher labor costs. As I look forward, I think we have a very solid setup. We\u2019ve got arguably the best absolute cost trends with further opportunity to drive unit costs down next year. We believe the West Coast is the least recovered region in the U.S. but also believe it will continue to recover, including business travel, which will provide future revenue tailwinds. We believe that once pent-up international demand is run through, there will be a normalization in the international versus domestic demand mix, further providing pricing support in our network, and we have further opportunity to drive our commercial initiatives. So, even as we expect to compete for the industry\u2019s best margin again in Q3 and for the full year 2023, we know we also have the opportunity to further improve our margin performance in the years ahead. And with that, let\u2019s go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: So, the RASM guide in the second half is clearly disappointing. You mentioned that Seattle South or West Coast was the least recovered. If we parse your network into four buckets, Hawaii, Seattle North, Seattle South and then Seattle East, could you rank order them in terms of year-on-year RASM change, looking forward, not the second quarter, related to the guide?\nAndrew Harrison: Hey Jamie, Andrew. That\u2019s maybe a little complicated off the top. I think what I would say is there is a lot going on in our network, but essentially, we continue to see California improving, both our margins versus 2022 and 2019, but it\u2019s the least recovered, but it\u2019s getting stronger. As far as the Pacific Northwest, that\u2019s where most of our growth has gone. And again, we\u2019ve seen really good unit revenue strength there. But I would say at the end of the day, as we\u2019ve said in our prepared remarks, overall, we\u2019re coming off the high across the network, across the system from historically peak unit revenues. That said, our planes across the board are still extremely full. And again, as we talked about, a lot of the things that we\u2019ve got there in our guide haven\u2019t been fully baked in. And importantly, if you look at the recent results from the other big guys, essentially, they had a deceleration from Q2 to Q3 of 4 to 5 points, which they\u2019re anywhere up to half international, which is extremely strong, and we\u2019re only down decelerating 6 points. So, on a relative basis, we feel really good about our performance.\nJamie Baker: Okay. And second, you spoke to 2024 ex-fuel CASM potentially declining. What level of capacity growth is required to get you into -- to push down ex fuel CASM measurably next year?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Hey Jamie, it\u2019s Shane. Thanks. Good morning, by the way. I think our -- we\u2019d want to be in our sort of long-term target range of 4% to 8% to have line of sight to that. It\u2019s really early, obviously, in terms of thinking about capacity next year. But it\u2019s completely our intent to continue to drive it down and to see a year-over-year reduction in 2024.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Didora from Bank of America Global Research.\nAndrew Didora: So Ben, Andrew, just maybe want to ask you about what seems to be a little bit of a change in -- little in change in strategy here, basically exchanging trading yield for more capacity. I know you explained it as a little bit more completion factor, but -- why is now the right time to do that given the domestic international share shift? And would you consider cutting capacity in the back half of the year if fares remain soft?\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Andrew. Yes, a couple of things. I just want to be clear on the capacity side and the 3-point increase of guidance. None of this is new flying. It\u2019s been in our tapes for some time. 50% of that is already sort of came in, in the first half of the year, and we\u2019re a little bit stale on the guide. But we exceeded our completion rate and we\u2019ve been very conservative. So, half of that increased capacity is technically for the rest of the year. And again, it\u2019s all buried in completion rate, which has been extremely strong and also our Boeing and Airbus deliveries. We\u2019ve firmed those up and we have -- excuse me, retirement of Airbus and Boeing deliveries, and we firmed those up, and we have -- feel much better about the rest of the year. So, that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on in the capacity side. The other thing is 80% of our capacity growth in the back half of the year, it\u2019s all stage and gauge. It\u2019s very highly efficient. And with these high load factors and strong demand, we feel good about our position.\nBen Minicucci: Yes. Andrew, it\u2019s Ben. I think another factor is when you compare where our capacity is compared to 2019, we\u2019re just getting back to 2019 levels of capacity. And then just to put another point on what Andrew just said, our departures are actually down 1.3%. So, we feel like we\u2019re in the right place for capacity.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And then just my second question, just -- if I were to take the midpoints of your capacity and revenue outlooks for 3Q and the full year, 3Q RASM seems to be the trough this year with 4Q a couple of points better. What is driving your thought process on this? Is it that domestic international share shift or anything else you\u2019re seeing in your booking curves? Thanks.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Thanks for that. As we shared in the prepared remarks, there is the deceleration, about half of that is indeed to the core pricing, but there\u2019s also increasing capacity and our stage length and a little bit of a shift in holiday. But if you look to the fourth quarter, we\u2019re showing it accelerate just a little bit if you just do the math. And again, we have a lower base in the fourth quarter last year. And we\u2019ve tried to be conservative. While we\u2019re not giving any pure guidance today on the fourth quarter, there are a couple of things like business travel and the abating of this international versus domestic demand that may actually come to fruition in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Helane Becker from TD Cowen.\nHelane Becker: So Ben, I thought you were really optimistic and positive on both the quarter and the outlook, and yet your stock is down 12%. So obviously, people don\u2019t think it\u2019s that positive. And I know that sounds kind of obnoxious, but my question really has to do with capacity.\nBen Minicucci: Yes.\nHelane Becker: It seems that the pushback is too much capacity growth in a domestic market that\u2019s not really growing as rapidly with pressure on fares, A; and B, to Andrew\u2019s last point, the hope for a shift away from international to more domestic later this year, I\u2019m not sure I would agree with that just because of the pent-up demand that exists for -- continues to exist for Europe and Asia. So, just kind of wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the disconnect between what you\u2019re seeing and saying in the stock price?\nBen Minicucci: Hi Helane, look, it\u2019s a great question. Look, I just want to put things a little in perspective. We had fantastic Q2 quarter with -- will likely be industry-leading pretax margins. We\u2019re still going to have a strong Q3. We\u2019re guiding to reiterate our 9% to 12% pretax margin for the fourth quarter. But I think demand, when you look at domestic demand, domestic demand is still strong. And as you guys have done your calls with other airlines, you\u2019re seeing this massive surge in international travel, similar to what we saw domestically about a year ago. So, our view is that\u2019s a great thing for the industry to have international come back, and we\u2019re putting a lot of our loyalty members on our partners metal, which is a good thing. But we do see strength still in the domestic market. And we do see this normalizing towards the end of the year into 2024. When it comes to capacity, as you know, airlines just can\u2019t switch -- put a switch on in terms of turning on capacity and turning it off. You kind of have to have a plan, you have to execute. The question is -- the issue is we\u2019re executing extremely well from a completion rate perspective. And again, I am optimistic about our business, it is solid across every lever. And we\u2019re dealing with just a surge of international demand right now, which we think will normalize towards the end of the year. So, that\u2019s how I\u2019m looking at it, Helane.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Just on a follow-up question on California. I\u2019ve noticed that there have been some capacity shifts as people have shifted -- other airlines have shifted some capacity out of California, but you guys have shifted into some markets. Can you just talk about the thought process there?\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks Helane, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re referring to San Francisco, Burbank or anything more general than that. But essentially, we\u2019re always looking at our network. We\u2019ve -- we are leaning into Latin -- Mexico, Costa Rica, that good stuff. And we continue to round out and build out our California network, which, as I shared earlier, is still 25% down from 2019 levels. But there\u2019s no major shift or changes there. And our recent market entry is a top 20 market out of San Francisco, and that was an area that we felt we needed to be in.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: On the full year capacity and the reiteration of the CASMex guide, I\u2019m just trying to understand why there wasn\u2019t more leverage. Is there some sort of incremental cost bubble near term that you\u2019re going to see maybe a productivity offset come in the fourth quarter? It seems within the guide, there\u2019s a pretty big step down as we exit the year. So just curious on the moving parts there. Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Yes. Hi Conor, it\u2019s Shane. Good morning. No, there\u2019s no real call out in terms of the cost category that is off-trend or off expectation in terms of the go forward. I think I mentioned some of it in the script. Number one, we tend -- and I think you guys know this to be pretty aggressive with ourselves on cost and productivity. We are getting closer to our 2019 productivity. It\u2019s our goal to ultimately get as close as we can to it. But we\u2019re a little bit short of what we had wanted to be at this summer. The good news is that those are all things we can control and that we will continue to work on as we get through the end of the year. We\u2019ve had some other things just move around the Airbus retirement moving up several months pushed significantly more of the transition training cost into this year and into Q2 and also into Q3. And like we\u2019re carrying a significant amount of surplus pilots on the Airbus, we were really deliberate about trying to retain folks onto that aircraft. So, we weren\u2019t doing a lot of training of new people into the Airbus. And I think that program was successful. And we\u2019ve got a lot of pilots who we just need to get through the school house and over to the Boeings. So, I\u2019m feeling good about where we sit. Going forward, I think we need to do a little bit better job on executing aggressive cost targets. But to be clear, sequentially, we\u2019re getting better. I think we expect to also get better relative to Q3 and Q4. Year-over-year, we\u2019re better in both of those periods. I think we\u2019re set up well for next year. We\u2019ll lap our step-up in maintenance costs, which we talked about earlier in this year, the 900 ER engine deal. We\u2019ll have all of our Airbus transition costs materially in this year and not with us next year. And we\u2019ve got a stable operation, and we know that long term, high completion rate, high on-time performance operation, we can leverage into better cost performance. So yes, you guys, I know will continue to pressure us on this. We\u2019re going to pressure ourselves. And I feel good about how we\u2019re going to perform over the next several quarters on costs.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Maybe as a follow-up pressure push. On the training costs, can you provide some context to how much that is? As we -- I mean, I think that everyone understands that you guys got a pretty good cost plan going into next year. I\u2019m just trying to make sure we have the magnitude of the moving parts, right, as we think about next year? Is it a noticeable amount within your full year guide, I guess, in \u201823, specifically?\nShane Tackett: Yes. I mean, just for the quarter in Q2, it was an extra $3 million relative to what we would have anticipated. We\u2019re carrying as many as 75 extra captains on the aircraft right now relative to what we would normally need to fly 10 aircraft. So, it\u2019s not insignificant. We\u2019ve had to train -- and we\u2019ll get the number to you, Conor, offline. I just don\u2019t have it in my head. Multiple hundreds, 300 or 400 pilots this year or more, 500 pilots this year from the Airbus to the Boeing. Those are not training events that we would normally have in the system. And those are training events that not only provide cost drag, but growth drag as well. So, it should be a very significant change next year, once we get through this.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: I guess, Ben, I just want to ask about volatility because, obviously, the stock is reacting today, and I know this is day to day. But you guys did look back on the first quarter and say, \"Hey, look, off-peak, we wanted to manage something different and going forward, we will.\" But it looks like you\u2019re adding capacity in the back half and just not getting revenue for it. So, is this just the case maybe you overearned in 2Q and you\u2019re kind of normalizing your earnings base in the back half of the year, or what more can you talk to this?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Hey Brandon, it\u2019s Shane. Maybe I\u2019ll start. I think it\u2019s fair to say, look, Q2 was very strong. I think every airline has beat their midpoint of their guidance. I think we did as well. We\u2019re excited that we were, I think, going to be at the top of the industry in terms of margins. So, it is a really high base that we\u2019re comparing ourselves now going forward. I think one thing we haven\u2019t mentioned yet, but we should is fares. While they\u2019re off of their unsustainable peaks of last year, they\u2019re still very high relative to 2019, and we\u2019re still filling planes up at those fare levels. So, I think, yes, Q2 could prove to be a high watermark for the industry. But I don\u2019t -- I think that our business is healthy and strong, and we have a good setup as we move forward, both on the cost side and a lot of opportunity on the revenue front as we continue to see this region recover and business travel recover with it.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate that, Shane. And then, Andrew, you did talk to half of the impacts from the sequential deterioration RASM being pricing. But I think you also said like another third from industry capacity. Could you just expand upon that a little bit?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, Brandon, basically characterized the 6 points half of it being just core pricing coming down off the peaks and then 3 elements are remaining, which were essentially our own industry capacity growth. Our stage length growth, which is up quite significantly and then also, there was more of a minor shift in the 4th of July, but those made up the balance of the difference.\nShane Tackett: Brandon, this is Shane. I\u2019ll just unpack that for you because I think I know what you might be asking. We have a normal capacity growth to RASM reduction model that we sort of assume, it\u2019s pretty consistent over the years. What we\u2019re saying is the pricing reductions is slightly higher than that model would suggest. And that\u2019s what Andrew\u2019s attributing to coming off the peak pricing impact.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Just a little bit, again, going back to the cost side, I was a little curious on what you\u2019re seeing from Boeing and your confidence in being able to kind of exiting this year and going into next year, being able to kind of deliver on that capacity. And if you look at -- if you could change just at a high level, again, what are the big chunks of kind of headwinds and tailwinds next year on the cost side?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Thanks, Savi. Boeing has been doing a phenomenal job for us this year. In fact, if we were to blame them for anything, it would be that they\u2019ve given us all their planes on time. And so we\u2019ve added capacity to the schedule a little bit, which people are questioning today, but they\u2019ve really been good delivering on schedule. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had one aircraft come after it was scheduled to be in service. So, they\u2019ve continued to do a really good job. We have a bunch of deliveries in December. December is always a month where things can slide around a week or two. So there might be 1 or 2 units that end up in January of next year, but we\u2019re not concerned about that at all. I think they\u2019ve recovered very well from both the quality escape and the spirit sort of period that they went through recently. So, we\u2019re feeling good about the fleet plan going into next year. I think we\u2019re anxious for them to get the Dash -- the MAX 10 certified. Whenever that happens, we don\u2019t know when it will, but can\u2019t wait to fly that airplane and take a lot of those. But Boeing has been just really, really good this year in terms of getting back on plan for deliveries.\nSavi Syth: Just on the major buckets there on next day?\nShane Tackett: I liked the first question, I forgot about the second one. Look, I think on the sort of tailwind side, I mentioned a couple of these. We have $100 million of cost step-up on the 900 ER engine deal this year, that will be fully lapped. Look, the vast majority of contract costs, we are currently lapping. We do have deals that we need to get done with our flight attendants and our mechanics which we\u2019re anxious to do and we\u2019re actively obviously working on those. I would expect and I hope that some of those costs are captured this year, but there will be some additional lapping to do of those deals next year. I\u2019m not going to talk about sort of amounts. And then the Airbus transition costs will be fully behind us, which will be another really good positive tailwind. And then like I said, it\u2019s with a -- our job now is to take and translate a really strong operation that is performing well and making sure that we\u2019re doing that at the most efficient cost structure possible. So, those are lots of little opportunities throughout the company, but we\u2019re going to be really focused on leaning out the cost structure next year because of our operational excellence.\nSavi Syth: Helpful. And can I clarify just quickly on those kind of fare softness. When did you start to see that? I think the other kind of question that investors are going to have is, obviously, is this the start of further declines, or is there something a new level that you\u2019ve seen stabilize? Just a little bit more on that when you saw that fare and then what you\u2019re seeing today?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Hi, Savi. As you know, our quarters build up the quarters beforehand. But I think as we were coming into the summer a little while ago, we started to see in the third quarter a couple of months ago, just starting to see that there might have been peaked and coming down a little bit off there. Again, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say -- use the term softness. I do think it\u2019s that finding that fine balance between the demand and supply. But again, as the Street has been reporting as well over the last 6 to 8 weeks, there\u2019s been coming off of the high and we saw that a couple of months ago.\nBen Minicucci: And Savi, remember, demand is still very strong on the domestic side. Our load factors were some of the highest we\u2019ve seen. And it\u2019s really due to the surge in international. And I think if you really look at it, international is going to be strong from maybe June through September, October. But as kids get back to school and things start to normalize, like I do think this thing is going to find its equilibrium. So, I just wanted to give just a little more context on how we\u2019re seeing it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien from Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: I know we spoke a little bit about this last quarter, and you touched on the prepared remarks, Shane, but unit costs coming in at the midpoint on higher than planned capacity is not traditional Alaska performance, I guess. Do you expect to be able to squeeze some of those labor costs tied to shoring up operations as we exit the year, or is that really more of a 2024 opportunity?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Thanks, Catie. It\u2019s probably more of a 2024, you sort of need the volumes to be there. And even though Q4 capacity is growing year-over-year, it\u2019s still down sequentially from Q2 and Q3. Not that we won\u2019t be focused on it, but the other thing, we have to get through this full Airbus transition and all of the pilot training. One other potential tailwind for us next year, I didn\u2019t speak too much about, but we will be bringing on a preferential bidding system with our pilots sort of earlyish in the year, maybe April, it will take us a few months to get our feet under ourselves there, but that should also be marginally helpful on the -- on just the cost efficiency and productivity front.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. That\u2019s great. And then, Andrew, you gave some stats on loyalty members flying on partners, uptick in international travelers going to your clubs. How does all that -- how does Alaska benefit from that? Does that hit your P&L? How do we think about that? I mean, obviously, you guys are a primarily domestic carrier. But just wondering if there\u2019s any piece of the business that benefits from this international shift? Thanks.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Thanks, Catie. Actually, it\u2019s extremely exciting for us. It shows that we have our members that our global loyalty program really works. They\u2019re using the benefits and more importantly, as we move more and more partners to sell directly on alaskaair.com, it just really opens up the utility that we can provide for our members that you really can fly globally with Alaska Airlines. So, it\u2019s actually proving out the thesis, and I\u2019m very excited as we move through the rest of the year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Shane, I want to get back to your point on the flight attendants mechanics deals yet to be done. Have you considered accruing for those agreements? And the reason I ask is, there was a time where actually all the airlines used to accrue for labor deals. And then I think we got to the point where it was just Southwest. And now we\u2019re seeing United accrue for their pilot deals. What\u2019s your thinking about that the philosophy, does that make sense? And why not start it now? And then I have one more.\nShane Tackett: Yes. Thanks, Mike. We haven\u2019t considered accruing -- we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re cognizant that some others have done that. I think the levels that those contracts represented that kind of made sense, but it\u2019s never -- since I\u2019ve been here, been something that we\u2019ve done. And I think it really just goes to the uncertainty around timing and we like to keep those discussions between ourselves and the union leaders at the property and not really be talking about what the economic impacts could be, which -- other companies have been a little bit more willing to talk about that in the open. We think it\u2019s a better approach to keep all that stuff between the parties and then once we\u2019re done, let folks know what we did.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, makes sense. And then just my second question to Andrew, and I realize this is more of a later this year, early next year, but you do have some pretty meaningful route changes, seasonal changes. And I know this goes back to a few quarters ago, maybe a quarter or two ago where you sort of came out and said we have to run a better airline or from a margin perspective in the winter in our -- what is historically our seasonally weakest time frame. As I think about later this year, early next year, it does seem like a good portion of your ASMs will be new routes. And it feels like it\u2019s been some time, maybe since probably the Virgin acquisition where you will have that much of your capacity in new markets. And I don\u2019t know, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, anything that you could sort of shout out since it\u2019s still early on things that you\u2019re sort of planning to do and maybe would address my question about how much of it is new flying versus historical. I feel like there\u2019s a few questions in there, so I\u2019ll stop there.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Don\u2019t worry, Mike. Well, I\u2019m glad you asked because it\u2019s actually a really important question and point. Our schedules will start to reflect and are being reflected, but we\u2019ve moved about 9 points of our capacity around in the first quarter. We\u2019ve also got extremely laser-focused on the makeup of the first quarter, which is really 3 distinct seasons for us coming off of the Christmas and the holidays. Then a very difficult period and then, of course, you move into March and the spring. You\u2019ve seen a number of new markets from us. Those are obviously reallocations. You see us leaning hard into Latin. We\u2019re trying some things like Mexico from Las Vegas is unserved, Nassau and all of those things. But honestly, the bigger impact on our capacity is just reallocating across our network, and that\u2019s sort of the 9 points of which some of these new markets are part of, but we\u2019re getting more disciplined, how much we\u2019re flying to New York City during the depths of winter, those types of things.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just firstly, anything in the 3Q comp from last year, you could call out? For example, was there any travel credit breakage above trend that you could quantify?\nShane Tackett: Hey Duane, it\u2019s Shane. Good morning. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything sort of materially worth calling out on the 3Q comp basis, certainly not on the breakage stuff. We -- I think we had already gotten through most of that prior.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. The only thing in the third quarter last year, obviously, coming off the back of some operational challenges in the pilot pipeline, we had some closer in pull downs that impacted summer and specifically California in a large way, but other than that.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And you mentioned some holiday shifts. Could you just elaborate on that?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. That\u2019s just the minor, the 4th of July fell on a Friday. And so we think -- which was June this year versus July last year. So there\u2019s a little bit of movement into the month of June. I think just interestingly, as we noted, two years running now, the unit revenue in June is our highest of the year, and that seems to be continuing.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes. Thanks. And then just I think another comment you made, which was interesting on -- in the quarter, for the quarter bookings. Could you put a finer point on that as it relates to the booking curve? Are these within a week, within 30 days? And does -- I know you\u2019re not baking that trend continuing, but does that imply that you now enter a quarter with lower visibility than you historically had?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think -- I mean, kudos to the revenue management team. I think when you look at what you\u2019re referring to is the amount of bookings we take in the month -- to fly in the month. When you look at sold too soons last year, we\u2019ve had really good improvements this year on Hawaii, Mid-Con into California, even the Transcon Southeast. And essentially, what we\u2019re seeing is we have availability and the demand is there, and we\u2019re filling the airplanes, and you see that both in the higher load factor. But interestingly, even with business demand down, especially for June, we saw more close-in within 2019.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So, sorry, you\u2019re not baking that into your guidance, but have you seen any change in trend as it relates to this close-in showing up?\nAndrew Harrison: I will just -- I can sit here the day on the 25th of July and tell you that I\u2019m continuing to see that close-in strength this month.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephen Trent from Citi.\nStephen Trent: Just one, and I know it does not directly pertain to you. But considering that your partner, American Airlines, is going to do the unwind of the Northeast alliance? Did that in any way kind of lead you guys to pivot on your eastbound strategy?\nNat Pieper: Stephen, it\u2019s Nat Pieper. Thanks for the question. A couple of things just to distinguish our partnership with American; A, we\u2019re pleased with it; and B, reviewed and approved by the DOT in 2020. And the good thing about that partnership is it\u2019s very much a traditional airline alliance. It links -- we link our complementary networks with codeshare. We offer reciprocal loyalty benefits that have really resonated with guests. So, we see plentiful opportunities with American in continuing to link our networks in places of weakness for each of us and offer more utility for our joint customers going forward.\nStephen Trent: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. I appreciate the color. And just one very quick follow-up, which I know is also not directly related to you guys, but -- you mentioned some potential perking up of the tech industry travel. Do you have any sort of specific signposts there? Like I think I heard something about Microsoft turning on corporate travel again or any sort of return to office initiatives you\u2019re hearing from your tech partners -- customers rather?\nAndrew Harrison: Hi, Stephen. We did make the comment that we might break through the 75% ceiling as we move forward. Just a couple of interesting data points. But 10 of our top 20 corporate accounts are actually recovered revenues and over 2019 levels right now. But we are seeing high variability within those accounts. We are still seeing some high-tech companies very low, not recovered, but we\u2019re also seeing some high-tech covered companies that actually are fully recovered. So I think what I would say to you is that we\u2019re starting to see a thawing. It\u2019s not a all the techs are down now. We\u2019re seeing some really start to perk up. And I think this why gives us a little bit of hope that there might be some green shoots here as we move through the rest of the year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dan McKenzie from Seaport Global.\nDan McKenzie: I guess, a couple of questions here. Andrew, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s been a change in the composition of revenue by advanced purchase bucket. So more discounting further out, firmer pricing closer in and, at least, in kind of what you referenced to your close-in strength today. And I\u2019m just wondering if the current forecast for the third quarter is predicated on strong close-in demand throughout the quarter.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Thanks, Dan. You\u2019re spot on, like the structured fares are what they are. But what we are seeing in the sale fares, they\u2019re sort of a little down than they were this time last year as in lower. But the close-in 0 to 13-day fares are actually up than they were last year. So overall, you\u2019re seeing that softness on the sale fare side. And we not baked into our forecast continued close-in booking strength.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Perfect. Okay. And then, going back to the commentary on business travel potentially coming back later this year and next, I know it\u2019s not in the outlook for this year. But are there conversations with corporate travel managers to lead you believe it\u2019s -- it could come back later this year, or is it really just a view that California weakness has to reverse at some point?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. A lot of people say they\u2019re going to do things and then what they actually do may be different. I think what we\u2019re just looking at is across our corporates, who\u2019s doing what. And I do think there is a soaring from what I see and an upward momentum in a number of these. And so, again, while I -- we need to make sure, obviously, and looking at the business fares and they\u2019re holding up quite well. It just depends on as they move through. And I\u2019ve always had the philosophy that a lot of this is driven by budgeting by our good friends, the CFOs in these organizations. And you really are not going to see a material change in rebudgeting until 2024. So, that\u2019s just what I see.\nBen Minicucci: And Dan, it\u2019s Ben. You got to remember, on the West Coast, we have some of the biggest companies in the world headquartered here on the West Coast, both in Seattle and in the Bay Area. So, it is a more difficult time for them, but they\u2019re going to come out of this. Again, we\u2019re optimistic they\u2019ll come out of it towards the latter part of the year and into next year. And it is dry powder for us. There is going to be tailwinds for us. And these are the biggest companies in the world, and there should be a lot of upside.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna Group.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So, with the capacity raise, it\u2019s entirely on completion rate, but could you remind us, as you think about the mix of frequency gauge and stage that you outlined last year, how this -- how 2023 is shaping up? And then also, you spoke about in your prepared remarks on prioritizing reliability. Normally, I would think if you\u2019re trying to prioritize that or build and buffer to your capacity that the guide would have come lower. So, I just want to better understand here the moving pieces here or the composition of capacity as we think about the back half of the year. Thanks.\nShane Tackett: Yes. Hey Chris, it\u2019s Shane. We set a 70% of the -- 90% of the -- sorry, 70% of the growth, I think, was stage and gauge, like three quarters. And I think that\u2019s what you saw in the second quarter. I think that was reflected in Andrew\u2019s commentary. And that will start to abate as we get towards the end of the year and lap some of that impact when we start aggressively getting out of the Airbus flying. Good question on reliability being a priority? How do you do that and then guide up, not down. What I can tell you is with the planes and the people that we had for this year, we could have flown even more than we are now telling you we\u2019re going to fly. And so, we put a significant amount of buffer into this year. I think I talked about it last quarter that we were outperforming many of those assumptions, both on the delivery side from Boeing, our own completion rate. And so, we\u2019re just sort of squaring up now with the fact that we\u2019ve been overperforming on a lot of those assumptions. But, we thought it was prudent this year given the last couple of years to assume a much lower completion rate than normal. And we\u2019ve outperformed it, which is a really good story. And now we just need to kind of normalize the Company around the completion rate we are achieving today.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then on 2024, I realize it\u2019s still early. It sounds like you\u2019re suggesting that we could see unit costs down on a kind of a 6% or mid-single-digitish type growth here. But -- and you do have the benefit of gauge here, of course, there is this slight miss with respect to forecasting. But if we think about RASM for next year and the ability to grow in excess of that, and sort of the moving pieces here as we think about the debate, this pool of international travelers that are being -- or the pool of travelers here that are being consumed by international, certainly debate on the duration of how long that lasts? And there is concern out there that the domestic capacity is going to continue to grow. So, is it fair to think that kind of holding load factors here constant for this year that you can grow your RASM in excess of CASM next year? Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Hey Chris, I think we are pretty -- we have a pretty standard practice not to speak about next year on these types of calls, although I totally understand and appreciate the question. Look, it\u2019s a little too far forward for us to predict what the economic environment is going to be, what everybody\u2019s capacity is going to be. I think generally, across the industry, you\u2019ve seen capacity guides come in from where they were originally sort of talking about. So I think there\u2019s a lot of open questions on what people are going to fly next year. I would point to the fact that Andrew just spoke about a really -- a focus on Q1 and sort of reconcentrating the network, so we\u2019ve got opportunity to do better in Q1. And then we\u2019ve got these other tailwinds with this region of the country, improving with international demand normalizing at some point. And yes, it could be a little longer than we\u2019re thinking, but it may not be in business travel recovering plus a lot more that we can push on the commercial initiatives. So there are some other things other than just pure growth that should drive the top line of the company next year. And obviously, we\u2019re going to be talking to you guys a lot more about that in the next couple of calls.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nShane Tackett: All right, everybody. So, our time is up. So thank you so much for dialing in, and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for attending."}, {"symbol": "ALK", "quarter": 1, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-04-20 15:24:16", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alaska Air Group 2023 First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. After our speakers' remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session for analysts.  I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Vice President of Finance, Planning and Investor Relations, Ryan St. John.\nRyan St. John : Thank you, operator, and good morning. Thank you for joining us first quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, which is available at investor.alaskaair.com. Today, you'll hear updates from Ben, Andrew and Shane. Several others of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. This morning, Air Group reported a first quarter GAAP net loss of $142 million. Excluding special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Air Group reported an adjusted net loss of $79 million. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements about future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found within our SEC filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release. Over to you, Ben.\nBenito Minicucci : Hello, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to welcome Ryan St. John as our new Head of Investor Relations. Ryan is a 15-year veteran of Alaska and also leads our financial and resource planning groups. I'm excited to see Ryan step into this role and know he will do a great job in it. I also must acknowledge Emily Halverson, who Ryan is replacing. Emily stepped into the IR role at the onset of the pandemic, not the easiest time to learn how to do this important and challenging work. Emily has been fantastic as our Head of IR, but this change will allow her to fully focus on leading our accounting and financial reporting functions as our controller. So now turning to our results. Despite our first quarter loss, I am pleased to report that our operational and financial performance trended positively as we progressed throughout the quarter. We are actively driving improvements in our business, and I believe we are well positioned to capitalize in the second and third quarters. It's important to note that Alaska, along with the entire industry, historically experienced weaker results in the first quarter, and our loss is primarily a reflection of our current network seasonality. In the past, Alaska has found ways to breakeven or earn a small profit in the first quarter. Therefore, we are setting a target to reduce our first quarter profit seasonality over the next few years. That's the right goal for us to have in the future, and it will have a meaningful impact on our full year results. The start of this year has presented more challenging weather conditions than we've seen historically. Persistent storms, regular snow and elevated icing conditions throughout January and February across all our geographies, including California, led to higher cancellation rates than normal. Additionally, volcanic ash in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest recently disrupted our operations for several days. Despite these challenges, we still operated with one of the best rate year-to-date. We will continue to prioritize operational performance, and we remain committed to delivering a reliable experience for our people and our guests, especially as we move into peak demand periods. Although we can't control what Mother Nature throws at us, I have set a goal for our teams to significantly harden our operational resiliency before next winter and to reduce cancels and customer impacts from weather to the greatest extent possible. The total impact of storms in Q1 were in the order of $13 million. But most importantly, this quarter, we delivered on metrics that were squarely within our control. First quarter capacity, revenue and unit costs, excluding fuel, all landed within our originally guided ranges. I am particularly encouraged to see less close in variability and greater stability when forecasting company performance than we've seen in the past 3 years as stability returns, our ability to execute on our cost and commercial initiatives improves. Looking ahead, our outlook and priorities remain unchanged as we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives. Our teams remain focused on returning us to the foundational strengths that have served Air Group well for decades. These strengths, including operational excellence, disciplined cost management, high productivity and low overhead will continue to be the primary drivers of consistent, profitable growth, and we are making good progress on several fronts. Our productivity trends are improving. Total passengers per FTE is up 6% compared to last year, and we have increased total aircraft utilization by 14%. In fact, our mainline utilization has exceeded 2019 levels. Absentee and attrition rates have declined across all work groups, including pilot attrition rates after the ratification of our new contract back in October. With several labor contracts signed last year, we are looking forward to reaching a deal with our flight attendants and aircraft technicians soon to complete the cycle. Our move to a single mainline fleet is driving better economics. We have improved fuel efficiency by 4% year-over-year this quarter or the equivalent of $25 million and 7 million fuel gallons saved as a direct result of the superior MAX aircraft in our fleet. This is equivalent of taking 15,000 cars off the road each year. Additionally, our upgauging strategy, which adds 28 more seats per aircraft than the A320s we replaced, allows us to unlock growth efficiencies without adding departures within an already constrained operating environment. As a result, we are now producing 20% more ASMs per aircraft than we did at this time last year. Finally, our balance sheet continues to be a pillar of strength. Our trailing 12-month return on invested capital has continued to improve, reaching double digits for the first time since the pandemic began. Our financial strength has also allowed us to support a long history of shareholder returns, and during the first quarter, we officially restarted our share repurchase program to offset dilution and remain on target to spend at least $100 million this year. As we approach our busy Q2 and Q3, we are well prepared for peak summer flying. We have taken proactive steps to prepare our airline, including doubling our pilot training throughput compared to the same period last year and providing a 1-day immersive care retreat to 14,000 guest-facing employees. This retreat emphasized our core values of being kind-hearted and doing the right thing as well as focused on self-care, team care and guest care, which are essential to our culture. This has become even more important and necessary in leadership's view post-pandemic. Our people are integral to our success, and I am proud of the work they do preparing our airline to meet demand while performing at a high level of operational excellence. We have taken deliberate steps to build momentum coming out of this recovery and to fortify our ability to deliver on our targets. As we look forward, we have line of sight to returning to strong double-digit adjusted pretax margins this quarter. And assuming a stable economy, we remain confident that we will deliver our full year adjusted pretax margin of 9% to 12% and earnings per share of $5.50 to $7.50, which we believe will be at or near the top of the industry. Despite the potential for a recession and softening in some sectors of the economy, travel demand remains strong. And while our industry and business may face continued economic volatility in 2023, it remains to be seen if there will be any negative impact on revenue. At Alaska, we have a proven track record of adapting and navigating challenging environments. As we progress on our road map to profitable growth, we are already seeing the benefits of restoring our historical strength as a single fleet operator and unlocking new commercial initiatives. This positions us well in any environment to continue to deliver on our financial commitments and drive our long-term success. And with that, I'll turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison : Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will focus on our first quarter results and in particular, on March, which I believe is more indicative of what we see going forward. I will also share our thoughts on second quarter trends and guidance. First quarter revenues totaled $2.2 billion, and that's up 31% versus the first quarter of 2022 with capacity up 14% over the same period. This marked a significant milestone for us as we finally restored capacity to pre-pandemic levels, a 3-year journey. Load factor came in at 80%, exceeding last year's load by 3 points as we lap the effects of Omicron in early 2022. Even when comparing our results to 2019, we delivered strong revenue progression throughout the quarter with January unit revenues up 13%; February up 15%; and March up 19%. The strong results in March are a good indication of where we're headed as we look to the second quarter. Total March revenue came in above our record-breaking March last year on both higher capacity and higher yields while our pretax margin was nearly 2 points better despite higher fuel prices. Throughout my tenure at Air Group, this airline has been solidly profitable 10 months of the year, with January and February always being the most difficult due to our network configuration and predominantly leisure consumer base. Layer and business travel that hasn't fully recovered plus exceptionally high fuel prices, and it made for a tough quarter. As Ben mentioned, we are committed to driving improvements in these months to accommodate seasonally low demand with an aim to return to breakeven or better in the first quarter in future years. Moving to business travel. Nearly all of our core hubs are in geographies where business has not returned as quickly as in other major economic centers throughout the country, corporate layoffs and a heavy concentration in the tax sector being major contributors. Yet despite the lagging tech sector, which is roughly 50% to 60% restored to pre-pandemic travel levels, overall, business travel remains around 75% recovered by volume and 85% to 90% by revenue when compared to 2019 levels. I believe the lag in West Coast business travel is upside for us, which we have not factored into our revenue forecast. There may be opportunity ahead as corporate travel budgets increase given some companies begin returning to the office and move into new fiscal periods later this year. We see continuing strength this year in premium and loyalty performance. First and Premium Class revenues were up 35% and 33% year-over-year, respectively, on higher payload factors and fares. This front cabin preference has persisted, and I expect this trend to continue. Bank cash remuneration also remains strong as we lap the anniversary of our renewed credit card deal with Bank of America. For the quarter, it was up 17% year-over-year. And with the launch of our new card benefits, acquisitions have exceeded our expectations. With the highest quarterly sign-ups in our history, surpassing 100,000 new cards during the quarter. Regarding network and alliances, we are progressing nicely on our plan to unlock selling capabilities for 10 airline partners on our website this year, with the goal of making alaskaair.com a gateway to the world for our guests. Since our last call, we've turned on selling capabilities for Iberia as partner #5, and work is currently underway to launch three more airlines by summer. While we know partner-enabled selling drives positive yield contributions to our network, Direct sales also offer a low-cost distribution channel that not only supports our partners but reinforces to our guests that Alaska Airlines can deliver on their global travel needs, which in turn keeps our guests within our network and loyalty program. I am excited to see this area of our commercial initiatives continue to grow and drive incremental benefit in line with our goals to enable 8% to 10% of our total revenues through Alliance Partners. Turning to second quarter guidance. We have line of sight to delivering strong results above and beyond the record quarter we produced last year during the demand for our industry experienced. For Q2, we expect total revenue to be up 2.5% to 5.5% year-over-year on capacity that is up 6% to 9%. While we experienced softness in close-in bookings in January and February, which is understandable given the lack of business travel that usually materializes during this period, we exited March seeing improved performance across the booking curve. Near term, we continue to see strength in demand with held yields sitting above both 2019 and 2022 levels as we move into the second quarter. My team is doing a great job optimizing the load and yield equation as capacity and demand remains more stable this year compared to last. I'm very excited to have Kirsten Amrine step into a new VP role overseeing both revenue management and network planning. Kirsten has spent her 16 years at Air Group in various roles in revenue management. START Her deep knowledge and expertise have been an asset as we constantly learn how to manage our inventory to account for new shifts in booking patterns and make network adjustments going forward. Brett Catlin has done a fantastic job at managing our network for the last 4 years, and he will be taking on direct responsibility for our loyalty and credit card programs, corporate sales and continuing his alliance responsibilities. These leadership changes will ensure that the commercial organization stays laser focused and coordinated on these critical revenue-generating levers. As Ben mentioned, our growth this year is primarily being driven by gauge and stage, a highly efficient form of expansion. Having returned to pre-pandemic levels of capacity at a system level, we are focused on building network depth in Portland and working to fully restore our network in many California markets. Looking to the remainder of the year, we are poised to produce strong results as we rebuild our network upgauge efficiently and refine our revenue capabilities within this evolving demand environment. Importantly, we are performing in line with our internal targets and remain confident in delivering on our full year goals. We have proven product initiatives in place, and they will continue to drive value for our business as we move forward. And with that, I'll pass it over to Shane.\nShane Tackett : Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As Ben mentioned, we experienced improved stability to the business this quarter, which was good to see. In my experience, the biggest challenge to operational and cost management historically has been volatility. And as that volatility subsides, our ability to drive consistent operational and cost improvements is enhanced. I'm encouraged that we were able to start the year with financial performance, absent fuel price impacts within our original guidance ranges. Alaska has a long history of delivering on our commitments and guidance, and we are focused on doing so again in the second quarter and for the full year. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity. We remain well positioned with both. Our debt to cap finished the quarter at 48% and our net debt-to-EBITDAR stood below 1 turn at 0.8x, both of these metrics are within our long-term target ranges. Debt payments were approximately $100 million for the quarter and are expected to be $50 million and $100 million in the second and third quarters, respectively. We generated $222 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, while total liquidity inclusive of on-hand cash and undrawn lines of credit was a healthy $2.8 billion at quarter end. As our business normalizes and we continue to pay for aircraft deliveries, we will anchor toward the higher end of our target liquidity range of 15% to 25% of revenue or around $2 billion to $2.4 billion, inclusive of lines of credit. Our trailing 12-month return on invested capital surpassed double digits and closed the quarter at 10.6%. The last time we achieved double-digit trailing 12-month ROIC was, not surprisingly, February of 2020. It's nice for this metric to, once again, be well above our cost of capital, and our goal is to now remain above 10% and grow from there. We also restarted our share repurchase program this quarter and have spent approximately $23 million year-to-date, a marker on our way to returning to our long-term capital allocation goals. Turning to the performance of the business. We executed to our plan in the quarter, again, absent fuel price. First quarter CASMex was down 1% year-over-year on capacity up 14%, both within our guided ranges. Our teams did an excellent job delivering on their internal targets with the only source of significant variance being the cost of challenging winter weather that Ben mentioned, which was approximately $8 million of cost of the $13 million total impact. Our completion rate exceeded our goal, while daily aircraft utilization increased 14% year-over-year, helping us return to pre-pandemic capacity. With the retirement of our A320s and Q400s in January, our total aircraft count was down 29 aircraft the ASMs were up 14% versus Q1 2022, demonstrating the impact of both utilization and the benefits of our upgauging strategy. It's worth acknowledging that our capacity was at the high end of our guide and our CASMex fuel was just below our midpoint. I would like to see us return to our historical pattern of matching capacity outperformance with commensurate cost outperformance, and I'm confident we will ultimately see this. We are wholly focused on continuing to rebuild this muscle over the next several quarters. Fuel was a clear headwind in the first quarter. While crude prices were between $70 and $80 per barrel during the quarter, refining margins continued to be particularly volatile. Although they have been more stable in the past few weeks at what I would view as reasonable levels. Our first quarter fuel price was $3.41 per gallon versus our original guidance midpoint of $3.25 and versus $2.62 last year. This added more than $30 million of cost versus our guide, which equated to approximately 150 basis points in margin impact. For the second quarter, we estimate our price per gallon will be between $2.95 and $3.15. We hope this is a conservative guide as month-to-date, our all-in per gallon price is close to the $2.95 low end of our guide. At any fuel price within our range, we have line of sight to solid double-digit pretax margins for the quarter with any additional price favorability contributing direct upside opportunity to our results. Turning to capacity and cost guidance. We expect capacity to be up 6% to 9% versus Q2 2022, and CASMex to be up 1% to 3%. While lower than the 14% year-over-year capacity increase in the first quarter, when comparing to 2019, our Q2 and first half capacity is roughly flat while we expect to step up to low single-digit growth in the back half of the year. From a cost standpoint, the first quarter year-over-year comparison benefited from $35 million of lease return costs rolling off, while this is not the case for the second quarter. Along with lower sequential year-over-year growth, we have a slightly tougher cost comparisons set up this quarter. For the full year, we still expect to reduce unit costs 1% to 3% as we drive productivity improvements, leverage the restoration of our full network and lap labor deals in the back half of the year. Regarding our fleet transition, September 2023 will be the final month we operate the Airbus fleet. At which point, we will retire the last 10 A321s from what was at one point a 72 aircraft fleet. This cements our future as a single fleet operator by 2024. And as a result of this acceleration, we expect to incur approximately $300 million to $350 million in special fleet transition charges through the end of the year. By fully retiring the Airbus fleet at the end of the third quarter, we expect all of our pilot training and associated transition costs should now be completed by year-end with very little spillover into 2024. We will plan to transition the remaining Airbus pilots in the fourth quarter of this year, which will set us up for a clean 2024 from a pilot training and dual fleet cost headwind standpoint. We still expect to deliver 8% to 10% capacity growth this year. As we've mentioned before, following the setbacks we experienced last year, we derisked our 2023 capacity plan considerably and we'll remain conservative in our capacity commitments as we protect stability and prioritize reliability in our operation. which essentially means that we may continue to perform at the higher end of our guided capacity range if our completion rate continues to be strong. In closing, our management team has been very intentional in setting targets and ensuring we execute the steps necessary to deliver on them. We know we still have work to do. but we are encouraged by our recent results and are optimistic about the second and third quarters, which are our peak performance period. We remain at the belief that we have core competitive advantages, the right business model and the right strategic initiatives to continue to drive outperformance versus our peers in whatever economic backdrop we encounter. And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth : I wonder if you could talk about -- a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of kind of pass into travel changes versus pre-pandemic in terms of booking curve, seasonality, day of week or destination. Just curious on how that's progressing and how that's impacting how you're forecasting things.\nAndrew Harrison: So we're still working and observing a we build back. But a couple of things I will share is that number one, I think the booking curve is back sort of to 2019 levels. So we're sort of seeing leisure book further out again. So that's the first thing. I think second thing on the big day of week changes, Friday and Sunday are still CASM Kings. They generate the highest unit revenues of the week, but we've seen Saturday take a step change up, and that's been one of the strongest increase in unit revenue days of week. And so flying a bit more on Saturdays. I think Wednesday Tuesday or the weakest and then sort of Thursdays on Mondays. Another big change that's occurred is sort of the advanced booking window. I think in my career, I've never seen 30-day advance purchase barriers that have gone up. And we're seeing that across our network which sort of leads me to believe that essentially business travelers are actually booking further out than they have historically. And then the last thing I would mention is Ben as well articulated is we need to do a much better job at matching supply and demand and what's seems to be a weaker January and February with business traffic essentially down 25% at this time.\nSavi Syth : That's helpful color. And then if I might, on the fleet transition, the special charge that you talked about, is any of that cash this year? And just if you could talk a little bit more about how that transition went in kind of the first part with the A320s and how that's informing how you do the A321 transition?\nEmily Halverson : Savi, this is Emily. I will start on the cash, and then I'll hand it over to Nat to talk more about the fleet transition itself. Some of the cash will hit this year. I expect most of it -- most of what Shane mentioned, the 300 to 350 to hit over the next 12 months. We also have some cash that will be incurred this year related to the accruals that were taken last year. So as we work through the remainder of the A320 transition, it's all through the P&L already, but the cash is still going to be incurred in 2023.\nNathaniel Pieper : And Savi, on the A321s, it's Nat. We're really excited as you gather from Shane, from Ben, from Andrew, really everybody at Air Group to get this fleet transition done and get to single fleet as fast as we can. The plan is in motion. And now the last hurdle we've got to get over is to come up with an A321 exit plan, and we're getting close. Late-stage discussions with a bunch of parties, lessors, financial firms, other airlines, and our objective is to paper the transaction for the 10 aircraft by the end of the second quarter. And we're confident the way we've structured it that will come out on an NPV and cash flow positive basis versus parking the aircraft to maturity and just making lease payments until then.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham : So the implied exit rate on cost is obviously awesome, but can you just speak to how you get to the high and low end of the full year guide? The reason why I ask is that the ARC seems -- the [indiscernible] improvement seems pretty steep from up to the -- I think you're implying basically like down 6% in the fourth quarter. So I just want to understand the puts and takes and how you get there?\nShane Tackett: it's Shane. Yes, I think the biggest driver of the second half performance trend is going to be the lapping of labor deals. I think we talked about this the last couple of quarters. We've got about $75 million, $80 million of structural cost increase due to the 6 labor deals we signed last year, they start to lap in August, but the biggest one, of course, is our pilot deal that really starts to lap in Q4. So we'll be fully through the comp headwinds by the fourth quarter. That's the biggest one. I think the other thing just to realize is as we grew the first quarter of this year on an absolute basis over the fourth quarter of last year. We held extra resources to do that. We typically down in capacity Q4 to Q1. We stress the operation a bit and we made sure we had ample additional sort of resource to ensure that we didn't take a hit on completion rate or operational performance, which we did a really good job on the operations. So I think as we go forward, we'll get a little more productive with our resources, and then we'll start to lap these large labor deals.\nConor Cunningham : Okay. Helpful. And then on the -- I think last quarter, there was like endless discussion between the link of fuel and revenue. Today, obviously, sure a lot lower than where it was in January. So you're reiterating your unit revenue assumptions, I think, for the full year. So I'm just trying to understand, why wouldn't we be at the lower end of the range if [Jet fuels] here? I know that you have a lot going on. So maybe you could just talk a little bit about the revenue drivers that you have that could offset some of that.\nShane Tackett: Conor, I'll start on the fuel. I think what -- I think we've always sort of felt like unit revenue is going to be more a function of capacity capacity may be more a function of economic sort of backdrop that economic backdrop probably is what drives fuel. But I think our sort of full year expectation for fuel was in the 3.15 range or 3.20 range. We haven't decided that it's going to be materially below that yet. You can see our Q2 guidance is a little bit below that, but certainly above what we're paying today. If we sort of felt like there was a lot of confidence that fuel was trending below 2.90 or something, yes, I think then we might have a slightly different perspective on unit revenues. But right now, we think it's too early to tell. Fuel has been super volatile. Refining margins have moved around a lot in the first quarter. So we just -- our sort of baseline expectation as what we originally guided to over the -- in the first part of the year, which is fuel in the 3.10 and change in unit revenues roughly flat for the full year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Andrew, I was wondering if you could come back to your comments about sequential RASM here and looking at it year-over-year as well. Looks like you're going to be up sequentially, but maybe down from where you were in 2Q '22. Can you talk to that dynamic?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I mean, I think, well, sequentially from Q1 to Q2, you see an absolute unit revenue increase of about 1.5% on sort of giving our seasonality. And as we've sort of shared, I think where we're at right now is our growth is obviously 9-plus percent as we move forward. And so essentially, our goal is to bring in traffic in line with our capacity growth at higher -- at essentially revenue unit revenues that were essentially at the same level we achieved last year. So you're going to see them start to come down a little bit. We have, obviously, very tough comps, but I think big picture for us, the volumes are coming in as we sit here on Q2. And we're maintaining, give or take, a few points, our unit revenue increases that we achieved last year. So that's what goes into the guide, and that's how we feel pretty good about the second quarter.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I appreciate that. And then can you give us any detail on business travel trends in your network, especially given Silicon Valley Bank in March?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think on a macro level, and again, I just went back and looked at the ARC data as well as our own data around the weeks of all of that. And essentially, the booking levels, there's blips here and there, but they've sort of really been stuck at this back in our network at least 75% with revenues closer to 85% and 90%. And I think as we look forward, we're not forecasting it, but we're hoping to see as we move past some of these little shocks to the system that business travel comes back a little bit better than the 75% it's been at, but we're not expecting it.\nOperator: And we'll hear next from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker : The last response, you said in your prepared remarks that West Coast corporate travel is an opportunity for you and I completely agree. But at what point do you kind of say that, hey, that's taking too long or maybe that's just structurally not coming back as much as you think kind of given the job cuts there. I was wondering, do you envision a point where you're structurally thinking of moving away from West Coast corporate as much exposure as you had and moving more towards a leader traveler?\nAndrew Harrison: That's actually a really good question, Ravi. I think where we are, for now, is that the close-in volumes aren't there. And so we're going to be biasing towards building the volumes outside of the typical business window. Actually, right now, leisure revenues are up about 130% versus 2019, very, very strong. And so we're going to continue to capitalize on that and watch that. And I think on the network side, some of the hub to hub heavy traditional business traffic markets, we're going to sort of trim back and maybe put that capacity elsewhere. So again, we're watching it. But I think that's going to be a big question as we move forward through this year.\nRavi Shanker : Got it. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up. Kind of given your West Coast alliance and get a part of oneworld, how do we think about China reopening as a potential tailwind for you guys over the next 12 months? Kind of how do you size the multiplier effect of domestic travel once you have people coming in through the West Coast hubs?\nNathaniel Pieper : Ravi, it's Nat Pieper. Great question on China. And I can't speak specifically to that as we're kind of watching that with all of our Alliance Partners. What I can say is that we're really optimistic and bullish with the oneworld feed and linking our West Coast network to our partners, whether it's nonstop flights into Seattle, Japan Airlines to Tokyo, Finair to Helsinki and then Los Angeles with Iberia. We're really seeing a lot of pickup and a lot of incremental revenue that's getting there. So as China opens over time, we'd expect to participate in that through our partners.\nOperator: We'll move next to Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora : Andrew, just can you talk to how recovered your California market is right now? How do you think about the build up here? And we've actually heard anecdotally over the last few days from several folks just -- and seeing transcon fares pretty weak. What kind of dynamic do you think is going on there that from your seat?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think we talk in macro levels about our growth and getting back flat with '19. The reality is Seattle is actually healthily above 2019. And the rest of the network and specifically California is still below 2019. And so in some respects, I think that's the right place to be. I think on a year-over-year basis, we've actually, in our network, at least being very happy with our unit revenue performance in the California market because we are building ourselves back to a stronger place. And so at the highest level, your comments are actually absolutely true. I think for us internally, we feel good that our California network is actually improving.\nAndrew Didora : Got it. And then thoughts on transcon?\nAndrew Harrison: California transCon?\nAndrew Didora : Yes.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Again, I think especially with our partnership with American and part of oneworld, we've got code on these flights, especially out of the Bay Area that's really helping. And I think we'll see what happens this summer, although it's not specifically West Coast, but I think the general New York areas, some of the slots are being pulled down a little bit. But again, I think we're in a better position than we were certainly last year as it relates to the transcon markets.\nAndrew Didora : Got it. Understood. And then, Shane, what would have to happen for you to consider buying back more stock than just for dilution purposes?\nShane Tackett: Andrew, I might just add one thing. I think your sort of implication of the question is California is somewhat weaker in terms of recovery than a lot of the rest of the country. And I think that's generally true. We've done a good job putting the right supply in there, but it's all upside for us. And I think we're feeling good because we've got a chance to still be the industry's top margin producer and further upside when California does recover. It's the sixth largest economy in the world. It's going to come back...\nAndrew Didora : I wasn't saying that it was unexpectedly weak. I was just curious where it was in the recovery?\nShane Tackett: Got you. No, I appreciate that. Yes, I think we're -- I think if we continue to trade at prices that we believe are a really good value, which is what we believe about our stock price today, we'll have a bias to do more than just dilution throughout the year. So we'll continue to talk about that internally and with our Board. But I think if prices are where they are today, we'll probably be more aggressive in the second quarter.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien : So maybe just one more on the revenue. Your guidance is implying a reacceleration in RASM in 2Q from 1Q on a versus '19 basis that helps us for seasonality there. Can you just walk us through what drove the deceleration from year-end into 1Q and what you're seeing today that gives you confidence in a better 2Q? Is that just higher leisure mix? Or is there anything else driving that improvement?\nAndrew Harrison: Catie, just to touch on Q2 first. We're actually -- we have 63% of the second quarter's revenues in the books right now. And I think as I look forward, looking at what we've been booking in the last few weeks, both on the yield side and the traffic side, it's sitting very nicely in our guide. I think from Q4 to Q1, obviously, growth in the first quarter was very significant at 14%. And also, obviously, in what is our weakest quarter being January and February. I think as it relates to January and February, I do think that -- and this is on me that we -- had we known differently, we probably would have structured and shaped the network a little differently in January and February. And of course, we had some very difficult weather in issues there as well that didn't help. But -- that's really a big part of the deceleration. But again, as you can see in the graphs, we're back on up. We're accelerating back into March, April, May and June, and I think we're on a good trajectory.\nCatherine O'Brien : Great. And then maybe one for Shane. So based on your commentary on two half capacity growth and then your comments on being considerate on completion, it sounds like there's a decent chance you're going to come in at the higher end of capacity guide. Should that inform our view on how CASM ultimately comes in? Or there offsets that higher capacity where we shouldn't assume coming in at the higher end of the capacity moves us towards the better end of the down 1 to 3 similar to what we just saw in the first quarter?\nShane Tackett: And I tried to address this a bit in my script. We were at the high end in Q1 of capacity. We have built conservatism into the capacity guide. We certainly have more planes and more resources that we could fly harder if we wanted to put more capacity into the system. We're going to continue to prioritize operational reliability and stability, and we're going to watch the economy closely. So I think I said in the script that if we continue to complete flights at a high level, we could easily be at the high end of that range. And I think that's an absolute true statement, and that's kind of where we would expect to be at this point. I don't think we should infer too much in terms of a change in our posture on unit costs. Our goal long term would be to be on the high end of the capacity range and the low end of the CASMex range. That's where we want to get back to. We didn't do that in Q1. I think we'll get there. It's just a matter of rebuilding this muscle we need stability in the operation, which we now have. We need to lap some of the headwinds that we've got, which we're going to do. And I don't think we've forgotten how to work the cost muscle. We just need some time to go do it. And that's what we're going to focus on this year. And by the end of the year, I think we'll be in a position to outperform capacity and be on the better end of our CASM guide as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Just on the technology corporate recovery status one we've been looking for, for a while. I think you said 50% to 60%. Is that a revenue or a volume comment? And maybe you could just put it in context, was it at a higher level than that at any point last year? In other words, are you seeing any incremental weakness in tech business travel? Or is it kind of bouncing along the bottom where it has been for some time? .\nAndrew Harrison: It's Andrew. That's a volume metric that I just gave you. And there are some technology companies that are way worse than that and some that are actually way better than that. I think just going off memory, I think back in the third quarter of '22, I think we saw a resurgence a little bit of tech. And then we started to see it collapsed by the back end of the year again. And just -- it just really has not changed. And my personal view is that literally, this is driven by the CFOs and a constraint on travel and budgets. And until that gets released, I don't think we're going to see an improvement.\nBenito Minicucci : It's Ben. Just on that, just being here on the West Coast and watching some of these big tech companies, mandate, return to office, new fiscal budgets coming. It's not in our forecast, but I think we just see a lot of upside going forward in the future. I think we're out of the trough, to answer your question, and we're hopeful that it gets better as these tech companies recover and get stable and then move forward with their business.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Great. And then -- I appreciate that. And then just on revenue management generally and the trade-off between loads and yields any different approach going forward than maybe the one that you entered the March quarter with? And could you just contrast that approach right here and now versus how you thought about the world in 2019?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. That's -- you know what, for Kirsten and I, the load and yield trade-off is what keeps us up at night. It is a critical question. And I think really what we wrestle with on a daily basis is how much do we rely on the close-in both yields and volume. And to date, we've seen them be a little weaker versus -- certainly versus 2019. So I think as we continue to watch this, but I think when you go back to 2019, unit revenues were up a couple of points. Capacity was up a couple of points. It was a pretty stable nonexciting year per se, but I think the volatility that we've got going on and looking at how we manage these ebbs and flows is key. So I think as we go closer into summer and we are a high leisure carrier, and that's where we -- Q2 and specialty 3 is where we really do well. We're going to have to really wrestle with that question.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Well, speaking of return to office mandates, here I am. So it's typically better to take local yields over connecting yields, just sort of a broader industry comment. But in light of this surging international demand dynamic right now year-on-year, is Alaska at a point where prioritizing fee to long-haul oneworld flights might make more economic sense? Or would that be sort of overstating the portion of the international Terry, that you take. I mean are you still better off chasing local yields in other words?\nAndrew Harrison: Jamie, it's a question that we're actually focused on right now. I will -- and I think we shared this on previous calls, but the traffic and the pro rates and the connecting and even the local from American is actually better than our system average. And so this is highly valuable traffic, especially with the surge in international. We have hired some international pricing folks as well. So as an RM team, we're getting more and more focus on this. As we shared at the highest level, 8% to 10% of all revenue coming from partners, International is obviously a subset of that, the domestic is obviously a much higher portion. But I do think that there is opportunity on certain markets and connecting markets to focus more on this area.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Interesting. And then second, when I think back to the start of COVID, One of the things that I wasn't initially thinking about or anticipating was the industry brain drain that has taken place. And maybe brain drain isn't the best term. I don't mean that in a derogatory sense, but gyrations in the C-suite, whatever you want to call it. As we think about your bench but also the broader industry, and I apologize I'm just kind of saying it out loud here, but is this a topic that you're team gives much consideration to internally? And if it's a super question, just say so I'm sure my competitors will be thrilled.\nBenito Minicucci : No, Jamie, I would never say that's the dumb question. No, actually, it's a topic we talk about at the Board. As I look around the table here at my executives and my officers, we've had very -- we were fortunate, we've had very little turnover at the executive level at Alaska. But I think what you're talking about is an important topic is, how do you create a bench? How do you create succession? And it's something we're focused on and working on as we speak. So your question is valid. Again, short term, we're fortunate here. We haven't had that brain drain, but it's something to be aware of in the next 3 to 5 years.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Stephen Trent with Citigroup.\nStephen Trent : I was just curious what your thoughts are on U.S. infrastructure. So I know you guys and your competitors have done a lot of good work to make -- to ensure, for example, a smoother summer travel period. What are you seeing on the government side in terms of appropriately staffed TSA traffic control infrastructure investment? It looks like the House of rep and the White House can seem to agree on budget. So I'm wondering how you're seeing all that on a high level.\nBenito Minicucci : Stephen, thanks for your question. So maybe the best way I can contrast it is back to 2019. So when I look at the capacity of the airline industry vis-a-vis today, it's roughly the same. So we have roughly the same amount of capacity than we did in 2019. I think the pinch point is air traffic controllers. As you see some of the actions that need to be taken in New York, I think in Florida, I think we've seen some in California and our L.A. market. So I think staffing on the federal side is the key pinch point. And again, we're talking with our government counterparties and making sure that they hire and train appropriately. Infrastructure is another one. I think that airlines and government have to work on together to make sure the airspace is efficient. There's a lot of things that we can do in terms of technology to facilitate that. And I think that going forward, like I say, we're back to 2019 levels where we were already constrained. But going forward, I think we really need a solid plan to really facilitate this next generation of aerospace management.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Andrew, your this objective about sort of reducing the seasonality of the company in the March quarter or at least finding a way to get to profitability. It seems like no management team at Alaska has really ever been able to crack the code in that regard. I think there's been like maybe a year here or there where we've seen profitability, but it was usually sort of peak. I guess absent, I don't know, building a hub in [indiscernible], is it network? Is it just scaling back frequency in some of these corporate markets and maybe running airplanes -- more airplanes through maintenance, maybe your utilization goes down, but that's better? Or is it more on the cost side, just moving to a single fleet type and you get a nice tailwind there. I mean I'm just trying to figure out what you're thinking about. It's interesting.\nBenito Minicucci : Mike, it's Ben. It's a great question. So if you look at for us, March was very profitable. We almost hit a double-digit pretax margin. It was January and February that were the issues. So for us, like I got to be honest, I just set the mandate for my team and say, look, leaders change outcomes. We don't like the outcome in January and February, and we don't know the exact answer, Mike, to be honest. But the mandate has been given to the commercial team to say, look, there are things that we know if we dissect the data, airplanes can be moved. We can do things with our network, manage capacity. But you have to do that not only right before the quarter, you got to start thinking about it 9 months before, which is why we're setting the goal now. So Andrew needs to think about what he does in the second and third quarter as he builds capacity so you can manage the first quarter of next year. And so a lot of work to do, Mike. And hopefully, we can show that at least we've closed the gap to next year as we work on this thing. And to your point, it's not been consistently done, but at Alaska. We just like taking big audacious challenges. Let's change the narrative.\nMike Linenberg: I know, very good. Now just one more. On just watching American sort of shift on their distribution and I'm sure you've been following the reports closely where it does look like that they're now focusing on their larger corporate accounts. And given that you guys have gotten closer and as part of the partnership, you, obviously, want to grow and build on that and then obviously bring in more corporate travel. Does that have an impact on you? And I guess, specifically, I'm saying where American has said that they're going to sort of back away at some of the smaller accounts, corporate accounts that maybe do less than $1.5 million or $2 million of sales. And I know that may be an area that you play in. I mean, obviously, you have big corporates that you do business with, but when I think about Alaska historically, I mean given your network in size prior to oneworld prior to the American partnership, you probably had a disproportionate amount of your corporates were probably maybe small, medium enterprises. So I'm just curious if there's any sort of impact there, you're probably watching that closely. Any comments that you can make about that shift on American on the distribution and sales side.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think obviously, it's well documented, some of the significant changes that American are doing specifically around NDC and the impact with GDS and all the rest of it. I think for us, we obviously have good and a lot of joint contracting with American and our larger corporates, and they've been working extremely well. One of Brett Catlin's priority on objectives is I think we under-index where we should in the small and medium enterprise. So I think it's not something we've focused on as much as we should. So again, if anything, given our West Coast footprint, we're going to be focusing a lot more on that. As it relates to NDC, we are well into our journey as well and more to come on that will be sort of fully up and running next year with OTAs and all that connected. And I think there's a good cost story there and there's a good product story there and more to come.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group : I want to just go back to the chart on the monthly RASM. So I think you said 63% of revenue is booked for the quarter. How much of June is booked at this point because there's obviously a big further step-up assumed in June? And how do I think about that further acceleration in June relative to some of your comments about RASM following fuel prices?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. So I think June, I'm going to just -- even on our load factor, I think we still got a good 45-plus points to go. So to your point, Scott, it is the lowest book of this month, but I'll also say it is one of the strongest and highest demand as we go into summer there. So I think that's what the team is squarely focused on right now. And to my earlier comments, we need to get right, the mix between bookings further out and what we're going to allow to come closer in.\nScott Group : Okay. And then, Shane, I just want to clarify is, you're still assuming 8% to 10% revenue growth for the year. And then the fuel hedges -- I know I've asked this before, but I'll ask it, doesn't feel like they're helping. Any thoughts about either changing how we hedge or just getting rid of hedges?\nNathaniel Pieper : Scott, it's Nat. Consistent with the Alaska, you know, we are -- we play it for the long run. And hedging costs in the quarter was about $12 million. Long term, it was $170 million to the good last year. So we didn't get a lot of questions last year about changing the hedge program as you might expect. Since we've had this program specifically in place since 2015, buying calls 20% out of the money, 18 months in advance. The program has been positive for us. It's all about [indiscernible] volatility and really trying to just put a box around it. So one quarter doesn't cause this necessarily to change a multiyear process. But I think we're going to be intelligent about it and look at it over the long run. And if there are smart changes to be made, we'll make them.\nScott Group : And then the 8% to 10% revenue, is that still the right number?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Sorry, Scott, I didn't mean to not answer that question. Yes, that is still the right number for us for sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Helane Becker with TD Cowen.\nHelane Becker : I have two questions. My first question is in February this year, I think you lost a lawsuit. And in the Virgin America case, number one or a, have you taken accruals for that? And b, will you appeal that decision? Or is it not appealable?\nKyle Levine: Helane, it's Kyle. This litigation is a long road. We've been fighting this for about 7 years. It's the Virgin Group Royalty license matter pending in London. And the very first stage of that was a ruling by the judge in London, adopting Virgin Group's interpretation of our contract. There are additional proceedings coming, so continue to watch, and we'll keep you posted. On the accrual side, we have accrued $10 million at this point, and you'll see additional disclosures in our 10-Q in a couple of weeks.\nHelane Becker : Okay. That's very helpful. And then my follow-up question or another question, you guys announced recently, I think, within the last week or so that you're eliminating kiosks at the airport. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that? I know most people come to the airport with their boarding pass in hand, but how are you thinking about the acceptance rate of that among your clients?\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks for bringing that up, Helane. Actually, this is very exciting. And the reality is our lobbies are hugely congested. And we've actually started rolling these out. We've had about 7 or 8 stations done, including Portland. And what we're finding is at least a 10-point increase in people coming prepared to the lobby, checked in already, even paid for their bag. And so what it's going to do is there's a little bit of change in management, of course, but we've seen hugely positive results both from our guests and our agents. And I think what you're going to see in the future is people only needing to check bags that are going to be milling around in the lobby. Only half of all passengers check bags. The rest need to go straight to security. We've had about 1/4 of those being the lobby, using kiosks, do all sorts of things. And now we're fully mobile and we can do that outside. So I think you're going to see good productivity, efficiency and a much more pleasant lobby experience as we roll this out over '23 and '24.\nBenito Minicucci : It's Ben. Like our long-term vision is to have people come in just get their bag tag or have an electronic back tag, which we've already introduced, go to a self-backdrop, drop your bag and get to security within under 5 minutes is the goal. So really, make it a wonderful, easy customer experience. So these are the things that we're rolling out in the next 12 to 18 months. It's really exciting for us on the innovation front.\nHelane Becker : That's really helpful, Ben. Are you able to lower facility costs then?\nBenito Minicucci : Well, I think what we would do as we're growing, as my CFO here is on my right side, he would say, keep the same footprint but process more people. And I think that's the goal, right, is to increase the productivity of the real estate footprint we have, which is what we're all about.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris with Susquehanna International.\nChris Nicholas : Ben, could you comment the procedures in place to navigate, let's say, less than ideal operating conditions versus periods of strong demand, meaning how confident are you in Alaska's ability -- operational resiliency and ability to keep your completion factors north of, let's say, 95% when conditions are tough?\nBenito Minicucci : Chris, great question. I would say right now, as we head to the summer, I'm extremely confident. I think two things that have to be in place: One, you have to be staffed properly, and our staffing numbers are quite strong across every labor group. The second thing is, as we're getting our footing as we go back and you know our history, we've always had great performances. We have an operational playbook that we execute, and this is something that we focused on is we have a timeline. We know exactly what to do and when, and that is starting to click in from what I see across all areas and all of our hubs. So I'm quite confident in our operations team, and I think we're going to have a great summer.\nChris Nicholas : Okay. And then my follow-up on the stage engage focus this year, as we think about the cadence of second half CASMex, should we expect this benefit to flow through evenly through the second half? Or is this something that would be more fully realized as we exit 4Q? And I realize there's also implicitly some type of macro assumption around stage and certainly as it relates to gauge and any order book risk that you've contemplated there?\nShane Tackett: Chris, yes, the CASMex cadence, I think we tried to -- we issued some slides that may help if you take a look at them. Certainly, the Q4 exit rate is the best rate of the year, but it's actually pretty ratable as you get through Q2 to Q3 than Q4. It's not like all of the benefit comes in Q4. So we'll have a chance to see how we're doing against that in the next 1.5 quarters or so. But yes, I think given that we're lapping the labor deals primarily in the fourth quarter, that's where you get the biggest sort of CASM-ex tailwind benefit. And thank you everyone, for joining us. We'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending."}, {"symbol": "ALK", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2023-01-26 15:24:01", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alaska Air Group 2022 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on mute to prevent background noise. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. After our speakers' remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session for analysts. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Vice President of Finance, Emily Halverson.\nEmily Halverson: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, which is available at investor.alaskaair.com. On today's call, you'll hear updates from Ben, Andrew and Shane. Several others of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. This morning, Air Group reported fourth quarter GAAP net income of $22 million. Excluding special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $118 million. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements about future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found within our SEC filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release. Over to you, Ben.\nBenito Minicucci: Thanks, Emily, and good morning, everyone. Despite another volatile year, we closed out 2022 with solid results. With our continued focus and the incredible dedication of our employees, we are well positioned to build on this success as we move into 2023 and beyond. This year, we generated full year revenue 10% above 2019 levels, doing so on 9% less capacity. Our 7.6% full year adjusted pretax margin led the industry, proving that our business model is resilient. Air Group's pretax margins have now ranked number one in the industry for 11 of the last 13 years. Additionally, our employees earned the largest performance bonus payout in our company's history on average, adding 10.5% on top of our employee salaries or nearly six weeks' worth of pay. Our people did a fantastic job delivering care. I want to thank all of them for the work they do to ensure Air Group outperforms even during turbulent times. Earlier this year, we identified three key priorities to strengthen our competitive advantage and prepare for future growth. Our teams delivered on each of these priorities, including: one, completing our labor deals. We signed five labor contracts in 2022, all of which include significant improvements for our people and creates stability and clarity for our company and employees. With these in place, we are well positioned to fully focus on our future; two, fortifying our operational reliability. Despite challenges throughout the year, we finished 2022 with one of the industry's best completion and on-time performance rates. Operational Integrity is the foundation of a healthy airline, and we remain focused on balancing our growth aspirations with consistent delivery of the operational excellence Alaska is known for; and three, executing our single fleet transitions at both Alaska and Horizon. On January 8th, we flew our last A320 revenue service flight, and today marks the final Q400 flight leaving only 10 A321s in the fleet through year-end. We have retired over 60 aircraft in the last few months, paving the way to more cost-efficient and productive operations in both our regional and mainline business. As we take off 2023, we're taking with us many lessons learned. We closed out a solid year, and we are committed to make 2023 even better. Our leadership team has a clear set of strategic initiatives that will support our growth aspirations, expand margins and improve operational excellence. For the full year, we expect to achieve adjusted pretax margins of between 9% and 12%. This morning, we introduced an earnings guide of $5.50 per share to $7.50 per share, which implies restoration to 2019 EPS levels at the midpoint. Delivering on these targets will be challenging and will require us to leverage our competitive strengths. Undoubtedly, there have been structural shifts within the industry, but history has proven time and again that cost discipline and a strong balance sheet are required to win in the airline business. This is the heart of Air Group's DNA, and we continue to believe low cost and high productivity matter and that pursuing both benefits all stakeholders. Productivity is not where it used to be in this post-pandemic era, and it can be debated what is structural and what is temporary, but our leadership team is dedicated to driving down unit cost in 2023 as we restore flying and begin to close the productivity gap. This strategy is largely enabled by our single fleet transition and the upgauge benefits that come with our new MAX fleet. Two critical factors to successful capacity growth in 2023 will continue to be staffing and aircraft availability. We had success in hiring nearly 8,000 people in 2022, and are confident in our plans to hire 3,500 more in 2023. And as it relates to aircraft, we remain in close communication with Boeing and have a high degree of confidence in our fleet planning assumptions as well. Having factored in the appropriate buffer in both these areas, we are confident in our 2023 plans to grow 8% to 10% versus prior year, so long as demand and the economic environment continue to support it. Lastly, the revenue road map we outlined at our March Investor Day will provide valuable contributions in 2023 and continue to build to our $400 million target. Through focus on cost discipline and growing revenue opportunities, we have a tangible path to expand margins, and our team is excited to deliver on these in 2023. To wrap up, our goal throughout the pandemic has been to emerge a stronger, more competitive airline and the steps we've taken to date ensure we're on that path. We have the people, the resources, the knowledge, and the discipline to drive performance. I am proud of the results we achieved in 2022, but even more so, I'm looking forward to the opportunities ahead of us as we deliver on our financial and strategic initiatives in 2023 and beyond. And with that I'll turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter and full year results, along with first quarter guidance. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $2.5 billion. That's up 11.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2019, notwithstanding our capacity was down nearly 10%. These strong results included the impact of severe winter conditions that we experienced over the peak holiday travel period in December. The storm reduced revenue by approximately $45 million. Notwithstanding this, we achieved unit revenue increases of 23% for the quarter with robust loads, which exceeded 2019 levels and came in at 85.5%. More impressively, as Ben mentioned, our full year revenues came in at $9.6 billion, and that's up 10% versus 2019 on 9% less capacity. This resulted in industry-leading full year unit revenues, which were up 21% versus 2019, capping off a strong year of outperformance and demonstrating the leverage of our commercial initiatives, power of our network and a constructive pricing environment. Turning to product and loyalty. As has been the case all year, we continued to benefit from strong demand in our premium products. First class was up 19% and premium class up 14% versus the fourth quarter of 2019, with paid load factors up six points and two points, respectively. As we reflect on the full year of 2022, we were able to drive an increase in premium revenues of nearly $0.5 billion or 20% above 2019. Our loyalty program has also been significant revenue driver given our renewed credit card deal with Bank of America. Cash remuneration from the bank was up 42% versus the fourth quarter of '19 and 39% for the full year. As a reminder, product and loyalty represented roughly half of our $400 million commercial initiatives and we expect to achieve product and loyalty's full run rate in 2023. Regarding network and alliances, we are encouraged by the results we've seen through our partnerships in oneworld. Through increased opportunities that we simply did not have before the pandemic, including joint contracting with American and working with MX GBT. We have meaningfully improved our corporate share gap and continue to experience higher traffic volumes facilitated by our alliance partnerships. And we are stepping up our airline partners selling capability in 2023, which will help us offering full partner inventory for 10 global carriers on alaskaair.com by year-end. These partners include American Airlines, IAG, Japan Airlines, Qatar and Qantas, an expanded global network that we can sell and market as our own is compelling for our guests, and we expect our airline partner revenue to reach 8% to 10% of total Air Group revenues by 2025. Turning to corporate travel. We experienced a softening in bookings during the fourth quarter from those in the late summer peaks, exiting 2022 at approximately 75% recovered on a volume basis and 85% recovered on a revenue basis. West Coast business remains less recovered, which is not surprising given the significant workforce reductions happening across large technology companies located up and down the coast, where we primarily operate. Despite the choppiness we've seen in this segment, business travel has trended in a positive direction in the last few weeks. While we don't expect continued recovery to be linear, over time, we do still expect to fully restore our business revenue based on our improved opportunity set. Looking ahead to guidance for the first quarter. We expect total revenue to be up 29% to 32% year-over-year on capacity that is up 11% to 14% as we lap weak comps when Omicron reached its peak in the first quarter of '22. Q1 is always our weakest quarter of the year, but leisure travel remains healthy and yields are holding steady. For the full year, we expect revenue to be up 8% to 10% on flat unit revenue. Our 8% to 10% growth in 2023 will continue to focus on deepening the connections of our network while growing the Pacific Northwest and restoring California. Approximately two-thirds of our growth will be focused in the Pacific Northwest and one-third in California and will not be overly dilutive to our yields as much of it will be added to our strongest markets where demand exceeded supply in 2022. Importantly, 85% of growth comes from increased gauge and stage. This is the most efficient capacity growth of any year that I can recall at Alaska Airlines. In closing, my team and I are squarely focused on 2022 as our baseline year, which represented industry-leading unit revenue and profitability. And from that base, we look forward to building an even stronger result for 2023. The economics of our renewed credit card will continue to build this year. Our alliances and partnerships are set to gain further momentum as we improve our corporate share and international travel continues to unlock. Our premium seat mix and upgauging opportunities will also grow as we take 37 MAX deliveries where 22% of seats are premium. This combination drives further unit revenue momentum that we believe will be a differentiator for us going forward. I'm excited for what our commercial team is set to deliver in 2023. And with that I'll pass it over to Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As you heard from Ben, our full year 7.6% adjusted pretax margin led the industry and is a great result for us given how the year started and the challenges we experienced rescaling our company in the face of incredible demand for travel. We are especially proud that all of our people will receive significant performance-based bonuses in February given their achievements this year. We are looking forward to further building towards our long-term financial goals in 2023 by remaining focused on running a reliable operation, driving unit cost and productivity improvements and delivering on our commercial road map. Turning to Q4 results and an update on our balance sheet. We ended the year with debt to cap of 49%, within our target range of 40% to 50% and still among the strongest in the industry. Debt payments during the fourth quarter were approximately $50 million. For full year 2023, debt repayments are modest, totaling approximately $280 million with $100 million in the first quarter. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.4 billion for full year 2022 and total liquidity inclusive of on-hand cash and undrawn lines of credit ended the year at $2.8 billion, a great result, given that we continue to pay cash for our CapEx in 2022, which was one of the highest CapEx years in our history. In addition to top of industry margins and our balance sheet strength, our trailing 12-month return on invested capital reached 9% in 2022, above our cost of capital and approaching our long-term target range. Our balance sheet strength, our cash position and our margin and return on capital results allowed us to take two other important steps towards the end of 2022. First, we announced in December our plan to restart share repurchases in the first quarter of 2023, initially focused on offsetting dilution. And second, we secured an expanded order book with Boeing now having firm and option aircraft positions through the rest of this decade, given overall aircraft and engine demand and ongoing supply chain challenges, having access to positions for the next seven plus years will, we believe, prove to be beneficial strategically as it provides us maximum fleet flexibility on great terms.  Turning to costs. In Q4, CASMex increased 24% versus 2019, approximately one point above our guide driven entirely by lost capacity and incremental costs as a result of the severe winter weather in November and December. Absent this impact, our Q4 CASMex would have slightly beat our guide. Our full year CASMex in capacity ended the year within our guided ranges at up 20% and down 9%, respectively, versus 2019. And as a reminder, we do continue to include the cost of our performance-based bonus and incentive pay programs in our unit costs. For the full year, this represented approximately two points of unit cost pressure versus 2019 and was materially more impactful on our unit costs than other airlines. Our beliefs about what will drive long-term success and value in the airline industry remain largely intact and consistent with what we believed pre-pandemic. We firmly believe a strong balance sheet and low relative costs will be the ultimate drivers of business stability and success. We remain focused on and confident in both of these areas. Our balance sheet is strong and based on 2023 guides, Alaska is positioned to achieve the best unit cost result within the industry this year, helping us maintain or improve our pre-pandemic relative cost position. Looking ahead to 2023, our current schedule has us returning to pre-pandemic levels of capacity during the first half of the year. Maintaining operational safety and reliability remains our top priority, and we will have continued modest cost headwinds as we complete the transition training related to our fleet transitions. However, we are planning for solid improvements to our overall fleet utilization and levels of productivity during 2023, and are focused on reducing unit costs on a year-over-year basis. For the first quarter, we expect capacity to be up 11% to 14% with CASMex down zero to 2% year-over-year. And for the full year, we continue to expect capacity to be up 8% to 10% with CASMex down 1% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. Touching on fuel. Oil prices have moderated from 2022 levels but remain elevated. Refining spreads also remain volatile. We currently expect fuel price per gallon to be $3.15 to $3.35 for the first quarter and $3.10 to $3.30 for the full year. Our significant 2022 benefit from hedging, which was approximately $170 million will likely turn to a net cost in 2023. As a reminder, our hedging program uses 20% out of the money call options only, and our strike prices are above what we anticipate oil prices will be during the year. Taken all together, as Ben mentioned, we expect margins to improve this year with our full year adjusted pretax margin guide of 9% to 12%. This incorporates the full structural impact of our ratified labor contracts, contributing approximately three points to our full year CASMex. And while we are optimistic about demand for travel this year, we are also cognizant of the uncertain economic backdrop we are operating in, and we'll adjust capacity accordingly this year if we need to. One of our primary strengths over the years has been to execute our plans. In 2022, we certainly experienced volatility and some setbacks. But overall, we executed on the major components of our recovery plan and have a strong foundation to work from in 2023. We have most of our labor deals completed. We are through the majority of our fleet transition. We were one of the most reliable airlines in the industry. We've got a solid balance sheet and a great aircraft order book. And we are now focused on improving utilization, productivity and delivering on more of our commercial road map as we attempt to lead the industry again in financial performance in 2023. And with that let's go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Andrew Didora with Bank of America Global Research.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Andrew just you got the RASM premium last year even with kind of the West Coast corporate tech travel not showing as much growth as other areas. Based on guys out of other airlines and your guidance this morning, doesn't seem like you're assuming much of a further RASM growth premium here. Just curious, what are you baking into your guide in terms of corporate travel recovery here in 2023? And do you think there's the opportunity for that RASM premium to kind of maintain throughout this year?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Good morning. Thanks, Andrew. So a couple of things. I think firstly, and to your point, we did have the higher benchmark last year. If you look at the industry's guide for this year, I think we're all saying unit revenue is about flat. So we're in line with that. I do think, as I shared in my prepared remarks that we may have more upside in the corporate side than perhaps others on a relative basis. So I do see that there is opportunity there. And of course, as you're well aware, we really peak in the second and certainly, the third quarter. And again, industry capacity is not back to where it was -- in '19. So again, there could be upside here. But right now, we're in a pretty good place.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And then a question for Shane, just in regards to that kind of peaking in 2Q and 3Q. When we think about capacity in CASM for the rest of the year, do you expect these to be fairly consistent across the quarters going forward here? Or is there like any lumpiness that we should build into our models? Thanks.\nShane Tackett: Hey, good morning, Andrew, thanks. From a capacity perspective, it's pretty sequentially modest Q4 to Q1, Q1 to Q2, Q2 to Q3, there is a step-up in the second half of the year, but it's very reasonable, I think. In terms of unit cost, I think flattish for the first half of the year, consistent with our Q1 guide, obviously, and then a little bit of momentum in the back half of the year. It's not exaggerated. It's sort of flattish first half of the year and then single-digit-ish in the second half of the year. So I don't think there's a big swing quarter-to-quarter that you guys need to expect from us this year.\nAndrew Didora: That's helpful. Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. I know your pilot contract has a snap up or a me-too clause. But as I recall, it's a little complex. Can you remind us of the mechanics of that mechanism? When do look backs occur? What's the group of airlines that you comp against? And I can obviously do my own analysis, but if you have Alaska estimate based on Delta becoming the market, I'm all ears, but we can do that work on our end.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, Jamie, I'll give you the very -- I'll give you the complicated formula and then you guys can do the math. It's the simple average of the for larger airlines than us and JetBlue, and we look at it on September 1st. So you can make sort of estimates about what you think the industry would have ratified by that point in time and pretty easily back into what you think the impact might be relative to the scheduled 4% downline raise. So -- we're happy that we have this, by the way, in the contract. We don't want our pilots to fall behind. And we knew going first that we had to have some mechanism to make sure that we kept up with the market if it went to a different place than we were expecting.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Perfect. I appreciate the color. And then on oneworld, you said reaching 10% of group revenue by 2025. That's the goal you gave, right?\nShane Tackett: 8% to 10%. Okay.\nJamie Baker: 8% to 10%, okay. So I've always assumed that connecting revenue or alliance revenue is less profitable than local revenue. Obviously, if the connecting revenue is entirely incremental, it's highly accretive. I know -- and maybe my assumption is flawed. I know you've been really bulled up on your one rolled membership. But on a margin basis, how does that 8% to 10% compared to your core flying.\nAndrew Harrison: Well, I think -- so a couple of things. And again, just what we've seen this year, especially with American Airlines and not just international but domestically, connecting over their hubs and even some local market code share we have. We participated in American strong revenue environment as well where their corporate travelers or leisure travelers or connecting beyond need to utilize our network to help make for a better, shorter trip. So overall, I've been very happy with the yields that are being produced. And again, as we go into this year with international travel and the proration of the strong international fares, again, from what we had last year, I think these are all positive momentum for us.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. Take care everyone.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone. Hope you are doing well. So in December, you guys have some really unusual weather that drove the operational issues you saw not being that preparing for an ice storm on Christmas should be the operational base case, but some of your peers are talking about the need to have permanently higher buffers to protect the operation. Do you believe that you already had the appropriate buffers in place for 8% to 10% capacity guide for 2023 and December didn't really to change anything. Some color there would be great. Thanks.\nShane Tackett: Maybe I'll just speak to '23, and you can speak to the December event. By the way, welcome back, Catie, it's good to hear from you. I think we do have sufficient buffers in our capacity plan and our staffing plan to ensure that we're not overstressing the network. If you look at the second half of the year, once we sorted out our April issues with pilot training, we were amongst the best in the industry on both on time and completion rate. Yes, this was a -- although it's becoming the norm because it happened last year as well. This was a pretty unique event that lasted multiple days and did ice over our aircraft here in Seattle and in Portland and actually in other parts of the Pacific Northwest. So it was a pretty unique event. And I think it's probably not -- we're not going to assume that it happens to us every single year, but we do have to build some more resilient irregular ops for sure.\nBenito Minicucci: Yes, Catie, it's Ben. Having done operations in my whole career, I mean you can look at it a couple of ways. You can create a massive amount of buffer for an event that might not happen or you can go in with the appropriate level of staffing with some additional cushion to deal with winter events. But things like ice storms are massive events that cripple a city, and there's not a lot you can do no matter how much buffer you put in, there's nothing you can do to operate in an ice storm. So what our mindset is create a robust schedule that we can operate in the peak periods or peak periods where there's -- where we're susceptible to weather, create additional buffers but it's got to be managed appropriately. So we were good. This was just a big event, and I'm pretty proud of the team and how we dug out of it and got back on track.\nCatherine O'Brien: Totally understandable. I mean just seeing some of the scenes in Seattle, it definitely seems like a unique event. So maybe just one then. Great to have most of the fleet transition behind you. Can you just help us think about some of the moving pieces on the P&L for this year, underlying your full year CASMex guidance I know you mentioned some elevated training in your prepared remarks, Shane, but anything else we should be thinking about that as go-forward might roll off, that's unique to the fleet transition Alaska.\nShane Tackett: Yes. I don't think there's anything sort of major -- a lot of the expenses related to returning the lease aircraft we took through special last year. So we don't expect a lot of noise this year in the P&L related to the fleet transition. The biggest cost piece is that we're completing the transition training of pilots by and large in the first quarter, slipping a tiny bit into the second quarter. But that's really it in terms of fleet transition-related specific costs in the P&L. I don't think anything else is different than what you've seen across most of the industry. We have airport costs that remain an area of growth in terms of the P&L. I think that's consistent with the entire industry. And then certainly, labor costs have gone up structurally. And as we grow, they're going to continue to go up as we hire more people to fund that growth. But everything else looks pretty normal, I would say, in terms of trend, nothing to really point out.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Catie.\nBenito Minicucci: Thanks, Catie.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Helane Becker with Cowen & Company.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the time. Just one quick clarification on that last point, Shane. The $120 million in the fourth quarter, then is that the end of the transition costs? Is that the way we think about that?\nEmily Halverson: Helane, this is Emily. So the $120 million that you saw in special charges in Q4 should be most of the remainder because we've put all of our estimates in for returning all the A320s. We've done all the accelerated depreciation and other charges that we're going to take on both the Q4 and the A320s. Those aircraft actually leave our property over the next 12 to 18 months. So there could be some minor true-ups that come through there. the last remaining thing that you're going to see coming through special charges in 2023 is going to be whatever we end up doing with the A321s, which are still on our books. So there will be some dollars there, but there should not be much more for A320.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for clarifying that. And then just on the mileage plan. I think there was an announcement that there are new benefits that are accruing to your members beginning like I want to say around now. Maybe, Andrew, can you talk about that and how that should benefit your revenue line?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Thanks, Helane. So two things. Certainly, for our loyalty guest members, there is some really cool incremental benefits as it relates to bonus miles for subscriptions, boarding priorities. And even if you hold Bank of America accounts, you'll get bonuses there. So there's a lot of good things there. I think specifically for Air Group, a couple of things for new cardholders, there's going to be some minimum spend thresholds, which we've never had before. So I think that will add to some of the quality. And then the other thing we did have a fee increase this year, which we haven't done forever, and we're still one of, if not the lowest card membership fee. But again, that's -- that went from $75 to $95.  So we will participate in that goodness.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's very helpful. Just on that minimum spend, just to clarify, that -- so you're talking about it. I understand what you're saying about it being a better quality customer, but do you think that you get fewer applications because you're putting that in? Do people get turned off by that?\nAndrew Harrison: No. I think again, this is just on the forward book, Helane, not the back book. But again, obviously, this is something that we'll watch. But at the end of the day, knowing what our average card spend is and all the rest of it, our guests get a lot of value from our card and the spend on the card is very, very healthy. So we think this is well within the industry. In fact, it's probably low versus the industry, but we don't have any concerns about it.\nBenito Minicucci: And Andrew since we've launched it, you've seen a lot of credit card sign-ups, right?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, exactly, and a lot of positive comments.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Team.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Helane.\nBenito Minicucci: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: In terms of the pacing benefits, the pacing of benefits of moving to a single fleet, what are we seeing in the first quarter here, if any, and can you just remind us what are the hurdles you need to clear to realize further benefits?\nShane Tackett: Hey, good morning, Duane. Really, it's just getting through the pilot training and getting the Dash 9s that replace the A320s here on property. We are at low 40s of Dash 9s relative to the 60-ish A319s and A320s we had. So the planes are coming. We've got a bunch more coming this year. We'll have full restoration of the fleet size as we get through the year. We'll be through all of the transition training on Horizon here in the first half of the year, mostly in the first quarter. Similar on mainline, although we'll have these 10 A321s, I think we can pretty easily get those into one hub, one base and manage that. So I think the way the unlock is basically going to start in the second quarter and ramp through the rest of the year, and we should be at close to full run rate as we get through the fourth quarter, dependent upon what we do with the A321 transition because we still have 150 pilots, you've got to transition off of that equipment ultimately.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Great answer. Thank you. And then Ben, you were a -- or at least our recollection, you were a process guy historically. Historically, Alaska was very good at identifying variability, measuring variability and driving it out of your processes. Certainly, this is a different and more difficult operating environment. But do you think you still have those opportunities to drive out variability? What are the one, two, three kind of productivity initiatives you can go attack this year? Or is that just outdated thinking from a bygone era? Thanks for taking the questions.\nBenito Minicucci: Duane, thanks for the question. It's a great question. And we talk about that a lot. Like what I'm going to tell you is that type of thinking is in our DNA. It's been in our DNA for -- I've been here for 20 years. I mean that's how we think, and that's how we wired. In terms of has it structurally changed, and that's -- it could be debated. But my view is that the airline industry isn't even back to 2019 levels of capacity. So if you talk about aerospace itself, now of course, you've got to have ATC staffing in place. We're not flying the same amount we're flying in 2019. So if you look at block times, if you look at departures, we're still less than we were in 2019. So the aerospace is essentially the same. It's got to work from an FAA perspective. And how we look at it internally is we can still have improvements in asset utilization and people productivity. And we have already the processes and the mechanism in place to get to a better place. So is it -- has it changed a little bit? Yes. Are we going to bring it back to the left? Absolutely.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you very much.\nBenito Minicucci: Thanks, Duane.\nOperator: And we will move next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good morning, everyone. Shane, congrats on getting the ROIC, I guess, congrats to you and the whole team of getting your return on invested capital trailing 12 months on better than your cost. You're one of the few out there who can actually have achieved that objective. You did highlight the return of share repurchase program. Again, this is to offset just the dilution. And then the amping up the part of the deliveries of some MAXs. Where is your thinking on bringing back the dividend? Is that something that we see in 2023? Is that later this year? Is that a next year phenomenon? Thanks.\nShane Tackett: Mike, thanks for picking up the ROIC comment in the script. That's nice that you did. We are -- that question on dividend is the 2023 conversation item with the Board. We decided last year to prioritize offsetting dilution first. As you know, I mean, I think a dividend is something that you do when you have a lot of confidence in the outlook for a multi-year period. We're really optimistic, but we want to see how this year shapes up, especially with the economic backdrop. So we're actively discussing it with the Board, still in our long-term sort of thought process in terms of capital allocation and shareholder returns, but nothing to say right now on it.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Great. Fair enough. And then just second, my question on loyalty to Andrew. To see the $1.5 billion of remuneration. And I think just a few years back, it was $1 billion, $1.1 billion. I think you had mentioned something like 39% going back to 2019. And maybe we're looking at a 10% or 12% type CAGR here. Is that the right rate going forward? I mean -- or do we see -- maybe you talked about a step-up in fee, but do we see a step up in maybe rate? Are there any sort of milestones that we hit over the next year or two where that could say, jump to 2? How should we think about the growth of that program?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, I think -- well, a couple of things. And again, you've seen a significant step change from the new contract. And that as you heard this morning, there will be more goodness there. And there is also changes over time. But I think what we're really excited about now is we've got this behind us -- is growing the program, growing the portfolio, growing the spend top of wallet, and that's what my team is squarely focused on now. And so I do personally see continued momentum, and it's going to be a very big focus for us as we continue to move forward.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Very good. Thanks, everyone.\nBenito Minicucci: Thanks, Mike. I did want to mention as well. That was a great answer, Andrew, because it is Andrew's birthday today, which I forgot to mention at the start. And I just want to ask the analysts not to be too hard on Andrew during the -- I'm kidding. You can be as hard on the him as you like. Happy Birthday Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: Thank you, Ben.\nOperator: And our next question today will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James Financial.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. And I guess as a follow-up on Andrew Didora's question and it's probably a question to Andrew, so I apologize if this is mean. But I was kind of curious if you could give a little bit more color on the kind of the business recovery in terms of -- you mentioned may be getting eventually kind of getting back to 2019 levels, but because you have some of these other initiatives that should help you get there. Do you get there this year? And particularly, I guess what I'm focused on is you have a lot of headlines about kind of job cuts and kind of the West Coast-based tech companies and -- is that having any incremental impact on the tech business demand? Or is that -- is it just more -- you're not seeing the recovery yet?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Savi, thanks for that. And I think it's a great question because the first thing I will say is that even though the headlines are recent on these job cuts, we've been experiencing especially some really large tech companies, their corporate travel has already been severely depressed for some time now. So the corporate numbers that you see from us already include a lot of high-tech companies with that already, in some cases, nearly turned off their travel, but have severely depressed. So as we move forward, I don't think these cuts personally impact the technology side because I think we've already seen them. And the question is, will they come back? I'm more bullish and confident certainly on the non-tech side of corporate travel and continue to share there. I will say the jury is a little bit out on where tech does go. But I think overall, portfolio-wise, business is somewhat stable that the 85%, 75%, 85% range. But again, I hope with our share movement and continued strength over time that we do get back there.\nShane Tackett: And Savi, I might just add, the one thing not to lose sight of is these tech companies while they haven't been traveling for quite a while, these are like the most valuable companies on earth. And at some point, they are going to expand again and they're going to get traveling again. So it's probably future goodness for us. We just don't know when it's going to really come back. It could be a year away or more.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. And I just thought of the -- getting back to the utilization and productivity -- trying to understand, again, Ben you've talked about the aerospace is what it is, and we're still below and yet you're seeing everybody struggling with and then questioning if we get back to kind of the previous productivity, what's kind of controllable on Alaska side and the timing around that versus what -- what's kind of out of your control?\nBenito Minicucci: No, Savi. Just let me start with a couple of things. I think for us, well, coming back from a pandemic and getting the inertia up for the operation, I think that's where not just Alaska, but the entire industry struggled getting back up to a certain level of capacity. So there was some -- there was a lot of issues there. Like as I look forward now into 2023, when I look at the benefits of single fleet and having the majority of your fleet Boeing and the majority of your fleet Embraer 175, that just drives massive efficiency in terms of crews, in terms of swapping airplanes and getting reserve crews. So just there alone for us is a major improvement. Secondly, again, getting through a little bit of the volatility with staffing and training, that goes away. So that volatility goes out. So our folks is pure in every part of the operation where we see volatility in staffing, where we see volatility and performance is to go and zero in on those issues and snuff them out. And I mean that's what good airlines do and operational reliability is just critical in doing that right. Now there will be things that will never go back to the way they were in 2019, but I think a lot of this is in our control. And we just don't give up on those type of things. It's savings that you can go after, and we're going to go after them.\nSavi Syth: Just to clarify, but just on the staffing side, staffing and training. The training is related to the fleet transition, right? Are you fairly caught up in just being able to source the pilots for the capacity.\nBenito Minicucci: Right. Yes. We're going through a lot of the A320 Airbus pilot transition right now. So we'll be through it by the end of the first quarter. And so that's going through all our school house right now. Same thing with the Q400s and the Embraer 175. So we'll be largely done that big by wave.\nSavi Syth: Thank you.\nBenito Minicucci: Thanks, Savi.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. I just want to go back to the revenue guide. So it looks like RASM decelerating from when I look versus '19, decelerating from fourth quarter to first quarter and then reaccelerating the rest of the year. Just help us understand that. Is that a market view? Is that something specific to you guys? Just any color there?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, good morning, Scott. So a couple of things, and we've talked about this before, obviously, but our first quarter is always the weakest. And a little bit business travels certainly in January has been highly choppy and did not return as much as we had hoped. But I think if you take a step back and look at our revenue in general, and you even go back to 2019, our unit revenue guide for the first quarter are right in line with the industry's unit guides. And they also have very big international travel coming back, which I think will be a big tailwind for them. And again, for the year, we're about right where our industry is -- but again, for us, we've got work to do again on January and February on the network side. We do need to make sure that we construct our network to handle these lulls in our demand. But again, March and forward is very solid.\nScott Group: Okay. And then, Shane, I think you said that there's a fuel hedging loss embedded in the guide for this year. Just -- how much is that -- maybe just bigger picture, like the issue has been crack spreads not so much crude. Like any thoughts on revisiting how you guys hedge? I know it's more complicated, but it seems like it would be a much more effective way to hedge if you want to hedge it all.\nNathaniel Pieper: Hey, Scott, it's Nat Pieper. Thanks for the question on fuel. I think first on just our hedging program. We started this 20% out of the money calls, very straightforward, formulaic back in 2015, broke even basically 2015 to 2021. And then as you cited, and as we said in the script, 2022 it turned out to be a profitable thing. But as you know, we're not hedging to make money. We're hedging just to eliminate volatility -- we think it's a good way to use our strong balance sheet and it just gives us some better insights in our planning as we move forward. We have spent a considerable amount of time with investment banking friends back on the East Coast about ways to potentially to hedge the crack spread, you're right, and that that's been the main source of frustration, volatility, et cetera. And something we're looking at. But I'd underscore, we're only going to do it if -- again, it's consistent with our core values as a company, use our strong financial foundation and just keep it on autopilot.\nScott Group: And what is the hedge loss, though you've got factored in?\nNathaniel Pieper: We're looking at about $10 million in the first quarter. And then as you can imagine, it snaps to something different every day, the forward curve moves.\nScott Group: Okay. All right. Thank you guys.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global.\nDaniel McKenzie: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks. Andrew of course we want to help you celebrate your birthday with a couple of questions here. Happy Birthday.\nAndrew Harrison: Thank you.\nDaniel McKenzie: So I guess the question is the State of California was pretty slow to come out of the pandemic, and I guess my question is, what percent of the revenue growth this year is just simply getting markets back to 2019 levels of revenue? And then related to this, what percent of Alaska's revenue touches the State of California?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. So just on the big picture, Dan, our growth, two-thirds of it is going to be Pacific Northwest and one-third of it is going to be California. Just as it relates to recovery, if you look at our growth in 2023, the Pacific Northwest is now in the double-digit territory higher than 2019. But California was still down 23% last year, and it will be close, it will be 10 points better than that. So our California network will still be down about 10 to 12 points this year versus '19, but recovering. And I would say, again, very high level, one-third 1/3 of our revenues is somewhat tied to California.\nDaniel McKenzie: Wow, that's big. On the prior comment that Alaska has more upside on corporate revenue versus peers. So I guess on premium revenue, I believe the stat was to have 62% more premium seats this year versus 2019. And I guess I'm wondering if that stat is still correct or if that's right. And I'm not sure if you can share what the mix is today or -- but what it is today versus where you might expect to exit the year, but if you can, that's helpful. And then related to this, just the corporate travel budgets, are they coming in a little higher than last year, a lot higher or lower just given the tech exposure.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. So I think a couple of things. And you maybe saw in my prepared remarks that we were able to increase our premium revenues by nearly $0.5 billion. And as Shane has shared, we're sort of trading out 12 first-class seat 320s for 16 first-class seat MAXs. So there's real upside there. I think overall, I think first class revenues were up about 21%. And -- so there is a significant opportunity there. The other opportunity we're working on then is our regional fleet, and we actually we're all 175 now, which have first and premium, and we're really happy with the progress we've made on filling those seats at good fares, and we continue to work that. And then on the last question you had was on corporate. Could you repeat that one again, sorry?\nDaniel McKenzie: Yes, the corporate budget is a little higher, a little lower or given the tech exposure.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think -- some of the budgets when I last spoke to my team was still being finalized for this year. I think budgets or no budgets, I think what we're really seeing a little bit here, Dan, in some cases, is the on-off switch. You've got to go to your Vice President to ask for travel, and so people are not going. So we either see very deep cuts in travel or more to the average means. So I think the real question is, will high-tech start to give permission for their people to start traveling again. And as you know, it's not just it's hotels, it's cars, it's air fares. So anyway, that's where we're at.\nDaniel McKenzie: Thanks for the time guys.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the time. Happy Birthday, Andrew. Just on the capacity outlook, this would be an easy one. Just can you provide some context on what's new versus core utilization stage gauge. It just feels like a lot of the growth is going to be utilization and gauge base this year within your core markets, but if you could just clarify that, that would be great.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, I mean, you're exactly right. At the end of the day, very, very few new cities. This is essentially all core restoration and 85% of all of our growth is stage engaged. So it's a very efficient growth.\nConor Cunningham: Is that mostly on the Pacific Northwest in California? I mean, I feel like you mentioned that during the prior.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Yes, that's correct.\nConor Cunningham: All right. And then I hate to ask a cost question because I know you got a bunch, but it seems like there's some confusion. Just prior to the 1Q CASMex guide, I would have thought first half versus second half would just look a lot different than it kind of seems like it's shaping up to be. And when I think about high level, second half benefiting from just easier comps, fleet transition, improved productivity, all that stuff, maybe -- maybe the offset is more on like profit share accruals and then another increase in pilot. I'm just struggling with the idea, like are you being ultraconservative? Or is it just -- there's just a lot of uncertainty right now on the second half cost side?\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Conor. I think if you're implying that you might have thought it would be down more in the second half. I'm not sure if that's what your sort of question was.\nConor Cunningham: Yes, yes, yes.\nShane Tackett: There is not -- Okay. Got you. Yes. There's not a lot of noise, as I think Catie had asked earlier, sequentially throughout the quarter. I will say like with respect to our profit sharing accruals, we had a very significant results in Q4 2022 because of our first place performance on the margin side. And while we are still anticipating to lead the industry next year, I think you'll see those accruals come in differently this year. And it's significant enough to create a little bit of noise. But no, I think, look, we need to get through the first quarter, all the transition training, make sure the planes come and we've got to make some decisions about the A321. And I think what we've shared is something we're highly confident we can get to. We tend to target internally to do a little bit better, and that's what we're going to drive towards. But there's a lot of year ahead of us, a lot of execution to do. And I think the last couple of years, we've been ambitious in our plans and had a lot of setbacks. We don't anticipate those this year, but -- but I think some of that's informing some conservatism in our capacity and other guides.\nConor Cunningham: Sorry, just one clarification. I mean you did have like the lease return expense in the first quarter of last year is maybe that I'm sorry, I'll take it offline. I'll ask.\nShane Tackett: Yes, yes, we're happy to -- I mean we're not going to obviously get into like a lot of the specific details, but we're happy to give you more color for sure, on the progression.\nConor Cunningham: All right. Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: So another follow-up on corporate, I'm afraid, I think you said that you were -- the tech customers of yours are giant corporations and they're eventually going to come back, which I guess it's true, but then we can't be 100% sure of that kind of given the way to do business. So are you happy to wait for them to kind of come back on the corporate side? Or are you looking to maybe expand your corporate customer footprint? Maybe chase some more SMB customers? And is there anything you need to do from either a marketing or a network standpoint differently if your corporate customer base is likely to change going forward?\nShane Tackett: Andrew can speak quickly to the sort of composition. I just Ravi, one thing I'd say, tech tends to have some of the best discounts. It's sort of lower-yielding business traffic. And I think the point we were trying to make is they haven't been traveling much all of last year. So there's not even though you have these headlines of layoffs, it doesn't really mean that there's like another downward step in terms of their travel. And I do think that at historically low travel volumes, they may never go back to where they were pre-pandemic. I think they're going to be above where they are today. I'm very confident about that. I just don't know when.\nBenito Minicucci: And then maybe Andrew on the sort of pursuing SMB and all.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think we'll obviously adjust. We obviously would love high tech to get back to the -- where they were. But at the end of the day, this is about using your channels and the timing and when we sell and when we don't sell. And I think there's just a lot of opportunity to relook about who we're selling our seats to and when and where, and we will manage through this.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. And maybe as a quick follow-up. I mean, obviously, you guys have come a long way kind of in the last couple of years and kind of where your balance sheet is right now. And with kind of the biggest boxes checked on the cost side and the fleet transition side and everything else. How are you thinking of the pace of shareholder returns or cash returns through the year maybe as your confidence in your own numbers and the cycle maybe kind of build through the year?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Ravi, I think, so we announced the sort of dilution offset program. I think we've ranged it from $75 million to $100 million. We'll put a grid in place assuming the stock sort of price is somewhat consistent throughout the year, it should be ratable throughout the year. But we'll buy more if the stock goes down and obviously a little bit less if the stock goes up. But we'll get through the entire $100 million by the end of the year, my guess is it's fairly ratable across the quarters. And that's sort of our plan at this point.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thank you.\nBenito Minicucci: All right. Well, thanks, everybody. Thank you, Ravi. Thanks, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our first quarter call. Look forward to following up with anybody out there, and we'll talk to you on the second quarter. Everyone, have a nice day. Thanks.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending."}, {"symbol": "ALK", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-10-20 15:42:04", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alaska Air Group 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Vice President of Finance, Emily Halverson. \nEmily Halverson : Thank you, operator, and good morning. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, which is available at investor.alaskaair.com.  On today's call, you'll hear updates from Ben, Andrew and Shane. Several others of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. This morning, Air Group reported third quarter GAAP net income of $40 million. Excluding special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $325 million.  As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements about future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We'll also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release.  Over to you, Ben. \nBenito Minicucci : Thanks, Emily, and good morning, everyone. Today, we released our third quarter results, closing out the busiest travel period since the pandemic began. Demand was resilient, planes were full, our people were busy and our results were strong.  Our 15.6% pretax margin is likely to top the industry and came despite and multiple new labor contracts. We ran the best operation this summer, leading the industry with the #1 DOT on-time performance from June through September. Our $2.8 billion in revenue marked the highest quarterly revenue ever recorded in our history. Our unit revenue was up 27% versus 2019, which we also believe is best in the industry and underscores that our commercial initiatives are delivering. And last but not least, we ratified 3 major labor contracts becoming the first major airline to reach a deal with our mainline pilot group.  Our leadership team have been very deliberate about our priorities this year and setting ourselves up for continued success. We are seeing results as we focus on moving rapidly to a single fleet, delivering operational excellence, securing labor contracts and configuring our business for profitable growth. Our financial results are strong and our underlying business model is resilient. To put it simply, we are poised to continue to outperform and are excited about what the future holds.  Now let me give you a quick update on our top priorities. Our fleet transition is progressing well, and we are closing in on getting back to a single fleet. All A320 and Q400 aircraft will be out of the fleet by January of 2023, and the 10 A320s will follow by the end of 2023. Today, we have 35 MAX aircraft that are 25% more fuel-efficient per seat than the smaller A320s they are replacing. We expect to have 78 MAX aircraft by end of next year, representing over 30% of our mainline fleet. As we focus on reconfiguring our business back to a single fleet, transition training for nearly 500 of our pilots will continue through May of next year. After which we expect to begin to ramp toward a $75 million single fleet savings we outlined at Investor Day. Our operation is also back on track.  This summer, we returned to delivering a reliable operation with a completion rate over 99% each month of the quarter despite flying record high load factors throughout the summer. Horizon has also posted fantastic operating results with the #1 completion rate in the industry at 99.5%. And importantly, our guests have noticed with our guest satisfaction score improving and exceeding our target for the quarter. We locked in 3 major labor deals, a huge milestone for us that has been a primary focus of ours for several months. Following the ratification of a contract extension with IM and sent deals with both our horizon securing a new contract with our Horizon pilots for video in attracting a robust pilot pipeline.  Also Monday of this week, our Alaska mainline pilots represented by ALPA, ratified a new 3-year agreement that recognizes their contributions to our success and the market for pilots in the industry. We are excited for the stability and alignment. This brings our organization and will prioritize getting our upcoming labor agreements done as well. We have a lot to be positive about here at Air Group. We are delivering on our goals and demand remains strong. We also realized there are challenges our industry is facing, including an uncertain economic backdrop, and a structural step-up in wages.  Going forward, we are uniquely positioned to offset this pressure by leveraging initiatives we already have in place. One of the most impactful will be harnessing the structural efficiencies that come with our return to single fleet, a tailwind that will be unique to Alaska. This includes increasing productivity as we eliminate cross-training events more efficient scheduling by moving line pilots cost-effective growth through upgauging.  We are not immune to the challenges of the industry but remain committed to keeping our cost advantage relative to our competitors as we move forward. We are fortunate to be on solid footing as we look to finish out the year and build on our performance into 2023. Our priorities not only this year but throughout the pandemic have centered on preparing our airline for profitable growth, and we have taken strategic steps to bolster our competitive advantages. As these initiatives continue to fully ramp up, they will support our results both in the near and long term. Near term, this is already evident in our unit revenue outperformance and the fact that we are still tracking to deliver a 6% to 9% full year adjusted pretax margin unchanged despite now including the impact from our new labor deal.  And longer term, the foundational strength of our balance sheet, coupled with our commercial road map and commitment to operational excellence will continue to support strong financial performance.  To close, I am excited to see all of our hard work begin to come to fruition and for the opportunity that we have ahead of us over the coming quarters and years. Lastly, before I hand things over to Andrew, I want to thank all of our Air Group employees for a great summer and everything that they do. Running a safe, reliable operation is critical to our success on all fronts and serving our guests, connecting our communities and delivering on our financial performance. and our success would not be possible without their tremendous effort and the care they continue to show day in and day out.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Andrew. \nAndrew Harrison: Well, thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our third quarter results, along with fourth quarter guidance. In the third quarter, we achieved our highest recorded revenue in our history $2.8 billion. This revenue performance, up 18% versus 2019 on 7% less capacity, resulted in very strong unit revenue performance.  Unit revenues were up 27% versus 2019, a sequential improvement versus an already exceptional second quarter despite yields having peaked from the levels seen back in June and July. Load factors also remained strong, exceeding 2019 levels every month of the quarter and coming in at 86.5% for the full quarter. Our network and revenue teams did a fantastic job partnering together to maximize revenue performance, which was also fueled by revenues generated from the commercial teams initiatives. These factors, coupled with capacity constraints across the industry during a period of elevated demand has translated into a strong pricing environment. Moving to product categories.  Our premium products continue to show strength as they have all year. First Class and Premium Class revenue were both up approximately 28% versus 2019. Paid load factors continue to exceed 2019 levels with first-class up 4 points and premium class up 9 points, both on higher average fares. The strong cash flow generation from our loyalty program has also continued throughout the year. Cash remuneration from the bank was up 37% versus the third quarter of 2019 and while total loyalty revenues finished the quarter up 34% year over 3 recently voted the #1 Best Airline Rewards Program by U.S. News & World Report.  We believe our credit card and our loyalty program offer exceptional value to our guests and a continued source of growth for our business. These strong results were included in our product and loyalty initiatives this year. We are tracking ahead of plan and are set to recognize approximately $135 million in incremental revenue on our long-term goal of $195 million. This initiative is one of the key reasons for our unit revenue outperformance.  Turning to corporate travel trends. After taking a step up earlier this year, business travel volumes have remained around 75% to 80% recovered from 2019 levels, while revenue was approximately 10 points better than this given the yield environment. Notwithstanding a slower recovery of corporate demand across the West Coast, we believe our business recovery is in line with the majors, underscoring the improved business offering we have versus pre-COVID. Additionally, while some of our corporate partners have been slower to return to travel, we believe we are benefiting from employees at these companies taking more personal and hybrid travel as they move around and work remotely. I fully expect that we can restore 100% of business revenue.  Year-to-date, we've improved our share gap from 2019 levels through our corporate distribution channels because of the increased opportunities we have from working with Amex, GBT and joint contracting with American. And finally, our One World and international partnerships have continued their positive momentum from what we shared last quarter, sustaining a high single-digit contribution to our total coupon revenue for the quarter. As we sit today, international and business travel have not fully recovered, which we believe only offers more revenue upside from these partnerships. It will take a few more quarters to get a more complete sense for the impact, but there is no doubt that the strength of these partnerships is real and that this is an accretive revenue source for our business going forward. Looking ahead to guidance for the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue to be up 12% to 15% on capacity that is down 7% to 10% versus 2019. By a wide margin, our go-forward capacity will be most constrained in the fourth quarter as we retire 45 aircraft across our mainline and regional fleet by the end of January and execute training events in preparation for 2023 growth starting in the first quarter.  This guidance implies fourth quarter unit revenue performance of approximately 24% versus 2019. As we look to the fourth quarter, bookings remain healthy as guests continue to book holiday travel. As has been the case throughout the summer, we are booking solidly ahead of 2019 load factors through the end of the year, and are on track to fly a record load factor for the fourth quarter. We are currently holding yields at approximately 20% higher versus the Q4 of 2019. On the network side, we will continue to focus on deepening the spokes of our system as we fully restore our capacity to 2019 levels by spring and grow from there. As we look at our network, the competitive backdrop is still favorable as the West Coast remains the least recovered with competitive capacity down over 20% versus 2019.  As we move into 2023, we are looking forward to taking more MAX deliveries to upgauge and grow efficiently in some of our strongest and capacity-constrained markets such as Seattle. And to wrap up, we remain in a remarkable demand environment, and we look forward to closing out a strong year of revenue performance. We've configured our business for incremental improvement and are already seeing the benefits from joining One World, our partnership with American and our new credit card deal.  More importantly, the commercial drivers we have in place are poised to unlock in even greater way as we move into 2023. And I look forward to sharing more details during our year-end call. Our $400 million of commercial initiatives is proven and tangible, and we will continue to support our revenue performance over the coming quarters and years.  And with that, I'll pass it over to Shane. \nShane Tackett : Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Our $325 million adjusted net profit this quarter reflects both the strong demand backdrop we are experiencing and the strength of Alaska's business model. We are encouraged by the return to operational stability and reliability this quarter, and we are also encouraged by the absence of the extreme COVID-related volatility that had challenged us for more than 2 years.  Our results largely landed within previously guided ranges with no major disruptions causing significant and unanticipated revisions, which seems like a small thing, but it's actually quite refreshing. Not only did we deliver a very strong quarter operationally and financially. But as Ben mentioned, we ratified 3 key labor deals as well. Completing these deals is an important step in ensuring we have contracts that recognize the contributions of our people and also allow us to fully focus on running a great operation, taking care of guests and pursuing our growth and financial performance road maps. I'll briefly walk through highlights of our third quarter performance before discussing costs and labor contracts that are incorporated in our results and our fourth quarter guidance.  On the back of the continued strong demand environment, we generated $174 million in cash flow from operations during the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to $1.4 billion. Total liquidity, inclusive of on-hand cash and undrawn lines of credit remains at a healthy $3.6 billion, providing us 2x the cash we need to run our business and ample funds to pay for our Boeing aircraft deliveries over the next year. Our balance sheet remains strong with debt to cap at 49%. Debt payments during the quarter were approximately $100 million and remaining payments for the year are $50 million. And as you know, shareholder restrictions associated with our cares funding also officially rolled off at the end of September. With our strong operational and financial performance and solid balance sheet, we look forward to discussing potential shareholder returns with our Board next month.  Turning to costs. increased 19.3% in the third quarter versus 2019, 30 basis points above our guidance range. As a reminder, our practice is not to include new contract impacts in our guidance until ratified. Our new labor agreements added $35 million of cost that were not in our original guidance. And excluding these, our CASMex would have been up 16.8%, which would have been below the midpoint of our guidance range. Other transient cost drivers in the quarter include $30 million associated with issuing each of our employees 90,000 mileage plan miles in recognition of all of their extraordinary work during the pandemic, and our 90th anniversary as an airline and approximately $15 million in costs associated with carrying higher staffing complements relative to our flying that we believe will need in the future. These two items represent a 3-point impact to CASMex in the quarter. Turning to fourth quarter guidance and our longer-term thinking into 2023. Let me begin by saying that our Q4 capacity remains artificially constrained as we focus on transition training our pilots to meet our deadline for retiring Q400s and A320s in January. We'll have both the added cost of these training events and have fewer pilots available to fly in revenue service during the quarter and into the first quarter of next year. We expect fourth quarter capacity to be down 7% to 10% versus 2019, approximately 2 points sequentially worse versus the third quarter, where we were down 6.7%. We still expect full year capacity to be down 8% to 9% versus 2019. Our absolute costs will increase from the third to fourth quarter, entirely driven by our new labor agreements and expected strong payouts for our performance-based pay program, as we continue to expect to meet a number of our strategic and financial goals, including being amongst the top margin producers for the full year.  We expect CASMex to be up 20% to 23% in the quarter, approximately 4 points of this are structural costs related to our new labor agreements. 2 points are related to anticipated strong PVP program payouts and lower capacity and higher staffing complements or an approximate 4-point headwind during the quarter. Turning to fuel. While oil prices have moderated some over the quarter, they remain elevated and crack spreads continue to be both elevated and volatile. We expect fuel price per gallon to be $3.50 to $3.70 for the fourth quarter.  Our hedging program is expected to provide a significant benefit this year of around $170 million. For the full year, we now expect CASM ex to be up 19% to 20%. However, we are reiterating our full year adjusted pretax margin guide of 6% to 9%, and we continue to expect to close the year with a month of the top pretax results industry-wide. Last quarter, we outlined that we were prioritizing securing labor deals and returning to a reliable operation above other considerations as those are foundational to the long-term success and financial performance of the company. They are also the foundation of being able to deliver higher levels of productivity and cost leverage going forward. Having solidified our operational reliability, our focus will now shift to leveraging growth in 2023 to reduce unit costs across Air Group.  While there will be some continued productivity and capacity drag from fleet transitions in the first half of the year, our business plan for next year will include a return to our 2019 size during the first half of 2023 and will also include a reduction in unit costs year-over-year. While we won't share specifics on 2023 guidance until our Q4 call, we are very much looking forward to leveraging the benefits of single fleet at Alaskan Horizon higher levels of aircraft utilization and the significant benefits of updating from A320s to 737-9s and ultimately, 737-10s. These are all consistent with the road map we shared at Investor Day back in March and along with our commercial road map that is already producing and has further upside from here, I believe we are well positioned for continued improvement in our business in 2023 and beyond.  And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. \nMike Linenberg : Can you kind of give us an update now that you have both of your pilot contracts done, and this is to you, Ben, what you have seen on the attrition side? Has it completely sort of done a $180 million? And where are you with respect to having an appropriate number of both check airmen and trainers? You did mention that there's going to be a lot of training as pilots move off of the Q400s and the are you ready as we enter into the new year.\nBenito Minicucci : Mike, yes, what we're really pleased with both contracts on both the regional side and the mainline side. And these are really great deals for us on the attraction retention side of the business. In terms of what we're seeing for attrition, it's a little early to tell, but early indications are, we are seeing some benefit on both the regional and mainline side.  So I think this is really pivotal for us. It's going to really help us long term in terms of growth plans. In terms of Check Arman, in terms of the training output, we have -- we've seen a lot of improvement since the spring. We're producing about 65 pilots out of the schoolhouse a month with the goal being 100. We're increasing the number of check garment to help us improve that throughput, but we are on track right now to deliver our pilots, the pads we need per month on both the regional and the mainline side, and we're pretty confident on executing that plan going forward. Anything, Joe, you want to add or -- Mike, go ahead, if you have a follow-up. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] In the meantime, our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: There was a lot in there in terms of guidance points. Can you just refresh us on what you said about the first half and kind of the rate of capacity recovery in the first half? Is it sort of comprehensively a first half back to 100%? Or is that something like you'd hit in 2Q? \nShane Tackett : Yes, I think it's likely to be sort of in the middle of the first half of the year. I'm not -- we're still finalizing our Gen Feb plans. But we'll be back to 2019 size confidently sometime in the latter half of first quarter or early second quarter. With the transition training, it will be a little bit sort of choppy in terms of how the capacity comes back online. But we're excited to get there, and we've got a lot of aircraft coming in the first half of the year that can then take us ultimately above the 2019 size, and we feel like there's demand for it through the second half of the year. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: And on that delivery stream, can you just walk us through what you expect next year and your line of sight or confidence on those deliveries just given the environment? \nNathaniel Pieper : Dane, it's Nate. We've got 35 MAX airplanes now. And we think by the end of next year, we're projecting to have 78. Boeing obviously is 5 miles down the road, and we meet with them weekly to understand delivery constraints, et cetera. we're confident that they're going to deliver and give us the airplane capacity we need to hit our targets. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth : Just on the -- just a follow-up on some of the pilot training and cost and the elevated staffing costs. Just how much of a drag is that still in 1Q? I'm guessing the pilot training costs will kind of drop off after kind of the 1Q or early 2Q. I'm just kind of curious how much of -- what size of a drop-off there will be? And then kind of the elevated staffing, when do you see that moderating back to kind of historical levels? \nShane Tackett : It's about -- just to put context around it. For Q4, the overstaffing and transition training is about 1.5 points of our Q4 year-over-year CASM or year over 3 CASM guide. It's likely to be similar-ish in Q1, and then it will start to taper and be completely gone by the end of Q2. \nSavi Syth : Both costs --\nShane Tackett : Correct. Correct. Yes. \nSavi Syth : Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up with the -- on the Boeing deliveries and things of that. Just any kind of revised thoughts on CapEx? I know the CapEx came down a little bit here in 2022. Can view on 2023, '24 CapEx and the financing of that. \nShane Tackett : Yes, I'll have Emily sort of update. One thing I would just say, and it's intuitive, and I know you're hearing it from everybody, but not only on aircraft, on every capital item we're buying things are shifting to the right. I think supply chains everywhere are elongated still. New SIMs are taking a little bit longer. GSE equipment is taking longer. So things what we plan to buy. It just seems like they're taking longer to get in right now, but Emily can give you some more on the totals. \nEmily Halverson : Yes. I think Shane covered it pretty well. You saw that our guide for 2022 came down about $100 million. You should expect most of that to shift into 2023. And when we give our full year 2023 guide, we'll refresh you guys from the numbers we gave you at Investor Day, which we had originally said was around $2 billion for 2023. So I expect that to go up a little bit. \nSavi Syth : And is the financing Emily, is that debt or cash or any thoughts on the financing side? \nEmily Halverson : Savi, it's not. It will all be cash. We still continue to hold more than 2x the amount of liquidity we need to run the airline. So best thing we can possibly do is pay cash for airplanes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. \nAndrew Didora: Shane, a lot to unpack on the CASM front in 4Q and for the year. Just stepping back when we think of 2022 CASM up 19% versus 2019. Can you kind of break out for us of that up '19? Like what are the kind of the onetime items that you feel like will not repeat as we move into 2023? And how much of your CASM this year is just from not having your network fully restored? Just trying to get a good run rate potential for 2023 unit costs. \nShane Tackett : Yes. No, I appreciate the question, Andrew. Number one, I just want to remind folks that in terms of the updated cost guide, the only thing that's changed for full year for us is the new labor deals. Everything else is tracking exactly as we expected it to. And then, Andrew, you hit on it, the biggest drag to CASM or headwind for us this year is not producing the ASMs that we had wanted to originally. We made a very deliberate -- obviously, in Q1, we were all impacted by COVID waves and the entire industry had to take capacity out. We had a big snowstorm here in Seattle that drug into January.  But we made a deliberate decision to pull down the schedule by 6, 7, 8 points during the summer and to hold it lower during Q4 as well as we prioritize operational stability and. Now that we're stable, we've got terrific completion rates. We've got great on-time performance. We feel really good about our staffing complement levels and our ability to fill new classes across every role in the company. We're ready to get much more growth-minded and begin to leverage sort of the goodness that comes with growing and getting back to productivity next year. As one data point, I think we're still 10 points below our historical norm for productivity. I don't know that we'll get all of that back next year, but we're going to make a big sort of -- we'll get a big chunk of that back coming next year. So that's really the biggest thing. Everything else -- the only structural real change is the labor deals. I think we're unique right now, having been the first to get the mainline pilot deal done. I suspect we won't be unique for very long. And so that is something that the entire industry will ultimately have to do. And on a relative basis, we'll be in a really good position versus everybody as we have been historically. \nAndrew Didora: Got it. And just a second question for Ben or Andrew. I think look, having the scale that you have in your hubs in the Pacific Northwest, you really, I think, really solid driver of your overall margin performance. I know you'll never get to the share in LAX or SFO that you have in Seattle and Portland. But I guess how long do you think it will take to build out those geographies as I think -- as you build up there, your margin should see a tailwind as you scale up there over time. Any thoughts on kind of the time frame of those California markets? \nUnidentified Company Representative : Yes. Thanks, Andrew. I think the all I would answer that is that as we move into next year and we give better guidance on our growth, we are returning more growth back to California. I think we feel really good about where we are, the markets we serve. And as we've shared all along, it's about frequency and depths of those markets. It's about unlocking global connections with both our OneWorld partners and with American. And I think we have a head of California [Indiscernible] down there. I meet with him every month. And I'm really excited about the focus and the discipline that we have down there where traditionally as the Pacific Northwest Company, we focus a lot up here. So overall, I don't think you're going to see a material change overall in the scheme of things. But what we do do down there, I fully expect to get better and stronger over the next few years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie from Seaport Global. \nDan McKenzie : Shane, 2023 capacity is choppy as it comes back online, just going back to, I think, an earlier comment, does that tie to a choppy earnings recovery from here? And I guess related to this, we are seeing some of your peers lay out pretty big earnings goals in 2023. And setting aside the 11% to 13% pretax margin goal, what's your conviction that you can at least improve on your 2022 pretax margin as we move into next year? \nShane Tackett : Yes. I don't think it portends a choppy earnings recovery. A lot of the sort of choppiness will be the base comp, like on a year-over-year basis, we've just had so much unexpected schedule pull down this year. And by the way, next year, we're going to comp to 2022. And so I think it will be fine. I don't think the earnings trajectory necessarily will follow the return of capacity trajectory, really confident we can improve our margins next year. Really strong demand backdrop. I think the commercial team is doing a really good job of participating in that backdrop and currently outperforming the industry. And then we've got a lot of things that we need to go do on the cost side to take advantage of the strategic decisions we made around single fleet and getting back to historical norms on productivity. And so I think if the -- absent a major economic pullback, I think we feel really good about our ability to get improved margins next year. \nDan McKenzie : Terrific. Andrew, second question here. I guess, turning to you, $400 million in revenue initiatives outlined at the Investor Day, so loyalty network alliances, fleet upgauging. What percent of the revenue from -- what is the percent of revenue from premium products today, say, versus discounted leisure? And how can we think about that premium revenue target as we move into 2023, given the fleet transformation? \nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think off the top of my head, I think both premium and first all-in coupon and upsells are $1 billion-plus businesses each just to give you a rough size of magnitude. I think our challenge is always, given the strong demand, we believe and we continue to believe the importance of taking care of our leads and upgrades. But we're also recognizing there is opportunity to continue to get more out of our premium products. We're opening up new distribution channels. And most importantly, as we upgauge our fleet and we get 25-plus percent increase in first-class seats, from the transition. We still see significant upsides. We're looking at some other things, which I won't go into today. But overall, my expectation is we continue to show good things in the premium product space. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. \nScott Group : Can you just clarify the -- do we have the full impact of these -- of the pilot deal in Q4 costs? Or is it from the date of ratification? And then I just -- you made a comment that the only change is with CASM is this new pilot deal. But I thought you said it's -- there's a 4-point headwind from the pilot deal in the fourth quarter, but the full year CASM guidance coming up 3 points. So it feels like it's more than just labor. Maybe just -- I'm not sure I'm following.\nShane Tackett : Yes, sure. Yes, the -- and I would say labor deals, not just the mainline pilot deal is what we've been sort of speaking to. Those are fully baked into the fourth quarter ratably -- so that 4-point headwind is the structural sort of number that we're going to go forward with at this point. No, I think in terms of the full year CASMex guide the real change between prior guidance and current guidance is the labor deals being incorporated. As you know, we don't guide to labor deals as we're negotiating. And so we closed 3 this quarter. And that's what we had to bring through our full year CASMex guide. There was 1 other category that went up a bit, and it is our performance-based pay. Because we do expect to be on the better end of many of our financial targets that we took a larger as well. \nScott Group : And then so when we think about next year, we'll have, I guess, the more quarters of labor will have capacity up, which should help maybe some of the inefficient go away. When you add it all up, would you think that CASMex is up or down '23 versus '22. \nShane Tackett : Yes. No, it will be down. As I said in my script, our business plan will be to have a reduction in CASMex in '23 versus '22? \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. \nJamie Baker : So Shane, following up on that last question, the pilot impact in the fourth quarter. So there's a look back to September 1 on wages and then the $33,000 and $22,000 bonuses for Captain and first officers, respectively. So that's in the guide. You're not going to take that as a one-timer in the fourth quarter. Is that correct? \nShane Tackett : So the look back to September 1 is in the third quarter result that was recorded through the P&L the ratification bonus sort of lump sum payments, those were special in the quarter as well, not they're in the adjusted -- they're not in the adjusted number. \nJamie Baker : Yes. Okay, got it. So the fourth quarter guide is clean of that. And then second, and it's a question on preferential bidding system. And I really hate asking stupid questions. But here we go. Why does it take until April of 2024 to go live? I mean, isn't it just like Software? \nShane Tackett : Yes. Yes. And it may be before that. So that your exhaustive reader of our agreement, Jamie. That is the outside drop dead date. We need -- we have to go live by that. We have to negotiate a time line and just agree with our union counterparts, what the last day we would go live. Our hope is to do it much sooner. I know, Ben, would like to do it much sooner. There's only -- the real drivers, there's only a couple of providers for these systems and they have other demand on them as well, so you have to get in line. And then, Jamie, you just try to avoid the peak season. So there's only a handful of months in a year that you actually want to go live. You don't want to be doing it in December, you don't want it to be doing it in peak summer. So that's why these end up taking a little bit longer than everybody would suspect they should. \nJamie Baker : Okay. I haven't thought about the peak season aspect. Do you expect -- final question, apologies. When it does go live, do you think it's something we would be able to identify on a well on a margin basis. But on an ex fuel CASM basis, I'm sure it matters to you guys, and I'm sure that was a win. I'm just wondering if it rises to the level of materiality for those of us modeling the company. \nShane Tackett : Yes. I think it's something you'll probably have to ask a detailed question of us to give specific number when we get there, but it's not going to be inconsequential and I'm sure you'll hear us at least speak to the benefit of it once it's live, and we're starting to see the benefit. It really cleans up the transitions month-to-month and sort of the conflict drops, as you know. And that can be a significant benefit, both for pilots and for the company on a productivity basis. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. \nBrandon Oglenski: Can we go back to your analyst meeting targets. You said pretax margin, 11% to 13% long-term and above industry peers. Can you guys just remind us, I'm assuming that inflation is coming in a little bit higher than that. So assuming it's still relevant, what are some of the favorable commercial offsets that you guys are envisioning here? \nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think we're -- as we've talked about all along on the $400 million, of course, inflation has its impact certainly on credit cards, for instance, I mean, we get paid for every swipe, and those swaps are up 7% just inflation alone, give or take. I think what I would say, commercially and Shane and been a hit on it, is what I'm most excited about is that as we worked really hard to reconfigure this business, airplanes, labor that we're going to set ourselves up next year to really operate this airline like a Swiss watch. And I can tell you the revenue goodness that comes from that, the efficiencies that come from that and all the good things that come from that versus what we struggled with this year is really going to come into being. We're going to give you an update on as we continue to look at our initiatives, but overall, I think outside of that, operating this airline efficiently is going to be huge. \nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I appreciate that, Andrew. And I guess along those lines, you guys did talk about earning above your cost of capital. Obviously, that has moved higher this year. How do you think about the long-term growth of the business been? Is it right to still target 4% to 8%, especially with the higher cost base and higher cost capital as well?\nShane Tackett : Yes. Ben can jump in on this. I think, Brandon, we're sort of fortunate I think the equity valuation we'll have to see over time what the cost of equity is. On the debt side, we still have a very, very low cost of capital. And because of our cash position, we don't need to access capital markets anytime soon. So I think on the debt side, we feel incredibly sound in terms of the ability to finance ourselves going forward. You know our balance sheet story if anybody should and can be investing, it's us. And I think there's still a lot of like demand that we feel like we could be taking in our core markets that are highly accretive in terms of returns above cost of capital, but Ben can speak to the longer-term sort of plan. \nBenito Minicucci : Yes. I think our long-term plan is still to grow until 2025. We have a great order book from Boeing, which we plan to execute. So I think exactly what Shane said. I think we're on track for that and feel good about the long-term growth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. \nConor Cunningham : Just in 2Q, you talked a fair bit about the alliance initiatives and I don't think I heard much about that this quarter. And I would just assume that from oneworld in particular, you would see a huge benefit given like international is coming back in a major way. So if you could just kind of update us where you're at with that. \nNathaniel Pieper : Conor, thanks for the question. It's Nath Pieper. I think -- you go back to why Alaska joined Oneworld and why we were so eager to do that. And sure, it's to participate in international flows and be able to offer our guests the ability to carry their loyalty benefits, carry their status in our mileage program and get any place on the globe that they wanted to go, either on our airplanes or on somebody else's. And so as international traffic has come back, Europe, especially we're seeing real tangible benefits from that. Year-over-year, we're up 40% from a contribution perspective from these partnerships. And I think the second benefit to it, which is harder to see in the P&L is really keeping our most important guests within the Alaska family, whether it's on our airplanes domestically or it's using their Oneworld partners that have their loyalty status, we're not losing those passengers, our most important guests, to our critical competitors here in the Pacific Northwest anymore because we've got a global network that we can sell and market as our own. \nConor Cunningham : Great. And then just on the cost structure, I mean a lot of noise going on. I'm not trying to get the labor stuff. But when I think about Alaska historically, it's always about really highly productive employees. The world is different now. The productivity has probably changed in the last. So I'm just curious on how you get back to high productivity levels that you had historically. Like to me, is it really just a function of capacity? Or is there something else at play there? \nShane Tackett : Yes. Connor, thanks. A couple of things that I think were unique to COVID and transient and time will tell if there's a new normal or not. But one as we were reramping, we were having to hire larger volumes than we've ever had and get those folks through training, that is all a sort of relative drag to our normal staffing posture. And then we had incredibly high attrition, which every airline has seen and every industry has really seen. And so -- those 2 things, I think, stabilize over time for the economy and for us, we're in a much more stable place today. And I think you go back to the sort of more normalized training complement in terms of overall staffing as we get through 2023 and beyond. And then as I had mentioned sort of in my script, we carried -- we didn't reduce our staffing levels at all even though we took 6 or 7 or 8 points out of the system for the second half of the year. So we've got the people we need to do a lot of this growth next year. There's still a lot of hiring that has to happen because of attrition, but we're in a really good place.  Whereas last year, we were trying to hire just in time to meet the new capacity. And then we get hit with the COVID wave and people would be sick and absent and we couldn't operate. And so we, like others in the industry have totally done a 180 on that. We're now carrying more people than we need and it's time to go get the growth in the ASMs and the air and enjoy the productivity benefit from that. I don't know if we'll get back to pre-2019 productivity. I don't know if there's like a new normal of absenteeism, but we're going to be much better than we are today as we get into next year and beyond. \nBenito Minicucci : But I just want to add, Conor, like this company has a low-cost mindset. We're building budgets now that we're going to build productivity targets into the budgets. And we just -- we're setting the company up for 2023. I mean the labor deals -- we got 5 labor deals done this year. We're getting the single fleet done and behind us where there's a capacity drag on us. But heading into 2023, this company is going to go back to where we were in terms of this low cost, high productivity, low overhead mindset. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen & Company. \nHelane Becker : So as you think about the record revenue that you're reporting and your guidance for the fourth quarter and maybe how you're thinking about 23%. How are you thinking about where revenue can go over the next few years? Like do you have a new target for where you think you can see that number. \nUnidentified Company Representative : Yes, Helane, I think I've said on previous calls, I think we can learn a lot about revenue as much as we thought we did. We learned a lot more during COVID. And I think my team specifically I think just the way our network and RM team works together is at a different place. I think on the corporate side, we're in a different place. I think, on the alliances and partnerships. We're in a different place. We're working a lot on the distribution. And again, we are very, very focused on initiatives and generating more revenue. I think our natural, we're going to be a growth airline. That's what we do, and we're going to be well positioned to do that, both on the capacity side, but I still believe -- as I personally look at all of this, that there is upside on our products, our types of products and especially, I don't think we fully untapped the loyalty and the card growth. And I think there's a lot of goodness there. So all these things we know going forward that there will be a step change in costs on an absolute basis, mostly because of labor, and we're going to go get that on the revenue side. \nBenito Minicucci : And Helane, what I'll add is, regardless of what the revenue environment does, and I do think it will change for the better. We still need to focus on what we've done so well for 2 decades is a highly efficient, low-cost operation highly productive. Those things benefit you in a good revenue environment or a not-so-good revenue environment. So those are things that we're getting back to and Andrew, of course, everything Andy said makes sense.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna Financial Group. \nChris Stathoulopoulos : So I just want to -- the 6% to 9% pretax margin guide with the new pilot contract or these 3 new deals. So could you help us square that versus the moving pieces of the 4 to 8 ASM guide? And also, any -- it sounds like you're fairly confident around the order book. But if there are delays, how does that change the mix that you outlined last year on the 70% frequencies, 5% stage? Or perhaps more importantly, the 10% new markets. Are you just planning right now with these new deals at 6 to 9 for some level of sustained momentum in yields or the benefit of the operating leverage you referenced as your utilization returns in the first half of next year? \nShane Tackett : Yes. I'd make sure I try to answer each of those. On the delivery stream. I'll tell you when we do give you guys guidance on capacity for next year, it will be appropriately buffered for what Boeing believes they can deliver versus what we may plan for them to deliver. And so we'll build upside in if they actually hit the delivery dates they're telling us, that would be a benefit to us and would give us the ability to add some incremental ASMs. We're not going to overstress the system and assume every delivery comes on the exact day, even though we know that they're trying hard to do that. So we'll be really confident in our ability to operate the schedule that we tell you guys we're going to next year. I think it's both. I think primarily, we look to get the cost structure moving in the right direction, get costs going back down, which will be a big sort of tailwind to margin. And yes, I think right now, we do expect the revenue environment to be different than pre-COVID for a period of time. I think, structurally, there's relative to the size of GDP or demand, I think supply continues to be constrained and our teams continue to do a good job understanding the revenue environment and getting appropriate yields and pricing in it.  So I think both are going to help drive us. But really, we were sort of talking to you guys at Investor Day prior to a lot of this inflation stuff coming in. And we knew that labor was going to reset. We knew where we were in the market. We had a sense of where it was going. And when we laid out our long term targets, we specifically put together a strategy on both the cost and the commercial side to make sure we could get into those ranges long term. So nothing has changed for us from that perspective. We're going to deliver what we told you guys at Investor Day and get to these margin targets. \nChris Stathoulopoulos : Okay. And just a follow-up here. The 4 points on the structural labor side, is that just the base rate piece. I think you said that the ratification bonus and look back for September in 3Q and then Part B, should we assume that we would see elevated PBP accruals into -- or for full year 2023. \nShane Tackett : Yes. The 4 points represents all the labor deals we've done to date. And just as a reminder, in 3Q, the wage rate increase back to September 1 for our mainline pilot deal is in OpEx, the sort of lump sum bonuses in special. What was the second part of the question? EVP Dexter. Too soon to tell. I mean I think we have a strong commitment to being one of the best margin producers in the industry, and we believe if we do that, our employees should benefit through the PPP program. We do think it drives a lot of alignment. I think that's been proven out over a number of years, and it's appropriate to recognize folks when they're working hard and achieving.  But the Board sets those goals, they do that and sort of as we get through the end of the year, so it's too early to know where we'll come out on that for next year. My strong inclination is the goals will be a little tougher next year than they were this year, and we'll have to work harder to get to them.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Thank you, everyone. That marks the end of our third quarter earnings call.\nBenito Minicucci : Thanks, everybody. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending."}, {"symbol": "ALK", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-07-21 15:40:06", "content": "Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alaska Air Group 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group\u2019s Vice President of Finance, Emily Halverson.\nEmily Halverson: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, which is available at investor.alaskaair.com. On today\u2019s call, you\u2019ll hear updates from Ben, Andrew and Shane. Several others of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. This morning, Air Group reported second quarter GAAP net income of $139 million. Excluding special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $280 million. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements about future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we\u2019ve provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today\u2019s earnings release. Over to you, Ben.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Emily, and good morning, everyone. Our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business model and ability to adapt to a rapidly evolving external environment. We are in a period of record breaking demand, which is reflected in the solid Q2 results we reported this morning. Our 14%, second quarter pretax margin lands us near the top of the industry. A remarkable achievement given the fact that fuel expense is up 65% versus the same period in 2019. June, especially was a phenomenal month as revenue surpassed $1 billion, the highest monthly revenue recorded in our history. And we achieved this on capacity still below 2019 levels. Bank cash remuneration increased 40% in June, demonstrating the power of our renewed credit card deal and the strength of our terrific partnership with Bank of America. And lastly, we generated record revenue from our airline partnerships during the month, representing over 8% of coupon revenue, an exciting result, given that international and business travel haven\u2019t fully unlocked yet. Meeting these historic levels of demand is both exciting and challenging. And we are rising to the occasion. June is proof of this. Marking an important turnaround in our operation as we were at or near the top of the industry in both on time performance and completion rate for the month with this trend, continuing into July. Our fundamental commitment to our guests and our people is to run a safe, reliable on-time airline. It\u2019s that simple, and we will continue to prioritize those requirements as we move forward. I\u2019m very proud of the turnaround our team of 23,000 has delivered over the past two months, and I want to extend my thanks to all of them. This is a complex industry that has become more challenging lately. Our team has persevered, met new challenges with professionalism and care and continues to put their best into the company and operation each day. This year, we are celebrating our 90th year as an airline, which is a remarkable accomplishment for any business, but especially in this industry, to celebrate our remarkable people, we issued 90,000 miles to Air Group employees that they can use to fly with us or anywhere our one world and other partners fly. Now, let me briefly outline some areas that are going well for us, along with the challenges we continue to manage through. Of course, demand is a bright spot as guests take summer vacations and get out to visit friends and family and business travel continues to return. Andrew will talk more about demand, including what we\u2019re seeing into Q3 and growing revenue contribution from our credit card, as well as our domestic and international partners, which is great to see. We continue hiring at a rapid pace and are consistently meeting our hiring goals. We are currently at our target staffing levels across most work groups and locations. Our transition towards a single fleet remains on track. Our MAX fleet continues to grow while the A320s and Q400s will be fully retired by early 2023, followed by the A321s at the end of 2023. This quarter, we also reached a tentative agreement with the International Association of Machinists who represent 5,000 customer service, stores, reservations, ramp, and clerical agents. The TA is undergoing ratification voting and provides raises for our people and an extension of the current contract by two years to 2026. We look forward to reaching new contracts with both our Alaska and Horizon pilots as well. Finally, our relative financial performance is strong, which is our commitment to owners. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve generated $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations with $600 million in free cash flow. On the challenge front, fuel costs remain an issue for the industry. Our hedges continue to dampen the impact for us, and we expect our full year hedge benefit to be at approximately $200 million based on the forward curve as of July 18. Pilot attrition is another challenge we are attentive to across Alaska, Horizon and SkyWest. Attrition is most acute at our regional carriers and is a constraint across the industry. This is evidenced by industry regional capacity that is down 20% to 30% versus 2019, as mainline carriers hire pilots at unprecedented levels. And lastly, as is the case for the entire economy, supply chains remain disrupted by the pandemic. We are working with key partners closer than ever before, and will be more conservative in planning our operation and capacity until we see higher levels of stability and predictability. Our aircraft engine and component partners are working extraordinarily hard and we\u2019ll continue to support them in their efforts. As we look forward, we are committed to producing strong financial results this year, while also priming our company for success in 2023 and beyond. I am excited about what we can deliver on this front over the next few years. We are growing our fleet with new efficient aircraft within an improved competitive network and we\u2019re expanding global connections through our partnerships. Our relative cost advantage remains intact, despite industry headwinds overall, and our focus on enabling structural cost improvements and our move to single fleet will be a powerful enabler for us going forward. And finally, we\u2019ve unlocked commercial levers that are already materializing and are set to drive incremental benefit for us over the next few years. We have all the elements in place to continue to drive sustainable and profitable growth here at Air Group and we are setting ourselves up to continue to deliver industry leading financial results as we have done so for so many years. To wrap up, demand in the short term remains robust, despite real headwinds that exist in the economy and our industry today. Headwinds like the war in Ukraine, stubbornly high fuel prices, high inflation, and a potential recession. And even with these negative factors, we still expect to deliver strong financial performance this year with double-digit pretax margins in the third quarter, as well as our 6% to 9% full year pretax margin. As anyone who has been in the airline industry for a period of time learns long-term success only comes from taking one step at a time. The strategic steps we\u2019ve taken, streamlining our business, moving to a single fleet and capitalizing on commercial opportunities are set to make Air Group a stronger company, positioning us well in any environment. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will focus on second quarter results, our third quarter guidance, as well as progress on commercial initiatives. I want to start with a tremendous revenue result for the quarter. This was the highest revenue generating quarter in our history. Second quarter revenues totaled $2.7 billion demonstrating the swift change in environment compared to how we started the year. Second quarter revenue was up 16% on capacity that was down 8% leading to an impressive 26% increase in unit revenues. Very strong demand coupled with reduced industry capacity resulted in Air Group flying record load factors for all three months of the quarter, April at 87%, May at 87.5% and June finishing at 89.6%. Yields increased over 20 points from April to June, and we outperformed our own midpoint guidance for the quarter by three percentage points. I\u2019m also excited to share that May marked the first time revenues from our business channels exceeded pre-pandemic levels, a testament to our partnership with Amex GBT American Airlines and the resilience of our small and medium business customers. We saw revenue strength across all regions and from a product perspective, premium revenues continue to accelerate from the first quarter. For this quarter, both first class and premium class revenues were up 30% with paid load factor up eight points in first and 16 points in premium versus 2019. We offer a fantastic premium product which aligns well with our long average stage length for our domestic carrier. Today, premium seats account for about one quarter of our total seats. And this mix will only continue to improve as we retire the A320s and bring on the MAX-9, which will have 11% more premium seating. As we shared with you at Investor Day, our loyalty program and Bank of America card was going to be a revenue and profit accelerant. Q2 is proof of this. Cash remuneration from the bank this quarter was up 43%, while total loyalty revenues were up 58% versus the second quarter of 2019, both primarily driven by strong bank commissions and mileage plan redemptions. As we\u2019ve shared, approximately 195 million of my team\u2019s 400 million commercial initiatives relates to product and loyalty. We expect to recognize approximately 70% or 135 million of the revenue from this initiative in our P&L this year. And lastly, we get to talk about meaningful results from our oneworld membership. As global travel restrictions of ease and international travel rebound strongly, we\u2019ve been encouraged by the incremental revenue we saw this quarter. In June, our alliance relationship drove a record amount of revenue representing approximately 8% of total coupon revenue as Ben mentioned earlier. This is a full two-point increase over 2019. We are currently revisiting our revenue estimates from oneworld in our partners, because if June volumes are indicative of what we will see going forward, we will need to revise our internal forecasts upward. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to produce another solid financial quarter. Undoubtedly, we are in an exceptional demand period and the moderated capacity outlook sets a strong backdrop for our revenue performance. Considering current trends, which I\u2019ll expand on in a minute, we expect third quarter revenues to be up 16% to 19% on capacity that is down 5% to 8% versus 2019. This implies unit revenues up approximately 26% flat sequentially versus the second quarter, but a strong result on slightly higher capacity. With that guidance provided, I do want to offer more color on the trends we\u2019re seeing today, which are factored into these estimates. For clarity, demand remains very strong. Leisure demand continues to sit well above 2019 levels, while our business channels have now recovered fully revenue wise. While corporate business travel volumes have been a little choppy, we do expect these volumes to continue to recover from their approximate 75% to 80% levels today. That said, we do recognize that there are significant pressures on consumers, including rising interest rates, high oil prices and inflation, which if persists are likely to put downward pressure on demand and therefore pricing from where we are today as we enter the fall. There was a very aggressive run up in yield during the second quarter. And while we look to have peaked in yields, new bookings remain at historically high yields, just not as high as the past few weeks. Touching on capacity for a moment, our regional partners like all others across the industry continue to face pilot staffing and training challenges. Compared to 2019, approximately 35% of our CPA block hours have been removed from the rest of 2022 impacting our second half capacity by approximately three points. We expect these headwinds to persist well into 2023. Apart from accelerating the retirement of our Q400 fleet, we\u2019ve also taken several proactive network steps to mitigate the impact of this loss capacity. First, we\u2019ve pivoted to mainline flying where we\u2019ve had previously operated regional aircraft. Second, by reducing day of week capacity in long stage length regional markets. And in third, in a limited number of markets suspending service through next spring, in no instances have we exited any cities. Touching on mainline with the delivery of our 28th MAX last month, our MAX aircraft now represents 16% of mainline capacity. As our fleet grows, we\u2019re ready to take advantage of the up gauging opportunities by putting more seats into core hubs like Seattle, where we now offer 100 nonstop destinations, which is two times that of our competitors. We\u2019ve worked hard over the last several years in transitioning our company to enable profitable growth post-pandemic, which includes a tangible commercial roadmap that we expect will deliver $400 million in incremental revenue over the next several years. And we are off to a very strong start. We have a solid fleet pan, high quality hubs well placed across the west coast, a growing loyalty program and expansive partnerships for our guests to serve the destinations that we cannot. And with that, I\u2019ll pass it to Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results highlight a dramatic turnaround in our financial performance, especially given the significant losses we experienced to start the year. Our adjusted profit this quarter in absolute dollar terms was higher than 2019 on record revenue for Air Group. Our teams have done a great job managing the revenue side of the ledger as the man returned quickly after this winter\u2019s Omicron wave. More importantly, our operation has stabilized and we have returned to running an airline with high completion factors and high on time performance. Operational reliability and performance will remain our priority as we move forward into 2023 and towards single fleets at both Alaska and Horizon. Turning to second quarter results, our financial performance and strength remains solid. We ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in total liquidity inclusive of on hand cash and undrawn lines of credit. Year-to-date cash flows from operations are $1.2 billion, including tax refunds and free cash flow is approximately $600 million. Debt-to-cap ended the quarter at 50% within our target leverage range, debt payments are very manageable with approximately $100 million scheduled for Q3 and $50 million in Q4. CASMex was up 19% versus 2Q 2019 sequentially we increased capacity by 13% from Q1 while non-fuel operating costs rose 6%. Aside from performance based pay accruals, which as you know is a program we believe strongly in. There are two primary cost pressure areas, wages, both for our employees and from our third-party partners and airport rents and related expenses, as large capital improvement projects are completed across our system. These pressures we believe are consistent throughout the industry and not unique to Alaska.  Obviously our unit costs were also highly sensitive to our capacity and the lower capacity levels we are deploying this year are headwind that will ultimately reverse. Despite these and continued high fuel prices, which are up over 50% versus the start of the year. We have line of sight to another double-digit pretax result in Q3 and are reiterating our expectation to deliver on our full year pretax margin guidance of 6% to 9%. Speaking of capacity, this spring, we made adjustments to give us the necessary breathing room to get back to running a reliable operation, which is a requirement before we attempt to more aggressively grow. The primary driver of the scheduled pull down was lower output of new pilots from training versus what we needed. We have much improved visibility into our training throughput and will continue to more conservatively plan capacity in the near term to ensure staffing shortages are not driving an inability to operate the schedule we\u2019ve sold.  Additionally, as you know, we are committed to exiting the Airbus fleet and will begin retiring our 29 A320s in the fourth quarter. Given a more conservative approach to capacity for staffing reasons, better clarity on our Airbus retirement plan and the regional capacity reduction Andrew shared, we expect third quarter capacity to be down 5% to 8% versus 2019 and full year capacity to be down 8% to 9%. The capacity outlook reductions from prior guidance are roughly one-third from regional capacity reductions and two-thirds from slower mainline growth. The near term impact of lower capacity will pressure our CASMex performance for the balance of the year. Overall, we expect third quarter CASMex to be up 16% to 19% with full year CASMex up 15% to 17%. Apart from the direct impact of lower capacity, there are a few specific headwinds that also contribute to our CASMex guides. First wages and benefits. Given industry dynamics in the labor market overall, wages are increasing and productivity remains pressured. As Ben mentioned, we\u2019re excited to have recently reached a tentative agreement with IAM and if it ratifies, we expect it to add $13 million in costs in the second half of 2022 and approximately $30 million on an annualized run rate. Overall wage increases are expected to add approximately three points of pressure to CASMex this year versus 2019. Second, training and ramp up costs. As we continue to bring up staffing levels, elevated training and related costs will persist through 2022 and 2023. For the full year, we expect these incremental training costs to add approximately $50 million or about one point of CASMex. Third, performance based pay. We\u2019re proud of our incentive program, which is included in our CASMex. And for the full year, we expect the incremental expense to add nearly one point to CASMex. Additionally, the 90,000 mile bonus for employees that Ben shared earlier is adding another $30 million or two points in the third quarter. Lastly, we expect fuel price per gallon to be 379 to 389 for the third quarter, despite some of the headwinds our industry is currently facing. I believe we continue to have the right structure and low cost business model in place to strengthen our competitive advantages and fortify our relative position within the industry. This company has succeeded on running a disciplined operation with a long-term view for 90 years, and we\u2019re not losing sight of that now. All the elements to drive profitable growth remain intact and our underlying business model is resilient. Our move to single fleets will drive structural cost improvements supported by continued focus on operational excellence. We are progressing nicely on the $400 million in commercial initiatives, and we are supported by a strong balance sheet. So while we face common industry pressures, this unique combination gives me confidence in our ability to strengthen our competitive position over the next several years. And with that, let\u2019s go to your questions\nEmily Halverson: Operator, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ravi Shanker [Morgan Stanley]. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks morning, everyone. I want to follow up on the yield commentary. I think your random [ph] guidance of 3Q is still pretty strong, but I think there was some indication that maybe in the recent weeks there\u2019s been some slowing in trends. So, can you just help us quantify that? And you had said, you\u2019re still going to run well ahead of 2019, but compared to the mid-20s kind of, where is that looking at the very tail end of the booking curve?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, thanks for the question, Ravi. I think, what we\u2019re starting to see now obviously is that bookings that are coming in are now coming in progressively for the fall period, which as we move out of the peak summer period. But just to reiterate demand is still extremely strong for July, August, and September. Our load factors are on average one to two points ahead of 2019. So, we\u2019re just saying the last few weeks at these very peak yields, they\u2019re just starting to flatten out and come down just a small tad. But again, it\u2019s still extremely strong and as per our guidance, we expect a very strong third quarter unit revenue performance.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. Would you say that that\u2019s different from normal seasonality or is that consistent?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, I think as seasonality as the get away from the peak summer period in the fall that\u2019s, that wouldn\u2019t be unexpected.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. And just one follow up kind of on the at the Analyst Day, I think you guys had spoken about line of site to resuming cash return, obviously very choppy environment out there, but do you have any latest update on that?\nNat Pieper:\n.:\nRavi Shanker: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jamie Baker [JPMorgan]. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning everybody. Any update on tech sector contribution to corporate travel?\nBen Minicucci: Yes, Jamie, I would say for us, at least that that tech has probably been the weakest just to be frank given our network. But as I also have shared in our prepared remarks, we are very excited about the restructuring of our distribution channels for business, with Amex GBT as well as joint contracting with American Airlines. But the tech sector still has a ways to go to recover. And so we look forward to seeing that happen.\nJamie Baker: Okay. And second and bear with me, it\u2019s a bit of a throwback. I remember pre-bankruptcy American used to say, if we had Continentals pilot contract, our earnings, would\u2019ve been, whatever X, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019ve run the pay rates from the American and United TAs through your model. I\u2019m not suggesting the work rules in those TAs would be applicable for Alaska, but if you simply ran the MAX wage rates through your earnings model, what\u2019s the impact on margins or ex-fuel CASM, if you\u2019ve done the analysis?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Hey, Jamie, it\u2019s Shane. Thanks for the question. We obviously are aware of sort of movements at other properties when it comes to this; we are at the table regularly almost weekly with our pilots. We\u2019re looking forward to getting a TA with them as soon as we can. Yes, we understand the economic impact on the business and it\u2019s totally fine. Our employees across the both companies need to be at market. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re ultimately going to take folks. I\u2019m not going to share anything about the impact, because that sort of gets into like guidance that we haven\u2019t provided, but we\u2019re well aware of what it will mean in terms of the cost structure of the business.\nJamie Baker: Okay. It\u2019s worth a shot. Thanks everybody.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Didora [Bank of America/Merrill Lynch]. Your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Hey, good morning, everyone. Shane, Ben, two quick questions on cost here. One more housekeeping. Just what was the fuel hedge benefit in 2Q and what is implied in your 3Q fuel guide? And then just on 2023 potential CASM, if you\u2019re on track for being basically, well fully staffed next year, if your capacity is up, say 10% in 2023 versus 2019, kind of where do you think CASMex shakes out in that type of scenario?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. I hope Nat take the fuel hedge, and then I\u2019ll follow back with the CASM question.\nNat Pieper: Hey Andrew. The 2Q impact on our, with our hedge book is about $90 million. And then for third quarter, it\u2019s about $50. And again, that\u2019s based on, we snap the curve on the 18th. So on Monday.\nAndrew Didora: Great. \nShane Tackett: Yes. And on CASM into sort of next year. And we\u2019re not going to talk a lot about like potential growth rates next year. I think it\u2019s, we\u2019re still in the middle of trying to plan for that. But as I mentioned in the script, the real pressure areas are wages and then productivity we\u2019re carrying the same amount of FTs are maybe slightly more today than we had in 2019, but we\u2019re a smaller company. And so there\u2019s a lot of opportunity as we move forward to recover sort of more traditional productivity levels which will help us. I think Andrew, the big structural change is likely to be labor costs and wages across the industry. It\u2019s not unique to us and we\u2019ll participate in that. And so, that will probably be the headwind into next year. Certainly we\u2019re flying less capacity today than we had prepared for and have costs for. And I think in 2022, it\u2019s sort of a one for one exchange, had we flown 1% more ASMs. We would\u2019ve seen 1% lower unit costs give or take on the margin. So just to give you some flavor of, where we had anticipated, we could be in terms of capacity versus what the practical reality of what we can fly is right now.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. So then second question just for Andrew, you mentioned a little bit, on the corporate booking side, maybe your tech exposure is, might be hurting you a little bit there. And I guess, if I\u2019m doing my math correct this morning, it looks like kind of your 4Q revenue growth might decel [ph] a little bit from 3Q to hit your margin outlook. So yes, with all that you said, and what\u2019s going on in the macro, kind of just, how are you thinking about kind of, the demand trajectory from here between, across your network and then sort of your thoughts about broken down between corporate and leisure? Thanks.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think again, Q2 had a very, very strong run up, RASM was up 15 in April, 25 in May and 35 in June. And I think we\u2019ve sort of flattened out again as we\u2019re nearly done with July and I\u2019m looking at August is very, very strong. And even September as we sit here today. We are very pleased with what we see coming in. I think corporate, they\u2019re a little bit choppy, but I think we\u2019ve seen good strength there relatively speaking. And so again, where I sit today, demand and pricing environment, we still very, very good about the third quarter. And that\u2019s what reflected in our guide.\nShane Tackett: And Andrew, I might just say, because I know you\u2019re sort of inferring the pretax guide reiteration. I think we don\u2019t know exactly what will happen with revenues in Q4 and it wouldn\u2019t be prudent to assume that what we just experienced in July is the new normal. And so we\u2019re just sort of being thoughtful about how we look at the rest of the year, but hopefully demand stays stay super robust and we can outperform those.\nAndrew Didora: Yes. That\u2019s perfect. Thanks so much.\nShane Tackett: Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Mike Lindenberg [Deutsche Bank].\nMike Lindenberg: Oh, yes. Hey good morning, everyone. Andrew, I want to get back to just these, significant yield increases. I sort of think back, in years past when the demand environment was strong, we\u2019d see lots of fair increases. The industry would put through and there\u2019d be good successes. And I, my sense is that we really haven\u2019t seen, meaningful increases. It seems like it\u2019s a lot more about, just harnessing the power of, call it next generation revenue management systems and maybe distribution changes in how people purchase tickets and buying them off of their phones. And the impulse buys, you know, that\u2019s driving it as well. And I\u2019m just curious, if there is, maybe structurally changes in how, airlines are able to revenue manage up, right. Rather than just, across the board fair increases that we read about, where everybody moves $5 and $10 because demand is strong. Has there been a structural change there, or just anything that you can kind of tell us on how things have evolved and maybe this is sort of a pandemic, consequence your thoughts on that.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, that\u2019s a very interesting question. The thing that come to mind are two things excuse me. Yes, we\u2019ve seen, pricing increases here or there, but I think, the team is leveraged heavily on inventory, bucket closure and being very, very active with that. I think secondly just to be frank, the one good thing about the pandemic is we are way more dialed in and way more granular on how we manage revenues every single day versus the weekly or whatever, because the volatility and revenue over the last two years has given us muscles and skills that quite frankly were there, but we didn\u2019t use.  So I think with the new pricing and inventory management systems with the volatility index for our teams, looking at things way more closely, I think you\u2019re seeing better performance, better connection to the demand in the marketplace. So, I think those are all good things.\nMike Lindenberg: Okay, great. And then just the second question, and Ben, maybe this is to you, given your exposure in California, relative to your system, I\u2019m curious about maybe any initial thoughts about that state court ruling as it pertains to duty times, and rest requirements for flight attendants. And again, historically I always thought the Deregulation Act sort of meant that federal rule would trumps state rule and you\u2019re kind of opening up a Pandora\u2019s box. It looks like at least for now it\u2019s prevailing. Any thoughts on that, and I guess, the dust hasn\u2019t yet settled, but potential impacts and unintended consequences maybe initial take? Thanks. Thanks for answering my questions.\nBen Minicucci: Hey yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes. I think we\u2019re going slow on that Mike, and we\u2019re going to see how we head towards compliance on that and so we\u2019ll take that step by step. And Kyle, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add on that. I know you\u2019ve been working it.\nKyle Levine: Yes. Thanks Mike. Hey, you\u2019re preaching to the choir about the Deregulation Act. We had the same hope as you; The Supreme Court didn\u2019t see it that way. So our legal options are up and as Ben mentioned, we need to figure out what happens next.\nOperator: And we have a question from Duane Pfennigwerth [Evercore ISI]. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. As you look at your plan, and your recovery trajectory and your competitor\u2019s plans, when do you think, assuming a stable macro like, when do you think supply catches back up with demand? It certainly doesn\u2019t feel like the third quarter. You\u2019ve already gotten a couple questions about the fourth quarter, and my guess is that\u2019s just a plug at this point, but as you just think, supply demand and stable macro, when is the earliest shot at sort of supply catching back up with demand?\nBen Minicucci: Duane for us at Alaska, right now, what we\u2019re focused on is getting our single fleet transition done. And I think what we\u2019re trying to do is, set ourselves up for 2023 and beyond. So that is job one for us, both on the mainline side and the regional side. We want to be really well configured heading into 2023. We talked about some headwinds in the economy. So, we\u2019re not sure right now we\u2019re really happy with demand and yields, but we really want to configure our company to withstand whatever external shocks are out there. But also set ourselves up for growth. So once we get to single fleet, then the opportunity for growth is going to be there for us. And so that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. It was a bit of\u2026\nShane Tackett: Duane, I would just, I would just add, I think it all depends on how much demand is, is it 120% of normal today in capacity is negative 10%. It\u2019s probably several quarters before it catches up. If it\u2019s a 100% sort of normal demand in 2019 demand and for negative 10% capacity, it\u2019s probably a couple quarters. So it seems like it\u2019s to the right before we sort of fully catch up assuming a stable economic backdrop.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes. And then just could you comment a little bit on Hawaii? The level of recovery that you\u2019ve seen there what the booking curve looks like and maybe just the competitive environment, what level of industry capacity has been restored there? Thank you for taking the questions.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, Duane, I think Hawaii, while we don\u2019t specifically talk a huge amount about regions. We feel very good about how we\u2019ve constructed that obviously the industry has pumped more seats into that marketplace. So relatively speaking, there\u2019s some headwinds there, but I\u2019ll also say, as I said, in my prepared remarks, our premium cabin is off the chart in performance. And Hawaii is one place where our premium cabin is really performing, and helping mitigate some of those supply issues. So, overall very full airplanes, great demand and business as usual for now.\nOperator: Our next question is from Helane Becker [Cowen]. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi everybody. And thank you for the time. So, two questions. One is with respect to Horizon Air, you own that company. And you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing issues with your regional providers as most other airlines are as well. So, how should we think about Horizon\u2019s future over the next phase? I don\u2019t know, one year to three years given the constraints that regional airlines have?\nBen Minicucci: Hey, Helane, it\u2019s Ben. Hey, thanks for the question. It\u2019s a great question. Well, first, what I\u2019ll say is, our regional network is critical to our success. So, all the Pacific Northwest markets we serve are just integral to our entire domestic network. So one it\u2019s needed and required. I think, secondly, there\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s a pilot shortage in the industry and where you see it is in the regional industry. It\u2019s down, like I said, 20% to 30%. So, we\u2019re working again, this path to single fleet for us is one of our strategies to really try and mitigate that. And we\u2019ve got a lot of plans with pipelines and pathways to mitigate, the pilot shortage on the regionals. But we\u2019re working on it. And I think honestly, Helane, this thing is going to evolve. It continues to evolve every quarter with changes in the industry and we\u2019re going to stay close to it. Joe, did you want to add anything?\nJoe Sprague: No, I think, Helane, this is Joe with Horizon. There is some optimism. We have a new fleet order for Horizon that was announced earlier this week. And we\u2019re excited about the timing of those deliveries over the next four years, that in addition to the Q400s going away, which will make us smaller in the near term, it allows us to sort of rebuild our fleet size alongside sort of in tandem with rebuilding our pilot staffing capability over the next few years. And there is a lot of interest in becoming an airline pilot. There\u2019s never been a better time in history to become an airline pilot. We\u2019re seeing that interest at both Horizon and Alaska with the strong applicant pool and some things that we\u2019re doing at the sort of the top end of the funnel to encourage people to come in into the industry. And there definitely is interest.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s good to hear. And then my other question, my follow up question has to do with like the decline, and I don\u2019t know, maybe Andrew, this is for you. Airline traffic tends to be good until it\u2019s not good. And I\u2019m just wondering, like, when would you see a decline in bookings related to an economic slowdown? When would that start to manifest itself?\nAndrew Harrison: Why, as you know, Helane, we look at this, every day, I think, sometimes it can get confusing here, because demand is obviously is really a big part of pricing as well. I mean, just to be clear. And so demand right now, as I\u2019ve shared is very strong at very high yield increases over 2019. So, I think the first thing we\u2019ll see is, maybe a slowdown in demand if, and when it comes and then we\u2019ll start to obviously play with the yield levers. But there is a lot of room to go before we really come down and reach the floors of 2019. So, I would say as of today and this business changes we\u2019re still seeing relatively good strong position and even our held yields in September are well into the high-20s as we sit here today.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s great color. Thanks, Andrew. Thanks everybody.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Savi Syth [Raymond James]. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning, everyone. First off, I wonder if I could just clarify a previous answer on the 2023 potential. I know at Investor Day, I think you mentioned 2023 could be up 9% capacity type of outlook. Not that you gave specific guidance, but I\u2019m curious given, the moves that you made here in the second half, and just kind of building in this caution and you have this transition going on, and the early part, what could be kind of a realistic range for 2023? Or what do you think you can deliver in terms of capacity for 2023, demand pending obviously?\nShane Tackett: Hey, Savi, its Shane, one thing that we\u2019ve all learned over the last two years is most of our ability to forecast what\u2019s going to happen is not very \u2013 not as good as it used to be pre-pandemic. So take some of this with a grain of salt. I think the two things that are going to be sort of critical, absent, whatever the economy is doing is just our fleet transition. Ben mentioned that we\u2019re totally committed to that. Our ability to get replacement aircraft is sort of quickly from our supplier, and then just our ability to produce the right number of pilots and other staff for the operation. So, I think if anything, we\u2019re going to be a little more conservative until we have several quarters under our belt of really good operational reliability really good staffing levels. I just think, over the last year or two, we\u2019ve sort of assumed everything was going to work exactly as originally planned. And we\u2019ve just, that was probably a two aggressive set of assumptions. So, I think in terms of aircraft units we\u2019re going to have enough planes ultimately to grow quite a bit next year. I think what we decide to do with those is still up in the air and that\u2019s a discussion we\u2019re going to be having over the next couple of months internally. And obviously we know folks are interested in, and we\u2019ll say more as we get clarity on what our 2023 growth plans are. But they\u2019re probably somewhat moderated from what we were talking about at Investor Day.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Shane. And somewhat related one of basically, there\u2019s a regional airlines that are in house is one of your competitors, you\u2019ve got pretty big pay increases. And I know as you pointed out the regional capacity at Alaska is down quite a bit, and you\u2019re doing a fleet transition there as well, that\u2019s kind of bringing that regional fleet down. I was just kind of curious, if Horizon and I had to match some of those rates. What does that mean for kind of regional lift economics from a longer-term perspective, because it\u2019s pretty much going where you\u2019re \u2013 you can almost fly these with the mainline pilot?\nJoe Sprague: Yes, Savi, it\u2019s Joe again. I think no question there\u2019s cost pressure for regional airline pilots. The American deal certainly stood out. I think there\u2019s a lot of folks sort of watching to see what else transpires. We are working with our pilots to find some ways to improve retention at Horizon. But it\u2019s definitely a changing dynamic for the industry right now. And I bet Shane having some additional thoughts.\nShane Tackett: Yes. And I \u2013 number one, I just a shout out to Joe, he\u2019s done a phenomenal job leading Horizon. Savi, you may \u2013 you\u2019ve been with us a long time. We actually had spent a lot of time repairing the regional business model pre-pandemic. We had gotten it back to be a profitable contributor to the whole. So it\u2019s just the reality that it\u2019s going a different direction. The costs of operating regionals are going to go up. In terms of what that means for a long-term strategy, I think it\u2019s way too early to sort of tell or to share anything. What I will just reiterate is what Ben said, that the \u2013 we have a large part of our network that requires regional lift. We\u2019re committed to those communities. We have not exited a community yet. We don\u2019t want to, and so that aircraft E175 fits really well within our network whole, and we see a future for them. And we\u2019re just going to have to figure out once we understand where everything ends up in terms of costs, how to make that a reasonable part of our network from economic standpoint.\nSavi Syth: Helpful. Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Savi.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan McKenzie. [Seaport Global] Your line is open.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. So my question is sort of similar to Savi\u2019s. It\u2019s really a flex sub flex down question on supply next year. And I\u2019m just curious, what percent of the fleet is fully paid for? Or if you\u2019re looking to flex on supply is the easier move simply to accelerate Airbus retirements. And I guess I\u2019m just trying to get some sense of the ability to flex down flex up under sort of a tougher economic backdrop?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Dan, a couple things, some color give or take, I think Q4 Airbus capacity is about 8% of total Air Group capacity. Half of that is the A320 fleet that we\u2019re drawing down. And the remainder is A321 fleet, which will be with us next year. It\u2019s about 4% of capacity. You could potentially move to retire that more quickly. And that\u2019s roughly the amount of ASMs you\u2019d be talking about. I think the flex up thing, that\u2019s really a utilization question. And it gets back to how much sort of stress we want to put into the operation. And as I said, a couple questions ago, I think we were too aggressive in the spring. We\u2019re going to be a little more conservative for the next several quarters. So I would suspect we work the utilization level a little more next year, but not try to maximize it. So there\u2019s \u2013 I think there\u2019s a pretty tight range of capacity that we\u2019re going to end up in next year.\nNat Pieper: Hey, Dan, it\u2019s Nat. One other point too, just on your question, aircraft paid for unencumbered, et cetera. We\u2019ve got large part 60, 65 airplanes that are fully paid for, should capacity really go south because of the economy, et cetera. We could pull aircraft down with no problem at all and not have to pay leases on that, on any of those fully depreciated and owned.\nDan McKenzie: Yes, well. Thanks guys. Next question here. I know Seattle is solid. I can see the competitive dynamic in that market. And just following up on an earlier question, on Hawaii and inter-California, the pre-tax margin outlook is really solid. But in the back of my mind, I\u2019m thinking that you have a couple entities here that are still a drag on the system margin. So I\u2019m just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on some of these entities?\nBen Minicucci: Yes, Dan, I think in generally what you\u2019ve seen us do is obviously bring back capacity, the quickest and the fastest to Seattle, and obviously exceeds. As far as the rest of our network and I presume you\u2019re alluding to California. I think again the good news there is that our capacity has been down significantly and we are working to sort of bring that back. We have new corporate deals. We have new credit card programs. We have our Vice President in the bay area now who\u2019s full time job. It is to make sure other parts of our network continue to get better. So we feel very good. We think there\u2019s sort of only up from where we\u2019ve been just to be quite frank as we continue to work it. The last thing I will mention, just because it\u2019s becoming a theme here. I think for me personally, what 2022 has taught me is the best economic driver for Alaska Air Group, its loyalty and its guest is to set a financial plan and capacity and hit it. The amount of economic frustration and guest frustration when you set the plans and don\u2019t do it is very, very large. So I think that\u2019s why we feel very confident that whatever we grow next year that we will hit it and we will execute extremely well. And that\u2019ll be the best cost and revenue adds up for Air Group.\nDan McKenzie: Thanks guys. Great job.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Stathoulopoulos. [Susquehanna Financial Group] Your line is open.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So Shane, the 4% to 8% targeted growth through 2025, you outlined a few months ago. In light of everything that\u2019s happening right now, operational issues for the industry, labor tightness, likely economics slow down, does the 10% in the new market still makes sense or the 70% from frequency and as peers, as you know are taking down out your capacity guides, but the moving parts at least for me still are a bit murky. So any color on what\u2019s moving or what could move around with respect to that four buckets of growth you outlined up a few months ago? Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Yes, no, I think \u2013 thanks, Chris. I think, yes, the idea of \u2013 and I\u2019m not saying we wouldn\u2019t get into new markets. But obviously we\u2019re most focused on recovering the pre-pandemic network, even though it\u2019s been reshaped, but getting our California network backup or network back. Those are going to remain the priorities. That\u2019s where the incremental capacity from here forward will go. And if there\u2019s a smart market opportunity in there that\u2019s new, we\u2019ll definitely take advantage of it, but a little bit less biased towards doing that as we grow at a slower rate than we had anticipated.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And as follow-up, so as we think about exit rates for CASMex and your pretax margins for this year if you can, how are you thinking about volumes and yields here? Are you waiting the ladder more heavily as you plan for 2023? Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Sorry, Chris. That was on CASMex exit rate.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Yes. Well, it\u2019s just we think about the CASMex, we have a CASMex guide. We have your pretax margin guide. I think a lot of investors here are looking at exit rates and the setup for next year and the extent, how are you thinking about the weight or the split between volume and yields? What are you emphasizing here in your projections? Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Got you. Yes. In terms of like the pretax sort of, yes. I think what we\u2019ll see and what we anticipate we\u2019re going to fly marginally more capacity in Q3 relative to Q2. And then I think Q4, it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s an implied guide out there based on our full year, but it\u2019s still a little bit up in the air based on the economy and ultimately the Airbus and Q400 draw down. And I think those are going to be meaningful sort of determinants of how we exit the year on CASMex. As I had said before, I think there\u2019s kind of a one to one relationship right now. If we can fly the capacity we\u2019ll \u2013 one point of capacity should equal something like a point to reduced CASMex. I think, right now, as it stands here today, our plan is to hit all of those guides that we set forth. And it would take a pretty dramatic economic and demand turnaround for us to think differently about that right now. Because we\u2019re still smaller than we were in 2019 and we think demand is higher than 2019. So I just think right now, there\u2019s not a lot of bias to try to take further capacity down in Q4. We\u2019re going to go and execute what we\u2019ve just shared in terms of guidance.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Scott Group. [Wolfe Research] Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I\u2019ll just keep it to one. Shane, you talked about some puts and takes for CASMex next year. Just directionally would you think that CASMex is up or down in 2023 versus 2022?\nShane Tackett: I think assuming we get labor deals done that it very likely could be up.\nScott Group: Versus 2022?\nShane Tackett: I was thinking versus 2019 \u2013 versus 2022. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s probably, it\u2019s going to be highly levered against the growth rate, but there\u2019s a chance it could be up. And I do anticipate us getting labor deals done. We\u2019re not sharing sort of guidance around that, but our hope is that they are not in our cost base next year.\nScott Group: Okay. All right. Thank you guys.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Scott.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Scott. And thank you everyone for joining us and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for attending."}, {"symbol": "ALK", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-04-21 15:29:04", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Charlie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group's 2022 First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Vice President of Finance, Emily Halverson.\nEmily Halverson: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Thank you for joining us for our First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, which is available at investor.alaskaair.com. On today's call, you'll hear updates from Ben, Andrew and Shane. Several others of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. This morning, Air Group reported a first quarter GAAP net loss of $143 million. Excluding special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Air Group reported an adjusted net loss of $167 million. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements about future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release. Over to you, Ben.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Emily, and good morning, everyone. Despite a slow start to the year in January and February, March results were very strong. In March, we recorded Air Group's highest ever cash sales, 13% above our prior best month. And for the first time since the pandemic began, March revenues exceeded their 2019 comp. This was driven by strength in both leisure and business demand with leisure currently more than 100% recovered, and business demand now at 70% of 2019. As demand strength has carried into the second quarter and throughout the summer, we issued guidance today indicating that we expect to deliver double-digit percentage increases in both unit revenues and yields versus 2019. And the second quarter guidance reflects line of sight to double-digit pretax margin for the quarter. Given we expect to deliver profits in Q2 and for the remainder of the year, we are reiterating our full year pretax margin guidance of 6% to 9% for 2022, even with the higher fuel prices we are experiencing today. To provide more context about our expectations, I want to speak to you today about 3 topics: what Air Group is doing well, where we are experiencing challenges, and why our team is optimistic about our future. I'll start with what we're doing well.  While scaling capacity back rapidly has proved challenging, I'm proud of all the work being done at the company today. Our people have persevered through a lot these past 2 years. Every day, I ask our people to focus on what we can control, and where we need to do better. But I also want to say thank you to every one of our employees, from leaders to our front line. It is because of their hard work that Alaska was recognized as the 2022 Airline of the Year by Air Transport World. It's an incredible affirmation of the hard work and results this team has produced in a very challenging environment. We are also progressing on many aspects of our long-term strategy extremely well, including our oneworld and West Coast International Alliance partnerships that continue to strengthen and provide more value to our guests and to our results. Our new long-term materially enhanced co-brand agreement with our partner, Bank of America, being recognized as one of the 100 Most Influential Companies by Time Magazine for our climate efforts underscored by our commitment to net-zero by 2040. Returning our balance sheet to within our target leverage range and continuing to post financial results that we believe will lead the industry this year. And as we discussed extensively at Investor Day in late March, positioning Alaska to outperform the industry over the next several years given our cost profile and tangible commercial road map to grow revenue by $400 million. Moving on to where we are experiencing challenges. We have faced more operational disruptions than is acceptable as we scale our business back with the primary issue being staffing levels. We have been successful attracting new people to Alaska. We have hired 2,600 employees to date in 2022 with many of our work groups progressing as we expected against staffing plans. However, throughput in our pilot training department fell short of our plan at the end of the quarter, and our teams are now working to accelerate throughput and to get us back on track for the year. For this reason, coupled with our commitment to accelerate the exit of the Airbus 320 fleet, plus persistent high oil prices, we have reduced our planned capacity growth by a modest amount in the short term, and now expect full year capacity to be flat to down 3% versus 2019. Alaska at its core is a company that is rooted in operational excellence and the productive and efficient use of our resources. Returning to our historic levels of excellence in these areas is the primary focus of our teams going forward. Despite these challenges, I have full confidence that we have a phenomenal future ahead of us because of our people, our culture and our business model. The key elements are now in place to build a solid foundation to profitable growth. We have deepened our expansive network and global connections from the West Coast. We've reshaped our network over the past few years, seizing profitable flying opportunities as the pandemic shifted the competitive landscape. We are deepening the spokes of our network with efficient, low-risk growth primarily in existing markets. And we continue to build our global presence via oneworld benefiting from international recovery as our global partners launch new nonstop flights and restart service. We have accelerated our move to single fleet to drive cost savings and operational efficiency. This week, we welcomed our 20th MAX aircraft into the fleet. Last month, we announced plans to retire our Q400 aircraft and move our regional operation to a single fleet of modern E175 regional jets. The economics are clear and compelling and executing the strategy as quickly as possible is a top priority. We're leveraging our compelling product, brand and powerful loyalty program to strengthen our performance. Our renewed credit card agreement with Bank of America expands the value of our program and speaks to the incredible partnership we have and the potential to grow the program further. Finally, we're delivering on our resilient business model supported by our competitive advantages, including a low-cost, high productivity mindset, operational excellence and a remarkable service and culture of care. We have a track record of delivering industry-leading pretax margins. On top of this, we have restored our balance sheet to pre-pandemic strength, and continue to focus on our commitment to sustainability. Together, our business model and the initiatives we have undertaken will enhance our ability to produce superior results even in volatile times. As we navigate the remainder of the year, I've asked my team to prioritize 3 critical work streams. First, to pursue our transition to a single mainline fleet by no later than early 2023. We know and understand the benefits this brings for our company and the faster we get there, the better. Second, to deliver on the $400 million in commercial initiatives we outlined at Investor Day. And third, to return Air Group to operational excellence for our people and guests. Air Group has done well over 90 years because we are committed to learning from and adapting to our ever-changing environment. It is no small feat that we grew our airline 32% over the same period in 2021, and we have the ability to deliver future growth plans with our commitment to excellence. We will adjust our plans where needed to ensure safety, quality and our long-term success, while also meeting our financial commitments in the near term, including our 6% to 9% pretax margin this year. I'm very excited for the bright future we have ahead of us. And with that, I'll turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide a recap of our Q1 results and trends with a specific focus on March, which is indicative of what we see going forward. I'll also touch on our Q2 guidance along with longer-term commercial drivers. Total first quarter revenues came in at $1.7 billion. That's nearly $1 billion more than the first quarter of last year and down just 10% versus the same period in 2019 on 11% less capacity. This marks continued sequential improvement in our revenues, up 5 points from the fourth quarter of last year. That said, the most exciting aspect of Q1 was just how remarkable the return in demand has been from February. We went from bookings down 40% versus 2019 in early January to above 2019 levels by the end of February. We have now settled into booking levels in line with our capacity, but at very strong yields. Our load factors followed this booking trend and continue to strengthen as case counts declined and people returned to travel. January's load factor was 69%, February improved to 75% and March came in at over 85%. That's 1 point stronger than 2019. This positive progression contributed to our March revenues exceeding 2019 levels by 1.5%, even though capacity was down 8% versus 2019. Let me give you 3 main contributors to these results. First, the return in corporate demand. We've continued to see strength in leisure demand, but overall demand has also been buoyed by the return of business travel. Corporate travel has been improving at a rate of 2 to 3 points for some time now. And today, we are down just 30% in corporate bookings when compared to 2019. Strong yields. In the first quarter, yield was up 3.5% versus 2019, but March was up 9%. We expect to continue to see yields improve through Q2 as spring break travel hits in full, strong summer bookings maintain their trajectory, and corporate travel continues to recover. And our premium product outperformance. Q1 was another strong premium product quarter, but March was exceptional. First-class revenues were up 19%, with paid load up 15 points versus 2019. And for the first time ever, our regional fleet fluids paid first-class load factor on par with mainline with a 22-point improvement from 2019. Additionally, premium class revenues across our network were up 8.6% with paid load up 9.7 points. Moving to Q2 guidance. With the continuation of strong bookings, I'm confident in our Q2 capacity setup and planned return to growth in the back half of the year. In Q2, we expect total revenues to be up 5% to 8% on capacity that will be down 6% to 9% versus 2019, resulting, as Ben said, in double-digit yields, double-digit unit revenues and double-digit pretax margins for the quarter. While I've shared our near-term outlook and what sets us up to produce solid financial results this year, more importantly, Air Group is configured to grow profitably over the longer term, driven by revenue initiatives. As outlined at Investor Day, we have identified $400 million in incremental revenue that will build through 2025, driven by 3 categories: product and loyalty, fleet and network. First, product and loyalty. This represents $195 million, driven primarily by our renewed credit card deal with Bank of America. Our loyalty program continues to be a very strong performer with cash remuneration from the bank up 34% versus first quarter of 2019. This new agreement offers a powerful source of continued cash flow growth, and I expect it will remain a resilient revenue source as we continue to grow the airline. Second, fleet accounts for about $70 million of the $400 million, representing the revenue opportunity from up-gauging and incremental premium mix. Demand for premium products has outperformed throughout the recovery. And with our longer average stage length than all of our major competitors, our increasing premium mix will be well suited for our network as well as our financial performance. And then finally, network and alliances. That will drive about $135 million in incremental revenue. Our growth will be highly efficient over the next few years, 90%, which will be driven by frequency, gauge and stage length in existing markets. With the Pacific Northwest restored to 2019 levels of flying and California to be restored by year's end, we have the full breadth of our network back in play. Now we can prioritize building depth across our network with 70% of growth in the Pacific Northwest and 30% in California. We are focused on lower risk growth, competing where we can win and adding value to our network. Building on our own network, our alliance partnerships exponentially expand our reach and enable seamless global travel for our guests, which in turn only further strengthens the value proposition of our loyalty program. As business and international travel return, we are set to leverage our West Coast hubs as gateways to the rest of the world. This global access for our guests only continues to grow as partners add new and returning service off the West Coast, such as Seattle-Helsinki, Portland-London and San Francisco-Madrid. As Seattle continues to grow as a destination and gateway, we're excited to begin the first phase of our terminal transformation this spring. The renovations will modernize the guest experience and double capacity throughput, making it a more smooth and seamless experience. What I hope you take away and what I am most excited about for the future is that the foundation for profitable growth is in place for Alaska, and we are well positioned to capitalize on the return of travel demand. And with that, I'll pass it to Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. While losses are not ever the goal, the $167 million adjusted net loss for the quarter was a reasonable result given the Omicron backdrop we operated in. We are, of course, encouraged by our financial performance in the month of March where we turn to profit and by the strength of demand we are seeing this spring and summer. As you heard from both Ben and Andrew, we expect Q2 to perform at double-digit pretax margins and have reiterated our full year margin range of 6% to 9% even with higher oil prices. So while we will be focused on restoring operational excellence and ensuring our teams have the resources they need to do so, I remain excited about our position in the industry and about the initiatives we are executing on to set ourselves up for strong performance over the long term. Let me start with the near-term focus we are placing on ensuring we have the required staffing to run a more reliable operation. Our teams have done a solid job delivering absolute costs in line with our plans and targets, and our people have been resilient and consistently delivered care to our guests. However, we have been challenged in stepping up capacity as quickly as we would like to. As Ben mentioned, we've reduced our full year capacity by approximately 3.5 points at the midpoint to flat to down 3% versus 2019. This is primarily driven by staffing that is short of our plan, and simply put, we are going to fix that problem before we kick growth into a higher gear. Our CASMex guidance directly reflects this capacity change, and we now expect full year CASMex to be up 6% to 8%. For the second quarter, CASMex is expected to be up 16% to 19% on capacity down 6% to 9% versus 2019. The reduction in capacity adds approximately 8 points to CASMex in the quarter. Also, we expect fuel prices for the second quarter to be between $3.25 and $3.30 per gallon, up 40% from the beginning of the year, inclusive of hedge benefits. At current prices, our hedging program is expected to provide a net benefit of approximately $200 million for the full year. Reflecting on Q1, we were profitable in March and produced first quarter results in line with our guidance. Our nonfuel costs totaled $1.5 billion, inclusive of approximately $35 million in lease return costs and $36 million in incentive pay accruals for our employees. Beginning in Q2, lease return costs will be reflected as special as we accelerate our fleet transition. CASMex was up 17% versus first quarter 2019, coming in slightly better than our latest guide. Our balance sheet and liquidity remained healthy, and we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in total liquidity, inclusive of on-hand cash and undrawn lines of credit. Our Q1 cash flows from operations were approximately $285 million, driven by the strong booking trends that began in February. We continue to feel comfortable with our liquidity position and our ability to generate positive cash flows on a sustained basis as our business returns to normal, which together will support cash payments for the 55 mainline aircraft deliveries we have scheduled through 2023. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-cap ratio of 50% within our target range and among the best in the industry. For the rest of 2022, our contractual debt repayments are roughly $200 million, with $52 million due in the second quarter. We expect our debt-to-cap to decline within our target range over the remainder of the year. During our Investor Day in late March, we guided full year pretax margins to between 6% and 9%. And as we've indicated, we are not changing this expectation today. Demand has remained strong. Our capacity modifications will be focused on our least profitable flying. And with oil prices where they are currently, capacity reductions can drive better margins in the near term even though they pressure near-term unit costs. Our profit guidance also includes expected continued accruals towards incentive bonuses for our employees. This year, we have returned our performance-based pay program focus back to the achievement of profitability goals, a shift from the focus on cash flow generation in 2021. This year, 70% of our bonus program will be tied to pretax profitability, while 30% remains linked to other important goals, including ESG, safety and unit costs. We've also built-in goals related to outperforming the industry on pretax margin, which is ultimately what we are focused on achieving over the long term. And over the long term, I believe we have the right structure and business model in place. We have a strong balance sheet. We have a solid fleet plan and fleet order with Boeing. Our network position has improved coming out of the pandemic, and our growth will be primarily focused in geographies of strength. We have a solid $400 million commercial road map that is already in motion with the recently signed co-brand agreement extension and with the fleet up-gauging, which is underway. And we have line of sight to improving unit costs relative to the industry. It is this combination of initiatives that should enable us to continue to improve our relative position versus industry peers as we progress through the next few years. And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first caller is Jamie Baker of JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: So recognizing that the government has gotten involved in the past when the industry has required some form of assistance. Is that something that we should start thinking about vis-a-vis the pilot shortage? I'm thinking about the 1,500-hour rule. Maybe making, I don't know, low-cost government loans available for flight school. Like I guess another way of asking the question is whether you think the pilot shortage is severe enough or will become severe enough that the solution may not entirely be in the hands of the industry. You might need some outside help, if you will.\nBen Minicucci: Jamie, that's a great question. One person has just been doing a lot of work for us is Joe Sprague on the regional side. As you know, that's how you first see the fax open up. So Joe, do you want to jump in here?\nJoe Sprague: Jamie, it's Joe. It's an interesting question and certainly, there's a few issues hitting the entire industry right now more strongly than the pilot situation. The trade groups in D.C. have been focused on how we can boost financial aid for new student starts for flight training. That's an important piece at the very beginning of the pipeline and something that will help not only produce a greater supply of pilots, but help with improving the diversity of the pilot workforce as well. So we're certainly supportive of those efforts. Beyond that, it is something that will take a bit of time, but there's really strong training programs in place at Horizon in Alaska, and we feel comfortable about being able to produce pilots over the next several months and several years.\nBen Minicucci: Jamie, we have a pilot development program that -- we have 500 pilots in that program right now that have signed up with some financial assistance. We've teamed up with a school in Hillsboro, Oregon, that's going to train 200 pilots a year for Horizon with pathways. So I think your question is there could be an industry initiative that addresses some structural things. And I think as you're seeing is all airlines are taking destiny in their own hands to create a pipeline into their regional and mainline fleets, but you bring up a great point. I think this is going to be one of the biggest constraints for the industry going forward.\nJamie Baker: Interesting. All right. And second, just on the premium emphasis at Alaska, 1 question I get from clients is whether you're inadvertently creating a vacuum that ultra low-cost carriers can backfill. I certainly have my own answer to that question. But how would you answer that, if posed by a current shareholder?\nAndrew Harrison: Jamie, I couldn't quite catch the first word in there that was quite important to your question. What did you -- what was your first sentence?\nJamie Baker: Yes. Sorry about that. The premium strategy, chasing premium demand, which is something Alaska clearly is doing, does that create a vacancy sign, if you will, in markets for ultra low-cost carriers to backfill, which in turn potentially hurts you down the road, possibly? I have my own views on this topic, but it's a question that I gotten quite a bit as it relates to your premium strategy, how do you respond to the question?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. It's -- what's interesting about that is, I think, just to be clear, we're seeing -- obviously, the premium cabin has upgrades in it as well. I think as we grow the fleet, we're seeing demand for the premium cabin to be sure with people paying to get in there. But we're also seeing strong demand for our saver or basic fare structure. And as we shared on Investor Day, we are very focused on having a cabin that is -- works for our premium flyers, our regular flyers and those who want to be discount fliers. So I think as we up-gauge the fleet, as we grow the fleet, we're going to create more seats, more room. So I think it's a great question, but I think that's why I love our fleet strategy and our product strategy.\nOperator: Your next caller is Helane Becker of Cowen.\nHelane Becker: So just on -- I know you're talking about strong business travel. Can you parse that out by group and by geography? Like are you seeing improvements in California and on the West Coast, in general, California, specifically? And then in terms of like tech companies, are they coming back? Because I feel like they were the first to kind of work from home and seem to be the last to want to come back.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Thanks, Helane. It's actually quite fascinating to watch. And you're exactly right. I think the small, medium business is back to full strength, and they have been for a little bit. What I've literally seen in the last 2 weeks is a staggering increase in the increase in flying for the large tech companies. Some of the big ones have come back at the end of March and early April, where their traffic was down 80-plus percent. Just in the last week, one of the largest high-tech companies was only down 25%. So I think we're going to be a little lagged on Alaska on the West Coast because of the high tech, as you say, but I see that coming in quite strongly. So that's where we stand.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then my other question, maybe for Ben. You're talking about having to hire pilots and there's a huge pilot shortage, and we just heard United talk about their forecast for the industry having to hire 13,000 pilots, and our forecast is somewhere between actually 10,000 and 12,000 for the year. But it seems like -- why do people come to Alaska? Like what's your selling point to get pilots to come to Alaska Air versus American Delta or United, who are hiring at least 200 pilots a month each?\nBen Minicucci: Helane, it's a great question. I think this is -- with the pilot supply issue, I think pilots have a choice, and pilots will have a choice on what they want to fly and where they want to fly, so they have a choice. I think for us, we've always had a brand that's been differentiated in the industry, a brand where people come in, it's -- we're a bigger company, but we still have a small tight culture. And we're based on the West Coast, we fly all across the country. We have a great network. And so I do feel there's just a lot of appeal about who we are and how we operate. So I can tell you to date, our plan is to hire 600 mainline pilots and a couple of hundred regional pilots. We're on track on the regional side, which is fantastic. On the mainline side, we're halfway through. We've hired 300 net pilots so far this year. But it's a huge strain on our training systems, which is one of the issues that we're working through is how do we get pilots through the school house in an efficient manner and get them out on the line.\nOperator: Your next caller is Scott Group of Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So the guidance implies a pretty massive inflection in capacity growth relative second quarter and the second half of the year. So is that just the pilot situation getting better for you? Is that aircraft? And then maybe just talk about what you think the exit rate will be on capacity exiting the year and your confidence in getting there?\nShane Tackett: Scott, it's Shane. Thanks for the question. Yes, it does imply a pretty significant upturn in capacity and growth above 2019 in the back half of the year. I think it really does assume that we get back to where we want to be on the pilot throughput in the training house. The one thing I'll just say is we're committed to this exit of the Airbus fleet on a very expedited basis. And as we begin to do that, we may continue to move capacity around a bit. I don't think we have a strong appetite to, as an example, hire a new pilot onto the Airbus aircraft, have them fly it for 1 month and then put them back into training to transition. So as that comes into the window, we're just going to look to optimize the transition of that fleet off the business and over to the MAX. So there'll probably be some more changes. It's hard to predict what's going to happen in Q4 right now, but that's where we stand.\nScott Group: Okay. And then I wanted to just ask about the fuel hedges. I understand you hedge oil and not the track spreads. So at current jet prices, is this what we should assume -- the guidance you gave for second quarter, is this what we should assume for now, for the rest of the year if jet stays where it is right now? And do you reconsider the way you hedge to maybe do a better job covering track spreads?\nNatPieper: I'll take the second one first. It's Nat Pieper. Our hedge program is really consistent with the way we've run our company for 90 years, financially conservative, and frankly, it's auto pilot. As we talked about at Investor Day, buying calls 20% out of the money, 18 months in advance, 10% strips and just continuing to layer them on. As Shane mentioned in his script, we value the 2022 remaining order book at $200 million for a hedging benefit. It's basically 50% at $78 for the remainder of the year, 50% at $71 for the quarter.\nOperator: Your next caller is Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just with respect to your loyalty card extension, can you talk about how ratable that is versus amounts paid upfront? Oftentimes, when we see these things in the industry, there'll be kind of a heavy weighting in the first part of the agreement, maybe the first quarter or 2 and then it tails off. Can you talk about how this was designed and agreed to?\nShane Tackett: Duane, it's Shane. In terms of the cash, I think the cash you're going to see right away, I think that's something that we saw in the first quarter. We saw a very strong increase in cash from our bank partner. The recognition is going to be at a slower pace as you know, a good amount of this gets deferred and recognized over time. So I think through the P&L, you'll see this build throughout the rest of this year and even into next year as we get to start to recognize the cash that we're deferring today. So cash will come pretty quick, the recognition will take some more time.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Great. And then I guess just going back to your Investor Day, you were one of the first to really tease out this kind of more constructive revenue outlook for the year, certainly relative to where we were and where the Street was at that time. I wonder if you could just mark-to-market for us relative to Investor Day, what's changed since that time that has sort of further improved your forecast? What specifically has gotten better since Investor Day?\nAndrew Harrison: Duane, I think firstly, corporate business travel. I just think there was just a real step change over the last few weeks on that side. And as we've shared, certainly on the fairs side. Just to be frank, as we close up the buckets in the inventory, the demand didn't stop. And so the fares kept going up, but the demand kept coming. So I think since Investor Day, we've just seen a more sustained and, in fact, increasing strength in the demand as we book in now into summer and later spring break.\nOperator: Your next caller is Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Just a follow up on the corporate commentary and then the tech group coming back. So is it fair to say that much of the corporate normalization that you're seeing so far and what do you expect to see in the coming weeks and months is just a return of the kind of historical Alaska corporate customer? Or are you seeing new customers as well, kind of given the American Alliance and maybe new destinations and outreach?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Thanks, Ravi. I think a little bit of both, just to be frank, but they certainly knew our agreement with [ MX, TBT] as well as our joint contracting with American has opened up a lot of doors for us. And we'll get a clearer picture of that as we move forward into Q2 and Q3. And as we start to see the tech travel pick up more and more. But I do believe, and just seeing our fair share, our fair market share of corporate travel, just the reports I just was looking at last week, we're actually seeing a positive movement in our share gap. So I feel like that's good and that's sort of new traffic for us.\nRavi Shanker: Great. And just a follow-up, and I apologize if I missed this in your commentary. I know it's only been a few days, but are you seeing any uptick in interest in your forward booking curve now that the mass mandate has been dropped at least temporary or permanently?\nAndrew Harrison: It's very difficult for us to tell that. What I will tell you is that just even looking at yesterday's bookings that were even better than the day before. So I'm just still seeing very strong momentum here.\nOperator: Your next caller is Andrew Didora of Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: So maybe sticking on the corporate theme. We've been hearing from a few hotel owners that they're seeing sort of a change in the corporate booking curve, it's shortening pretty dramatically. Just curious kind of, Andrew, what you're seeing on the corporate side, I guess, particularly as maybe some more of these tech-heavy corporates come back on the road. Are you seeing any changes in the way they either book or they travel in the early parts of the recovery here?\nAndrew Harrison: The only sort of color I could give you there is that it just feels like there was this pent-up demand and then there's just been this material, as in 50-point change in booking levels for some of these big guys in the last few weeks. So I think what I'm seeing right now is a very big step change. And I think over the -- especially on the tech side, and I think over the next month, I'll have a much better feeling about if there's any other changes going on there, but that's what I see today.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And then, Ben, sorry if I missed this in your prepared remarks. But just I guess big picture when it comes to the kind of some of the operational issues that have popped up here causing kind of the change in capacity. Just outside of pilot hiring or training like, what else can you do to fix this? And just curious like how much is it going to cost to finally get back towards normal utilization levels?\nBen Minicucci: Andrew, yes, it's a great question. Andrew, you've known us for a long time. This company is rooted in operational excellence. And what I can say, and I've been with the operation a long time is, and I look at it closely, the root cause has essentially been staffing. And not staffing because we weren't hiring people, but staffing because we weren't able to produce the people in time to go execute the schedule. So when I look at the core operation, we are still very process-focused, system-focused, metric-focused, but you got to have the people there. And what happened to us early part of the month is pilots were stuck in the school house, and 60 pilots make it out on the line to go execute the schedule. So we're derisking the operation a little bit to give our pilots schoolhouse just a little bit of breathing room as we train them. And again, this Airbus transition is a big strain as well as we exit the Airbus. So we're just putting a little more conservatism into the plan and making sure that what we're known for, what we're recognized for, our customers can count on us, our employees can count on us, just making sure that we operate reliably. So I appreciate the question, Andrew.\nOperator: Your next caller is Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Ben, I want to go back to Helane's question just on the pilots. I know you said that you're sort of halfway through your hire -- you noticed is at 300 net. Obviously, there's attrition there, but -- and maybe even retirements and whatnot. Have you actually seen a pickup in your pilot hiring? This is the first time in my career where what we're hearing is that you can move up to a captain seat fairly quickly for a major carrier, much shorter than historically. And that definitely is an attractive feature. Anything -- any color on that on the attrition?\nBen Minicucci: Yes, Mike, it's a great question. Look, if you look at what happened in the last 2 years, the industry early outed 10,000 pilots. And so as we're trying to all get back to 2019 levels, you got to backfill that 10,000 taken early out and plus growth. So really pilots have a choice on what equipment they want to fly, where they want to live. And I think the acceleration from right seat to left seat is really quick, especially depending on who you're with. So again, we look at our plan, and I feel good about the pilot pipeline, but is it a risk for our growth plans going forward? Definitely. So that's why, like I was mentioning to Helane, we're putting a ton of time and a ton of energy to make sure the pipeline is full. And yes, it's not something that we've historically done because there's always a huge resource of pilots, but now you got to take destiny in your own hands and you have to go to high schools and encourage young kids from diverse backgrounds. It's expensive to become a pilot. So it was exclusive to a certain group of people. And now we're trying to expand it by offering financial assistance and grow that pie for people who want to be pilots to get into this industry. So I'm feeling good. Through this bad thing with this pilot shortage, I think it might be a good thing because a lot of airlines are really reaching out to communities where this wasn't a viable option. And now with these financial opportunities, we're tapping into a lot of people who're interested. Like I said, we have 500 people in our pilot development program. We're partnering with a school. And so -- but this is going to be an ongoing issue for everyone. And a little bit like I said, you got to take destiny in your own hands.\nMike Linenberg: Great. That's helpful. My second question, just to Andrew. Andrew, when I look at some of the markets that you've been paring back and you highlighted earlier with -- to get sort of -- the operation sort of integrity -- the integrity back to sort of what it was. But I have seen you pull down a decent amount of Hawaii. And I've seen other carriers also pull down a decent amount of Hawaii, and some of it may be taking down one of those flights freeze up, maybe an inordinate amount of resources. Or maybe some of it is just these longer-haul flights, especially ones that are predominantly leisure-focused, become more difficult to justify when fuel prices are $350 plus. What -- is there anything specific to the Hawaii market, maybe availability of fuel on the islands? Or is it just that economically the incremental or utilization flying \u2013 or the long-haul utilization flying just makes a lot less sense?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, thanks for the question. I think what you've seen us do is maybe take a 1/4 now down to 1/3. You've seen us cut back on some of the LA, Konas and La Huis. I think right now, I don't know for whatever reason, Hawaii's lagged a little bit, just to be frank. It's also very expensive to actually vacation there having just come back from there last week. And so there's just the accommodations, the rental cars. I think there's confusion as it relates to preclear and getting tested and that just went away as well. But what I am seeing as we head into June in the summer period is sort of that traditional Hawaii strength. But I think just as we look at the network, we had to make decisions. I think we felt like a few flights coming out of Hawaii and then we cut across sort of day of week, the Tuesdays, the Wednesdays, the Saturdays. High-frequency markets, we took down a few. And a little bit more where we're doing a little bit more aggressive growth, we sort of pulled it back. So we've tried to spread this across our network and Hawaii, we felt like a couple of flights coming out would be fine.\nMike Linenberg: Andrew, do you think that with international long hauls really starting to come back, especially transatlantic, that Hawaii was kind of that go-to exotic destination. Maybe a year ago after they opened, you saw flood of people go there. Is that -- do you think there's some of that where there's just now displacement on the other, call it, exotic destinations that are now international, but because they've lowered their restrictions, it's just easier to get to. Any of that maybe?\nAndrew Harrison: I probably don't have first-hand knowledge to that, except to say that you are very correct that the choice of where folks can vacation now has expanded massively. I also think Costa Ricas and the Belizes and the Floridas and the Mexicos. I mean we're just seeing a lot of demand across all these locations. So I think historically, where Hawaii was sort of the go to. I think there's just more options for travelers right now.\nOperator: Your next call is Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Shane, it seems like maybe Ben is giving you a bit more of a stretch goal here, if I'm hearing it correctly. Because I think the single fleet type return was slated for end of 2023, but maybe pulled to kind of early 2023. And then I know you still have the A321s and Q400. So what -- could you talk about what you need to still accomplish to hit that target? And what that means in terms of maybe how we should be thinking about in terms of kind of cash flow even though some of that might be considered special items?\nShane Tackett: Yes, yes, yes. Emily might jump in with sort of the remaining lease return cash costs. But just functionally in the operation, we've got to train 600, 700 Airbus pilots over to the Boeing. And we've got to do that in a way that's as ratable, as possible and doesn't sort of impact the network to a large degree. And we also have to sort of decide our long-term basing strategy for the Boeing. So there are some important decisions that we have to make. They're important to pilots as well. I think we have said by early 2023 for the Airbus A320. What I can tell you is Ben and I and others are -- the sooner the better. We like this behind us. We sort of can't wait to be through it. We know it's going to be a little challenging to get through it, and we'll put a good plan together and I'm sure it will shift around a little bit. And then we're executing now our sort of thinking about the A321 fleet. We've got 10 of those. We're committed to moving beyond those by the end of 2023, and Nat's actively working that. We don't really have anything else to share there. But Emily, maybe on the cash for lease return?\nEmily Halverson: Yes. Savi, so in terms of the lease return costs, you got it right that the special items that we'll be taking going forward will include the acceleration of those lease return costs. So we had previously shared with folks that, that was probably going to be in the range of around $250 million. The cash though will not be accelerated because the contractual lease return dates for those aircraft is still what it was before. So we'll park those planes earlier. We'll continue to do the work as we move towards those lease return dates and that cash will be spread over the original period. The only caveat I would share is that as we go through this exercise, we are continuing to have conversations with lessors. And of course, as we do less flying on those aircraft, that could impact the amount of cash that we actually incur. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nBen Minicucci: And Savi, just a little more color on that is like one of the things we have to work through right now that will impact how we think about capacity going forward is. What I've told the teams, I don't want to train a pilot who we spent 90 days in training only to produce them in September and October to transition them in January. So we really have to think about when we stop actually training on Airbus and transition to all Boeing. And that will really decide how much capacity we have for the Airbus fleet going forward from the summer on. So that's something we're still going to work through, and we'll give you guys more color on that soon.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And maybe just a little bit tied to that. And I think this question was asked a little bit earlier, too. On the second half capacity, I guess, how much cushion have you built into that where you might not have to kind of pull meaningful amounts down? And how should we think about like 3Q versus 4Q? Because I'm guessing some of this Airbus aircraft coming happens more in 4Q than 3Q where you have the summer demand. Just any kind of color around that?\nShane Tackett: Yes. I mean I think it's sort of a middle of the road estimate, Savi. It's really until we begin to make decisions around how much hiring we want to do onto the Airbus and when. It's hard to give you more precision. I think I'll get these numbers right, there's 10-ish thousand Airbus hours a month that we fly, give or take. Obviously, that cannot go to 0. I think we fly 80,000-ish, 75,000 to 80,000 total Airbus hours, just to give you some context around how much Airbus flying is of the total. So there's probably -- we'd like to do the 8,000, 9,000, 10,000 Airbus hours and see that meter down towards 0 as we get to the end of the year. But it could come down a little quicker than what we're currently planning. But I don't think it will be super material in the short term.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, Savi, just on the -- you mentioned the -- there'll be a little cleanup on the schedule here in the next weekend or so, but the summer capacity is -- you're going to see it through the tape and is going to be pretty solid and scheduled there. And to Shane's point, about 4,000 of the 9,000 Airbus hours is actually the 321. And so we're going to really start that transition, to Shane's point, in the fourth quarter, which is why that's probably the softest part of our capacity guide right now. But we're going to get real tight on that soon.\nOperator: Your next caller is Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Andrew, I guess, as you guys have expectations coming off the back of that question to really ramp up flying in the second half of the year. It looks like to get to your guidance, we would take RASM down a little bit from maybe where you are in the second quarter. But is that necessarily the outcome that has to happen?\nAndrew Harrison: Not -- on the RASM side, I obviously have pretty much no visibility into the fourth quarter there. But my expectation is as we get surgical and sharp and smart about capacity, I think if anything, it's going to boost our ability to maintain good solid unit revenues into the fourth quarter.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I mean, is there anything about the flying that would be new markets or developing markets that could set that back a little bit?\nAndrew Harrison: I mean I can safely say to you right now, you pretty much see what we're going to be flying this year as far as markets. And as I shared on Investor Day, 90% of all of our growth is going to be in existing markets and pretty much what you see already, the Miamis and such are our new markets for this year. So we're sort of done.\nOperator: Your next call is Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners.\nConor Cunningham: And just in terms -- I know you talked a little bit about the corporate recovery in California. But just wanted to see if you could give some color around just the entirety of that market. I would think that the California network really dramatically outperformed relative to the Pacific Northwest as demand snapped back. So just want to see where you are in terms of that -- recovery of those markets and your expectation for a full recovery there. And then is California dilutive to RASM at this point? Or is it actually back in line with the system?\nAndrew Harrison: We're not going to probably get in the habit of providing that level of detail. But what -- your observations are correct, especially with the snapback looking at March and April. But the California demand is extremely strong, and we are seeing very, very solid unit revenue performance, especially on the yield side out of California in our current bookings. So if anything, just given we have less capacity there than we do in the Pacific Northwest, I think what I'm seeing right now is a very, very solid recovery out of California.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then your guys' financials have recovered a lot quicker than others and your balance sheet is in great shape. And -- so when I -- the one thing that is kind of outstanding is the pilot contract, there's been a lot of discussion on this call about pilots in general. I would imagine -- is that now your #1 priority of getting done? Like I'm not asking you to negotiate right now, but it seems like it would be front and center in terms of priorities for you.\nBen Minicucci: It's an absolute priority for us, Conor. We're focused on getting a deal with our pilots, recognizing their contributions. And get a deal that makes sense for a business model. So we are entirely focused on getting a deal with our pilots.\nOperator: Your next call is Myles Walton of UBS.\nMyles Walton: I was wondering, as an operator, an airline, you could comment or weigh in on the benefits and risks of requiring the MAX 10 to include a new flight crew alerting system. And if that were to come about, what it would -- what would the cost benefit tradeoff to you be given some of your fleet expansion\u2019s obviously reliant on moving into the MAX 10?\nNat Pieper: Myles, good question. It's Nat. We're obviously observing the certification of the program really closely. And clearly, safety is first in that whole process and why it's so important. But to reinforce, we are really bullish on that airplane. We think it's got the potential to have the best seat cost of any airplane in our fleet. But obviously, that assumes a level of pilot commonality that runs through all of the models. And hard to say and forecast where that goes. But should that not be the case, it's something we would reassess and obviously, the Dash 9 is a great airplane for us. We have 20 of them so far, and we'll have good optionality with Boeing.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And then in terms of just a cleanup on the ATL. Can you just level-set us as to what is set for expiry this year from the holdover maybe during COVID from travel credits?\nEmily Halverson: Yes, this is Emily. So we look at the ATL kind of historical trend in terms of breakage rate every quarter. So from an accounting perspective, we've been updating those over time. And I would say that generally, there has not been a massive change in terms of the breakage and experience that we've been having.  Separately, though, kind of on the guest front, the #1 priority for the company is to make sure that we're meeting guests where they are and making sure that we're honoring the flight that they want to have with us. So I think over time, if we start to see guests come back and look to redeem some of those tickets, we'll be generous in the way that we handle those things.\nOperator: Your next caller is a Catie O'Brien of Goldman Sachs.\nCatie O'Brien: So I guess the first one for Nat. Just like a bit of a follow-up on the Airbus discussion. I know you're working on a solution for the A321s. But is there a potential for someone to maybe look to buy you out of your A320 leases, given aircraft supply constraints? Mostly, you've been focused on wide-bodies, but we've heard more about aircraft constraints again this earnings season. Understanding even your capacity plans for this year, but if you did get bought out, like maybe that changes the cash costs over the life of the lease and potentially the recognition on your P&L over the rest of this year, realizing that's special out of CASM, that was kind of nested question. So I appreciate the help.\nNatPieper: Catie, it's a great question. I'll tell you initially that the ratio of calls I get on the A321s to the A320s is about 10:1. So it tells you from a market perspective that folks are much more focused on those airplanes. And part of it is they're 2 to 4 years old, Airbus is delayed in delivering new ones. And so folks are interested in trying to take 10 young airplanes and grow their fleets that way. On the A320s, the lease is there, it all expire by the end of '25. And so as we answered earlier in a question, we're focused on that return plan and Emily's run our numbers to focus on that. But there are opportunities with lessors to buy out of those leases early, especially if the lessor has a prospect on the other side. And so it can be actually a win-win, certainly for us, and it helps us get the airplane out of our fleet more quickly and maybe not have to do all the return conditions for then the lessor to modify the airplane for the new operator. So there's some gains that are potentially there, and we're working those really hard.\nCatie O'Brien: Got it. And then 1 for Andrew. You called out some of the new partner flights into your West Coast hubs during your prepared remarks. But could you maybe just give us like broad strokes on how much partner capacity is up into your hubs as we look through the rest of the year? And I guess just any high-level read-through from your partners on how demand and yields are looking on those routes? And then lastly, how could that translate into incremental revenue for Alaska?\nAndrew Harrison: I think the largest as it relates to partners is international. And in our prepared remarks, you're starting to see that come back. I mean Japan Airlines as one is certainly still significantly down. So the long-haul carriers are starting to come back. Qatar obviously is sort of up. And so I think as we get beyond this summer and going forward, I think more and more there. I think some of our other comments that we shared on Investor Day is really taking a key city from Alaska flying into another key city of American and connecting beyond that, that continues to work.  The vast majority, obviously, of our passengers travel across our own network. But as we get into the Q2, Q3, we're going to have much better visibility on that partner traffic as demand fully returns there. So we'll give you more color on that in the next couple of quarters.\nEmily Halverson: Operator, I think we have time for 1 more question.\nOperator: Your next caller is Dan McKenzie of Seaport Global.\nDanMcKenzie: A couple of questions. I guess, first for you, Andrew. What forward data are you tracking to give you confidence on unit revenues through year-end? And if you can talk about fair searches on alaska.com, how are they trending versus 2019? And are the searches tying into the -- or are the searches tied into the revenue management systems to inform how you're sort of thinking about the revenue trends?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. We -- one of the beauties, I suppose, of COVID, but every day, we're looking at bookings and searches and all of those. What I will tell you is that the -- even as the yields are going up, the conversion rates are not going down. So the conversion rates are staying strong. RM is not technically connected to the booking schedule on as.com per se, the searches, I would say. But we stay extremely close. And as I've shared earlier, we look every day of what was sold in which month at what yield, and we are seeing across the board out at least the next 4 to 5 months, strength across all of it, all the regions at those high percentages every week.\nDan McKenzie: Well, very good. Going back to the ULCC. What percent of revenue does this impact this summer? So I guess the question is, is it material? And then if you can just help us balance that with what the growth rate in premium seats is this summer, say, versus 2019? And I guess I didn't catch this earlier, but just tied to the premium seats this summer versus '19, what's the rate of corporate recovery here in the first quarter? And what's the expectation on the corporate recovery this summer? And I apologize if you shared that earlier. I joined late on the call here.\nAndrew Harrison: No. I think on the ULCC, irrespective of what happens in the marketplace, we don't -- the ULCC overlap in our markets has not really changed. It's not significant. A lot of it is really East Coast focused and the Midwest. So nothing's really changed on that front on the ULCC side. I think on the premium seats, we've given no color into the specifics in the second or third quarter other than to say is that -- as I said in the first quarter, we saw revenues for first-class up 19%. So we're going to continue to watch the yields. But I think as business travel continues to come in, I think there's going to be continued strength in the premium, Kevin.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. This call will be available for future playback at alaskaair.com."}, {"symbol": "ALK", "quarter": 4, "year": 2021, "date": "2022-01-27 14:00:26", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group 2021 Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Emily Halverson.\nEmily Halverson: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, which is available at investor.alaskaair.com. On today's call, you'll hear updates from Ben, Andrew and Shane. Several others of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. This morning, Air Group reported fourth quarter GAAP net income of $18 million, excluding special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $31 million, pretax margins were 2.4% for the quarter. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements about future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release. Over to you, Ben.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Emily, and good morning, everyone. In 2021, Alaska has established a track record of leading the industry in the recovery from the pandemic. This has been enabled by the strength of our business model, our measured approach to capacity and our financial discipline. Our 2.4% pretax margin in the fourth quarter continues that trend, especially considering the disproportionate impact that severe weather had on our hubs, and the Omicron-related impacts we began to face at the end of the year. While I'll discuss the impact of weather on our fourth quarter and the impact of Omicron on our first quarter, let me start by saying both of these are temporary challenges that do not deter my confidence in our underlying business model and its ability to outperform the industry. Starting with recent events. The combination of severe snow, multiple consecutive days of sub-freezing temperatures in our Pacific Northwest hub and stacking disruptions caused by the Omicron variant, resulted in one of the challenging holiday travel periods we have ever experienced. Our completion factor was extremely challenged at the end of the year, which resulted in flying approximately one point less than our expected capacity in the quarter and 2.5 points less than we planned to operate in December alone. I want to apologize for letting our guests down during one of the most important travel periods of the year, and I also want to acknowledge the strain our teams were under as everyone worked to stabilize the operation. In terms of the financial impact of these events, they were material. Our fourth quarter result was worse by approximately $70 million, and our pretax margin was reduced by 3.5 points. Even with this outsized impact, Alaska was profitable in Q4 and strongly led the industry in pretax performance over the second half of 2021. In response to the ongoing impacts of Omicron in early January, we proactively reduced our remaining Q1 scheduled client by about 10%. I am pleased to report that Omicron absences are down significantly and our operation is once again stable. Omicron has not only impacted our ability to operate fully and has dampened closer to the main substantially as well. Andrew will provide more detail on the demand environment but the silver lining is that demand for travel from presence date and beyond remain strong and booking trends have rebounded week-over-week since their low point in early January. We expect the bulk of the Omicron impact to be felt in the first quarter, specifically in January and February as revenue has reduced and as unit costs are pressured given lower ASM production and higher staffing-related costs. However, as I opened with, this will be short term in nature and has not changed our expectations about the overall recovery. Clearly, this was a tough way to end a year that otherwise had progress worth celebrating. And in that vein, I want to acknowledge that 2021 was a year of significant recovery and highlight some of the important successes from the full year we've just closed out. First, our revenues recovered to $6.2 billion or 70% of 2019 levels, and we achieved this while flying less capacity than many of our peers who had similar revenue recovery results. Second, while the full year adjusted pretax loss was $342 million, we recorded $282 million of adjusted pretax profit during the second half of the year. Our second half adjusted pretax margin was over 7%, clearly outperforming the industry even though West Coast travel has recovered slower than much of the country. Third, with decent demand recovery and disciplined cost management, we returned to positive operating cash flows. Excluding any CARES funding, we generated more than $100 million in operating cash flow for the year, which reflects $100 million pension contribution we funded in the third quarter. Fourth, as profits and cash flow returned to positive territory, we have essentially repaired our balance sheet. We closed the year with a 49% debt-to-cap ratio, 12 points lower than prior year and within our target range. And lastly, given we were able to meet or exceed several of our recovery goals, our employees earn the industry's highest bonus pay through our incentive-based pay program. For the average employee, this payout amounts to about 6.2% on top of their annual pay. All told, I'm really pleased to report that our bonus programs will pay out $151 million to our employees for the year. In addition to these financial milestones, we also cemented several critical strategic decisions during 2021 that will help drive our success well into the future. We made the decision to return to a single fleet of Boeing aircraft, which will drive revenue and cost benefits. The remaining 27 Airbus A320s that are flying today will be retired by the end of 2023, enabled by our Boeing MAX order of 93 firm and 52 options. We joined One World and launched our West Coast international alliance with American Airlines which will unlock additional revenues and loyalty across our West Coast hubs, especially in Seattle. We announced sustainability goals, committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 and further embracing a sustainability mindset by linking a portion of our annual performance-based pay plan for all employees to the carbon intensity of our operations. And we renewed our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion by establishing a five-year goal to increase leadership representation and match that of our front line. We also integrated this goal into our executive compensation targets. Let me close with a brief look ahead at 2022. Like our industry peers, Q1 will clearly be impacted by Omicron both for revenues and unit costs. We do believe that virus will move to endemic status and that demand will ultimately stabilize. And when it does, our business model is set to outperform. Notwithstanding a challenging first quarter, we expect to be profitable for the month of March and for the remainder of the year. We remain committed to returning to pre-COVID capacity by the summer and plan to grow from there. I expect full year capacity to be up versus 2019 between 2% and 6%, dependent on demand. This guidance reflects first half capacity that is flat to slightly up and second half capacity that could be up as much as 10% versus 2019. As we did throughout 2021, we will continue scaling our business back in a measured way, leveraging our strong balance sheet and running our operation to produce consistent industry-leading financial performance in 2022. I hope you'll join us at our upcoming Investor Day. We plan to share our long-term expectations, including comprehensive 2022 guidance. This event is set for March 24 in New York. Before I hand it off to Andrew, I want to thank the people of Alaska and Horizon for all that they do. It is no secret that this is a tough business, but the pandemic has surprised and challenged even the most seasoned in our industry. The strength of our company comes from our people and culture of care, our focus on safety and operational excellence, our reputation for customer service and our financial discipline. I am confident these strengths will serve us well again in 2022. And with that, I'll turn it over to Andy.\nAndrew Harrison: Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter revenues, totaled $1.9 billion and were only down 15% versus 2019, which was better than our guide and with flowing capacity also down 15%. Our fourth quarter unit revenues were flat in 2019. As Ben mentioned, end of quarter weather disruptions were significant, impacting revenue by approximately $45 million. Even with these setbacks, our revenue recovery improved by three points from what we viewed was a relatively strong third quarter. Load factors showed continued improvement throughout the quarter as well, progressing from 75% in October, to 80% in November and 83% in December, signaling demand for travel continues to move in the right direction. The strength of this demand clearly played out in our November revenue results. November revenues were down just 7% versus 2019 on 12% less capacity. My take from that result is that our fundamental revenue results were better this November than in 2019. Even though, we've not seen anywhere close to a full business demand recovery, the full impact of our One World and American partnerships or a complete West Coast recovery. Our network is well positioned for recovery. Another encouraging indicator of yields, which ended the quarter up 3% versus 2019, this was driven by the strength of holiday bookings and solid demand management by our RM team despite the delta and Omicron variants book ending the quarter. For the winter holiday period, we were on pace for flat to positive load factors and double-digit yield gains prior to the impact of the winter disruption. Given all the volatility this year, we achieved great results, and I want to thank my entire commercial organization. They came together as a fully integrated team and did a tremendous job stimulating demand and welcoming guests back to flying, managing loads and yields and taking care of guests during disruptions. The net result of all of this was posting the best unit revenue performance in the industry for the second half of 2021 is down just 0.5%. As we\u2019ve seen all year, guest preference for our first and premium class products remained strong in the fourth quarter. First class paid load factor ended the quarter up 2 points and premium class paid load factor was up 8 points, both versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Royalty strength also carried through year-end, particularly from our credit card program. Our bank card remuneration reached record levels in the fourth quarter, up 13% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. We have a tremendous partner in Bank of America who issued our co-brand card. And we\u2019re excited about the highly engaged cardholder base that we\u2019ve established together. Looking ahead, while the impact of Omicron will be transitory, each successive variant has been expensive for our business. Post-Thanksgiving, we saw a softening of bookings for the first quarter, but most acutely in January. Impacts also blend in the February 3 Presidents Day but at a much-reduced rate from January. We estimate Q1 bookings lost to this way by approximately $160 million. As Ben mentioned, we\u2019ve seen bookings start to recover from down 40% versus 2019 in the first week of January to around 25% today. March loads and yields are strong. And we expect them to remain this way as the negative impact of the variant continues to subside. Given the abrupt softening of close-in demand, we\u2019ve moderated our capacity plans in the first quarter. We will fly approximately 10% to 13% below the same period in 2019. With the lost bookings in January and February, we expect total revenues in Q1 to be down 14% to 17% from 2019 levels. Q1 is our seasonally weakest quarter. And while it\u2019s unfortunate it will be significantly impacted by Omicron, I prefer Q1 was impacted versus any other quarter. We do anticipate that when Omicron moves behind us, demand will snap back to recovery path we were seeing leading into the holidays. As that has been the trend after prior waves, spring and summer travel should be strong on the leader side and benefit from further unlocking of business and international travel. I look forward to quantifying our expectations for the full year, but we\u2019re saving many of those details for our upcoming Investor Day. That said, I do want to speak in a bit more detail about our 2022 capacity plans. As Ben shared, we\u2019re targeting to return to pre-COVID capacity by the summer and the growth through the back half of the year for full year 2022 capacity growth of between 2% and 6% depending on demand. In Seattle, we are already above pre-COVID capacity. A material portion of our planned growth in the back half of 2022 will be from our Pacific Northwest hubs as we look to continue to enhance relevance and scale, mostly through scheduled debt. California demand has recovered more slowly than the rest of the network. But as we bring California fully back in 2022, I\u2019m excited about the opportunities that await us. This must be brought on Board a new regional Vice President of California, Neil Thwaites, who will be a pivotal part of growing our presence in the state from both a business and leisure perspective. From a commercial perspective, I\u2019m anxious to capitalize on a full recovery. I believe we have the right cost structure, the right commercial offerings and the right balance sheet to allow us to grow versus 2019 as the recovery continues to unfold. We have flexibility to adjust our capacity as needed to match supply with demand, and we are looking at the back half of 2022 as a period that pivots from capacity recovery to one of capacity growth. And as we plan for growth across our West Coast hubs, we\u2019re eager to maximize the potential of our loyalty program and leverage the international capabilities of our One World partners to provide our guests with global access. Beginning summer of 2022, British Airways will fly non-stop service from Portland to London Heathrow and Finnair is set to launch non-stop flight from Seattle to Helsinki. This summer, Alaska partners will have over 100 non-stop flights per week of the West Coast to Europe. We\u2019ve been navigating the ups and downs of this pandemic for nearly two years now. And while we know the first quarter will be weaker than we expected just a month ago, I\u2019m very optimistic about how we are positioned for March and beyond. And with that, I\u2019ll pass it to Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start, as I always do, with an update on cash flow, liquidity and our balance sheet. We ended the year with $3.5 billion in total liquidity, inclusive of on-hand cash and undrawn lines of credit, which is essentially unchanged from Q3 and reflects $112 million in debt repayments during the quarter. Our Q4 cash flow from operations was $129 million, above our previous guidance, largely driven by stronger demand recovery than anticipated given we were dealing with the now old news Delta variant as we came into the quarter. Our balance sheet remains a bright spot point of differentiation within the industry. This year, our debt-to-cap fell to 49%, 12 points below year-end 2020, placing us within our stated target range. And as Ben said, essentially back to our pre-COVID balance sheet strength. In fact, in a period marked by increasing debt across the industry, our adjusted net debt ended the year 40% lower than 2019. We\u2019re pleased to have received credit upgrade in late December as well, moving us one step closer to an investment-grade rating. The weighted average effective rate of our outstanding debt is 3.3% and our debt service is entirely manageable going forward. Contractual debt repayments in 2022 are about $370 million with $170 million in Q1. Given the low-cost nature of our debt, we don\u2019t plan to make any significant prepayments during 2022. Rounding out the strength of our balance sheet, our pension plans ended the year at 98% funded, the highest level we\u2019ve achieved since 2013. Our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity put us in a terrific position to pay cash for the 32 737-9 aircraft deliveries we have in 2022. We feel very comfortable with our liquidity position especially given our belief that we are back to annual profitability and consistent annual positive cash flow generation. By the end of 2022, I expect our total liquidity will step down to around $2.5 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA to settle around 2 times or less. Turning to the P&L. Our 2.4% pretax profit was a solid outcome given the circumstances in the quarter. Andrew spoke to the revenue results, and I\u2019ll dive into our cost. Our non-fuel costs were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $25 million of unexpected costs from the December disruption. This was driven by approximately $18 million for overtime and wage premiums as we work to stabilize the operation from staffing disruptions and $7 million incurred for passenger remuneration, EIC and other related costs. Typical bad weather event for Alaska might last a couple of days and impact a single hub. The December event lasted in an entire week impacted both Seattle and Portland and was exacerbated by the start of a surge in Omicron-related staffing shortages, in short, a literal perfect storm. As Andrew indicated, the revenue impact of our cancellations was $45 million. And given the $25 million in incremental cost, this event alone raised $70 million of profit from the December month and quarter. The combination of lower ASM production and higher costs resulted in our CASMex being up 12% versus 2019, outside the high end of our range. Absent the disruption, our cost results would have been in line with our guide. Looking ahead on costs, our commitment to returning to 2019 CASMex levels remains unchanged. We know we\u2019ve got our work cut out for us. Our business model drive some predictability and execution. And it is obvious that COVID has inserted a level of volatility into our industry that makes managing a high fixed cost business more difficult. 2022 will start off very challenged, but we fully expect it to sequentially improve materially as the year progresses. For the first quarter, Q1 CASMex is expected to be up 15% to 18% and capacity down 10% to 13% versus 2019. Seven points of this is purely driven by our late pull down of first quarter capacity. While the reduction will help ensure our ability to operate the flights we sell, given Omicron\u2019s impact on staffing and as a hedge against lower closing demand. The reality is we cannot pull out most off this cost exclusive. As said the capacity pull down our unit cost guide would have been up 8% to 11%. In addition, our costs in Q1 include two items contributing another 3.5 points of pressure that are worth detailing. First, approximately 2.5 points of our Q1 unit cost increase is related to lease return expenses for our Airbus aircraft. As previously noted, given the speed with which we plan to return to a single fleet, we will be incurring significant costs associated with returning these leased Airbus aircraft, primarily over the next two years. I currently expect the total waste return expense to be between $200 million and $275 million in total with more than half of that being recorded this year. These transitory return costs begin in earnest in the first quarter of 2022 will peak by Q4 of this year and will then taper through 2023 as the last A320 leaves the fleet. So, while a headwind right now, it will become a tailwind to our cost structure in the next eight quarters, which will be further helped as we replace the 150-seat Airbus with the 178 seat or cost-efficient Boeing 737-9 aircraft. Second, approximately one point of our expected Q1 unit costs are being driven by incremental trading costs and wages of newly-hired employees as we prepare to recover to pre-COVID capacity by the summer. To move from 80% to 85% of pre-COVID flying to 100% and then beyond, we must staff up early given the throughput capacity of our hiring and training infrastructure. We expect fuel prices to be between $2.45 and $2.50 per gallon in Q1, also increased from the last quarter. Despite this quarter\u2019s cost guide, largely driven by the late pull down of capacity that I noted, we expect significant sequential improvement in unit cost as we recover capacity throughout the year. We expect full year 2022 unit costs inclusive of lease return expense to be up 3% to 6% and on an ex-lease return basis to be up 1% to 3%. This estimate implies returning to our pre-COVID cost structure during the second half of the year. This entire pandemic and our recovery has been obviously unpredictable, but I\u2019m excited about what lies ahead for Alaska. I truly believe we\u2019ve set up our business to deliver superb results as demand fully stabilizes. With continued focus on our cost initiatives, fleet transition and our commercial opportunities, we have valuable levers that set us up for a great next couple of years. And with that, let\u2019s go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first caller is Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you kind of an industry revenue management question and I think it\u2019s a little tricky to answer here in January, but I\u2019ll give it a shot, nevertheless. So, as we have these waves, these recurring waves, probably the first time we saw one of these waves the industry\u2019s willingness to sort of hold back on the future and hold back on inventory management into the summer, et cetera, was probably pretty limited. I wondered if you could contrast maybe the second wave with this period of time? And to what extent have we already sold forward kind of summer yields at less-than-optimal levels.\nBen Minicucci: Yes. Thanks, Duane. That\u2019s actually a really, really interesting question. I think if you looked at our third quarter performance, it evidenced very, very strong demand. November and December, again, evidenced very, very strong demand. With each of these waves, it\u2019s about four weeks from the peak of the negative bookings down to a recovery in the mid-teens. And specifically, to your question, from a revenue management perspective, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of a pricing issue as it is a volume. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve returned really good yields. We\u2019ve been holding out that excess demand and that strong demand when it comes, even as of March and beyond, we\u2019re sitting in a very good yield and unit revenue position. So, from our perspective, the demand is the problem with the waves, but when the waves go, the demand comes back. And when we see that, we manage the revenue accordingly.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks for that. And then maybe just sticking with revenue. Is there anything you\u2019d call out regionally as we think about the rest of this year and again into the summer, can you remind us what was better, what was worse? And any commentary you might have on Hawaii specifically. Thanks for taking the question.\nBen Minicucci: Yes. We don\u2019t really talk a lot about regions per se. The thing that our team has done a really good job like where is really managing the capacity in those regions. And you\u2019ll see, as we\u2019ve shared in our prepared remarks, California was in a weaker position, and we have most of the capacity coming out of there, where we\u2019re stronger, we have more capacity coming back. I think Hawaii has been doing quite well. I think we\u2019ve got past issues with vaccination and all the rest of it and guests up flying a little lower than pre-pandemic, but overall, the business is performing.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next caller is Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Good morning. Thanks. Andrew, have you ever \u2013 or Ben, have you ever thought about using price to manage costs in the sense that we\u2019ve got these \u2013 you just mentioned you\u2019re always willing to push for yield a little bit, and we have these really peaky periods where the operation just gets so stressed with volume. Have you thought about pushing yields a little harder maybe to save yourself some IROP or recom cost risk or maybe you lose a point of load factor, but you save 1.5 points of CASM because you\u2019re intentionally keeping volumes down at peak periods?\nBen Minicucci: Maybe I\u2019ll start, Hunter. It\u2019s an interesting thought. I think, honestly, we\u2019ve sort of built our brand on being value for money. And so, we have their capture to be frank. We will get to a point where we will not charge guests any more than certain amounts. And so, we\u2019re very much focused that we now get to come to book that they feel like they\u2019re getting good value for money. And so, to take that approach, we probably reach some of our concepts there. That\u2019s just one point though. That\u2019s an interesting question.\nHunter Keay: Thanks. Ben here\u2019s another interesting question for you. Have you seen the weakness in tech stocks every day impact your bookings? I mean a lot of your passengers are Seattle based, they have tech stocks in their personal portfolios. And I\u2019ve always thought that the day the market is down, people don\u2019t book airfare, I would imagine that\u2019s particularly key with you guys being in the Pacific Northwest. So, have you ever given any thought, Andrew, to tying your daily bookings with what you\u2019re seeing in the market specifically as it relates to the weakness in tech of this year?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Hunter, you\u2019ve hit on, obviously, a very key point. And I just \u2013 our business come back to 50% in December. I\u2019m just going to say the largest tech companies. The air travel is anywhere down from 70% to 90% right now. They are not traveling. And that impacts the volumes in those high-tech markets. As far as general demand, as I said earlier, I don\u2019t see a willingness to pay really means issue. It\u2019s just volumes really the challenge for these flights.\nShane Tackett: Hunter, just to clarify \u2013 Andrew is giving you the Just giving you the sort of business traffic. I think on the leisure side, people who work at tech companies are still travelling, if that\u2019s your question. We haven\u2019t seen a pullback in that based on just few weeks.\nHunter Keay: Yes. That\u2019s not exactly the question, Shane, but regardless, I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next caller is Dan McKenzie of Seaport Global. Your line is open.\nDan McKenzie: Hey good morning. Thanks. Just going back to that last comment, it seems that December yields were up double digits, if I heard that correct, and that\u2019s really without a lot of your corporate travel. I\u2019m just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on pent-up demand, the script was helpful. But does it feel different this time versus past down turns? And if so, what\u2019s driving that?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think one thing that\u2019s a little different is first quarter doesn\u2019t -- other than starting in March does not have sort of the peak bookings that sort of when you came off the Delta variant, you had November and December. So again, I think the yield environment from where I sit is very good, quite frankly. And I fully expect for the Omicron we get this behind us, we\u2019re going to start to see the spring of the own booking come back to life.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. And Andrew, you\u2019ve digested a lot of growth over the years. You\u2019ve done a great job with it. Does the growth later this year skewed towards long, medium or short off-line -- and if you\u2019re exiting the second half of the year at double-digit growth, does 2023, should we think about that trending closer to the historical 4% to 6% or 4% to 8% growth rate? Or are there anomalies that we need to keep in mind as we kind of build out through next year?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think as it relates to capacity, we \u2013 what we\u2019re planning to grow in the second half of the year, we\u2019ve grown a number of times at those rates, maybe 2015 and 2016, for sure. So, we feel really good about that. I think I can\u2019t really comment on 2023. But again, our goal was to get California back pre-COVID levels. And then in the back half, continue to grow at filling the depth of our schedule in the Pacific Northwest, and that\u2019s sort of what we plan to do.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. Thanks for the time, guys.\nOperator: Your next caller is Savi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey good morning, everyone. Just on the -- I was wondering if you could provide a view on CapEx for 2022 and 2023. And any other kind of notable demands on cash this year and next year other than kind of the debt color that you provided.\nNat Pieper: Savi, it\u2019s Nat Pieper. Thanks for the question. CapEx for 2022, looking at about $1.6 billion, and we\u2019ve been open, as Ben referenced in the script, really taking the decision to go single fleet and over-index with Boeing on deliveries over the next couple of years as we phase out A319s, 320s and get the most efficient airplanes in the sky that we can. From a debt obligation perspective, we don\u2019t have, as Shane referenced, a lot of expensive obligations coming. We\u2019ve got about $450 million principal plus interest over the year, which frankly, given our cash balance, given where our debt ratios said, we should be able to start that very, very easily.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. So, a couple of years of kind of elevated CapEx here, at least, is fair.\nNat Pieper: Yes.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. And as we\u2019ve said, with 2023, again, number of airplanes coming.\nSavi Syth: Okay. That makes sense. And then I know the regional operation is not a big part of your kind of overall capacity. But just curious how that is impacting your 2020 outlook as Horizon and your partners kind of deal with pilot supply issues and now more recently, this kind of whole fee ban rollout issue?\nJoe Sprague: Hey Savi, it\u2019s Joe from Horizon. Yes. That situation is definitely a reality in the regional industry right now. Horizon has seen a fair bit from it over the past quarter. The attrition that we\u2019re seeing, I would say, has so far been right in line with our projections, though. So, the adjustments that we made to our flying for this year so that we can sort of get folks hired up to replace those that are departing and account for the training cycle that\u2019s baked into our plan and is proceeding as it has sort of been sketched out last fall. We have not dropped any cities and the amount of reduction in our flying has been pretty much in line with other regionals. 5G is definitely a little bit of an impact. We do operate the E175 and we\u2019re working through that with the FA. I hope to get a resolution on that soon.\nAndrew Harrison: And Savi, I might just add that regional in totals around 10% of our capacity. And really, all of this growth is coming from gauge and sky age and Max and retirement of Airbus mainline growth. That\u2019s really what\u2019s driving what we see in 2022.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next caller is Conor Cunningham of MKM Partners. Your line is open.\nConor Cunningham: Hey thanks. Maybe a follow-up to Savi\u2019s question. Just Again, when we think about the hiring issues, it\u2019s always about the regionals, the one that people are most concerned about your MAX order right now is under the larger variant, but has there ever been any thought to actually replacing or maybe upgauging the regional effort to a smaller MAX just because it\u2019s probably easier to hire at the mainline going forward than and it is that Horizon. I realize that there\u2019s a big jump in capacity. But some of those markets seem like they may be able to support a larger plane now.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks for the question. I think when we look at the fleet structure, I like where we are. I mean we serve small Pacific Northwest markets that are just suitable for us, I think 60 airplanes. So, we like the fleet mix. When you look at 737 MAX, where you're looking at Dash 7, Dash 8 or Dash 9. We skew towards the larger airplanes in terms of unit cost per seat. So, I pretty much like where we are, and I think we're going to continue on that path.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Great. You guys get unique questions because you're a unique airline that made money in the second half last year. So maybe just on the second half capacity ramp. So just trying to reconcile everything. You talked a little bit about it, but potentially going to be 10% larger, or double digits, I guess, is what you said. And I was a little surprised by that. I mean, I think your fleet is only 5% larger. So, I realize that there's some stage engage, maybe you can quantify what that is. But is your utilization potentially going to be higher in 2022 \u2013 in the second half of 2022 versus 2019? I'm just trying to again reconcile all the moving parts there. Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison: You've got all three of the factors. There's some stage length growth. There's certainly some seats growth given the large Dash 9 aircraft and then there's utilization that we can compressed a little bit harder than we are right now.\nConor Cunningham: Do you care to share the moving parts? Or is that a later day\u2026\nAndrew Harrison: Actually, stage is one of the larger drivers. Probably half of that difference. And then the other two are probably similar in terms of the driving.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Alright, thank you.\nAndrew Harrison: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next caller is Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. If I can ask the first question, but from the cost side, on the revenue side, has everything that's happened in the last three to six months with Omicron and Delta and everything else fundamentally change the way you think of staffing and resourcing the airline going forward. Or do you feel like this is pretty much an idiosyncratic pandemic-driven issue. And once we get back to normal, it should be kind of going back to normal service resumes of just operational efficiency.\nBen Minicucci: Ravi, it's Ben. I think being under this COVID umbrella, I think there is a different life set in terms of staffing, there is a little more sliding towards overstaffing, just to take care of people who get an infection that goes through people rather complete with Delta and Omicron. But if you look long term, our plans to get back to product levels, the fact that we had pre-pandemic. So, we're in a COVID phase right now, and we have to stop a policy for that, which will be a little higher than we that would normally be, but our goal is to get back to pre-pandemic levels.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. And for my follow-up, not to steal the thunder from your Analyst Day, but on the last call, you guys hinted at the potential of returning to the cash return by the end of this year. And clearly, you guys are flexing our muscle on the balance sheet. Any updated thoughts on that at this point?\nShane Tackett: Ravi, it's same no. I think what we've said is, number one, our philosophy hasn't changed, so shareholder returns are part of our long-term capital allocation philosophy. And number two, we wanted to be in a position sort of for others to make a decision to go back into shareholder returns, but it's not an active discussion going to conclude, until the end of the year. So sometime over the first of the year, we'll start talking about it with our Board. And certainly, once we know that, we will share it with you.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next caller is Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Hey, good morning, everyone. First question for Shane, and there's a question I'm asking a lot of the airlines this earnings season. But can you maybe talk to sort of the wage inflation that you're considering for your labor groups when you when you kind of model out your 2022 cost plan?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Andrew, I'll take this in two parts. The first is we noted last call, some entry-level wage pressure, and we've had to move wages a few of our groups, just in order to attract folks in the tight labor market, we had priced that at about $7 million for the quarter. That remains in the business today, and it may end up being permanent. I'm not sure, and we'll see how labor market unfolds. Our cost guidance don't typically include new CBA costs. And so that's just been our standard for many years. I think it's worked well. And so right now, those don't include changes to CBAs. And we'll be in negotiations with several of our groups over the course of the year.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And is that $7 million pretty standard across each of the quarters, so talking about maybe a $30 million wage rate headwind.\nShane Tackett: Yes.\nAndrew Didora: That's fair. Okay. And then, Shane, also you had a decent hedge gain in the quarter. What's your hedge position like today? And I guess, more importantly, how are you thinking about the program today given kind of the continued mismatch between the revenue recovery and where fuel is going? Thanks.\nAndrew Harrison: It\u2019s not. I\u2019ll take this one. So, our current hedge position, we\u2019ve had an established program since 2015, where we hedge 50% of expected gallons with call options 20% out of the money. And for 2022, we\u2019re currently 42% hedged at $72, so a decent position on that and projecting right now for 2022 similar sort of return as we saw in 2021 and obviously very volatile markets. I think that program works well for us. We had internal debate on it and we currently do. But it\u2019s just consistent with what Alaska has done financially of being stable, conservative and just sticking to the program and not being overwhelmed with reactionary actions when fuel spikes or wind fuel drops.\nAndrew Didora: That\u2019s perfect. Thank you.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Your next caller is Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. I\u2019ll start with the yield question, but I\u2019ll try to make it interesting. I think it was the April call last year when I asked about the steepening booking curve for leisure and the potential for strong summer yields. I\u2019m just wondering if we should be contemplating the opposite now. So as demand recovers, that\u2019s a good thing, but as consumers increasingly have the confidence to book further out, is it inevitable that you see some yield erosion in that scenario? Or is there some optimism that you can hold on to some of the yield benefits that presumably accompany a steeper curve?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 this is something that you look at every week to make sure you understand the changing dynamics. I think all I can share with you is where we are today at the reference point. As we look at the current booking and the reductions in bookings because of the Omicron variant, we\u2019re seeing the highest level or the highest reduction closing. Obviously, business is a part of that but also leisure. As you move out to two months away, three months away, and in fact, four-plus months a day, four-plus months bookings, although smaller on an absolute scale are actually in the best position. So, what we\u2019re seeing right now is good booking progression in the out years. And as we look at our network today, as we look at our demand, we don\u2019t hit really big decision points on the question you\u2019re asking for another few months to come up for sure. And we feel pretty good right now, and we\u2019re just holding out for some of it is as good as 2019 or maybe even better.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then for Ben, sort of a high-level question, but when you think about your 2022 guide or outlook, rather, what you\u2019re looking at, not necessarily what you\u2019re sharing with us, what do you think are the two or three most idiosyncratic components that are unique to Alaska? I mean rising demand tide fuel, labor challenges that\u2019s all-industry stuff. I want to hear what you think is most unique to you or rather Alaska, preferably in rank order.\nBen Minicucci: Right. That\u2019s a great question, Jamie. Let me see \u2013 let me give it a shot here in 30 seconds. One, like I have just tremendous confidence in our business model. And if you look how we\u2019re positioned in the Pacific Northwest and on the West Coast. What really excites me is the West Coast coming back to life out of this pandemic and getting our network back to 100% of pre-COVID levels. So that is priority number one for me is getting back to 2019. And second is setting the stage for growth in the back half of the year. So those are two big things that I think about. And I think there\u2019s a lot of potential on the West Coast, particularly in California, where it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s ramped up a little slower than the rest of the country, but I think there\u2019s a lot of potential there. Those are two big things. And third, I think as international travel comes back. The one thing I\u2019m really excited about in here, we\u2019ve sown the seeds with One World is seeing international traffic come back in our West Coast up particularly in Seattle, where we give global access to our guests, and I think you\u2019ll see accretive revenue to Alaska with that.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you very much. Take care.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next caller is Helane Becker of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thank you very much operator. Hi, everybody, and thanks for the time. I noticed that you pulled down capacity out of pain field. Could you just talk about what the plans are for that, I guess, for pain going forward?\nAndrew Harrison: Hi, Helane. Pain, we\u2019ve obviously, 5G has been a massive issue for pain field, just to be frank. So that\u2019s why that\u2019s struggling right now. But if you look out into the schedule, we\u2019re going to get back to our 18 pouches a day full slot complement sort of by the summer slash fall. So, it\u2019s just a matter of ramping that up and digesting what Joe has talked about a little bit because it\u2019s all regional up there. We are going to put some mainline in there, but just getting the regional fleet to a place where we can serve that a full capacity. So, you should...\nBen Minicucci: We have sold to purchase a day now going to 18 departures by the summer.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's helpful. And then my other follow-up question also has to do with the network. During the pandemic, you restructured the network to be more focused on the Pacific Northwest and North South especially California. As you think about ramping back, how should we think about getting back to some of the transcon flying you were doing pre-pandemic that might make sense to go back to going forward? And then just as a part of that, do you have an actual number for how many people you're intending to hire this year?\nAndrew Harrison: Maybe I'll start with the first one, Helane. Our network, obviously we have slots in New York. But if you look forward at our booking schedule in April and May and beyond, you're going to see what our network looks like. The reality is, I think we've announced two of them; really, you're going to see very, very, very few new markets from Alaska Airlines. It's just returning scheduled debt. And that's what's really going to happen. And so especially with California, you're going to see the return of scheduled debt.\nBen Minicucci: And Helane, we're going to hire about 3,000 people in 2022.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.\nOperator: Your next caller is Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey everyone. Thanks for the time. I have a couple on the cost outlook. I know the full year outlook is negatively impacted by IRAP from 1Q you've previously said that on slightly less than '19 capacity to be below 19 CASMx. That was a while ago now; a lot of stuff has changed. But I guess should we still expect that to be true as the operation normalizes into 2023, just with less training, restart cost? Or has inflation just changed that? I know it's a little wonky to compare since you actually be growing versus. Just any color there would be great? Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Hey, Katie, I appreciate the question. And yes, a couple of things. Number one, we are in need to grow now. So, it's a little bit of a different dynamic. And when we were talking about that and we're still very committed to getting back to pre-COVID cost structure. I think our underlying assumption or sort of fear at the time was that this might be a very long recovery cycle and that demand may be depressed for a longer period of time. And I think what we believe is that there's a lot of demand. It's just not able to be fully actualized until these waves go away and we normalized society. And I think the economy remains healthy. I know there's inflation worries and stuff like that, but it didn't have the dampening effect on the economy of demand that we may have originally feared when this all immediately took root. So, I think what you should know about us, and I know you do is cost management and cost discipline is part of our DNA. We know it's the only sort of way we can create stability for our people or investors long-term. And we are going to ultimately head back towards pre-COVID efficiency and productivity and cost levels. But it is a different setup that we're dealing with today. And we're looking at a growth scenario, not sort of a shrink scenario.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. So maybe just a follow-up to that. I don't want to put words in your mouth Shane, but maybe this year, more heavily impacted by some of these incremental training kind of like start-up or restart costs, I guess, you could call it than you might have thought, which hits chasm, but is ultimately a good thing if demand is going back faster. Is that \u2013 do I have that right?\nShane Tackett: Absolutely right. Plus, I think had we not decided to go single fleet, we would have had these lease return costs run out over a much longer period of time. So, there's an acute sort of impact from that this year as well. So, I think those are two of the biggest drivers. The degree inflation runs through the industry, I mean it's going to hit everybody. So, we're not assuming that that's going to be a major obstacle for us for a long period of time. It hasn't, I think been a major office on for us. It's more about ramping for growth in some of these transitory costs we've got to know to a single fleet.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Got it. And lease returns are happening on a bit of a faster pace than when you first said that, too, right?\nShane Tackett: Yes. We really didn't have a mindset around the fleet. We had spent I think, three years talking to you all about needing to make a fleet decision, the pandemic sort of gave us an opportunity to actually sit down and make one. And we were happy that we had to be forced to make one. It's hard to do a fleet transition pre-COVID when you're trying to grow in the whole economy and industry are growing, it's hard to think about taking some of that growth away. And so, this has given us a chance to move through that fleet transition pretty quickly. Even though two years feels long, it's actually a pretty quick time period to get 60 to 70 units out the door.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. Alright, thanks for letting me do that multipart. I will leave it there. Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next caller is Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, a real quick follow-up on that, and maybe I've just missed it in the last few months. But have you guys made an announcement as well on the A321s then?\nAndrew Harrison: No. Brendon, we haven't. Okay, that's fine. No, we have not. I think they're leased through 2030 essentially. We don't \u2013 in a perfect world we wouldn't hold them that long. If we have started working on dispositioning those. But I wouldn't be shocked if we held them for a while, and that wouldn't be shocked if we were able to find a place for them to go.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I appreciate that. I just want to make sure I wasn't missing it. And then I guess maybe this question is for Ben, but I'm not sure. As you look out, you said you could even be growing maybe 10% by the end of the year, I think, if I heard you correctly, to what level of profitability do you hold those thresholds? Because obviously, you're baking in a lot of costs right now to restore the network just as a lot of your competitors are, too is this a game where \u2013 not a game, but do investors just have to wait for everyone to get back to full restoration of capacity before we can start talking about restoration of profitability.\nBen Minicucci: Brandon, it's a great question. I think if you look at our track record, if you look at our second half of 2021 with everything that's been thrown at us, we generated a 7% pretax margin and we were the most profitable airline in the industry. So, our mindset is always to grow profitably. We don't grow without believing that we can grow properly. So that's our mindset. That's the plan going forward, and that's how we plan to execute.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thanks, Ben.\nBen Minicucci: Thank you, Brandon.\nOperator: Your next caller is Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, yes. Just sort of two quick ones here. Andrew, we've obviously seen some correlation between case counts and bookings. And I'm curious, case counts have just collapsed on the East Coast. And yet I think out west, like State of Washington, State of Alaska, as I last checked, they're still asymtotic, are you seeing point-of-sale differences for your \u2013 as particularly in your transcon flights where you're getting stronger bookings, maybe east of the Mississippi versus West? Any color there? Thanks.\nAndrew Harrison: Mike, it's a little hard to answer that question. I think the vast majority of our network is really anchored on the West Coast. And given \u2013 everything, we're probably bringing back capacity a little bit quicker than we'd like on the transcon. You nailed it on the case counts and I celebrate New York City every day with, had new counts coming in we normally lag a few weeks behind that. And I think we've sort of peaked and we're going to start to come down. And I think you're going to see the same behavior you do there on the East Coast as you do here as it relates to bookings and...\nMike Linenberg: Okay. That's great. And then just second, just a quick one here. You gave us kind of the increase in your loyalty program remuneration in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a rough number of what that is on an annual basis? I know some of your competitors will provide that number. Anything rough, what you're bringing in on that Bank of America card deal? Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think I don't know the exact number, but I think this was our first year where we generated over $1 billion, just I think, $1.1 billion from our card program this year, which is higher than it's ever been before in the pandemic. So, we feel very, very good about it\u2026\nChris Berry: This is Chris. And it is the highest ever been. It was \u2013 year-over-year, year over two year it was definitely about 5% or 6% higher than it had been in 2019. So, it was a remarkable year from that respect.\nMike Linenberg: That\u2019s fantastic. Thanks everyone.\nAndrew Harrison: Next question.\nOperator: Your next caller is Myles Walton of UBS. Your line is open.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, and afternoon. I think, Ben, from your comments, you were implying the first half was going to be about flat with 2019, obviously implies a pretty big step in the second quarter. I think the largest sequential growth in ASMs you've had since the pandemic and restoration. Can you just talk about the risks in achieving that objective? I know you're putting costs in and you're putting the training in now, but \u2013 is that sort of the trajectory you're looking for?\nBen Minicucci: Yes. Myles, we getting back to peak cover capacity; it was always on our radar from 18 months ago, just to be honest. And so, we've been planning towards that, the hiring, the infrastructure, the training. So, we're on a good path. The pipeline for hiring is full, but it is a competitive market. It's a tight labor market, and we've got to fight for good employees. And that's always a risk, but it's a risk everybody has. In the second half at the same thing. We have set up our whole leadership team and is really poised on executing growth. That's been our plan for the last 12 months. And of course, there are risk factors that everyone is facing, but we feel good about where we are right now.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And your first quarter implies only a 300 to 400 basis point difference in the capacity versus 2019 and revenue versus 2019. Is that a fair way to think about the remainder of the year? Or do you think there'll be a little bit more unit revenue pressure as the capacity comes back with speed.\nAndrew Harrison: Sorry, could you, you \u2013 think that I didn't quite track your question, I apologize.\nMyles Walton: Sure. Yes, the capacity restoration versus the revenue restoration versus 2019 is only about a 400-basis point difference. Do you think that closes or expands as you move through the rest of the year?\nAndrew Harrison: I'm probably not going to sit here today to answer that question, but I will say that Ben shared, we plan to grow profitably. And so, we don't grow if there's no demand and we're not able to turn that growth into something that's profitable. So that's where we take.\nBen Minicucci: Okay, alright. Thanks everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter call, and we look forward to talking to you guys soon at Investor Day. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. This call will be available for future playback at alaskaair.com.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group 2021 Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded, and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Emily Halverson. Please go ahead.\nEmily Halverson : Thank you, Sia (ph) and good morning. Thanks for joining us for our third quarter 2021 Earnings calls. This morning, we issued our earnings release, which is available at investor. alaskaair.com. On today's call, you will hear updates from Ben, Andrew, and Shane. Several others of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q and A portion of our call. This morning, Air Group reported third quarter GAAP net income of $194 million. Excluding special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Air Group recorded adjusted net income of $187 million. Pre -tax margins were 12%, a 15 point improvement from the prior quarter. This marks our first profitable quarter on an adjusted basis since the pandemic began. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements about future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release. Ben, over to you.\nBenito Minicucci : Thanks, Emily. And good morning, everyone. Air Group's 187 million adjusted net income marks an inflection point on our path to recovery. During our last earnings call, we forecasted a double-digit third quarter pre -tax margin. And despite the impact of the delta COVID variant, we delivered. A 12% pretax margin solidly lead the industry and was just 6 points shy of our Q3 2019 margin. I'm proud of how our Company is emerging strong from the pandemic, and I'm looking forward to when the recovery is stable and less likely to undergo demand shocks due to variance. Our approach from the beginning has been deliberate, scaling your business back in a measured way, leveraging our strong Balance Sheet, and running our operations to produce consistent industry-leading financial performance. No matter what the external circumstances. Our third quarter results reflect the strength of the summer season, with pent-up leisure demand bringing passengers back to the skies. For 4th of July and Labor Day passenger and planes approached 2019 levels. Even with the dampening impact that the Delta variant had on demand in August and beyond, our third quarter load factor came in at 80% and total revenue was down just 18% on a year over 2 basis, a 15 point improvement sequentially from the second quarter. Our unit costs were up 9% in the third quarter, beating the better end of our guidance range. The solid cost execution reflects incremental progress towards our productivity goals as passengers per FTE increased 6% sequentially, falling just 12 points below 2019 levels for the quarter. Shane will provide more detail about our cost performance, and pressures we're seeing in a few cost categories. Looking forward, our longer term thinking about our approach at recovery remains intact. Despite the transient choppiness we're experiencing from the Delta variant, our plan is still to return to our pre -COVID size no later than next summer, and then to grow from there. We anticipate recovery will continue to be volatile at times as we learn to live with COVID, and until demand ultimately normalizes. Our job is to deliver consistently strong financial and operational performance, no matter what course the recovery takes. And Q3 has shown us that when demand does come back, our business model is tuned for success. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we plan to increase our capacity to 13% to 16% below Q4 of 2019, and given the dampening effect of the Delta variant, we expect to deliver breakeven to slightly positive pre -tax margins. If the pace of the recovery accelerates from here, there will be upside to our expectations. This quarter's results were only possible because of the hard work of our frontline employees in cruise. Their dedication to delivering an efficient operation with our culture of kindness and caring is at the heart of our success. I want to thank them for their efforts and for putting Air Group amongst the top performers in the industry in on-time arrivals and completion rates once again this quarter. Our guests have shown their appreciation for that great service too. Guest satisfaction scores have exceeded internal targets every month so far in 2021, sustaining operational performance with high guest satisfaction is a remarkable achievement given how complex re-ramping our operations has proven to be. Several quarters of improving demand and financial performance have provided the stability necessary to invest in repairing our Balance Sheet. Year-to-date we have made gross debt repayments of 1.2 billion, driving our debt-to-capitalization ratio down 10 points from year-end 2020 to 51% and moving within reach of our sweet spot for leverage between 40% to 50%. Having deleveraged so quickly from our pandemic borrowings, makes clear to me that we made the right decision in not deluding shareholders during the depths of the crisis. Even though that is not yet something the market is rewarding us for. We're making progress each quarter on our path of single fleet. This quarter we took delivery of two more, 737-9 aircraft and also exercised options for 12 incremental firm airplanes to be delivered in 2023 and 2024. All total, we will have 93 737-9 aircraft in our fleet by 2024 with options for 52 additional airplanes. This fleet order not only replaces our departing Airbus 319 and 320 fleet, but positions us for significant growth when demand comes back, which we expect will be in the back half of 2022. Importantly, we're in a financial position to take these deliveries while also maintaining our strong Balance Sheet. To close, I'm optimistic about the foundation we have laid to prepare for Air Group 's return to growth and profitability. We have a fantastic Boeing order book creating flexibility for significant growth through 2025, a low cost structure that allows us to compete with low fares supported by a strong Balance Sheet, a great on-board product mesh with industry-leading customer service and operational performance, a powerful domestic west coast network supported with the OneWorld Alliance, a brand with a fierce customer loyalty behind it, and most importantly, a culture rooted in kindness and caring. I'd like to thank our people one more time for a great quarter. And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison : Thanks Ben, and good morning everyone. Our comments today will focus on third quarter performance, recent demand trends, progress with our alliances, and revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. Our third quarter revenues came in at $1.9 billion, down 18% versus 2019. This was on flown capacity that was also down approximately 18%, resulting in near flat unit revenues. We were very happy with this result, especially the impact of the Delta variant started showing up in a meaningful way at the end of July. Our revenue performance reflects a 15 point sequential improvement from last quarter, while capacity was just 3.5 points, higher, flow factor sequentially increased 3 points to 80%, but the bigger revenue driver was strong sequential yields, which improved 13 points from last quarter to up 4% versus 2019. On a monthly basis, loads were strongest in July at approximately 88% then deteriorated to 81% in August, and bottomed at 72% in September. In the same timeframe, yield deteriorated about 5 points from up 3.6% in July to down 1.5% in September, both on a year over 2 basis. These negative trends were all driven by the emergence of the Delta variant. Geographically, Hawaii represents 16% of our capacity, and was our weakest performing region during the quarter given the travel advisories for the state, which damaged demand for Hawaii. In fact, the impact to our system results was to reduce RASM by 2.5 points. Considering the headwinds in Hawaii, along with the broader impact of the Delta variant, I would characterize our Q3 revenue performance as strong. Our commercial team did a fantastic job managing revenue in a volatile demand environment. As I'll expand on momentarily, the consequences from the Delta variant have not yet dissipated, and we're still working to build back Q4 bookings that were lost from the 4th COVID wave, given that occurred during the important periods of building Q4 traffic. But sticking with third quarter results for a moment longer, there are 2 bright spots that have steadily bucked trends for several quarters now: premium product performance and our loyalty program. On the premium product side, this quarter's paid load factor in our first-class cabin was 3 points over 2019 and premium class cabin exceeded 2019 by 9 points. We continue to see strong demand for our premium products and we believe this will only continue as business demand returns along with international demand associated with our entry into OneWorld. Regarding our loyalty program, this quarter we received the highest level of cash compensation in our airline's history, which was up 7% from the same quarter in 2019. Our loyalty program is one of our most durable, competitive advantages, and we are squarely focused on maintaining and improving this momentum over the coming quarters. Now, looking at our network, it's only -- it's been our priority throughout the recovery to quickly rebuild Seattle and restore the Pacific Northwest capacity. This approach is producing results as this evident from our revenue performance this quarter. We're also saving opportunities to capitalize on demand shifts as they arise. Reflecting on the year, we'll have added 30 new markets and only discontinued 3. In short, choices for our guests when combined with our strong relationship with American have improved significantly. Today we are flying approximately 85% of our pre - COVID network. Now, Seattle hub capacity is fully restored with capacity above 2019 while overall Pacific Northwest flying is quickly approaching 2019 levels. California recovery remains slower as we flew 65% of 2019 capacity during the quarter, I still expect that by the summer of next year, our California flying will be back to pre -pandemic levels. As part of the California rebuild, we've recently announced that we're expanding our service from the Bay Area to Mexico, positioning Alaska with more non-stop flights to Mexico from the West Coast and any other U.S. carrier. Now turning to the future, the current revenue environment has certainly been challenging, but as I mentioned last call, my team is focused on building a strong commercial engine that will serve this Company for a long time. One of the ways we'll do this is by leveraging the unique benefits available to us as part of OneWorld. I'd like to give a shout out to the alliance's team who have been working tirelessly to establish robust commercial agreements that will unlock flexibility and benefits for our guests. So far in 2021, we've added 195 incremental Codeshare routes with 5 OneWorld partners, increasing our Codeshare portfolio by 43%. This figure includes our recently announced agreements with Iberia and with Qatara. In very short order, we've seen Qatar become one of our top international partners as they efficiently connect our network with their nonstop services between Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, with their global hub in Doha. The Seattle -Doha nonstop, which was launched in January, has been especially strong. This success is an indication Alaska guests value our global portfolio and are eager to see their responses to American upcoming Seattle route launches to Shanghai and Bangalore in 2022. With American and our OneWorld partners, our potential to capture international traffic out of Seattle and California is significant. OneWorld and our partnership with American have also opened the door to greater access to corporate travel, and we believe Air Group is uniquely positioned to get more than our pre - COVID corporate market share with the tools we are putting in place. On September 1, we activated for the first time our preferred partner status with American Express GBT, enabling greater access to more corporate guests and quality traffic. I'm really looking forward to sharing more details with you about these new initiatives, as well as many others in the spring. Now, turning to the fourth quarter guidance, although the Delta variant surge looks to be behind us, it's impact on bookings have left an unfavorable imprint on our Q4 expectations. Bookings deteriorated from down 20% in July, to down 35% in August, and flirted with down 50% on a few booking days during the peak of the surge. While that rate of recovery since the peak has been slower than we experienced after the last surge this spring, over the last 7 days, we've seen bookings recover to down 10% year-over-two. Ultimately, we believe the Delta variant has reduced fourth quarter revenues by approximately $200 million. Although the trajectory of bookings today has improved, it is not enough to fully make up for what was lost in Q4. With this as our backdrop, we expect Q4 revenues to be down 16% to 19% on a year over 1 year basis. However, our assumptions reflect weaker performance in October with total revenue down approximately 25%. So just looking at November and December, revenue is expected to be down between 13% and 16%, right in line with our capacity reduction. From a unit revenue perspective, October RASM is shaping up to be down about 10% versus 2019, while November and December could improve to nearly flat versus 2019, Filling our planes is a top priority, but we're using discounts cautiously with an eye on preserving yields, especially in a rising fuel environment. While we aren't making any predictions about what awaits us around the corner, improving rates of vaccination, availability of booster shots, the expected near-term approval for vaccines for children, and opening of international borders could have a positive impact on the recovery and the economy. However the recovery unfolds, I'm very optimistic that our commercial model will deliver relative out performance as we saw in Q3, and that our work to date is positioned as well. As Ben just shared, we expect our efforts to lead to a break-even quarter with upside potential. And with that, I'll pass it to Shane.\nShane Tackett : Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As we highlighted today, another quarter of sequential improvement and strong margins underscore the durability of Alaska's business model. Underlying our industry-leading results were July and August performance that came within about 2 points of 2019 margin levels. I'm impressed by our team's execution and the results they delivered in such an unpredictable environment. In my commentary today, I'll provide insights on these results our cash -flows and liquidity, cost performance, and our expectations going forward. I'll begin with cash -flows and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in total liquidity, inclusive of on-hand cash and undrawn lines of credit. This is down from $4.4 billion of total liquidity in June, as we paid down nearly $550 million in debt and made $100 million voluntary pension contribution. Debt repayment included retiring our $425 million 364 day loan, and our pension contribution brings our funded status to 94%, and also allowed us to capture a one time permanent tax benefit of $14 million. Q3 cash flows from operations were essentially break-even, excluding pension funding. The sequential decline from Q2 to Q3 was expected due to the absence of PFP grant inflows this quarter, and the normal seasonal draw down of ATL. However, as Andrew described in his commentary, the Delta variant stalled otherwise strong demand recovery in the quarter, and as a result, the ATL draw down was higher than originally forecast. Fourth quarter cash flows from operations are expected to be between negative $100 million and $0 exclusive of tax refunds and payments, which we expect to net to a positive $100 million in the quarter, depending on when we receive our anticipated 2020 tax refund. This forecast factors in the reduced cash intakes due to the impact on bookings of the Delta variant. Planned debt service for the remainder of the year is approximately $120 million and we have no plans for further pre -payments through the end of the year. With this quarter's debt retirements, our debt-to-cap has dropped to 51%, placing us just shy of our intended range as Ben shared. Today, our outstanding debt bears a relatively low weighted average effective rate of 3.3% and our 2022 debt service is very manageable at about $375 million for the year, roughly a quarter that of 2021. Moving beyond 2022, annual debt service is in the range of $250 to $400 million. For the sustained return to profitability, I expect our net debt to EBITDA levels to move to approximately 2 times or less in 2022. Our liquidity and balance sheet are in great shape, and we plan to leverage both as we fund our fleet order, and eventually look forward to reactivate in shareholder distributions, which we can do towards the end of next year. As of now, I expect our total liquidity to move to approximately $2.5 billion in 2022. Moving to costs, I will touch briefly on our Q3 performance and then focus on our cost trajectory over the next several months, as we prepare for a return to growth. This quarter, non-fuel costs were $1.3 billion with unit costs up 9.3% versus 2019, better than the guidance we issued in September. Our teams have continued to do a superb job meeting their internal cost plans. And we also saw lower-than-expected medical costs in the quarter. Fuel costs rose again this quarter to $2.05 per gallon, up approximately 25% from where we started the year. With crude at $70 per barrel for the quarter, our fuel hedges provided a $21 million benefit or $0.11 per gallon. We currently have 50% of our planned fuel consumption hedged for the next 6 months at an average strike price of $61 in Q4 and $69 in Q1. Given the current spot prices of oil, we expect to continue to realize hedge benefits in Q4 and into 2022. Meaning we also expect to see fuel cost headwinds impact absolute margin performance in the near-term. Looking forward, we continue to make steady progress on getting costs back some pre - COVID levels. That remains an expectation and priority of the leadership team. Our progression through 2021 has been solid with mainline CASM X compared to the same month in 2019, up 19% in June, up 7% in September, and likely to be up 4% to 5% in in December. Capacity in December compared to 2019 levels is expected to still be down 13%. Capacity pressure is more of acute for our Horizon operations, as aggressive pilot hire across the industry is expected to lead to abnormal attrition levels, creating lower capacity capability and consequently, also pressuring their unit costs in the near-term. We're also seeing modest pressure in entry-level wages, which we believe is both an industry and general trend in the economy at large, and wage adjustments in this category are adding approximately $7 million to the fourth quarter. Additionally, as we ramp to 100% of pre -COVID capacity, we are onboarding more employees earlier than we normally would, given our training through put capacity. Costs associated with additional training and carrying employees for the quarter are approximately $5 million. The costs associated with ramping capacity will normalize by next summer. In 2022 we will continue to reduce unit costs as capacity returns. Doing so is not without its challenges as we have two particular headwinds to offset. One is airport related costs, as our airport partners run through cares grants and returned to fully charging airlines for both operations and capital expenses. The other areas of step-up in transition costs related to the returning our Airbus fleet to lessors. The cost of returning aircraft were fully contemplated in our decision to return to a single fleet, and the end economics of doing so are strongly favorable long term. As we step squarely into the return window, we will be recognizing these expenses through the P&L in earnest. I expect the largest impact in 2022 with a significant step-down from there into 2023 and a final one down in 2024, which will provide a nice tailwind to our CASM ex trajectory as we exit 2022 and move through 2023. Notwithstanding the headwinds, we will emerge as an airline with a cost structure equal to or better than 2019 in short order, our cost restructuring targets are intact and this quarter's results reflect increased utilization -- our realization of productivity savings, as well as the efficiencies of now 7 737-9 aircraft flying for our main line fleet. As a result of the headwinds and tailwinds I've described, our expectations for Q4 unit costs is that they will be up 7% to 9% versus 2019 on roughly 15% lower capacity. To close, I would just say again that our underlying business model is strong. While demand is choppy, and we hate that we don't get to have the fourth quarter that we think we were set up to have, because of the Delta variant. We're confident that when reasonably strong demand returns, we are poised to deliver strong financial performance. We are looking forward to re-scaling to our pre - COVID size and demand-allowing growing from there. As we do this, we will be continuing to deliver on our cost restructuring and fleet transition and unlocking commercial levers to drive additional value to our bottom line. And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: At this time I would like to invite analysts who would like to ask a question to [Operator Instructions]. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And the first question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hi, good morning, everyone. As you talk about rebuilding the network here, I was just curious there are big airports; Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and LA as you build those back. This is a mission the way -- the strategy behind those airports, how you operate them, change post-crisis versus before?\nAndrew Harrison : Hi Savi. Good morning, this is Andrew. I wouldn't say it's changed, but we have actually made some refinements and tweaks. Obviously, Seattle, we serve everywhere from there and Portland to a lesser extent. I think some of the pivots you've seen us make and given the contours is especially Los Angeles, you're going to see a little more leisure flying for us out of there, we do very, very well. And on I think in San Francisco, we built out a pretty good network and I think what you're going to see us style and more focused on is the largest OND out of there, making sure we drove the top 20, 25 business markets. And so that's sort of where we're landing on all of this.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And then, just Andrew, maybe if I could follow up on that a little bit more on the other focus cities that you've tried to build in the past or kind of working so we think about kind of San Diego, Salt Lake City, Boise. How do those fit in within the network and any kind of learnings in the past, trying to build those out?\nAndrew Harrison : Yeah, we've -- especially on the secondary cities, but we've done a lot of Pacific Northwest to California. We used to flow that traffic over our major hubs and just given the demand and the loyalty strength in the evolution of those markets, we're finding non-stop service to be very good there. I think San Jose is part of the Bay Area and San Diego for us, it's all about loyalty as well and making sure we've got utility for all of our guests. So while we focus mainly on the Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, the Boise's and the secondary cities will always be very, very important to us and we're going to continue to grow those over time.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. And just one last clarification, where is business demand these days?\nAndrew Harrison : Business demand is coming back. In fact, we've had the best day, best week I should say recently versus the previous one in the pandemic, which was just before summer. So what we're seeing is an increased steady forward momentum of business demand starting to return.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison : Thanks, Savi.\nOperator: The next question will come from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the questions. I have a question for Andrew. I know industry capacity plans are pretty fluid here, but you've benefited from below average competitive capacity growth through much of the pandemic and I know this has been helping all the yield performance that you talked about earlier. But we do see some of this capacity picking up, particularly into 1Q based on schedules. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing in the competitive environment and how you see it unfolding over the next quarter or two?\nAndrew Harrison : We look at the West Coast, Andrew, and we've looked at how the competitive environment goes. I think a little bit the West Coast is being honestly subjected to weaker demand and risk [Indiscernible] rest of the country. So even though you may see that competitive capacity is not as high vis -a - vis others, I do think when you think about California specifically, demand h as being stopped there. But at the end of the day, we feel really good about our network mix and how it's structured and we feel really good. As you can see by the third quarter that our network is configured for good performance.\nAndrew Didora: Shane and maybe Ben, I mean, Shane, you mentioned in your prepared remarks and I think you're the first airline to say this is that you were looking forward to shareholder returns this time next year? Your Balance Sheet can certainly handle it, but I guess Shane or Ben, when you're allowed, when you think about your capital return policy, do you think it will be as high up on your priority list as it was pre -pandemic? And the way you think about it now, do you think it'll be a little bit more focused on sort of a buyback or a dividend once you're allowed to? And thanks for the questions.\nShane Tackett : Andrew, I think our thinking here is that we want to put ourselves into a position to be able to do shareholder returns. We're not committing to any particular timeframe today to do that. We'll obviously get together with our Board and make decisions about what the best avenue is and at what levels. But I don't think a lot about our capital deployment and capital allocation philosophy has changed. We do have to understand what our go-forward environment with COVID looks like and how stable demand and returns are. But I think our philosophy that we had going into that the pandemic is going to be very consistent with the one we have coming out in terms of shareholder distribution returns. I will say that our first priority is making sure we have a stable business, enough liquidity on hand to manage the ups and downs and to grow the airline. But shareholder returns are also super important to us.\nAndrew Didora: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker : Hey, good morning, everybody. So you echoed what other airlines have said this season about premium demand. To the extent that this phenomenon is permanent and growing, do you need to do anything differently to continue capitalizing on it or are you optimized for this mix demand leg up, however you want to describe it?\nAndrew Harrison : Hi, Jamie. Our cabins, I believe, are very well configured with first-class and premium class, so I don't foresee any product changes, but to your point, we are going to definitely -- especially with business demand and our ability to play a much larger place there, is our booking curves and how many seats we hold out and when. I think historically we've probably denied business traffic, that cabin historically, and I think we're going to get more fine-tuned on that. I think that would be the largest change. And then the other part of that, too, is just making sure that our network -- we're going to be a little bit more disciplined about timing our flights for that business demand. I see just increased demand coming for that premium cabin going forward.\nJamie Baker : Okay. That's helpful. And second, and I apologize for pivoting to the model. Did you say the Delta variant saps fourth quarter revenue by 200 million. Was that right?\nAndrew Didora: That's correct.\nJamie Baker : Okay. It's on the tape that it was 400 million, so I just wanted to make sure I wasn't wrong. So even if we allow for some variable costs associated with that, if we were to just tack that 200 million to today's guide, it implies that you'd be back in the double digit pre -tax margin territory in the fourth quarter, and I know that's where the fourth quarter plan was in July because you said so, but that was on cheaper fuels. So I guess my question is whether, well 1, is there anything wrong with my math\nJamie Baker : hopefully not. But if not, it feels like your ex-Delta fourth quarter plan actually strengthened over the summer despite the rise in fuel. Is that a fair, albeit mangled interpretation?\nShane Tackett : Hey Jamie, it's -- the one thing you can never do is go backwards and redo things over again and know what it turns out if there wasn't a variant. But I think what we had going for us were very, very strong load factor builds. We were above at -- this call in July, we were sitting on load factor builds that were above 2019 levels at almost every forward month and on yields that were above 2019 levels in every single month. And so yeah, I think we were feeling quite optimistic, if that demand pattern played out and wasn't interrupted, then we could've had a really strong fourth quarter. Hard to exactly know if strengthened over between that and now is the right way to think about it. But yeah, it would've been a strong quarter, for sure.\nBenito Minicucci : I think, Jamie\nJamie Baker : Yes. Sorry. Go ahead.\nBenito Minicucci : I think this is, and we said in our prepared statements, I think this is why we're confident about our business model. I think it's a business model that when recovery comes back that we're going to produce returns and I think it just goes down to score that. But, go ahead, I think you had a follow-up?\nJamie Baker : Yes. And that's certainly my modeling interpretation, as well. Just a real quick labor clarification, do I recall correctly that you are the only airline of size in the U.S. that still doesn't have a preferential bidding system? Is that right?\nShane Tackett : We don't with our pilot group, we do with our flight attendant group. That is true, Jamie.\nJamie Baker : Okay. Just checking. Thank you.\nBenito Minicucci : Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: The next question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Morning all. If I can just follow up on the last two questions. Are you guys surprised at all that the mix is so strong coming out of the pandemic? Again is that something that you had expected given the people's preference to travel and then the front of the plan e given everything that's going on or is that a surprise? And second, on the competitive side, just given the concentration of travel are you surprised at all that the industry has pulled back on traveling to certain lanes and it's not a free-for-all out there?\nAndrew Harrison : Hey, Ravi. I can't speak for the rest of the industry, but I can speak to -- for Alaska is knowing business demand was where it was, we materially reduced space in the front of the cabin. Our first-class fares were coming down, but they will weigh made up plus much on the volume side. So I feel the team did an outstanding job at lowering phase and driving net incremental value through volume. And so that's part of what we're going to have to measure going forward, but let's be clear, Who doesn't want to travel in first or premium class? I mean, I don't believe there's anybody. So it's a matter of what price and volume. So there's demand, that's the first place people want to sit. And so we've been working well there. I think on the industry capacity again, I don't know if you all look at the network and the system. We look at the West Coast. And as I look across the West Coast, you see a lot of adjustments by other carriers coming down closer in. And I think one of the things that I'm particularly proud of, especially with our operations folks and Ben's leadership here is that we have not been volatile; adding back, reducing, adding back, reducing capacity. We've been on a steady path that's allowed for really good cost control, really good selling and inventory and minimal guest disruption. So I feel like all of that has been working for us.\nRavi Shanker: If I can just --\nBenito Minicucci : Go ahead. Go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: No, sorry. Go ahead.\nBenito Minicucci : I was going to say, just with the leisure travel, I think with this the environment of COVID, I think they are looking for more space and to have more comfort when they're fly, and we have competitive fares up on our premium class and first-class. I do think we're seeing the benefit of that. But sorry, go ahead, you had another question.\nRavi Shanker: Yes, just a follow-up on that specific point. So how do we think about this going into '22 and '23? Are you going to be looking to keep this elevated mix of premium cabin with the fares at current levels? Or are you going to be looking to return fares to where they used to be even if that kind of -- if you see this mix shift back a little bit to main cabin?\nShane Tackett : The other thing I'll comment on that is it's not so much the fares that we're focused on, but of course, as business travel returns, as our road worriers return and loyalty returns, we are still committed to having robust opportunity for our guest to upgrade into the first-class cabin. So we're going to be balancing phase with first-class upgrade occupancy rates. And that's going to be our challenge going forward, but it's a good problem to have.\nRavi Shanker: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Mc Kenzie : Hey, thanks, guys. Just a question here with respect to the American partnership, what is the aggregate wallet that Alaska can now tap into that it couldn't previously? And I guess I'm really referring part of me to just to a normalized backdrop. So corporate travel managers that for the first time can consider flying in Alaskan - American as an alternative to their current program?\nAndrew Harrison : Yeah. Hi, Dan. I'll answer your second one first, I think. But essentially, really the unlock here is a couple of things as to your point. We've had overwhelming response from our corporate clients wanting joint contracts with Alaska and American, providing much more competitive fares and much bigger options. We've also, just to be frank, being more generous now with our big corporate accounts. We're opening up priority seating for them, handling on [Indiscernible] and so the whole dynamic there has really improved. On the first part of your question, could you repeat that?\nBenito Minicucci : I'll take it actually. This is [Indiscernible] and speaking to the value of the American partnership, I think a couple of places. Initially when we announced the WCIA, the focus was on Americans non-stop flights out of Seattle to London, to Shanghai, into Bangalore. And obviously with international travel a bit suppressed, those haven't taken off as actively as we want, but we're excited about the potential there. But what has really come to pass is linking our domestic networks via code share and having the ability out of Los Angeles, San Francisco. And over the Chicago hub for American offering unique destinations that we can't get our passengers to, and so think the Des Moines, the Grand Rapids, Codeshare behind O'Hare and behind the American hubs has really been valuable, and lets us tap into demand streams that before we really couldn't.\nDaniel Mc Kenzie : Helpful. Okay, an d then one of the comments in your prepared remarks, you're looking to get to a cost structure of 2019 sooner rather than later. Do you have to get to 100% of 2019 capacity to get to a CASMex that's similar, or can you achieve a CASMex of 2019 with less than 2019 flying?\nShane Tackett : Yeah, thanks Dan, it's Shane. No, we don't -- I don't think that we would have to get back to full 100%. We've got a pretty large cost restructure program and commitment that we're executing on. A big piece of that is movement to single fleet, and that takes a couple of years to get done. And so it's likely that we will actually be above 100% of pre - COVID, sort of coinciding with the full capture of those costs restructure items. But if we, for whatever reason set a 90% or 95% of our pre - COVID capacity for a long time, our commitment will be to get back to 2019 cost levels. It just -- I think the trajectory is going to be a bit different with our order book and with what we think about the opportunities in front of us up and down the West Coast and with our business model, it's likely we'll be growing above the pre -COVID size and at about the same time getting to the pre -COVID cost structure.\nBenito Minicucci : And then which?has got doesn't seem we're focused on is productivity.? And we're getting back to our pre -merger productivity targets and that goes hand-in-hand with a single fleet and that's where we're squarely focused on when we get back there. That's going to be the sweet spot for us and we'll see a big benefit with CASM as well.\nDaniel Mc Kenzie : Perfect. Thanks for the time, guys.\nBenito Minicucci : Thanks, Dan.\nShane Tackett : Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey thanks. Good morning. You're probably not the best Airline to ask this, because your plan has been appropriately conservative and your schedule hasn't whipped around as much. But on labor availability, airport staffing, ground handling, are you seeing any early signs of clouds parting on that front, are you seeing any relief?\nConstance Von Muehlen: Thanks for the question, Duane, this is Constance. I think as our performance has shown in the third quarter, we've really delivered among the top performers in the industry despite all the challenges we have and that's for two reasons. One, you mentioned, which is disciplined return to capacity. And secondly, really resilient, proactive team in solving all the many challenges we have. Sam, you said in your conversations, those are true across the industry. I think our Mehen leadership team has done a great job addressing those as we see them. I'm confident we'll continue to do address that through the Mehen fourth quarter and beyond.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Fair. All very fair comments which we agree with, I guess the question is, I guess the effort per higher or to the extent you're trying to acquire airport staffing, is that getting any easier or is it just as difficult as it was?\nConstance Von Muehlen: I would say it's consistently difficult. Perhaps the acquisition is one thing and then the retention piece, and the consistently staffing on every day continues to be a challenge. I think that's true across the industry, so we do put an inordinate amount of effort into that, relative to what we may have done in 2019.\nShane Tackett : Yeah Duane, let me just quickly add because we want to tighten our answers in real quick, but it's a thing -- I think everybody is dealing with it, certainly the Seattle region, it's been tough to get entry-level workers. Just that pool of labor hasn't been what it used to be, but I will say it's improving. I think as we've gotten through the summer and into the fall, our need for staffing is a little bit less, and I think the labor pool is starting to expand a bit. So I think that things are going in the right direction. But one thing I know confidence would also say is we still appreciate the employees who came to work every single day, put everything they had in the operation, worked tons of overtime to keep our guests moving and really minimize operational disruptively. They did a phenomenal job.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's super helpful. And then just for my follow-up, I apologize if you mentioned this. But how are you thinking about Capex in '22 and '23? And thanks again.\nShane Tackett : Capex right now, Duane, we're at it -- for 22, we're looking at about a 1.5 billion with airplanes, obviously in the midst of our fleet growth and then a little bit north of that in 2023 as well. Again, based on our liquidity forecast, based on our conservative pre -tax margin forecast, the plan is to pay cash for all of those airplanes and still be well above our minimum liquidity value at year-end 23.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nBenito Minicucci : Thanks, Duane.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg : Hey, yes. Good morning, everyone. Hey, 2 questions here. Shane, you talked about the headwind with respect to redelivering the Airbus airplanes. I think you said '22, '23 -- 2022 and 2023. How many airplanes are we looking at here? And what is it like a million to 2 million in airplane. I'm just trying to size this cost headwind that will go away in a few years?\nAndrew Harrison : Thanks Mike. It's well north of that, these are full to engine restorations airplane restorations as a condition of the lease. If what would've had to do had we extended the leases or really all of these aircraft are due for sort of heavy maintenance cycles. The number of aircraft, specifically by -- I think Chris might have --\nShane Tackett : Yeah. So we've got about 24 operating Airbus A320 s that will all be gone by the end of 2023. So that's really the number you're looking at and to change point, these are -- we've had some history of returning these. These are anywhere between $6 to $12 million a tail on the return cost. And so that's the bubble you're looking at for the next couple of years. Mike, we've got maintenance incurred for a lot of this. That's the P&L expense potion.\nBenito Minicucci : Everyone wants to negotiate.\nMichael Linenberg : Now that's actually super helpful, because it gives us a good sense of what's going to go away and then just to my second question, I guess to Andrew, there's been some comments about some commentary -- some very good qualitative commentary about your relationship with American and OneWorld. Interestingly, American on their call, they said that the benefit that they were getting from you and JetBlue was accretive to revenue thus far by I think they throw out a half to 1%. They said something on the order of about 750,000 passengers. And obviously we'd have to split and figure out what's your piece and what's JetBlue's piece. But the fact is they're five times bigger than you are. So I'm curious if anything that you can throw out as it relates to what you've seen on the revenue front. Is it a couple of percentage points, some accretion to revenue since it's been up and running? Any anything quantitative would be helpful. Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison : Yeah. That's a great question. And we're not probably prepared to make a whole lot of comments here, other than to say that we're going to unpack this for you on Investor Day. And I mean, we're going to give you a lot more transparency then and that's probably a little later.\nBenito Minicucci : We're giving Mike to spend. We're seeing a loss from the value of this partnership with American and OneWorld. Again, it's not totally a lot because of COVID, but we do see upside and will give you more details on Investor Day.\nMichael Linenberg : And when is Investor Day by the way?\nEmily Halverson : It's going to be in March.\nMichael Linenberg : Very good.\nEmily Halverson : [Indiscernible] will be sent out mid-March.\nBenito Minicucci : We promise it won't be raining [Indiscernible]\nMichael Linenberg : Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen, please go ahead.\nHelane Becker : Thanks very much, Operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for the time. Just a couple of questions. Actually shifting gears completely to ESG. You've made a number of changes, I guess to the board over the last couple of years. So as you're thinking about that, or is the board where you want it to be? Are there retirements coming off, that gives you a chance, or to change -- to get more diverse, or are you okay with that? And then the other part of my question is with respect to Alaska Star Ventures. What's the focus for that? What are you hoping for it to do? Is that focused on SAF acquisition or maybe you can impact some of that. Thank you.\nKyle: Good morning it's Kyle. I will take the first question and Diana will take the second, I think. Our board is so fantastic and we just added a new board member bringing us to 12 independent directors. Adrienne Lofton just joined last week, bringing really fantastic marketing and brand experience to our board. I'll also just note, I think currently we're at 50% gender diversity and about 40% plus ethnic diversity. We're super proud of that, and we're very happy with the board composition right now.\nBenito Minicucci : And I'll say is our board is squarely focused on ESG and sustainability, it's a big strategic driver for us, and they're really excited about our path forward on this which will dovetail into answering your second question here on we're excited about Alaska Star Ventures, Diana?\nDiana: Yeah. Thanks [Indiscernible] for asking. So specifically Alaska Star Ventures is right now focused on the 5parts of our path to net zero, which we announced earlier this year. So just briefly, those are operational efficiency. Obviously the fleet evolution, which sort of our interest is not focused on but sustainably the synfuel novel propulsion, incredible carbon offsets to close the gap to our target. So we're looking specifically for technologies or in the case of our first investment specifically sector-focused fund that can help us to accelerate those past. That path and bring Technology into the system that can help us do that in the next 3 to 5 years.\nHelane Becker : That's very helpful. Thank you very much. I just have a question. You're in -- maybe Dan for you, I don't want you to say anything you can't say with respect to the pilot negotiations. But what's up with them?\nBenito Minicucci : Helane, first, I want to state we have a fantastic group of pilots. They're highly skilled professionals that keep us safe and on-time and we value their contributions, they do a great job for us. We've got some sticky issues we're working our way through, and we've asked the National Mediation Board for some help, and we're comfortable we are going to get to a deal. We have a history of getting deals with our Unions, and so we know we're going to get there. What I'll say is we have an exciting future for our pilots, you heard our growth plans, we plan to grow the airline a lot over the next 3, 4 years, so this will be a phenomenal place for our pilots to spend their career s. So we'll get there. I appreciate the question.\nHelane Becker : Thanks Ben, thanks everybody. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham : Hey, everyone. Thank you for the time. I might be wrong, but I think your credit card agreement is up soon. The market's been reset a little with a recent agreement from another carrier. I was wondering if you could just provide some details around how many signups you've had since closing on the Virgin America acquisition, or maybe just how spent has evolved on the card over the past couple of years?\nShane Tackett : Hi, Conor. We've been -- we've still got a little bit of time on our agreement that said we are very aware of other agreements done, and we 're working very closely with Bank of America, who we have a 30-year relationship with, and things are changing and they're working to change with us. I think as I said in my prepared remarks, I think since the team we've got a compounded annual growth rate of 9% on both our portfolio of members and Spain. So this program has done nothing but deliver and return, and as I also shared, we've had the highest cash receipts we've ever had. So more to come there and as we get into 22, we've got a lot of exciting things planned that I think it's only going to fuel growth in our loyalty program.\nConor Cunningham : Okay. Great. And then Ben, in the past you've talked about making Alaska a national brand and I assume that would involve some further investment in markets that are off the West Coast. I saw that you put in for slots at Newark and clearly that would be big for the brand of the Northeast. Just wondering how you made benchmark that success of just brand awareness outside of the West Coast, outside of where you guys are already pretty dominant. Thanks for the time.\nBenito Minicucci : Yeah. No, thanks, Conor. This is a big strategic initiative for us. It won't be just a 6 month or 12 month initiative. This will spend next 3, 4 years. And it's really linked to what Andrew was saying and how we build back our network from 80% to 100% and growth from there. So there will be a focus first on the West Coast in making sure people understand who Alaska is and the strength we bring with our network, and with our brand and with our loyalty and our product. So we're going to focus first on the west coast and then move east from there.\nConor Cunningham : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien : Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. So it sounds like you laid out a path to have capacity flat to up for 2022. I mean, I guess, correct me if I'm wrong, and then from earlier comments, it sounds like in that scenario, we should be expecting unit costs down versus 2019. I guess, is anything wrong there and if that's right are there any larger tailwinds you want to flag? Thanks.\nShane Tackett : Thanks, Katy, hey. I want to stop short of giving guidance for next year because we don't want to be doing that today. We do totally recognize that there's an appetite to understand what our view on 2022 capacity and costs is for the full year. And I think when we have our earnings call in January, we'll strongly consider giving full-year guidance instead of just quarterly guidance. But the essential thing is get back to pre - COVID size by summer of next year and we've got planes coming in, in the second half that could allow us to grow, if the demand there and we're configured to do it. And as we go along that capacity trajectory, we see our unit costs ultimately step back to hopefully flat and then down, but not -- I don't want to commit to a timing for that right now.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien : Okay that's fair enough. And then it sounds like you've already locked in either some new contracts with corporate clients, or perhaps have made adjustments that give you greater wallet share with existing accounts that have recurred since the onset of pandemic with your American and OneWorld partners. Can you help us frame the upside you have on the books as of now, if you were to assume that all else equals your pre -pandemic corporate volumes returned to 100%. I'm sure you can't give an exact number, but just is it a 110? Is it a 150? This really high-level will be helpful. Thanks, guys.\nAndrew Harrison : Thanks. [Indiscernible]. But what I'll say is, is that, you know how these things go. They have RFPs, I cycle through every few years. I think we rapidly in the process of changing at our agreements, for joint contracting agreements, RFPs plan to full. And we've just found an overwhelming engagement and we're also being more and more competitive on businesses and working with big TMCs like GBT. Just going to only help us propel that more. So I think that's what I'll share. And again, on Investor Day, we will share more about our strategy around that.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien : Thanks for you time.\nAndrew Harrison : Katy.\nOperator: The next question is from Myles Walton with UBS, please go ahead.\nMyles Walton : Thanks. Morning or afternoon. I was wondering maybe I'll follow up on Katy's question and it's a little bit cart before the horse. But is it reasonable to think '22 is a double-digit margin year and maybe some of the frustration you sensed the market not recognizing your performance is simply that everybody is losing money, losing less isn't necessarily a big deal. But maybe the market isn't differentiating your uniquely higher gearing on the volume as it drops through from a pretax basis?\nBenito Minicucci : Yeah. Myles, I appreciate it. It -- that's really hard to say. If you look at the revenue impact that we mentioned from this one wave, it's a couple of 100 million for Q4 alone. It was more than that if you add in Q3 impact. So if there are no more waves and demand comes back and the economy is strong, then yeah we're configured to deliver really strong financial performance. But I think what we've been saying all along and Ben open ed with is we expected choppy recovery, that's what we're mentally prepared for. Oil prices are spiking right now, that's going to be a headwind. So it's hard to give you some exact confidence that we're headed towards those types of margins. We would love it if everything stabilized and we could deliver that. But I think the environment's really too choppy to be able to predict that right now.\nMyles Walton : Okay. One detail, so your head count's down about 16% roughly in line with capacity, as you get back to 2019 capacity where will your headcount be relative to 2019? Thanks.\nShane Tackett : Great question there as well. It should be down - ish as we really execute on the productivity targets that we've got, probably not a huge amount, but as we achieved the productivity targets, we will on an average basis do a little bit better. So that's our expectation going forward.\nMyles Walton : All right, thank you.\nShane Tackett : And the other thing that I would just say is we've got a really -- we've done a really nice job of managing overhead of the Company, and we'll grow overhead back at a much slower rate over time relative to capacity.\nMyles Walton : Thanks, Myles.\nShane Tackett : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris S with Susquehanna, please go ahead.\nChris: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So appreciate the comments you just gave on your ASMs pro FTE. But if you've spent a lot of time going through the productivity initiatives, I was wondering, could you put a finer point on that and if there are 2 or 3 metrics that we should think about it, it is ASMs per FTE.\nChristopher Berry : As we think about this next stage of the recovery here, 2019 was around 3.3 or is it perhaps something block hours per month per crew? Just a finer point on some of the metrics here that we should consider, as we look at this next leg of the recovery. Thanks.\nAndrew Harrison : Hey, Chris. Yeah. Appreciate it. The two that, I think, are most easily consumed externally are passengers per FTE, which obviously has a demand component to it. And then the other is departures per FTE. We do manage a lot of the business from that perspective, in terms of the labor inputs for departure. Internally, we track more than that, at the specific employee group level and certainly block hour production for our crews is something that we look at closely. That is probably something that can be derived externally, but not as easily as those other two numbers.\nChris: Okay. And just a follow-up question here. So in your prepared remarks on your signaling capital returns here. As we think about 2022, cash flow from operations have a lot of moving pieces here. You have the partnership, we have concerns around inflation, higher fuel, but if there's any sort of detail, finer point, how we should be thinking about yields. Or more specifically CASM access in the back half of next year, I think you've said that. You're expecting to fly 2019, your 2019 book for next summer and then what would that imply for CASM excess as we think about the second half of 2022? Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison : Thanks, Chris. I appreciate the question. I'm going to stay on about my earlier comment that I don't want to give guidance for next year. I totally appreciate that there's desire to hear more about our annual -- full-year expectations, and I do think on our next call, we'll consider giving you guys annual guidance for both CASM and ASMs for all of 2022 so you can get a better sense of the shape of what that looks like quarter-by-quarter.\nChris: Okay.\nAndrew Harrison : Thank you.\nChris: Appreciate all the questions from everyone. Appreciate all the questions, we are out of time. Thank you. And we'll talk to you on the next call. Thanks, everybody.\nShane Tackett : Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. This call will be available for future playback @alaskaair.com.

My name is Sia, and I will be the conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group 2021 Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Emily Halverson. Please go ahead.\nEmily Halverson: Thank you, Sia, and good morning. Thank you for joining us for our Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, which is available at investor.alaskaair.com. On today's call, you'll hear updates from Ben, Andrew and Shane. Several others of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call.  Our financial results published this morning reflect a clear step forward in the recovery of our business. In the second quarter, Air Group reported an adjusted pretax loss of 3%. For the first time since February 2020, monthly adjusted pretax margins turned positive in June at approximately 14%. These results exclude any CARES Act payroll support program benefits. The pace of recovery during the quarter drove approximately $840 million in cash flow from operations, inclusive of the $489 million of CARES Act payroll support program grants received.  Our comments today will include forward-looking statements about future performance which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release.  Over to you, Ben.\nBenito Minicucci: Thanks, Emily, and good morning, everyone. The results we published this quarter showed that we are successfully rebuilding our company and returning to profitability. As Emily shared, our second quarter pretax loss was 3%, lining us close to breakeven as we had initially forecast during our Q1 call. Margins improved significantly during the quarter, as we exited March with a 41% loss and closed June with a pretax income of 14%. Our Q2 adjusted pretax margin is the best in the industry among carriers who have reported so far.  This quarter, we hit several milestones that validate our strategy is working. The first milestone was our return to profitability, exiting the quarter with solid double-digit margins. The second is that our business returned to positive cash flow generation of $351 million, excluding any PSP grant funding. Third, we used our strong liquidity position to begin to delever, bringing debt to cap down 6 points from the prior quarter to 56%. And lastly, with the strong return of passenger demand, our productivity levels rebounded to near 2019 levels.  Underlying these achievements is a dramatic return in leisure demand that began to gain momentum in March. To a lesser extent, business travel demand has been increasing more recently as well. Air Group's passenger enplanements progressed from down 34% in April to down 18% in July. We are consistently flying about 110,000 passengers per day, and forward bookings are approximately 85% of 2019 normalized levels. This progress and our second quarter results give us confidence that the worst of the downturn is behind us, but the impact of the Delta variant may pose some risk in the recovery trajectory. To date, we are seeing no signs of demand slowing, but we will continue to watch booking trends carefully so that we can appropriately match capacity with demand.  With that in mind, our plan is to return to 100% of 2019 flying levels by no later than the summer of 2022. However, given that the recent surge in demand has been consistently strong and has not shown signs of slowing, we may accelerate our return to pre-COVID levels accordingly. To create flexibility for that faster ramp-up in capacity, we are planning to reactivate approximately 10 Airbus aircraft and begin flying them this fall and winter.  This temporary return of several Airbus airplanes allows us to create capacity quickly and protects against unforeseen events that could be outside of our control, such as supply chain disruptions. Last quarter, we spoke about deleveraging our cost structure, fleet plans and commercial tailwinds to move back to a path of sustained profitability quickly. It's clear from this quarter's financial results that our approach to managing the business is working. For Q2, we expect our pretax margin, load factor and unit revenues to be near the top of the industry as a result of our disciplined approach to capacity.  With growing passenger counts, our productivity has increased 1.5x between March and June and is expected to be within a few points of 2019 levels in July and beyond. This sets us up well to further close the gap on 2019 CASMex levels. As we look forward to the next 6 months, we expect to deliver double-digit margins throughout the third quarter and high single-digit margins in the fourth quarter. It's also worth noting that the gap between our 2021 and 2019 margins is closing each quarter. I'm proud of how quickly we've returned to profitability and how, as Shane will detail, we have begun reinforcing the fortress balance sheet that has been a hallmark of our business for many years. Our financial strength sets us up well for sustainable growth in the future.  Impressively, our operation performed near the top of the industry in on-time arrivals and completion rates even with the rapid return in traffic during the quarter. At our Seattle hub, where our flying is essentially back to 2019 levels already, we have found that entry-level labor pools are limited, making hiring a challenge, particularly for ramp workers. With this staffing pressure, along with record-breaking heat waves during the quarter, have put stress on our operations. Yet through these challenges, we've delivered for our guests with caring service, creative solutions and teamwork.  I want to recognize the incredible efforts of our employees across the operation, including airports, ground handling, contact centers, in-flight, flight operations and maintenance teams, many of whom have covered extra shifts to keep our operation and guest moving as peak summer travel got underway. Even our back-office management employees at all levels have jumped in to help the operation in the past couple of months. One of the things I truly love about this company is our culture, and how our employees support each other and take care of our guests no matter what it takes.  While it is inevitable that we will encounter new challenges and uncertainty as the recovery advances, our momentum continues to build. Our measured deployment of capacity allows us to maximize financial results while allowing our operations to scale up successfully. It's exciting to see Air Group's progress as we rebuild our network and operation, harvest savings from cost and productivity initiatives and reinforce our strong balance sheet.  I am confident that this is exactly the strong foundation we need to further grow our partnerships with oneworld America, leverage our 737 fleet order and launch our upcoming commercial initiatives.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Ben, and it's great to be with you all again. My comments this morning are going to center around 3 areas. First, we're going to be talking about our second quarter revenue performance. But I'll focus on sequential monthly improvements in revenue versus quarter-over-quarter so that the trajectory of our revenue recovery is clear. Second, I will provide capacity and revenue guidance for the third quarter. And then lastly, I'll be touching on revenue initiatives that are getting ready to take effect or will be rolled out in the future to further enhance our revenue performance.  Starting with revenue this quarter, our second quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, down 33% from 2019, but nearly double the revenue we generated in the first quarter. As Ben shared, this reflects material increases in passenger volumes as well as sequential improvement in yields. This quarter, we flew 21% below 2019 capacity levels with load factors climbing from 70% in April, 75% in May and 86% in June. This acceleration put us just above our load factor guidance range for the quarter, and we expect load factors in the mid-80s for the rest of the summer. I'll speak more to our guidance in a few minutes.  Our RASM was down 15.5% for the quarter, but the improvement from the beginning of the quarter versus the end was dramatic. Our RASM was down 25% in April, 18% in May and only 5.5% in June. Much of this improvement was driven by passenger volumes, but yield also played an important role, which improved 8.5 points during the quarter from down 14% in April to down 5.5% in June. Mileage Plan revenues, including commission revenues from our co-brand credit card program and award redemption revenue showed particular strength during the quarter.  Collectively, Mileage Plan revenues represent nearly 20% of total revenues and were down just 9% versus the second quarter of 2019, with June down just 0.9%. Bank commission revenues were particularly strong for the quarter, up 7% versus 2019. Additionally, we saw credit card acquisitions for the quarter exceed those of 2019. We're encouraged by loyalty program performance, and it's clear that our guests are excited to engage with our program as they return to travel.  So turning to our network. Our strong sequential revenue performance was enabled by our network teams rebuild strategy. Air Group has returned to approximately 80% of its pre-COVID network size. But we prioritize Seattle growth, given the strength of demand here. Our Seattle hub capacity in Q2 was approximately 2% higher than in the second quarter of 2019. And the team also restructured the Seattle hub to gain access to greater flow traffic, which has helped fuel this growth. As of July, our Pacific Northwest flying is only down 4% from 2019. We expect to continue to grow Pacific Northwest capacity from here.  And Hawaii capacity has also been returned more quickly than system average and was only down 7% in the second quarter from 2019. We've reallocated some Hawaii flying across different markets, which includes adjustments to frequencies in both California and the Pacific Northwest, which has proven to be a positive move. Our California capacity was down 40% in the second quarter, reflecting the reality that demand in the States has been amongst the weakest in the nation. As we shared last quarter, we will add back capacity to California as demand returns, which we believe has now started.  During the first half of the year, there was an 8-point load factor gap that existed between our California and non-California flying. And with the state reopening mid-June, I can report that the gap has fully closed in the past several weeks. With California load factors improving, we're experiencing relative stronger pricing and yields on flights to touch California are now better than the rest of the system on a year-over-2 basis. As with our entire network, our priority is to continue to match supply with demand, and we fully expect to have returned 100% of pre-COVID capacity to California, sometime in the first half of 2022.  Even though system capacity remains below 2019 levels, we have been adding new markets to our network to maximize revenues as the recovery takes hold. We've seen a shift in demand during the pandemic to getaway destinations and cities with lower cost of living and our recent focus on growth in places like Boise, Austin and Florida due to this reality. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we will have either commenced or announced over 50 net new markets, which reflects the shifting demand landscape in our network.  Booking momentum remains strong, stabilizing at about 85% of pre-COVID levels. This level of demand is consistent with our capacity plans, which are also approximately 85% of pre-COVID levels and supports our objective of returning to 80%-plus load factors and pre-pandemic yields. On the business travel front, we've been encouraged at what appears to be an acceleration of the return of business travel. In fact, over the past 3 weeks, our indirect corporate bookings have reflected 40% to 50% recovery of 2019 levels, and we're optimistic this will continue to improve. Similarly, direct corporate bookings that utilize EasyBiz were over 50% recovered in the second quarter. EasyBiz users generally skewed geographically towards the Pacific Northwest and State of Alaska customers. But provide a good indicator of recovery trends for small and medium businesses.  We mentioned on our prior call that we expect the business to recover to about 50% by the end of the year. But with recent trends, we expect it will reach sustained 50% or better ahead of that. As I also mentioned last quarter, oneworld and our partnership with American have opened the door to greater access to corporate travel. Just to give you a sense of our progress against that opportunity, to date, over 90% of Alaska's top-tier corporate accounts are being executed or are expected to execute a joint contract with Alaska and American, which will offer their travelers greater access to flight options, more competitive fares and seamless elite guest benefits.  Additionally, we will soon be working with several TMCs in a much deeper way. We have spent a fair amount of time over the last few quarters, getting ready to fully leverage this distribution channel, which will ensure we are well positioned to get at least our fair share of corporate traffic as business travel recovers. In short, we will be competing on a more level playing field, and I'll have more to share on that soon.  With this backdrop, I'll turn to our third quarter guidance. For capacity, we plan to fly 17% to 20% below 2019 levels. Given the strength we see in summer demand, passengers are expected to be down just 15% to 18%, and load factors will improve to 82% to 85%. Revenue is expected to be in line with capacity at down 17% to 20% versus 2019, which means our unit revenues will be close to flat.  Looking beyond this year, I've shared that our larger share of corporate travel, new revenue management system, along with unique benefits available to us as part of oneworld will be critical to our return to sustained and profitable growth. Our team is in the process of sizing these and new commercial opportunities with a directive to deliver at least $300 million of incremental annual revenue to our pre-COVID revenue baseline. We plan to provide a deeper look into these initiatives and our expected delivery time line at a future investor event. As the next stages of this recovery play out, I look forward to bringing clarity to our investors who are eager to hear about our growth plans.  June was a turning point for us and delivering an adjusted pretax margin of over 14% gives me great confidence that our airlines revenue and cost model is configured to return us to industry-leading margins as we climb out of this pandemic.  And with that, I'll pass it over to Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As our results this quarter indicate, the initial recovery of our business has been rapid and strong. After a deep loss in Q1, we saw margins improve substantially throughout the quarter, posting the double-digit margin in June that Ben mentioned. Nonfuel costs increased just 9% versus Q1, while capacity increased 29%, and our revenues increased 191%. The our results are solidly amongst the best in the industry, which is worth noting, particularly given that California was relatively later to reopen than the rest of the country.  Our results underscore the strength of Alaska's business model and our ability to execute as a company. My comments will focus on our financial performance, cash flows and liquidity, cost performance and our plans for the rest of the year.  Beginning with cash flows and liquidity. We generated $840 million of cash flow from operations this quarter, which is inclusive of $489 million in payroll support grants. Excluding PSP grants, we generated $351 million of cash flow from operations at the business. Most of the cash flow improvement was driven by ATL growth, which ended the quarter at $1.5 billion. $385 million of our ATL represents travel credits which guests continue to utilize for purchasing tickets. In the quarter, $185 million of travel was booked using credits versus our normal $40 million a quarter pre-pandemic.  Our on-hand liquidity at June 30 was $4 billion, up from $3.5 billion in March. We shared last quarter that we had plans to begin retiring debt in the second half of the year but accelerated that plan given the pace of recovery of cash inflows.  Debt retirements in the quarter totaled approximately $570 million, including the repayment of our $135 million balance under our CARES Act loan. We have now closed that facility and the underlying collateral that originally secured the facility is once again unencumbered, the largest of which is our Mileage Plan program. We expect to end 2021 with around $3.5 billion in on-hand liquidity, but we'll continue to reduce this balance throughout 2022. We have not yet determined a new normal level of on-hand cash in the future, but I do expect it will be somewhat higher than what we held pre-pandemic.  The debt repayments this quarter, as Ben shared, improved our debt to cap by 6 points from 62% to 56%. It's worth noting that our adjusted net debt levels dropped to approximately $725 million this quarter, given the excess cash we have on the books today. If we reduce the cash by $1.5 billion to retire debt, our debt to cap would be at 47%, which is equivalent to when we entered the pandemic. I share this only to give a sense of how strong our balance sheet is as we move into the recovery. We do plan to use cash to pay down more debt this quarter, including our $425 million 364-day term loan.  Going forward, we will move from focusing on adjusted net debt, which was an important metric for us during the depths of the pandemic, back to focusing on debt to cap and net debt to EBITDAR.  Turning to costs. our cost execution was solid this quarter as productivity levels ramped. Total adjusted nonfuel operating expenses were $1.2 billion for the quarter, up 9% from Q1, while capacity increased 29% sequentially as I mentioned a moment ago. We saw productivity levels rise from 42% below 2019 levels in March to 15% below 2019 levels in June, and we expect July to be within a few points of 2019 levels.  Our Q2 unit costs were up 10.4% versus 2019, which was better than our mid-June guidance and was helped by $15 million in onetime favorable adjustments to wage and benefit-related expenses. During the quarter, we also accrued $34 million in expenses related to our performance-based pay incentive plan. As many of you know, our approach to incentive pay is unique in the industry, and we continue to see the value it has in driving clarity and alignment throughout our business on the goals we need to achieve to produce strong results as a company over the long term.  Also during the quarter, we were able to finalize 3 labor agreements, including a new wage agreement with our Horizon pilots and 1-year contract extensions with Alaska's flight attendants and dispatchers. I'd like to thank our employees and their IDT, ASA and TWU representatives for their diligent work to develop and ratify these agreements.  Looking ahead to the end of the year, I expect that our CASMex will continue to progress towards 2019 levels even though we're not fully back to 2019 capacity by year-end, with mainline approaching 2019 levels as we exit the year. To recap our expectations for the third quarter, we plan on flying 17% to 20% below 2019 capacity. Revenue should be down in line with capacity, resulting in unit revenues that are approximately flat to 2019. We expect unit cost to be up 10% to 12%, similar to our Q2 performance, given the relatively modest capacity increase quarter-over-quarter.  Given these ranges, we expect to achieve double-digit margins for the third quarter. Cash flow from operations is expected to be between 0 and $100 million for the quarter. The sequential decline in cash flow from operations is primarily driven by no PSP grant inflows and normal seasonality that we expect to see in ATL, which tends to decline in the third quarter.  Before we move on to questions, we want to express our appreciation for all the employees who have tirelessly contributed to our success in recovery. As you've heard today, folks in our operations have been working incredibly hard. The improved financial results that we are excited to be sharing with you today would not be a reality without the hard work of the 22,000 employees who bring our airlines to life each day. And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: So your June Q cash flow came in quite a bit better than initial expectations, in part driven by better forward bookings. But your capacity cut for the third quarter is only, I think, 2.5 points narrower in the second quarter. Is that the max capacity you could produce given the fleet changes you've made over the last year? Or is the demand uptick we're going to see that more in higher modes and yields?\nAndrew Harrison: Katie. Yes, our capacity is sort of where it's going to be for the third quarter. And so the loads and the yields is what's going to drive the revenue performance.\nCatherine O'Brien: And so when you say the capacity is where it's going to be, does that mean that's kind of the max in terms of headcount and fleet availability?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, that's correct. Our capacity guide because what we've tried to do when we set this up, costs are always certain. Revenues is not so much. So we've set this up so that we've got a very solid handle on our costs with a good level of capacity because there is room for growth on the yield front and the load factors. And so that's where we're going to be for the third quarter, in that range that I shared.\nShane Tackett: Yes, Katy, I might just add, I think we've talked about this before. We do want to get back to 80%-plus load factors on a sustained basis. We're not looking to see a lot of variation as we move from peak to shoulder. And so this pent-up demand that we're seeing in the summer, it was -- we didn't know how much of that would follow into the fall. So I think we've been pretty methodical about capacity. And that's how we've set up headcount for the third quarter. But we are going to reactivate these 10 Airbus. And if they come online and it looks like there's opportunity to use them, the demand is there, we will deploy them. But it will probably be more fourth quarter for that.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Very clear. And then just for my follow-up. Like most of the industry has reported so far, you're expecting capacity cuts to narrow a little bit in the third quarter versus 2Q, but CASMex inflation to pick up a little bit sequentially. Is that all just ramp-up costs tied to bringing on more capacity? Or what's driving that? And how should we think about maybe some of those ramp-up costs flowing or not flowing into the fourth quarter?\nShane Tackett: Yes. No, thanks, Catie. I'll speak to that a little bit. I think there's a little bit of Q3 cost that is ramp up, getting ready for Q4 next year. But a couple of notes. We outperformed our Q2 guide heavily. We did have this benefit of $15 million in onetime items. There are also other areas like medical came in way under our original forecast. It's a little bit hard to forecast right now when people are going to go to the doctor, so volumes were down. So some of that isn't in our Q3 guide. We don't expect onetime items. We're sort of expecting medical to normalize.  But the biggest driver for us sequentially is selling expenses are now coming back in a big way. ASMs are only up a few points quarter-over-quarter. But passengers and revenue are up 25%, 30% quarter-over-quarter. So we're starting to see commissions and credit card expenses rise. Also in the third quarter, we'll have our full catering complement on board. So more people getting more food and beverage similar to where we were pre-COVID. So we've got -- those are all variable costs. They're not structural. I'm not worried about them at all, but they're coming back with demand, and they're all coming back in the third quarter pretty strong.\nOperator: The next question will come from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: So my first question is related to something you said, Shane. I think you said that you were seeing bookings at -- about $185 million worth of bookings are using credits versus $40 million pre-pandemic. So as you think about going into the third and fourth quarter end, and that would -- and working out those travel credits, are you going to get back to that $40 million level? Or is there a new level that we should think about?\nChristopher Berry: Helane, this is Chris. We won't get to that $40 million level this year because, obviously, the remaining travel credits are much more elevated over where they were pre-pandemic. We've got about 25% of our total ATL, as Shane mentioned, in travel credits that still remain. Most of those do expire at the end of this year. So we expect those to be used at a pretty heavy pace for the remainder of this year. And then as we get into 2022, we would expect those to start to normalize then.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then it normalizes back to around $40 million?\nBenito Minicucci: Well, I mean, that's hard to tell. I mean that's just what it was. And yes, we do have the element of no change fees anymore. And so it may be higher than it has historically been, but it will definitely level off from where it is now.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then just for my follow-up question. I think, Ben, you mentioned that you're having a hard time hiring ramp workers and, I guess, other nonunion -- or maybe they are part of the union, but other workers. So how should we think about like attracting people to the profession, to the airline industry in general, if they are unionized and you can't restarting pay? Or can you raise starting pay so that you can attract people? And does that lead to wage inflation for you?\nBenito Minicucci: Helane, it's a great question. I think this is a national issue as you're hearing a lot of companies talk about this labor shortage. I would say the only place we're seeing it now. We're not seeing it with pilots or flight attendants or a lot of labor groups. Where we're seeing it is really at the entry-level position, particularly in Seattle, there are spots across the country, but particularly in Seattle. So what we're doing is really looking at the market. I think we want to be prudent about this.  We're looking at the market. We're looking at what it might be in September and October when the stimulus and the unemployment runs out, this thing needs to find its water level. So we're going to approach slowly. What we've done now and our operations team has done just a phenomenal job at some incentives to attract workers. And so we're doing fine now. But it's just something that's on our windshield. And I don't think we know where that number is going to be for just a few more months.\nOperator: The next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Congrats on this outlook. Only because you gave it, and I apologize for asking this because you gave good disclosure. But just on June 14%, can you put that in context? Like what is a June typically look like relative to kind of the rest of the second quarter?\nShane Tackett: Yes. So Duane, I'll give you some context. I mean if you look back at 2019, the June 14% this time is about 10 points lower than say it was in 2019. So June, July, August tend to be our highest margin months, and they're typically in the 20s.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Got it. I guess I was asking relative to the other months of the quarter because it just -- it sounds like you're saying you saw a much better kind of trajectory, much better kind of sequential build in margin than you normally do.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, Duane, it's Andrew. I think the best way to describe that is the capacity was fairly even in April, May and June. But what you saw was load factors going from 70% to 86% and yield declines from down 25% to 5.5%. So the revenue and volumes really made the difference there over the quarter.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's great. And then just with respect to 3Q, and this might just relate to what you just said. Maybe you can speak a little bit to kind of the visibility coming in and kind of the advanced book yields. Because it felt like the industry needed to overcome kind of the advanced book yields coming into 2Q, but they're in a much better place coming into 3Q. And maybe you could just comment on like your stage changes because this is, listen, this is not a massively long-haul network that's contouring to be short haul, like flat RASM in 3Q feels a great outcome.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Thanks, Duane. On the top of my head, I don't know our stage, but that's not really the story. I think to your point, what we're seeing is, and honestly, as I look out, that's why we shared flat RASM. From what we've seen today, our yield position looks good and much better than it was in the second quarter, and the bookings are coming in well. I think on the business fare side, the environment is still weak. Just to be frank, the leisure is much better, but I suspect as business travel demand returns, I think we might see a strengthening there. But as I look forward right now, I feel pretty good about how we're positioned from both a load factor and a yield perspective and incremental improvement from the second quarter.\nBenito Minicucci: And in all, I think we're just being disciplined on how we deploy capacity. I think that's the big story for us. We've been very thoughtful from a year ago and how we're going to deploy capacity, bring people back, scale up the operation. And I think we're going to do that through the third quarter and the fourth quarter and into next year as we ramp up to 100%. We're going to watch what's going on, watch demand and react appropriately.\nOperator: The next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Just to follow up on Catie's question, as you bring those kind of 10 Airbus back this year and given your fleet order, just -- where do you think -- not looking for guidance, but what's the kind of the high level and the low level of where capacity can go in 2022?\nAndrew Harrison: Savi, it's Andrew. Yes, so if you look out, these Airbus aircraft start to return by the end of the year. But if we flew them all at normal utilization, so summer of '22, we could increase summer of '22's capacity up to 8% versus where we are in '19. So as it stands today, we've talked about getting to flat. But if we really needed to or wanted to, we could get up 8%.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And then Andrew, I know you teased this a little bit on the $300 million incremental. I was just kind of wondering if that's related to items that you have put in place today? Or if there is things that you have to actually turn on to start achieving that at some point? I realize it's not $300 million next year, but just from an execution standpoint, what's involved related to that?\nBenito Minicucci: Yes. Savi, I'll start with that and then hand over to Andrew. So when we put our 2025 strategic plan in place prior to pandemic, we've built it up with a lot of strong commercial initiatives that had that $300 million. And then the pandemic hit, we kind of put everything on ice to address cash burn and get back on the path of profitability. So at our recent offsite, all these initiatives are being refreshed. And I can tell you, Andrew is stoked on getting going. So maybe, Andrew, maybe just -- I just wanted to give you some background that these things are just not new. These are things that have been in the hopper for at least 18 to 24 months. But Andrew, maybe just a little color on that.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Ben. Yes, Savi, I mean there's sort of 7 categories. And yes, some of them were there pre-pandemic that was ready, but there's also been big changes in our business like corporate contracts, TMC, American, oneworld, merchandising, and we've got some network restructuring and changes. So I think as we roll this out, but I feel very confident that it's almost like we're on the runway barreling down at full speed and then the pandemic hit. And we were so close to starting to roll some of these out. And now that demand is returning and our businesses is reestablishing, we're going to get to rolling these out.\nShane Tackett: So Savi, I'm going to jump in too, so you get all 3 of us on this. I just want to reiterate, the plan is sort of a 4- or 5-year plan. So we'll talk more about specific timing at an investor event, which we'll hold at some point in the next quarter or 2. But the whole -- the cost restructure plan and the commercial plan is really predicated on 2025 ultimately getting there. So I just don't want people to get too excited about next quarter on this stuff. But we are excited about the initiatives that we're going to be undertaking.\nOperator: The next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Andrew, have you ever contemplated -- you and your team ever contemplated like a fully transparent or predictable revenue management strategy, basically nondynamic pricing?\nAndrew Harrison: Hunter, I think no, is my short answer to that. But if you want to expand on your question, happy to give you more color.\nHunter Keay: That's fine. If the answer is no, then it's no. We'll talk about it some other time. But...\nAndrew Harrison: I think I would say like I think we do try to be simpler than a lot of other folks. I mean it is -- you don't -- I mean, you know this well. It's a complicated sort of discipline. But we were I think the first domestic airline to go to one-way fares. We have had a pretty small number of buckets relative to others. We've had sort of caps at the high end historically. And we have tried to be fair and simple with a lot of this stuff. But sort of a one-price-fits-all or something like that. I don't -- I think it's probably revenue negative. So we haven't really looked at that.\nBenito Minicucci: And it's all good to hear. I mean all similarly are thinking. So maybe following this, we can hear more.\nHunter Keay: Yes, let's talk about it some moment time. It will be -- I have some ideas. But anyway, one other question for you, Shane. You talked about pulling the Airbuses out. You mentioned supply chain disruptions. Are you suggesting there's some risk to the MAX delivery schedule?\nShane Tackett: Hunter, no, I mentioned that. We just met those -- I will tell -- I am 100% confident in Boeing's ability to deliver. Our view is that there are things right now in the economy with supply chains that some of us can't even see. Out of our control, out of Alaska's control, out of Boeing's control. And these Airbus, what it does, it just gives us dry powder to either backfill any issues that we may experience because of it. Or like Andrew said, we can grow up to 8% for the next summer of 2022. So again, with a prudent approach to capacity discipline. So it's just more arrows in our quiver for us to manage going forward.\nOperator: The next question is from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Shane, just following up on an earlier question, if capacity in summer 2022 is up 8%. What does CASMex look like in that environment?\nShane Tackett: Well, I'm just going to be careful. If we're up about 8% is the question, I don't know that it will be. But I think our view is by the middle of next year with sort of the full ramp of our cost restructuring initiatives, we're going to be in a really good place. We do expect to be at or below pre-COVID CASMex. Ultimately, we've said that from the very beginning. I don't know if we would hit it by next summer, but we should be there or getting very close to there. But I don't think I'll be more specific than that. It's -- I think we're going to have a really good cost structure.  One thing we know we're going to not do is lose sort of relative advantage to others in the industry. So we're super focused on this cost discipline and execution. The productivity stuff that we're seeing right now makes us very -- makes us feel very good about how we've executed to date.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Andrew, can you just talk about kind of customer behavior you're seeing? Like are folks flying more? Are they spending more than they did in 2019? Or is it just kind of compressing normal behavior into a tighter window? I'm just curious kind of what changes in behavior maybe beyond that you're seeing and the degree to which that speaks to kind of the sustainability of this leisure demand strength?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Thanks, Joe. I was just talking to my team yesterday about this. Looking out into the fourth quarter, I think what we're actually seeing, at least from our network's perspective, is actually people are booking earlier and further out than they were in 2019. So as we sit here today, we're seeing good intake volumes for the fourth quarter. And if you just take a look at our credit card spend and our loyalty portfolio, in fact, we have had -- we had the highest spend in this company's history this quarter on our credit card portfolio. So we're just seeing sustained strength. And honestly, as I look further out, it's still maintaining. So that's what I see today.\nOperator: The next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: So Ben, not so long ago, you and I were talking about when you might reintroduce pretax -- longer-term pretax margin targets and whether it would simply be the pre-COVID 13% to 15% or possibly something even better. In your prepared remarks today, I kind of thought that's where you were going, but you stopped short. What else do you need to see? Is it the macro environment? Is it Alaska-specific? Maybe it's related to future labor economics. I don't know, before you're comfortable replanting your margin flag, so to speak?\nBenito Minicucci: Jamie, it's a great question. I think what we need to see is just a little more stability in the economy. Like for example, you got this Delta variant there that might create some choppiness in the recovery. So I think we just want to be cautious. I mean, just from my perspective, I feel pretty confident that the worst is behind us. I think we've started with a strong pretax profit in June. And I think we should easily sustain it going forward. But I think we want a little more certainty, closer to the windshield, see what's going on out there with labor markets, with the return -- the strength of the economy, there's inflation, there's all these things. We just want to see this stuff settle down a little bit. And I think come Investor Day, I think we'll give you more information on that. We're giving more visibility. But it's like you said, we're slowly getting there. And I think today is as far as we want to go.\nJamie Baker: And as a follow-up, I think it was Joe's ex-fuel CASM question. Can you just review for us what the headwinds and tailwinds are? Because on my list, I have more entries in the tailwind category. But of course, not every entry is equally weighted. I'm just having a hard time coming up with anything that would prevent you from having modest to materially better ex-fuel CASM by next summer. So just looking for a little more color headwinds to tailwinds.\nBenito Minicucci: No. Thanks, Jamie. I do think it's capacity at the end of the day. The fixed costs are kind of stable. We like where they're at. A lot of the cuts that we did during the pandemic has held and we'll be very disciplined on that. The variable costs are coming back as we would expect ratably. And so to us, capacity is the biggest thing, just getting the ASMs back out there to cover fixed costs over. There's not a major headwind. We will see about -- there's going to be another sort of round of labor deals at some point. I don't know when those will happen, but a lot of groups were open across the industry, pre-pandemic, and it's hard to say when all that stuff will get going again. But my guess is that, that's going to be relatively equalized throughout the industry. So to us, it's just -- once we get back to our pre-pandemic level, we're going to be in a really good position, I think, from unit cost.\nOperator: The next question will come from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global.\nDaniel McKenzie: So I wanted to follow up on that question as well. Returning to industry-leading margins in the next cycle. That's what caught my ear in the prepared remarks. It sounds like from the last question that you can get back to your historical margins. Big picture, what are the biggest drivers for getting there? What are the biggest pieces to the Alaska story for achieving that? And I'm just wondering, maybe you could rank the revenue and commercial initiatives versus the cost initiatives? I mean there's a lot of new things in play for you guys in this next cycle that didn't exist in the last cycle.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. No, I appreciate it. One thing I'll just -- I just want to sort of go back to our performance this quarter, and I know it's all sort of recovery driven. But I do think posting the industry's best margin very close to breakeven in a quarter that started with very thin demand and very poor pricing. It just underscores the strength of the business and our ability to execute. And so we've got a lot of confidence as we go forward. I think, Dan, we laid out $265 million of cost reduction initiatives that we're well on our way to capturing. And then $300 million of revenue initiatives that we just talked about today.  Some of that was contemplated because we thought maybe the demand environment like passed down terms would be a little dampened coming out of COVID as it was in the last 2 big sort of industry downturns. And we wanted to be able to get back to pre-COVID margins irrespective of whether demand was down a bit. And it proves not to be down a bit, but it's just more upside for the company. And so I think those 2, $565 million or so of improvement to the business over the next few years relative to our pre-COVID baseline, that's what's going to drive this ultimately. We've got a great product. We have phenomenal employees, great customer service. We're on a good part of the country, a growing part of the country. So we're excited for things to stabilize, like Ben said, normalized business get back out there. And we're ready for the recovery.\nDaniel McKenzie: Understood. Second question here. One of the industry's strongest balance sheet, how are you thinking about using that in the next cycle? Is capital returns on the table sooner rather than later? Or does it make sense potentially to accelerate -- further accelerate some of the fleet replacement retirement upgauge to more efficient aircraft? How are you thinking about that balance sheet?\nNathaniel Pieper: Dan, it's Nat. Thanks for the question. I think from the balance sheet perspective, as Ben and Shane said, we're in pretty good shape from our historical debt-to-cap measures. We've got a $425 million facility. We'll look to repay in the next 90 days or so. And then I think going forward, it becomes a dilemma against repaying other debt, which really, in our situation, is pretty cheap rates, further investment in our business. And then, as you know, we've got the restriction on shareholder repayment until the end of September next year due to some of the government aid. So we'll balance all 3 of those things as we move forward.\nOperator: The next question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: So maybe kind of a follow-up to that question and maybe this also links to the revenue initiatives. But just how far paced are you willing -- off paced are you willing to go kind of with some of the new revenue initiatives and kind of deploying that balance sheet kind of -- are you looking at just sticking to the existing mousetrap and try to maximize opportunity? Or are you looking at completely different things?\nShane Tackett: This is -- sorry, the revenue initiatives. Ravi, I think most of it is that you would expect -- and Andrew mentioned and he can jump in again, but a new arm system, which ours was 20 years old, and we're excited to have the new one in place. There's a few things. I mean they're just -- we're not super excited to talk about, but distributing our premium economy cabin. Indirect channels, we only distribute prior and direct channels. The American, oneworld, WCI stuff, those are all sort of on the list of things that are going to contribute. I don't think we want to talk a whole lot about things that are new that we might be looking at or different today. But if we get closer to an investor event, we'll lay out sort of more clarity on all of these areas.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. I think you guys are doing a really good job of ramping up the excitement here. So looking forward to that. And maybe as a follow-up, kind of how would you describe the competitive environment out there right now? I mean, clearly, there's a lot of demand still concentrated in relatively narrow regions and there's a lot of capacity kind of going into that region. So how do you characterize the pricing environment this year?\nBenito Minicucci: Ray, I'll start and then I'll have Andrew jump in. I think we always expect competition in our markets is the West Coast. They're very competitive markets. Our mindset, again, as you see from where we were last year, how we brought back capacity, it's always been in a disciplined prudent approach. And I think that's the approach we're going to take. We have dry powder. We can scale it up or scale it back. We have a strong regional airline horizon that was just fantastic throughout this pandemic to fill in a lot of holes. So our view is just, again, a disciplined measured approach over the next 12 and 18 months. Andrew, anything? Does that make sense?\nOperator: The next question will come from Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners.\nConor Cunningham: The revenue stuff's great. I did have a question and I feel like you guys get basically every quarter. I mean there's been a big push from a premium perspective but from other carriers, and you had some recent changes in JFK. So it seems somewhat topical. With your focus just on higher-yielding passengers and corporate in general, has there been any reconsideration on revisiting the product in terms of dedicating more space to premium products or maybe even moving towards a live flat seat?  I would just imagine that corporates are asking for again. And the reason why I bring it up is you mentioned this A320 subset of aircraft, it seems like you could test something like that there. I know you have money -- I know that will cost money, but it seems like you have the balance sheet to do it. Just curious on your thoughts.\nAndrew Harrison: Conor, it's Andrew. A couple of quick things. Just to be clear on the LA movement. We just redistributed JFK slots across the rest of our network. We're still in Newark. So we still fly to New York City from LA. We've just reallocated those. I think on the product side, of course, like we're always looking at product. But I think we've got 12 and 16 seats in the front cabin. And if we did live flat, it would probably still be 12 and 16 seats. But we have big airplanes to fill. So I think where we're at right now is just to get back in the recovery stage. We still feel really good about our front cabin product that we continue to improve. We have the best pitch in the industry on traditional seats by none. And then our premium class cabin is also very generous. And I think a big thing for corporates, too, is our network utility. And I did touch on network, and I will say, we've done a lot of expansion on breadth over the years. We're going to focus more on depth frequency.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Great. And then on the American partnership. So I've been thinking a little bit about this a little bit more. But are you expecting your customers to build points and loyalty on your network and then burn them on Americans or maybe it's vice versa? Or does that even matter? I'm just curious like how that dynamic may play out when that starts to really ramp?\nAndrew Harrison: I think we have a lot of experience with this actually. We've had big relationships for decades. And I think at the end of the day, the customers will choose where they redeem and accrue miles under individual programs. And again, we just feel really confident and good about our West Coast network and footprint. And American has a big national and global footprint, and I think they work very well together. And I think both customers of Advantage and Mileage Plan are going to be a lot of opportunity in choice.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Shane, just a quick one right here. As best as I can tell, it seems like you're in the best position to get back to investment grade next. Is it a stated objective of the company to get to an IG rating? Where are you on that?\nShane Tackett: It's a stated annoyance that we're not an IG company. But yes. No, Mike, it's -- Nat and I are going to be talking about this. We need to go back in that direction. And it's -- we've got to figure out how to engage the agencies differently. But it's probably a ways away as they ultimately make all those decisions. But yes, we haven't publicly put it out there, but we certainly want to get there over time.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes. Look, the reason why I bring it out is there's a lot of carriers that they will tell you that they want to get back to investment grade-like metrics, and then they'll go out and lever up an airplane and borrow at a single A credit. But never actually really do the work that they need to do on their balance sheet. And so it does instill a level of discipline that I think many of us are hats off to a carrier like Delta who wants to get to the IG rating. So I'm just throwing it out there.\nShane Tackett: Got it.\nMichael Linenberg: Then just a second question here to Andrew. Andrew, you guys have done a fantastic job. I mean, I don't want to beat a dead horse on this revenue. But when I think about the fact that your entire carrier relies disproportionately on coastal hubs, which have underperformed a lot of the Mid-Con hubs. So you're already starting from a difficult position revenue-wise. And yet, you're right up there among the best in the industry.  Now I know you threw out -- you made the comment that there's been recalibration to the network. You talked about 50 net new city pairs. I'm curious how much of the revenue improvement is just a function of withdrawing from those markets that were underperforming. So I know you gave us a net number, but is there anything that you can give us to give us a sense of what markets that maybe you backed away from that just, they weren't working? And I know you mentioned like depth over breadth and doubling down on Seattle. So maybe I'm answering your question. It's a combination of all of that. But any additional color on that front would be great.\nAndrew Harrison: And every CEO, Ben and before, have held this strong belief. And I'm just going to be very transparent with you on this one is, its loyalty. I will tell you that never in my career, when you look at your network and specifically your areas of strength and there's unlimited seats given demand. And when you look at the T-100 data, and you see your load factors compared to your competitors' load factors. When there's unlimited seats to choose from, and you see your loads on multiples, you know loyalty is powerful. And I'm just going to be transparent, moving networks around is good, it's needed. But the strength of our loyalty and our guests and their commitment to us and what we hope to continue to invest in them on service, loyalty program and meeting their needs has just proven to be very, very strong for us.\nOperator: The final question is from Myles Walton with UBS.\nMyles Walton: I was hoping you could just clarify, I think you said 4Q you hope the mainline CASMex would be in line with 2019. Can you give us color on regional? And then on the fleet side, that 8% higher 2022 potentially is the exercise, is that similar to the number in the fleet as well, 8% higher than where you were? Or are you getting there through still down relative to the prior fleet levels?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. So Nat, you can maybe close the fleet levels. The 8% that was really enabled primarily by the reactivation of these Airbus for a short additional period of time. I just don't have the fleet count in my head for next year. And then on Q4, I just want to make sure we got it right, Myles. We're talking about December exit rate really focused on mainline getting to very close within a few points of pre-COVID unit costs. And I think we don't expect to have pre-COVID mainline capacity back yet. Regional side is a little bumpy, the sort of very rapid regrowth and hiring of pilots around the industry puts a little bit more pressure on both the ability to deploy capacity on the regional side and also needing to get out and start the hiring for the funnel for regional sooner.  So we're still working through that. Those numbers in terms of how many pilots airlines are going to hire have been changing a bunch. But that's going to be a headwind for the regional side of the business for a little bit here.\nNathaniel Pieper: Myles, on the aircraft side, we've got -- net 2022 is a big delivery year for us with 31 737-9s coming in, 13 regional jets as well. And so as we look forward with that and then start to phase out the A320s, we think those are all gone by the end of 2023 and with more 737-9s coming in there, too. So you've got some replacement naturally that's going to happen and then some growth as well.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the conference over to Ben Minicucci for any closing comments.\nBenito Minicucci: Well, thank you so much for everyone joining us this morning, and we'll talk to all of you soon. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. The call will be available for future playback at alaskaair.com. Ladies and gentlemen, you may all disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ALK", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-04-22 17:30:39", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Thea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group 2021 First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analyst. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Emily Halverson. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.\nEmily Halverson: Thank you, Thea and good morning. Thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, which is available at investor.alaskaair.com. On today's call, you'll hear updates from Ben in his new role as CEO and he will be joined by Andrew and Shane for commercial and financial update. Several others of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. Our business and outlook continue to be significantly impacted by the global health and economic crises that are underway. In the first quarter, Air Group reported an adjusted net loss, excluding special items and mark-to-market adjustments of $436 million. And we went from burning approximately $4 million a day last quarter to cash generation of approximately $1 million a day in March under the same definition. We believe we are among the first in the industry to have achieved this milestone. It marks a critical point in recovery that enables us to turn our attention to the future. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements about future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Emily and good morning, everyone. I appreciate all of you joining us today for an update on our business. As this is my first call as CEO, I thought I'd share some of my thinking and where I will spend my time, energy and focus over the next several years. I've been with Alaska for 17 years, I've come to know and love what our company is all about. Our people and our culture, our focus on safety and operational excellence, our reputation for customer service and our financial discipline and track record. Over the years, we have truly embraced that balanced approach to delivering for all stakeholders. And I will continue to nurture this approach and build on that legacy. But we also need to grow and do better in other areas that I look forward to developing, how we managed to reduce our climate impact, ensuring that Alaska is a place where everyone feels they belong and unlocking the power of our brand. In the short-term, however, our primary focus is on rebuilding our business to pre-COVID levels and returning to profitable growth. While Q1 results are far below normal levels it has marked an inflection point during this pandemic, and it appears that we have turned the corner in several key areas that I'll touch on in a moment. Before I dive into results, I want to welcome Constance von Muehlen in her role as Chief Operating Officer for Alaska Airlines succeeding Gary Beck. Constance has been with the company for 10 years and is an incredible leader. I know that she will do a fantastic job in this typical role. Onto the quarter recap, as momentum with vaccines has picked up and travel restrictions have eased, there has been a strong return of leisure demand. We've seen passenger enplanements moved from being down 65% in January to down 35% in April. Today's sustained future bookings are roughly 80% of pre-COVID levels. On the strength of these increased bookings and solid cost management against our plan we posted positive cash flow in March, excluding the impact of the PSP funding. Full quarter operating cash flow, inclusive of funds received under the PSP was positive $167 million. I'd like to take a moment to thank the employees at Alaska and Horizon for helping us get to this point. They've handled this long downturn with an incredible determination to keep our company moving and ready for a strong return of guests. Protecting the health and safety of our guests and employees while also protecting the financial health of our business has only been possible because of the collaborative efforts of our employees and labor leadership. During the quarter, our teams advanced several strategic efforts that are important to shaping our future. First, on March 31, we celebrated our official entry into oneworld. It was the culmination of a year of work by over 400 people across our company. And I want to specifically thank the IT and e-commerce teams for their incredible efforts to make this possible. Many other teams spend months working on this as well, including our crews and frontline teams who are helping guests navigate the changes we've put in place. Second, we received four 737-9 MAX aircraft, and have placed them into operating service. Despite the temporary grounding, which we expect to be resolved in the next week or two these aircraft had been very well received by our guests and our crews. By the end of 2022, we will have another 39 MAX 9s replacing the Airbus A319s and A320s that were retired from service last year. As you know, the MAX has 25% better fuel efficiency, lower maintenance costs and significant revenue opportunity with its higher gauge. The fuel efficiency of the MAX will also help us reduce our climate impact through lower emissions. And on that note, we've recently made new sustainability commitments, particularly focused on climate impact and racial equity. On climate, we announced yesterday, our long-term commitment and roadmap to net zero carbon emissions by 2040. We also set near-term goals for 2025 focused on being the most fuel efficient U.S. airline building on our culture of efficiency in every part of our system and continuing to electrify our GSE fleet. In February, we announced specific commitments for diversity, equity and inclusion, including the following goals: ensuring the diverse representation of our frontline as reflected in our senior leadership team, cultivating a truly inclusive culture and continuing to support education as a critical element of equity. We know we have not done enough in this area in the last 10 years and that we still have a lot of work ahead of us, but we're committed to making Alaska a place in which everyone feels they belong and can be their best. And to underscore the importance of climate and DEI commitments, we've tied a portion of executive at-risk pay to achieve diversity goals and our climate-related goals are [not] (ph) part of our performance based pay program that every employee participates in. As we look to the remainder of the year and beyond, we are focused on several important areas. First, maintaining balance sheet strength. Our adjusted net debt today is $1.6 billion, down from $1.7 billion at the end of 2019. As we bring capacity and costs back online, we will also prioritize reducing debt levels in the back half of the year. To the extent, the recovery is choppy or decelerates, we know having a strong balance sheet will provide foundational strength. Second, we are focused on returning capacity at a deliberate and responsible rate. As we laid out last year, we will fly 80% of 2019 levels this summer. We plan to return to 100% no later than summer of 2022. This trajectory is consistent with our preference to seek higher load factors than we're seeing today and allows us to make progress with pilot transition training to a mostly all Boeing fleet. Third, we are developing a roadmap back to profitability. Our fleet plan and cost restructure program are essential pieces of this roadmap. Our recent entry into oneworld will be instrumental, and we look forward to sharing a framework for the commercial contribution it will bring as we return to our pre-COVID size. In our forecast today, Q2 is approaching P&L breakeven and we anticipate turning into profitability in Q3. And it's worth reminding that nearly 50% of our traffic and revenues touch California on a pre-COVID basis. And then as you know, California remains largely closed today. Seeing the state reopen will be a powerful near-term enabler for our path back. As we manage these three important aspects of our business, we're cognizant that we may be faced with reasons to modify our plans. Let me state unequivocally that we have the balance sheet, cost structure and cash on hand to adjust our capacity trajectory and will do so if conditions merit. For example, if we saw more robust demand or an acceleration of the business recovery, we will adapt. The same is true, if we see competitive threats to our network or future growth. I know I speak for the whole management team in saying that turning the momentum we're experiencing today into earnings over the long-term is imperative. The work we are focused on, and this quarter's results are steps in the right direction. I truly believe Alaska is well positioned for the future. And with that, I'll pass it to Andrew who I know you have missed hearing from in the last few quarters.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. And it is great to be back speaking with you about the commercial side of our business. Although, we've still got a long climb ahead the momentum that we've seen in the past few months is really exciting as we've started to see demand return. First quarter revenues came in at $797 million, down 57.5% from the year over two. We also saw a sequential improvement in each month of the quarter with January revenues down 63%, February down 59% and March down, 52%. Passenger enplanements followed a similar trend. Our first-class cabin performed particularly well with revenues down 42% for March, which was 10 points better than system average, low fares resulting in high [paid] [(ph) load factors with the main drivers. Our overall revenue results looked to be amongst the strongest in the industry, despite as been noted California demand remaining seriously impaired. To provide perspective on this, the 54% reduction in California bookings during the first quarter versus 2019 were down nearly two times that of the non-California system average. We expect California to experience a step change in performance by mid-June, which is when the governor has targeted to fully open California's economy. Capacity was 33% below 2019 levels, which was three points worse than we'd expected. This was primarily caused by cancellations from a severe winter storm across the Pacific Northwest over President's Day holiday. For the quarter, our load factor was 52%, which is up seven points from Q4 on 9 points more capacity aided by a move to unblock middle seats beginning in January. This has been really helpful as demand returns. In March, 41% of our mainline departures carried over and above what our load factor caps would have allowed if middle seat blocks have remained in place. Taking a look at the quarter, load factor accelerated from 42% in January to 49% in February and to 62% in March. Notwithstanding, we added 20,000 more daily seats in March compared to January. This momentum has continued into April, where we expect to get close to a 70% load factor. May is also building at a higher right than April was at this same time last month. Turning to bookings. Recent data indicates enplanement trends should continue to improve. We began the quarter in January with an average of around 60,000 bookings a day, or about 43% of 2019 levels. Booking stepped to approximately 60% of 2019 levels in February, and then 75% in March. The sequential improvement in year over two-year bookings trends has continued into April. With demand and passenger enplanements up as much as we're seeing and the opening of middle seats, I do want to highlight that our Alaska Listens survey for first quarter continued to show over 80% of guests give us an excellent or very good ratings on health and safety. Additionally, our customer satisfaction scores remained higher than they were pre-pandemic. I'd like to personally thank our frontline and crews for making this happen and ensuring our guests feel safe and comfortable, even though loads have been increasing and we no longer block middle seats in the main cabin. Touching briefly on pricing, yields were 11% below 2019 levels this quarter in part because of the promotional efforts that we use to stimulate demand for January and February which are traditionally our weakest months of the year, the pandemic making them especially so. Price volatility is likely an issue we will continue to face in this recovery. As we look towards summer, we are seeing yields improving with demand, while our bias is towards flying full of planes, we are clear-eyed about the need to increase yields as we navigate back to our pre-COVID size. A bright spot during the last year has being our loyalty program. Total mileage plan revenues were down just 32% during the quarter, and cash brought in from the bank to compensate us for miles earned on our card surpassed 2019 levels in March. Credit card holders also showed modest growth since the end of 2020, increasing by about 0.5 point. As we see demand return, our teams have started to focus more acutely on the commercial opportunities in front of us. We are picking up from where we left off in 2019 if you will. Three immediate opportunities for 2021 and beyond have already been put in place. Firstly, tapping into the unique benefits around American and oneworld alliances; the increased breadth and depth that we can offer guest is the next level, creating value from both a network revenue and loyalty revenue perspective. Secondly, implementation of a new RM system, including fare classes that align with our oneworld partners and affords us additional selling classes in the premium cabin. And then thirdly, greater access to managed corporate accounts, as we now provide much greater utility with our domestic partnership with American and our global partners with oneworld loyalty benefits. We finally resolved a long time issue for our corporate guests by now having a seamless global program in place. As we look forward, we believe the continuation of the return of demand supports our plans to add back capacity in our strongest hubs in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, then ultimately California as it begins to relax restrictions. Business travel remains severely depressed during the quarter, and our quarterly surveys of corporate customers reinforced our belief that business travel will ramp to about 50% of normal levels by the end of this year. That said, we've seen a 4.6 point improvement in our share gap in the year over two in the first two months of this year for our managed corporate accounts. Consistent with all I've shared, we remain committed to fly approximately 80% of 2019 levels in the second quarter. And total revenues are expected to be down 32% to down 37% versus 2019. For the second quarter, we expect load factor to be between 70% and 75%. While this pandemic has thrown a litany of challenges our way, I do believe that as vaccines continue to roll out, which has resulted in demand being less and less impacted by case counts excuse me, we have line of sight to rebuilding our business. Our network, product, fares, loyalty program and commitment to guest service and care are all configured to bring us out of this even stronger than we went in. And with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will touch on our cash flows, liquidity and our balance sheet, as well as costs and expectations for the second quarter. This quarter felt very much like a turning point away from purely trying to survive and toward rebuilding our business, bringing people in flying back and beginning to chart a path back to profits and growth. While we reported an adjusted net loss this quarter of $436 million, we were able to generate positive GAAP operating cash flows for the quarter, and positive adjusted cash flows in March, even excluding CARES payroll support grant. Our air traffic liability increased by $224 million or 21%, reflecting the step-change improvement in demand the industry is currently seeing. Travel credits now represent 37% of our ATL, down from 53% at year end. We exited the quarter with an improved adjusted net debt result, which was down from $1.7 billion at the end of 2020 to just under $1.6 billion. And our debt to cap increased only 1 point to 62%, which we believe will be the high watermark for our debt to cap metrics, and that we will see it reduce from here. We also continue to hold $3.5 billion in on-hand liquidity. Given booking trends and our balance sheet health, I anticipate that we will begin reducing our cash balance by retiring debt during the second half of the year, also ultimately moving towards on-hand liquidity in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Having heard from Andrew about the commercial progress we saw in the quarter, let me turn to cost performance. We had several areas of good performance and some we need to drive more improvement in. Adjusted non-fuel operating expenses were $1.14 billion, an increase of $43 million or 3.9% sequentially versus Q4 2020, while capacity increased 8%. As mentioned, for the quarter we saw strong cost performance in several areas of the business, as we beat the cost plan we set out for our divisions. Areas of particular strength included a overhead spend, productivity in our airport ramp and aircraft mechanic groups, further progress against long-term structural cost savings and regional flying unit costs, which were nearly flat year over two with especially solid cost performance at Horizon. As we bring back capacity further, we now need to work on improving our crew productivity, which is challenged by recall training, our fleet transition and flying that is not balanced by crew base relative to our pre-COVID schedule. Speaking of recalls for a second, we were able to welcome 1,500 additional employees back from leave this quarter. We're excited to have our employees back and appreciate what they've done to support the company and their colleagues during the worst of most uncertain periods of the downturn. A primary area of cost headwind right now, are airport costs, as a material share of these costs are not variable with volume. In Q1, airport costs were down just 2.6%, on 27% fewer departure volumes, and we continue to see pressure in this area in Q2. Airport leaders were great partnering with the industry last year to manage these costs down and given they have received additional funds under the American Rescue Plan Act, we are anxious to work with them to use these funds to offset costs again in 2021, as they were able to in 2020. In Seattle, specifically, we have a unique $30 million cost headwind versus 2019, related to the sunsetting of a lease provision that previously provided for sharing concession revenues as part of the lease agreement that carriers agreed to in 2018. I also want to share some additional context on two other costs categories, maintenance expense and variable pay expenses. Regarding maintenance, we are not actively deferring maintenance on our operating fleets, and today, we are operating our entire regional and our entire Boeing fleet. Due to this, we won't have a pent-up maintenance backlog going forward, and as such, we expect relatively smooth maintenance costs through the year. And lastly, more as a reminder than anything, we continue to utilize our longstanding performance-based pay program to align employees on the goals that are key to our short and long-term success. I believe we may be the only airline right now with continued incentive pay accruals. And in the quarter we accrued $33.5 million for our monthly operational goals program and a potential payout under the annual PBP plan early next year. Looking ahead, we expect continued sequential unit cost improvement with an increase in Q2 of 15% to 17% versus 2019. As I just mentioned, our cost forecast includes an assumption that employees will continue to earn a payout under the performance-based pay program. And it also includes the 3 point headwind specific to Seattle\u2019s airport costs. We expect the sequential improvement versus 2019 to continue throughout the year as more capacity comes back and as we make gain towards the structural cost initiatives we've outlined in previous calls. We do expect to return to pre-COVID unit costs or better at some point in the next several quarters. Lastly on guidance, I expect Q2 GAAP operating cash flow will be approximately $450 million to $550 million, which reflects an improvement of $200 million to $300 million versus Q1 solely associated with the recovery of the business. This guidance is inclusive of the grant portion of the third CARES act PSP program. To close, we are proud of the work our Alaska and Horizon teams did this past year to manage through the worst depths of the pandemic induced crisis, and we are now hopeful that we can completely focus from here forward on rebuilding our network and our margin profiles, then growing and returning to balanced capital allocation. We are fortunate to be well-positioned coming into the initial part of recovery. We have a strong balance sheet that should continue to improve throughout the year. We have a competitive advantage in our cost structure that we will continue to work to improve over this year, and next. And we are on the path to get all of our folks back ready to welcome guests as they get flying again. With that let's turn to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning everyone, and thanks for the questions. As first question for Andrew. Just wanted to touch on Hawaii. It is clearly market it's opening. It's all leisure. What percentage of your ASMs will be here in 2021? And do you think it will have better, worse, or the same margins relative to the system as compared to pre-pandemic?\nAndrew Harrison: Hey, Andrew, I'm not going to comment on margins, but Hawaii for the next little bit here gets about 15% of our capacity. And what we have seen is that and the same with Mexico a little bit is that the testing and all the requirements they have seem to be working fairly smoothly. So, demand in Hawaii is solid.\nAndrew Didora: And how do you see the competitive response on those Hawaii routes?\nAndrew Harrison: I'm not, as far as competitive response specifically, what are you referring to?\nAndrew Didora: Is competitive capacity?\nAndrew Harrison: I see. Well, what I can tell you is that from where we sit and our loyalty we've been very good. We think by this summer we'll be up to our pre-pandemic frequencies of about 32 a day, and given where we focus our flying we feel very good about the seats and it's performing well.\nBen Minicucci: Hi, Andrew, this is Ben. I think we have the perfect product for Hawaii to compete. We got a strong first-class product. We have a premium product that people love, a generous main cabin with great service and we're starting to bring our product back. So we have the perfect product to compete on our Hawaii routes.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. And just secondly for Shane. I know in the past, Alaska has hedged fuel a bit more from using as call options as insurance. Do you have any hedges on right now? And are there any internal discussions on maybe stepping that back up today given where fuel has gone? Thanks.\nShane Tackett: Andrew, good to talk to you. Yes, we actually never did anything different with our hedging program throughout the pandemic. So we were over hedged last year, obviously, as capacity came way down and we had already put a lot of positions on for last year. I think right now we're back to our normal cadence, about 18 months in advance of the quarter. We start layering on hedges up to about 50% of expected consumption, 20% out of the money. That's what we've done for the past several years. Strangely enough, we did ask ourselves should we change our program or do something differently. Just in the past several weeks and all of the data that we looked at suggests that we really like our program, how it is and we don't plan to change it from here forward.\nAndrew Didora: That's great. Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: The next question will come from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. So hoping you could just touch on the California reopening? And I know it's only going to capture a little bit of the June quarter. But as you look to the bookings trends in July and August are you seeing the population moving in advance or are kind of sitting on their hands waiting for final confirmation? And moreover, what does it imply just early reads about what you're going to do with the network into 3Q?\nBen Minicucci: Yes, thanks, Myles. I think you know California slowly coming back. We're obviously seeing an improvement in bookings. But we feel pretty good about the way we've structured our network. About a fifth of our ASMs in the second quarter will be in California. And we're still going to be down 50% in capacity. So we have plenty of room on the airplanes. And I think we're just seeing increasing trends, but come June will be the real telltale about how big that step change is.\nMyles Walton: And one quick \u2013\nBen Minicucci: Go ahead.\nMyles Walton: And maybe one quick one on loyalty. You mentioned that oneworld, you're going to lay out an economic framework or contribution framework at a future date, but given you planted a seed, I'll ask you to water a little. Can you comment on how much of that economic contribution framework will be indirectly or directly through the loyalty versus through the network? Thanks.\nBen Minicucci: Yes, we're going to comment on that a little later date. Obviously, international travel is basically next to nothing but we both domestic and international and I think overall, certainly on the loyalty side, you're going to be \u2013 that's a very, very strong area for us. Corporate business another very strong area for us. And then of course the incremental network passengers from international, and of course just our joint domestic partnership with American as well. So good things there.\nOperator: The next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning everyone.\nBen Minicucci: Hey, Savi.\nSavi Syth: Prior to the crisis, you were working on getting pre-tax margins to 13% to 15%. I wonder if you could provide an update on your, kind of ability to get there eventually and especially business demand isn't going to fully recover to pre-crisis levels in 2022 or 2023?\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Savi. These are some questions to get to talk about future profit margins that reflect sort of pre-COVID level. We have it, Ben mentioned in the script of roadmap back to profitability. And as you know, a long time ago, we said 10% as a minimum threshold and we've talked a lot about 13% to 15% as a normal sort of level that we think is appropriate in the industry. To the degree that the economic backdrop sort of helps support those levels we certainly expect to be one of the top margin players in the industry, and we do want to get back into that range. I think it's a little early to talk about like when that could happen. And if it's clearly going to happen, I keep thinking we'd like to get through this sort of initial pent-up demand surge and into the back half of the year to see where business travel kind of shapes up to your point. And then I think we'll have a better picture of ultimately where margins may shake out, but we're not abandoning that goal at all. We think long-term it's a place the industry could, can and should be, and we should be amongst the leaders from a margin perspective.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful Shane. And maybe if I can follow up just a little bit on your comment about kind of getting back to that. But getting to like a $2 billion to $2.5 billion liquidity target. Just wondering where the logic behind kind of that level versus something else?\nShane Tackett: Yes, no, it's, look, it's a little bit judgment and instinct and if there was another unexpected big step back, we don't want to be scrambling. So we've been talking a lot about this. If cash flow generation continues to improve in Q3 and Q4 advanced bookings are good, some business travel comes back, we could see ourselves going on the lower end of that. I think what we've committed to internally right now is no lower than $2 billion coming out of this year. We have a big capital commitment next year and so we want to be mindful of that as well, Savi. But we're well above our normal sort of need for cash right now. I don't know if we\u2019ll ultimately go back to 1.2 to 1.5, that's something that I think will be sort of thinking about and making decisions about in the next six months, or so.\nSavi Syth: Sounds, good. Thank you.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Savi.\nOperator: The next question will come from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hello, thanks, guys. Good morning. Andrew, how effective is Alaska at monetizing customers outside of the airplane? You all obviously are pretty effective with Bank of America. I'm curious what you think the opportunity is beyond the co-brand partnership?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, you're talking about really merchandising and up-selling that type of thing \u2026?\nJoseph DeNardi: Sure, other partnerships, just finding other ways to use data to, yeah, kind of market your loyalty customers outside of the credit card?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. We've been doing a lot of work on the digital side on as.com. We become experts in promotions over the last six months and the team is getting very sophisticated on how we go about doing that on the programs we do that. We also have other things like premium class is going to become a cabin just like first-class and we see opportunity there. Our first-class product now is what we call J Class which historically it was [F] (ph) so I think corporate customers are going to have greater access. And I think we're working on a number of things and as shared in this script, we'll lay more of this out as we move deeper into the year, but we have a lot of revenue upside benefits outside the core coupon ticket that we're working on.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then, Ben you mentioned one of the strategic priorities is maximizing the value of the brand. I think is what you said that piqued my interest shockingly. So, what did you mean by that? Thank you.\nBen Minicucci: Yes, no, I appreciate it, Joe. Look I'm a big believer in Alaska. And if you look at the strength we have in the Pacific Northwest and the state of Alaska and the loyalty and love for our brand, I just think there is huge potential in unlocking this brand more than we have in California and across the countries. So this brand is powerful when people get to know it, when people fly us, they love us, they love our people who just done a wonderful job every day. And so I just think there is a lot of this brand can offer once people get to know it more.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Shane, you talked about some accruals, I think for hitting your operations target as well as maybe some profit share. What are the circumstances under which you would be paying for profit sharing early next year?\nShane Tackett: Hey, Duane. Good to hear from you. Yes, so our PPP plan always has multiple components profit is the typically largest component under that program and we don't expect honestly to pay out under that particular metric. We didn't change the threshold target or max. So we would have to hit a full year pre-tax margin of 5% to pay out for profits. But we also have operating cash flow goals in the program this year. We've got carbon reduction goals. We've got cost-related goals around productivity and safety goals. And the company is, folks are doing a really good job against each one of those right now. So those are the potential areas, I think that we see a potential payout.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's great. I wanted to make sure I wasn't reading too far into it. And then may be just across the network is there anything you're seeing on a revenue basis that's up at this point relative to 2019? And I wondered if you talk about bookings into state of Alaska? Thanks for taking the questions.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, Thanks, Duane. You know it's - the network obviously it's stronger in some areas and others - we're not at prior pre-pandemic load factors. We have a couple of regions now that are into the 80% but of course the fares and the yields are not where they were back in 2019. So, overall across our network revenues are building. State of Alaska, there is obviously incremental capacity coming in this summer, but we feel really good about our network for this summer, and we love our brand and we've been marketing it well. So we see Alaska being a good story this summer for us.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Duane.\nOperator: The next question will come from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time. So two questions. So, I'm wondering if you could tell us how you're going to measure the carbon goals for your profit sharing? How should we track that, or how are you - actually more importantly, how are you tracking that?\nAndrew Harrison: So, and I'll let Diana jump in a second. So it's really important on the climate Helane that we have two short-term goals, only have two goals. One is the long-term goal 2040, where carbon emissions we target to be zero, Diana speak to that in a second. Then the short-term goal, which is being the most fuel-efficient airline in the next five years, which is what Shane was referring to we've tied our performance based pay program where we're going to measure carbon impact per ASM. So that's how we're going to measure that short-term goal, and every employee in the company is going to be measured on that. That will be 10% of the payout for our PPP. But, Diana could you share a little more on the 2014 how we're going to do that?\nDiana Birkett Rakow: Sure. I think Helane was asking \u2013 just to clarify Helane, you were just asking about the PPP goal in our employee based pay plan, which is as Ben said pounds of CO2 per ASM.\nHelane Becker: Right. Exactly. Like I\u2019m just trying to figure out how you're going to measure that. So that's the answer, right, pounds of CO2 per ASM, and the goal is to just lower it.\nDiana Birkett Rakow: Got it. Yes. And it's based on fuel use. So we set a target based on our \u2013 looking at our budgeted ASMs and our budgeted fuel use and we are aiming to reduce carbon emissions from year-over-year from what we would predict would be flat.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then my other question is, I'm wondering, if completely unrelated to environment, can you \u2013 Andrew, could you do like a bridge to how you're thinking about raising yields? I know it's, you know, in part, based on demand, but how are you given the lag between bookings and pricing, how should we think about fares trending this summer, and a bridge from maybe where you are to where you want to be, which would be say pre-pandemic levels.\nAndrew Harrison: Sure. Yes, well, a couple of things on yield that affects Helane as you know. You can push yield up with more volumes of business travel and to-date that's really significantly down. And you can push yield up when flights gets pull up. And so you're exactly right. We've built our base with bookings that would during really low booking period and stimulation in getting a good base. So what we're seeing right now is that as we move forward into the second quarter and certainly into the third quarter we bringing in new traffic, and you've heard others comment and it's the same for us too that the yield and average fares coming in summer right now for our peak flights are actually higher than 2019. So I think you're going to see a sure but stable climb, but I will say that a lot of this is dependent on business traffic, and of course capacity. We all know what everyone's flying in May. We sort of see June. But beyond that, we haven't seen proper schedules load and that will also dictate on what happens with yields.\nHelane Becker: Great, thanks very much, Andrew. Thanks, team.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Can you be a little bit more specific as to the milestones you need to achieve before you begin returning capital to shareholders? Obviously, acknowledging the PSP restrictions that are in place. Just wondering what internal metrics or milestones you're looking for.\nNat Pieper: Hey, Jamie, it's Nat Pieper. As you know, taking care of our shareholders has always been a core priority for us as we run our business. And I have to take the opportunity to remind you that we're proud \u2013 we didn't issue equity or dilute our shareholders to raise funds through the pandemic. And we want to restart shareholder returns as soon as it makes sense. Like most things here, we have a checklist to complete before doing so, and these items won't be a surprise for you. Balance sheet strength to get in debt-to-cap back in its target levels, positive cash flow and sustained profitability. So really once Ben and our Board gives us an A on the checklist, I\u2019d anticipate re-engagement in that area. You're right that we've got government restrictions as well on both buybacks and dividends until September of 2022, due to the PSP triumvirate. And we'll balance that too.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. And second, your comments earlier about first-class yield momentum, I found that interesting, the Transcon premium market continues to improve from a passenger perspective. You got Delta 764s now that are flying with, what I call sort of this pseudo suite product, mint is getting a refresh. Is there anything happening in the premium Transcon market that might make you revisit your decision to exit, or are you still happier than ever with that decision?\nAndrew Harrison: So I think, Jamie, you're referring to maybe lie-flat seats. Here's what I will tell you about, on the first class cabin, our product is made for the conditions that we have today. We have 12 and 16 seats, the largest pitch for non-lie-flat seats in the industry. And we've been really focusing on selling demand into those seats. And Ben mentioned before, Hawaii has been a very strong point for us. On the Transcon right now, even if you look into sort of May \u2013 our capacity is down 70% because the demand is not there right now. So we're seeing first-class perform on our Hawaii flights, on our north/south flights and that sort of thing. So it's just been the perfect product and people are willing to buy up right now with good low fare. So it's a good new story.\nShane Tackett: Jamie, this is Shane. I'll just \u2013 on the actual like, no, we're totally happy with our decision to not have moved into that market. It makes sense for certain carriers to do it. It didn't make sense for us. We'd have to sell three quarters of those $1,000 or better. It's just not the model we have. And we don't really like selling $1,000 fares anyway, we like to make a lot of money selling lower fares. So we're feeling very good about our decision.\nJamie Baker: All right, strong answers on both topics. Thanks, gentlemen. Take care.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks Jamie.\nShane Tackett: Thanks Jamie.\nOperator: The next question will come from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey everyone. Thanks for the time. I think my first one is probably for Shane. On your CapEx outlook, I just wanted to confirm that $150 million to $200 million is gross CapEx, and that's not net of any financing on aircraft from Alaska's order book. And then based on the deposits Boeing already has from Alaska. And I'm guessing some negotiations around purchase price, given the MAX grounding and your new order, when do you work through those deposits and what will CapEx look like over the next couple of years?\nShane Tackett: Yes, thanks Katie. I'm going to have Nat help out on this, but I'll answer the really hard one first. Yes, it's gross CapEx, it's not net. I\u2019ll give this one to Nat.\nNat Pieper: Awesome, delegation. I think in this year with that PDP balance and Katie, as we talked about in previous quarter, when we made that order, all of our 2021 obligations related to it are taken care of. So very little, if any cash out for 2021 airplanes. In 2022, we've been public with a CapEx number of 1.3 billion or 1.4 billion and that's 31 airplanes coming in 2022. We have as part of our negotiation with Boeing, restructured our PDP pool a bit. And so we'll be using that leverage appropriately as well. So we're comfortable with where that sits. And we're also comfortable even though that is a big requirement in 2022, we can achieve that and still get our balance sheet strength back to the levels that we want to retain.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. And then maybe one for Andrew, it sounds like there's definitely more to come on this, but a question on American and oneworld partnerships, just like a higher level theoretical question. As international and corporate ultimately start to recover and you potentially see your corporate share improve, a couple of some of the new RM changes you also spoke about, should we expect Alaska to just be a higher yield carrier, ultimately post-COVID versus pre-COVID, kind of assuming maybe all else equal on the leisure side of the business, just for ease of this question?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Thanks Katie. My view is absolutely yes. Given the things that have been put in place that give us access on the corporate side, I do believe that our share will grow even as I said already, seeing it even on low numbers in that first part of this year that will attract high yielding traffic as business demand returns.\nCatherine O'Brien: Great. Thanks.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Katie.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Hey, good morning, everybody. So Ben, last June, you made a prediction that 2021 revenue would be down 20% to 35%, which was actually an amazingly pretty good guess. I don't know how you did that, how you knew that man, but given your track record as you look at 2022, do you think it will be up relative to 2019?\nBen Minicucci: What I'll say, it's all an ops background, Hunter that helps me with the financials. You know what, Hunter, the way we looked at stuff is we try and be realistic with what we see. So as we look into this fall, it's hard to see what's exactly going to happen, but we can make some solid predictions. We know leisure demand is coming back for us pretty much at 100%. We're at 25% of business right now, we probably will see a step change in business demand by the end of the year, as the vaccines roll out and businesses relaxed the restrictions. So that should double, it should be 50% is what we're predicting for business demand by the end of the year. And so we should see it much higher than the first and second quarter. So we should be getting close to where we are in 2022. I'm not going to give you a number but we feel good about 2022, and we're trying to set up ourselves in 2021, just to solidify that road back to profitability, get all this transition training done so that we can fire on all cylinders in 2022.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And then Shane, just to follow up on Jamie's question a little bit, you talked about balanced capital allocation. How do you think that term is going to change from pre-COVID to post-COVID? Is it rather than paying some nominal dividend? Is it maybe, hey, this makes more sense to think about like investing in the product a little bit more post-COVID or doubling down on the repo. I don't know, whatever it might be, or just paying down debt, like, how does the term balance capital allocation change in two years relative to what it was in 2018, 2019?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Thanks Hunter. These are \u2013 I really love your questions. You guys usually prompt us to go back and think about things a little bit more. This isn't something that this is a little bit off the cuff. So I want you to know that. I don't \u2013 I'm guessing it's going to be a tweak more than an overhaul. In our basic approach, historically has been get the balance sheet to our target range and then make sure we're growing at an appropriate rate, 4% to 8% annually. And then fund pensions robustly and then make sure we're returning to shareholders. And we sort of liked the set up where we had a dividend and then we topped off with share repos. And I think that's our default, as we go forward, I know it's not like sexy or something because it's not exotic or new. I do get the question though, that there are certain areas of the business that coming out of COVID we'll see if the market and expectations changed from a customer perspective. Certainly things around cleanliness and sort of feeling of safety, we're making investments in although. Now those are things that we've been doing this past year and they'll just stick with us. And I don't really view that necessarily as capital allocation, but I think it'll \u2013 our mindset is mostly returning to kind of where we were before. And we'll adjust as we learn things going forward. Anyhow, yes, that's kind of where my head is at on that right now.\nHunter Keay: No, that's great. Helpful. Thank you everybody.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning, everyone. I guess, just two here. One, Shane, where are we on \u2013 the secured loan with the CARES Act. The second one, I may have missed it, but I know you had drawn down a piece and there was like another $1.7 billion. What's the status on that\u2026?\nShane Tackett: You got it right, Mike. I don\u2019t know how you get to keep all this stuff straight. Because sometimes we have to \u2013 because we struggle too, but yes, we had to take a portion of that loan down by law initially about $135 million that remains outstanding. And then we have access to another $1.7 billion through May. I don't see really any scenario where we'll tap our access, that $1.7 billion. But we have until May, so we haven't formally made a decision on that quite yet.\nMike Linenberg: Which then leads to me to ask that I think the plan was that loyalty would feature into something along those lines. And if you don't tap it, are you still considering loyalty or maybe I can answer the question. It sounds like you're done with everything on the financing side. Is that right?\nShane Tackett: You got it.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Great. And then just my second question to Andrew. Andrew, you gave us a little sliver of information on your improvement in corporate share. And I realized, the March quarter of 2021 is probably not all that representative of a normal quarter because of COVID. But the fact is, the American agreement I believe has now been in place I think for almost a year, maybe it has been a year. Can you just give us maybe some other quick wins, like in the past you talk about whether number of passengers connecting on a daily basis, or in the past we've heard airlines say three to four or five load factor points are attributable to the code share agreement, et cetera. Anything else that maybe you saw in the earlier part of the agreement? Although again, I do realize it came into place in COVID.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think more to come on that Mike, I think just the networks and the demand and everything, but here's what I will say is that from a joint contracting perspective, there's been overwhelming engagement of corporate contracts wanting to jointly contract with us in American, given the joint utility and opportunity we give them we've seen very positive and strong guest feedback from our guests around getting back American and their ability to accrual and redeem miles. We have full access back behind from the Pacific Northwest, through mid connecting hubs in the U.S. and even California through Chicago. So there's a lot of good things, but to your point until demand and the water starts flowing through the pipes, we won't to see the true benefit, but we're ready for it when it comes.\nMike Linenberg: Fair enough. Great. Thanks everyone.\nShane Tackett: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: The next question will come from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nDan McKenzie: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess, just a question on the balance sheet targets, just following up on some of the prior questions. I'm wondering what the timeframe is, in the back of your mind to get to that target. And I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the step up in CapEx next year with where you want the balance sheet to be ultimately?\nNat Pieper: Dan, it's Nat. I think as we move over the next 12 to 15 months and obviously, there's revenue and positive cash flow coming in as part of that and assumptions we're making as we see it. But I see us by the latter stages of 2022 being in the region that we want to be from a debt to cap perspective and that's inclusive of the CapEx requirements we discussed for 2022.\nDan McKenzie: Got it. Okay. And then as we move past 2022 as you've got the step up in CapEx, how should we think about what a normalized CapEx would look for you guys in the context of 4% to 8% growth?\nShane Tackett: Hey, Dan, that's a great question. Let us come back to you on that. I just want to, as we're in the middle of the fleet transition, I just want to make sure we've got really, really good data on how many planes are going out and coming in 2023 and 2024, as we shift the schedule around. But I think we basically need to replace 60 aircraft over the next couple of years. And then we need to add about 10 to 12 units a year relative to our pre-COVID mainline fleet size, which was 235 in order to kind of maintain that range. So I'm just \u2013 I sort of know all the math but I want to make sure we get you a tight answer on it. It's a good question.\nDan McKenzie: Very good. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the time, guys.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the conference over to Ben Minicucci for any closing comments.\nBen Minicucci: Thank you, everyone for joining us. If you have any other questions, please reach out to our IR folks. Have a great day and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

My name is Sia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group 2020 Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analyst. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director, Investor Relations, Emily Halverson. Please go ahead.\nEmily Halverson: Thank you, Sia, and good morning. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. This morning we issued our earnings release, which is available at investor.alaskaair.com. On today's call, you'll hear updates from Brad, Ben and Shane. Several others of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. Our business and outlook continue to be significantly impacted by the global health and economic crises that are underway. In the fourth quarter, Air Group reported and adjusted net loss excluding special items and mark-to-market adjustments of $316 million. Special items this quarter include $255 million of impairment and estimate at least return charges that were triggered as a result of certain aircraft being permanently parked. $22 million of benefit related to the first CARES Act payroll support program wage offset and $102 million benefit resulting from the expectation that certain employees will eventually be returning from long-term leave early. Our average daily cash burn for the quarter was approximately $3.8 million. This call marks the end of an unprecedented year, but also a few other important milestones as well. Brad has been with Alaska for 30 years serving as the CEO for the last eight and this will be his final time speaking as CEO to our investor audience, as he will be retiring on March 31 and handing this license over to Ben. Today also happens to be Andrew Harrison\u2019s birthday. Please join me for wishing both Andrew and Brad the best.  Our comments today will include forward-looking statements about future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We'll also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Emily. And I had actually forgotten that today is Andrew's birthday, so happy birthday for me as well Andrew, and good morning to all of you. As everybody knows, we are roughly a year into this difficult COVID crisis, which has put virtually every airline around the world to the test. We've seen a lot of challenges over our 88 years at Alaska, but none has driven such a deep and prolonged disruption as this one. Our people rose to this challenge that they've done countless times before and the rest of the leadership team and I want to thank them for everything they've done and everything they're doing to ensure that Alaska emerges from this crisis better and stronger. We'll talk about those things on this call. From the onset of the pandemic through this uneven recovery, we've remained focused on two priorities. First, the health and safety of our employees and our guests, and second ensuring our airline comes out of this crisis strong and ideally in a better position competitively than when we entered it. These remain our priorities today. Our COVID work streams continue to align our actions around these two priorities. On the safety front, our next level of care program is providing guests with the confidence they need to fly. You know about the many measures we've implemented. We've received external recognition for these, but we also know that our guests who are flying with us are having a very positive experience.  And our fourth quarter Alaska listened survey 87% of our guests gave us excellent or very good ratings on health and safety. And more broadly, our customer satisfaction scores have reached all time highs in the last few months. One of the great things about Alaska is that often our leaders figure out where we're going to head next and our people figure out how to get us there. That is certainly the case with our health and safety practices. If you haven't had a chance to view our safety dance video, we recommend it. We provided a link in today's press release.  For some time now, we've been analyzing our fleets and determine the best path forward. We were anxious to see if we could use this downturn to reconfigure ourselves and to come to market with a more simple and streamlined fleet. We were pleased in the last couple of months to bring two transactions to ahead. First, we sold our 10 owned A320s. And second we reached terms on a restructured and enhanced order with Boeing for 68 new 737-9 aircraft. That will get us largely out of the Airbus fleet by the summer of 2023 and that will provide a host of other benefits. Shane will talk more about this.  Our customers and employees care greatly about Alaska being a clear leader in the effort to reduce emissions and our carbon impact. And this is especially true given our presence on the West Coast. We have long led the industry or been on the top couple of airlines in terms of carbon emissions per passenger. And these fleet moves will do nothing but further our lead. From a financial perspective, there's so much we could talk about, but I really want to focus all of us on just two numbers. First, our revenues for 2020 were down a staggering $5.2 billion or 59% as a result of COVID. But second, our total debt factoring in lease obligations and backing out cash on hand is essentially unchanged from last year. I've watched the industry and our company for my entire career and I can't remember a time when two numbers stood in such stark contrast.  Shane will describe this further, but from my part, I want to thank the extraordinary leadership team at Alaska and horizon for aggressively reducing our spending both in variable and fixed areas and I also want to thank them for running our business profitably over the years such that our starting point was a strong balance sheet and robust cash flows from operations. I also want to thank the terrific employees of Alaska Air Group for standing behind their company during a period of significant change. And I especially want to thank that 10,600 of them who took leaves of varying lengths to help us bring spending down or to save a job for someone else.  Not burdening the company with a massive amount of new debt means that our balance sheet is unimpaired and strong, which means that we can all look forward to using it in the months and years ahead to find new opportunities for all of us. It's very clear the Congress's efforts to support the industry and its employees by providing vital funds to weather the downturn were essential to preserving our balance sheet of the $5 billion variance between our revenue loss and our $234 million cash outflow from operations, $753 million represents a grant, which we received as part of the CARES Act and will receive another $400 million grant in the first quarter.  All of us here want to thank leaders on both sides of the aisle and in both the Congress and the administration for their support of our industry and our employees. And as Emily said, this will be my final earnings call, a CEO of this great company. Before I sign off, I want to express my gratitude to all of you on the buy side and the sell side listening today, and to the folks who came before you. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to build relationships with many of you and you have most definitely pushed us to be better. The financial principles that underpin our management philosophy today, such as maintaining a fortress balance sheet, keeping our pension plans funded, and maintaining a low cost structure, our principles that have been shaped by conversations with all of you. In the early 2000s, Alaska led the industry in establishing clearly articulated chasm goals, and after that ROIC goals, and then by aspiring to deliver results like other high quality industrial companies, not just other airlines. All of these ideas were simple in concept, but they seem to ambitious and radical in an industry that for many of those years had done nothing, but accumulate negative retained earnings. Some of the greatest learning\u2019s we had came from answering your questions and then walking away realizing that we didn't love the answer we've just given you. You've sharpened our thinking in so many areas. This is a long-winded way of saying thank you. You\u2019ve made Alaska a much, much better business. I really enjoyed my time with all of you and I\u2019ve learned so much. And perhaps most importantly, I want to thank our employees and the guests that we serve. This company has come so far in the last 30 years. I think all of us are humbled by the success that we\u2019ve experience. And when we were challenged and all airlines are regularly challenged, I was honored to be in the trenches with this fantastic team. Our people have a level of loyalty and dedication to their company that is uncommon in this day and age. And if you had to put a point on it, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve done as well as we\u2019ve done and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so optimistic about our future. So thanks to all of you serving this great company has been an honor. And while I look forward to staying involved, my primary job in the future is going to be the step back and support Ben and this great team, as they take Alaska to the next level. Over to you, Ben.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. I can\u2019t pass on the opportunity to say a bit more about Brad\u2019s impact here at Alaska over the last 30 years. And this time with the company, Alaska went from being one of the smaller airlines in the industry to the fifth largest airline in the country. As many of you know, Brad was CFO from February of 2000 and was instrumental with Bill Ayer and creating the balanced business model providing value to employees, customers, owners and communities. I want to highlight some of his accomplishments during his career and tenure as CEO. Over this 30 years, our fleet grew from 117 to 330 aircraft and our guests Congress six-fold from 8 million to 46 million. Brad mentioned the chasm max and ROIC goals from our 2010 plan, which were transformative in the industry. And he was instrumental in conceptualizing and implementing that plan. This lead the groundwork for the financial discipline we\u2019re proud to have today. And in the last decade, he oversaw tremendous growth along the West Coast, including the acquisition of Virgin America. By 2019, revenues under Brad\u2019s watch had grown eight times of 1991 levels. Brad\u2019s focus was always long-term sustainable growth and our company is stronger for it. But most of all, Brad has overstayed deeply connected to our culture, our values, and to the 22,000 people that make up this great company. At any Alaska event or station visit, drag these employees by name and remarkably recalls our last conversation. You\u2019ve probably experienced this yourself as part of our investor community. And so after 84 quarterly earnings calls, I hope you\u2019ll join me in congratulating, Brad, on his incredible career. Brad, thank you for all that you\u2019ve done to make our company what it is today. And I speak for the whole team, I say, Alaska strong position would not have been possible without your leadership over the 30 years. So turning to our fourth quarter results, when we last spoke with you in October, both employments and bookings read peaks for the pandemic period. And each month was improving from the last. That trend stalled in the fourth quarter, as employments and bookings deteriorated in November as state and local closures and federal trauma warnings came into effect and response to this third wave. In the fourth quarter, our revenue was $808 million, down 64% from prior year on sellable capacity that was down 59% from prior year. Sequentially, sellable capacity was up 10 points on Q3, while revenue results improved 7 points. Average daily bookings have been increased in since they stalled in November. From December to January, average daily bookings have increased 20% from 49,000 to 58,000 and we\u2019ve experienced several days at over 70,000. Note that boosted by the fantastic work our commercial team has been doing to promote and stay connected with our guests. While customers are demonstrating interest in future travel and employments today remain stalled at around 35% of normal levels or about 40,000 passengers per day. Leisure travel continues to be the majority of our guests, both in carried passengers and in future bookings. Markets with the strongest load factors are warm weather destinations and places with outdoor activities. Our strongest helps lead our system and performance longer distance routes including Transcon mark is \u2013 were the worst performer in the fourth quarter, similar to what you\u2019ve heard across the industry. This is demand continues to be severely depressed and came in at approximately 15% of normal levels. A bright spot, however, in our Q4 results was our operational performance. Alaska and Horizon were among the top of the industry in on-time performance for the quarter. It\u2019s important that we carry this momentum forward into 2021. So while we had hoped the fourth quarter results would be better, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic there will be a step change in demand once the vaccine has been broadly distributed. For the past couple of calls, I\u2019ve shared our thinking about the recovery and planning assumptions we\u2019re using the plan for the future. First, I\u2019d say the recovery has been slow thus far, but we expect there will be a point that it begins to accelerate in earnest. We\u2019ve been trading water recently and believe sustained progressive improvement will begin when we have a widespread vaccine rollout and States are able to relax restrictions. We are confident. Leisure will lead the recovery and we believe there is substantial pent up demand for leisure travel. While we know many of our corporate guests want to get back out traveling, we expect that business travel will returned to only 50% of normal levels by end of year and this is based on our surveys of corporate customers. So our focus right now is keeping the company ready for when demand does jump and making sure we have a business model that is strong post pandemic. We remain confident that flying is safe. As I shared last quarter, several independent research studies have shown that consistent usage of masks coupled with effective air flow and filtration systems on board create a safe environment for our guests and crew. This is consistent with our own accumulated experience as well. This month, we moved forward with our plan to begin unblocking middle seats in our main cabin, but given the low and passenger recovery, we don\u2019t anticipate this to be highly impactful to results for a few months. We\u2019ve left middle seats blocked in our premium cabin through May 31, not as a safety precaution, but as a benefit we can provide the guests who are looking for some extra elbow and legroom. Affordable and accessible testing and streamlined clearance programs also have the potential to reduce travel friction. Pre-clearance programs for destinations that required testing are maturing and may become more prevalent. In December, we were the first airline in the industry to offer Hawaii-bound guests pre-clearance on the West Coast to bypass the airport screening process upon arrival. And the CDC has announced the new order requiring passengers entering the U.S. to have proof of either an antigen or a PCR test taken within three days. We\u2019re currently working with our partners and health centers in the international locations we serve to prepare our guests and our teams for this requirement. Given all that I shared with you, we believe our customers are gearing up for traveling this spring and summer. And this supports our plans to prepare to fly approximately 80% of 2019 levels by summer. It is proven for a business and our operation to scale to those levels in a measured way. As a result, we plan to fly Q1 capacity, that is 70% of 2019 levels and expect to carry a load factor between 40% to 45%. These load factor expectations reflect the current state of stalled employments, but we do expect health patterns to improve in the next two months and that restrictions will begin to relax. Additionally, the return of warmer weather in the spring is expected to drive continued interest in people getting out and doing things. As a result, we expect employments to improve in March and beyond. As we add back capacity, we will focus on our strongest hubs in the Pacific Northwest in Alaska. And as California adapts to a more open posture, we will eventually begin to focus on adding capacity back there as well. These plans did not reflect any closing cancels that we may utilize that conditions ultimately do not support the levels of flying that we have planned. While our capacity plans are consistent with what we share previously, changes to our fleet that have been recently announced will impact our workforce planning and Shane will share more of that in a moment. The choppy recovery in 2021, we\u2019ll present us with challenges as we scale our business back, but we have a lot to look forward to. Our entry into oneworld is just two months away and as we move forward with our partnership with American, this will bring incredible value to our guests and increased opportunities for our airlines. Our teams are also laser focused on aggressive cost control, increases in productivity and the operational and financial discipline that Alaska is known for. This will put us on the path back to profitability. 2020 has been a year like no other, but I am proud when I look at what we achieved, the ways we improve and the strength we carried with us into the new year. I truly believe that our best days are ahead of us and our great people are ready for what it will take to climb out of this crisis. Now over to Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. My comments will cover similar areas as the past couple of calls with a focus on liquidity and net debt, costs and cash burden during the quarter and expectations going into 2021. I\u2019ll also briefly discuss our recent order and fleet plans. We ended the year with $1.7 billion in adjusted net debt, which was essentially flat from year end 2019. We believe we\u2019ll be the only airline to achieve flat net debt without having issued equity. With no impairment to our balance sheet we are well positioned to capitalize on the recovery. We were able to achieve this result even in light of a $5.2 billion revenue decline from last year. And that is because we were running a strong business before the pandemic, and because of the speed with which we reduced cash spend throughout 2020. We removed $2.4 billion in expenses in 2020 shrunk capital spending and moved to secure structural cost savings going forward. Those actions coupled with $750 million in direct grant aid from Congress to maintain industry jobs, we\u2019re able to fully offset our revenue loss to maintain flat net debt. Regarding liquidity, during 2020, we\u2019ve created access to over $5 billion in incremental liquidity. And today we have $3.5 billion of cash on hand inclusive of approximately $266 million that we received last week under the second round of PSP. We also have the additional $1.8 billion in available incremental financing through the CARES loan program, which we now have until May 28 to determine how much, if any, we will borrow. Our adjusted debt to cap is about 61% right now with low CapEx plan in 2021, we will be in a position to begin to reduce leverage by lowering our cash balance and repaying debt this year, assuming there is a stabilized recovery from here forward. In fact, if we were able to return to normal cash on hand levels and use the current excess cash towards debt repayment, our debt to cap would be below 50%, which as you know is within our long-term target range. Turning to costs, adjusted operating expenses were down 27% in the fourth quarter, two points better than Q3 while capacity in Q4 was up 13 points. This performance was aided by 3,300 employees remaining on leaves or incentive lines reduced costs driven by now 40 permanently parked Airbus aircraft and several favorable resolutions of vendor negotiations resulting in one time savings. Additionally, we saw the ramping of several of the structural cost initiatives that we detailed for you on the last call toward run rate levels, including permanent wage reductions, non-wage overhead spend reductions and supplier rate reductions. Variable costs for the quarter were up with the added capacity and our COVID business recovery program, a goals based bonus program that was designed to align our employees in managing this crisis, paid out as a target, as a result of our employees\u2019 fantastic work around safety and our industry leading cash burn reduction efforts. This drove incremental cost in the fourth quarter. So the program was an effective way to align our employees ran important tools this past year. Our GAAP operating expenses include several one-time charges that I\u2019d like to touch on briefly. Including approximately $255 million of impairment charges associated with the write-off of lease assets and recognition of lease return cost estimates for aircraft that we have permanently parked. We also recognize a credit of $102 million for the revision of our estimated pilot incentive leaves. As you know, we designed our leave programs early in the third quarter, but since then we have finalized a significant fleet decision that allowed us to refine our schedule, which now reflects a higher mix of Boeing flying. Cross training and returned to work schedules were impacted by these changes. We had designed the program to have flexibility for just this reason. While we\u2019ve done well this year, managing spend and making our cost structure more variable, we have more work to do to return Alaska to pre-COVID unit costs. For 30 years now, our formula has been to have low fares enabled by low costs, which are best driven by a high productivity and low overhead mindset. Achieving those isn\u2019t easy. It takes leadership focus, excellent execution of our operation, and buy-in from our people. In the post-pandemic period, we believe these same principles will ultimately be required to drive our business recovery. Our average cash outflows as defined under the cash burn metric were approximately $450 million per month in Q4, which is in line with the expectation we shared with you on our last call. Our cash burn in the fourth quarter of approximately $3.8 million per day was a sequential improvement from the third quarter driven primarily by improvements in demand, despite the choppiness that developed in November and December. Beginning today, we are sunsetting monthly cash burn guidance that we introduced in the initial phase of this crisis. Instead, we will provide quarterly operating cash flow expectations, which are more direct measure of the health of our business as we believe the acute liquidity risks that mattered in 2020 have been mitigated by our available liquidity. With that, I will turn to 2021 cash and cost guidance. As Ben detailed, we anticipate operating capacity of approximately 70% of 2019 levels in Q1 and 80% by summer. This will naturally bring incremental flying costs back into the business. Last quarter, I detailed for you approximately $215 million in cost initiatives that had already been identified are secured. We have since identified an additional $50 million of savings, including $10 million in fleet related savings as we begin replacing the Airbus with MAX aircraft, $10 million in real estate related reductions and $30 million in productivity related initiatives. Some initiatives are now at the run rate levels, while others will ramp through 2021. Our current expectation is for Q1 CASM ex to be up approximately 20%. And we expect continued sequential improvement throughout the year on our way back to pre-COVID levels even if we are a smaller company. We expect our operating cash flow for the first quarter inclusive of PSP funds to be flat to minus $100 million. However, I believe cash flows from operations will be positive during the first half of the year. If the vaccine rollout works, as we all expect it will and allows demand to snap up. Given what I\u2019ve shared about our liquidity and these cash flow expectations, we currently have no plan to draw any incremental financing in the first quarter. Having said that our default will be to maintain conservatism until we have more confidence that the recovery is stable. So we may extend or renew some existing debt that is currently slated for repayment in March and April. Before I turn the call over for questions, of course would like to touch on the very exciting news that came out just before Christmas regarding the future of our fleet. The order we jointly announced with Boeing provides a clear path to transition into a higher gauge, more efficient aircraft as we return our leased Airbus fleet. The partnership between Alaska and Boeing is as strong as ever. And I\u2019m very excited about what this order means for both of our companies. I think, you know, we are both located here in Seattle and we have employees with spouses, parents, sons, and daughters that are Boeing employees. The tied between our two companies are deep and we\u2019re excited about our futures together. With the order over the next four years, we will take delivery of 68 new 737-9 aircraft, 13 of them leased, which will largely replace our Airbus fleet. We then have options for up to 52 additional aircraft through 2026 for when we find opportunities for growth. The agreement features significant flexibility in the deferral rates for the majority of the orders and full substitution rights to other MAX models. Shell for sale the newer generation 737-9 aircraft have material lease, superior economics relative to our existing older technology A320s, did a better fuel efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and 20 incremental seats. Each replacement will improve unit costs and provide incremental revenue opportunity for our P&L. And as noted above, the order allowed us to revise our 2021 cash outlays for CapEx as we will first consume existing PDPs with Boeing before beginning to pay into PDPs again in 2022. As a result, our 2021 capital expenditures will remain low at approximately $150 million to $250 million. And with that, we will go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. And Brad congrats on the transition. I promise you that we learned a lot from you and your team as well over the years.\nBrad Tilden: Thank you, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So big picture, your net debt is flat versus pre-pandemic. Your share count has not changed versus pre-pandemic and relatively that screens pretty well. So what would you say is the biggest driver of that strong relative performance? Is it simply that you had capital spending flexibility that others did not have? And was that a function of kind of where you were in the integration or how you structure your contracts? Appreciate just some detail on how exactly you were able to accomplish that?\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Duane. It\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s \u2013 I know more about us obviously than sort of where others are situated, but you\u2019re right. We did have a lot of flexibility with respect to managing CapEx down very quickly this year. It was one of the important features of the revised deal with Boeing. We wanted to keep a low level of CapEx required into next year. And so we were happy to be able to restructure the agreement with them and maintain a low CapEx posture for 2021. I think the other thing was we rallied really early on, I sort of lose the week or the day, but it was sometime in late March where we decided this was a crisis. It was going to be a crisis for an indefinite period of time. And we immediately went to the company and so we\u2019ve got to sort of stop spending immediately. And the company responded across the board at every single employee participated.  As Brad mentioned, we had over 10,000 people take elective voluntary leaves, give up their own income in order to help the company or save a job for somebody else. We worked with suppliers. We changed our sort of payment terms. We ended up paying for what we were using, not necessarily exactly what contracts called in terms of minimums. And so we\u2019ve just, we\u2019ve had a \u2013 it\u2019s been a lot of work over the last several months, but the company did a phenomenal job, pulling costs out, immediately getting cash burned down. I think we reached $4 million per day early in this, and we\u2019ve sort of hovered there, waiting for demand to come back. And I think that\u2019s probably the biggest piece of it. And then what Brad said, we came into this in a really good position. We had a phenomenal balance sheet coming into it. We had just gotten done paid off $500 million or $600 million of debt that Brandon was happy to have done. And I got to go in and reborrow. And so I think the fact that we were producing $1.5 billion or $1.6 billion in cash flow pre-pandemic gave us a lot of runway to not, get in a bad position coming out.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So when you lost $5.2 billion, you only had to make up $3.5 billion or $3.7 billion to get back to flat?\nShane Tackett: Correct. Yes.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Debt unchanged?\nShane Tackett: Yes.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate those thoughts. And then just for my follow-up on the A320s that are leaving, can you just remind us, how does \u2013 how do those impact cash flow in other words, are there any cash gains? Are they all leases, how does debt go away? Can you just remind us how that impacts your balance sheet? Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Yes. I\u2019ll have Emily or Chris talking about the balance sheet a bit, but yes, there\u2019s \u2013 we have maintenance requirements on all of these aircraft. They\u2019re all leased. We have paid maintenance reserves along the way. And so it\u2019s going to be a relatively manageable, full amount curtail as we return these, but there will be some cash expense to bring them back up to where they need to be brought to before we return them to the less or but from a balance perspective, Chris or Emily?\nChris Berry: Yes. Hey Duane. We did. I mean, it was \u2013 we paired with 40 of these Airbus aircraft this year all of them were leased. I think there were the 10 that we did own that we sold to AirLease Corp, but at least in those back, we\u2019ve been paired those as well because they\u2019re parked. But yes, the cash impact of those leases on the maintenance reserve side is really only going to be about, well only it\u2019s a lot of money at $45 million to $50 million in 2021. So the charge you see on the P&L is certainly not going to turn into cash imminently or nearly, not going to right now so.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Appreciate the thoughts.\nChris Berry: Thanks, Duane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Duane.\nOperator: The next question will come from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for your time. And also just want to echo I'm sure what will be everyone's comments congratulating you, Brad, on your career and what you've accomplished at Alaska.\nBrad Tilden: Thank you so much, Catie.\nCatherine O'Brien: So my first question is to be a follow-up on the fleet decision, I know sometimes moving deliveries around can create added costs with the OEMs, but given the MAX grounding, can we assume there was no net negative on pricing, on existing orders and perhaps even some better pricing on the new orders, given your decision to go back to an all Boeing fleet versus keeping the dual fleet, maybe that's for Shane or Nat.\nShane Tackett: Yes, thanks, Catie. I might, I probably won't get into the specifics of the deal. I can say though that we've worked a long time on getting to this decision. And I think we were really clear along the way with our good friends and partners of Boeing on what we needed in order to place an order, especially right now and where we are in the pandemic sort of cycle here that add 60 firms and a lot of options. Our history with options is we take all of them. And so it could be quite a large order for us, and a significant amount of capital that we've got to go make work for us. So, I think we feel very good about the deal that we struck with them. We're really excited about the path we're on now. There's a lot of operational efficiencies and savings we can get by getting into a single fleet. But I think I won't get into the \u2013 any more specifics than that on the deal.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. Fair enough. And then a couple of related ones on the balance sheet. It sounds like we're waiting to see what happens with the recovery, but potentially no more cash burn or cash positive, cash from ops in the first half of the year. So I guess in that scenario, how do you weigh taking more of the CARES loan at the end of May and then whether you take that loan or not, how do you think about your balance sheet once we have seen more recovery. It sounded like from your comments you maybe considering holding on to higher levels of liquidity for now. But we permanently have a higher liquidity minimum you want to stick to before contemplating debt pay down, like how do you think through a couple of those moving pieces there? And thanks for the time.\nNat Pieper: Catie, it\u2019s Nat. Thanks for the question. I think our current cash balance is $3.4 billion, which clearly is higher than historically Alaska is carried. Year end 2019 we had $1.5 billion. So I think you're going to see us carry an excess amount until we see sustained revenue recovery. And then I think over time, we'll see what the landscape is, and have that choice to pay down debt. I do think certainly through 2021, we're going to carry an additional pad of liquidity just until we see sustained revenue recovery.\nShane Tackett: And I'll just add to that. In terms of long-term posture, we haven't decided that we're going to be at a higher rate than the $1.5 billion. We may end up there. We just haven't done a lot of that planning quite yet, but ultimately we'll make sure we have the ability to go out and get access to cash in a quick way if we need it. But we do want ultimately bring the cash balance down.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. And, Brad, congratulations, it's been a long time that I've known you. I think I've been on all those 84 conference calls with you.\nBrad Tilden: And then you might be \u2013 you and my \u2013 probably you guys go back. All right. I won\u2019t say. Thanks a lot.\nHelane Becker: Because remember, I still think I'm 35. So here's a couple of questions for you. On the route network, how are you thinking about adjusting the route network? Given the fact that transcon is performing so poorly. Are you ready to \u2013 are you giving up on spring break traffic or are you thinking that we're going to get that back or we have a chance at it? So not sure who wants to answer that?\nAndrew Harrison: Helane, that's a great question for our CEO elect. [ph]\nBen Minicucci: No, thanks. Brad still has some privileges, he's an exercise. The way we think of our route network and working closely with Andrew and his team is we are focusing on the Pacific Northwest, so where we're adding increasing capacity to 70% and 80%, you're going to see a lot of focus in the Pacific Northwest and state of Alaska. California is going to come back as restrictions ease. And we'll had the capacity hopefully in the next 12 months to 18 months. In terms of transcon, and spring break, Helane, I think we'd have to see what happens with the vaccine rollout and with how people are feeling and relaxation of restrictions. I think, I'm optimistic with the Biden administration, he just announced 1.5 million vaccines a day, in 100 days that can mean 75, maybe we have a 100 million people in the country vaccinated. I think you might start seeing, people venturing out of spring break. So I think we're going to be cautious. I think we're going to be on our toes and react appropriately. Andrew, anything you want to add?\nAndrew Harrison: Just, I think, Ben answered. I just to put a couple of numbers to it. I think like on New York transcon still going to be down 90% in the first quarter as this was a fourth quarter. San Francisco is going to be down 68%, the same as it was in the fourth quarter. So where there's no demand, but then places like Hawaii, we're going to be up 15 points in capacity. And as Ben said, Pacific Northwest, and then we moving things around like we've got 10 additional main line flights. Three of them are Cancun. Six of them are Florida on one to Hawaii. So as we progress, we're moving our airplanes around to go where the stronger demand is. So that's where we're at on that.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just on oneworld, I know the goal is what March 31, I think. And so \u2013 but that's mostly international connection opportunity \u2013 connecting opportunities. Is that is your thought getting into oneworld because it makes sense to do it now. And then you get the benefits in second half of 2021 or into 2022, or is it the idea that you don't \u2013 you do. Yes, I guess that's the question. Thanks.\nBen Minicucci: Helane, it's a great question. We\u2019ve got Nat and Andrew here, but you know what I'll say with one world, it's a couple of things. It's the partnership with American, which we call the West Coast International Alliance and we have the one world partnership. We have four international flights starting here. In the next couple months, we have \u2013 and I'm going to see if we have Qatar that starting from Doha. We have Shanghai starting from Seattle. We've got Bangalore and we have in London.  So to your point, I think Andrew and team are working hard on getting corporate customers to see that with Alaska's broad domestic network in Seattle, and now with the international alliances that we have that Alaska really can provide a service to our business and even leisure travel all around the world so really excited with that. When you're coupled with the Americans, this is the partnership we have with the West Coast Alliance on the domestic side, it's really a powerful network that we can offer. Not only from Seattle, actually for all our West Coast hubs.\nAndrew Harrison: Ben, I think one of the you can talk lot about is even though international is down, there are people that like to consolidate their international travel with their domestic or they're thinking they're going to do international down the road. So that customer, that travels internationally once or twice a year, but six or eight times domestically, we just gives as a much better chance of getting that customer into the Alaska Airlines mileage plan, right.\nHelane Becker: That's great. Thank you very much, everybody. \nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Helane.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning. Brad my heartfelt best to you and your family. I'm curious if this means you'll be doing more flying and thank you for not lumping me with the old timers club just now. And for Andrew happy birthday, I know many of us feel we've aged about three or four years in the last single year. So hopefully, you did better than that. So a question on ticket pricing, and I'm going to try to ask it in a way that doesn't waste your time and that you're comfortable answering.  So common question is what level of discounting is going to be needed to coax people out of their homes. And personally, it's not clear to me that any discounting would be necessary, but I realize ticket pricing is a lot more complicated than that. So the reason I want to last cause perspective is that it seems that you've been running a fair number of promotions, but at a time when people are nervous about flying. So can you at least comment on what sort of response that's driven and whether we should assume that that's a blueprint for the future? Is that something you're comfortable commenting on?\nChris Berry: Thanks, Jamie. And we had very significant stimulation and I'm very proud of the marketing team. We had very heavy promotions in December. It got our brand out there. It got our employees engaged. We had the highest level of first-class bookings, highest level of Thursday, Friday, Saturday bookings that we've had all pandemic. To your point, I think that a lot of that, that was focused on future traffic. We have a lot of seats to sell into the future. And so we use that opportunity. Our coupon yield was down about 7.4% during this quarter. So to your point, it's going to be that fine line, but we are after demand right now and volumes and then with volumes come pricing. So that's sort of where we are right now.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up to that, and this relates to one world in kind of piggybacks off what Helane was bringing up with connecting travel, presumably that yield is going to be dilutive, which isn't to say, it's not a accretive, it's just dilutive. So is that something that we should be considering on our models, because hopefully you're an affirming core yield environment as the year progresses, but at the same time you're going to be carrying more connecting travel. Is that going to be impactful? Is it going to mean that your yield could lag that of the industry, just given the coincidence timing of the one world entry?\nChris Berry: I mean I think in the fourth quarter, I think our international connectivity \u2013 connections were down 93%. So that's going to take some time to come back. I don't necessarily think it's going to be dilutive at all. It might be some yields give a type, but I will tell you on the loyalty, on the business, on the connecting of our network and loyalty program with both American and one world, I think is all going to be good news for us.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just speak in a quick third, do you have the average pilot seniority today versus this time last year?\nShane Tackett: Wow. Jamie, this is Shane. We did retire 130 off the top at a 3000, but I don't think it's moved a ton just based on that. So we had 120, 130 that took early out. But that's it attrition has been relatively needed besides that. \nJamie Baker: Got it. Thank you very much, everybody. \nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Jamie.\nChris Berry: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: The next question is from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. Brad, I like to care all the comments here on the call and Andrew happy birthday and I'm sorry that you were spending it with us here today. Shane, if I might ask on the fleet that you able to provide maybe kind of by year at least for the next couple of years, just what you expect in terms of deliveries and exits.\nShane Tackett: Yes, I can, because there's a chart right here in front of me. Yes Nat, why don't you take with these numbers?\nNat Pieper: Happy to. Savi, we've spent a lot of time obviously with this chart. But so we're going to take 13 737-9s in 2021, nine directly from Boeing and then four on lease from Air Lease Corp. We'll take 30 units in 2022, 13 in 2023 and then 12 in 2024. So that gets us to our 68 from and then we have 52 options that's pulled in a few in 2023 and then 2024, 2025 and 2026. So it gives us some good flexibility and optionality. Shane mentioned this in his script as well. We've got a lot of deferral rights on this too. So that was one of our motivations with Boeing. Want to be flexible here and as the revenue recovery is still a bit murky.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. Just on the Airbus side, when do you expect that kind of there's some of the remaining XP A321 the rest to grow up.\nNat Pieper: This 320 for the most part it's pretty consistent in 2022 and 2023, 10 to 15, lease is expired. And as Chris mentioned earlier, we will work with less orders to accelerate some of those because most of those airplanes are parked. So the lion's share and so we've matched up our deliveries from Boeing, pretty akin to those Airbus units going away. \nAndrew Harrison: I think those are the \u2013 Savi, you've talked about the 321s that span, I think the 321s there 10 of them, they're going to stay in our fleet in the foreseeable future. But I think we're open to possibilities and what we can do for that, but for now they're in our fleet and we tend to operate them.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And if I might ask just a clarifying question on the OpEx outlook for 1Q, I'm just kind of wondering how much of that is impacted by PSP2 requirements and of the 250 to 300 that you're kind of targeting, how much has it been is kind of reflected in that number?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Savi, so the PSP, we ended up having to bring back a few folks, mostly on the management side that we had unfortunately had to riff on October 1. And so they're entitled to come back through the period that PSE covers through March. On the frontline side, there wasn't a lot of additional recall that had to happen. We've already been in the middle of recalling folks to get ready for both the Q1 and Q2 capacity that we're going to deploy.  The \u2013 I think you're speaking to this structural cost savings, when you're talking about the 215 or 235, yes, some of that like our management headcount reduction, it's a minor amount, but some of that is impacted. But that's really at full run rate today. A lot of like the other things that we're tracking towards like non-wage overhead stuff just cutting consultant costs and all the discretionary spend that's at full run rate today. And I don't think we've given specific amounts on every one of these, but that's a full run rate. Productivity with the front line, some of the real estate reductions that we're going to go forward with, those are things that will ramp throughout the year. And I honestly, we need a little more volume in order to help those ramp. And then some supplier negotiations, we're about 50% of the way through capturing that. And so I'll get \u2013 we'll follow up with a specific number, because I'm not going to tell it, in my head on the fly here, but by category, that's kind of where each one of those are at from a run rate perspective. \nSavi Syth: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Darryl Genovesi with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nDarryl Genovesi: Hey guys, thanks for your time. Congrats to everybody. I guess Andrew, the \u2013 there's this federal excise tax holiday on airline ticket purchases that expired at your end. So I guess this is somewhat of a follow-up to Jamie's, but I think that tax is now coming back with equates to about 10% of the base fair. Do you anticipate any kind of yield pressure specifically related to that? I don't \u2013 I guess specifically recalling when raising filing higher affairs when that tax went away, but I assume the revenue management system is probably seeing some kind of elastic response and maybe it's early to tell, but just wondering kind of how you think that plays out and you in particular, do you think that if there is a drag that it lasts into Q2, because of the booking curve?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I don't want to comment too much about pricing. I haven't checked recently. What \u2013 when this first got reinstated, I think the industry kept that fairly well. And then I think in pockets, it started to erode. But I think for us, the biggest opportunity is 30, 40 point load back to gaps. And the reality is that we need to fill these airplanes. Volume is what's going to bring our revenues back for now, and then we're going to worry about yield later on. So and we think that's the lowest fare option and that's the best for our brand and it's the best to keep the blood flowing trail hubs. \nDarryl Genovesi: Cool. Thank you. And then Ben, I think operational excellence has been kind of a key tenant for you guys. It's very evident that that's been a focus. And so just wondered if you taking on more CEO responsibilities, remember \u2013 remembering everyone's name and what have you. What needs to happen underneath you to kind of backfill what you've been doing? I don't recall you announcing any specific personnel appointments, so if you don't want to mention any specific names, that's fine, but just generally speaking, what's kind of the strategy for backfilling you? \nBen Minicucci: We've worked hard on succession on the operations side and with Gary Beck here, he's been with us \u2013 for Gary been with us for over 10 years right now. And we have a strong succession plan. So the operations team is solid through and through. Our playbook is mature. And I don't have worries on the operational side Darryl. So we'll announce more of that in the near future, but I feel really confident.\nDarryl Genovesi: Great. Thanks, everybody. Appreciate the time. \nEmily Halverson: Before we take the next question, if you all could keep it to one question from here on out, we've only got a couple of minutes left and several people to get through. Thank you. \nOperator: The next question will come from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. This may be one and a half, but I want to ask the follow-up. Maybe for Andrew, can you just talk about the nature of your business traffic customer in terms of what industries they come from and whether you think that is more or less susceptible to, kind of the virtual meeting headwind, potentially just thinking about it from a tech exposure perspective. And then whether you think you need to revisit cabin configuration in light of some of the uncertainties around business traffic demand longer-term or whether you\u2019re kind of happy with what you have now or whether that\u2019s kind of being evaluated at the moment. Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Thanks, Joe. Our business is down, whether you measure it by bookings or revenues, just like everybody else. I think where we have a unique strength is especially in Alaska and the commercial slopes the fishermen, the oil workers, those types of things. We have strengths. We \u2013 just the nature of our business, we still have a lot of small business travelers, who do a fair bit of travel. The big ones that are the challenged, obviously, the Microsoft and the Amazon very strict policies right now on no travel. So I think, as Ben mentioned, what we\u2019re excited about is that we believe we will take a step change up in our participation in business travel. Once it returns with oneworld and the international and our partnership with American. And then your second question was cabin configuration, we feel really good. We are very thankful that we maintained a non-life flat position. We think our first class seats are spot on for the demand environment. And as you heard Ben mentioned, premium class cabins come a little bit under pressure, obviously with the lack of business demand. And that\u2019s why we are booking the middle seat there and giving folks extra reason to buy up into that cabin as we come through this period of time.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning, everyone. And just, Brad, what along the fun trip to spend? I learned a lot from you, in fact, I think back to when you sent me an email, telling me that I was calculating really wrongly. So I thank you for that. And maybe \u2013 you\u2019re calculating right.\nAndrew Harrison: I calculating wrong or you, Michael. Hopefully we got it right.\nMike Linenberg: Anyway I guess that\u2019s Andrew super thing, just a quick one, Andrew. You notice just lost the middle seat in the premium cabin. What that actually means that a better product than in your first class, at least for those two, want the visual space, maybe you want to be as far from people as possible. So is there just the risk of cannibalization? I mean, I think it\u2019s great. You\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s going to be great for your premium product, four seats and block, four and six seats based thoughts on that, that could have adverse consequences.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. We haven\u2019t seen that and I think, we\u2019ve just recently opened up a first class cabin, obviously, since January 6. But our first class cabin is a nice product and we have \u2013 we actually have, full food service, but not hot, but we have good food service and it cost a lot of other benefits that come with a first class cabin. So what will say and of course we can always adjust pricing along the way, as we go forward and see what happens there. So I\u2019m not overly concerned. I will say that, we have great premium seats and I want guests sitting in those if we can make those available.\nMike Linenberg: All right. Very good. Thanks to everyone.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: The next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Hey, Brad. Congratulations, man. Good stuff.\nBrad Tilden: Thank you, Hunter. And we\u2019re going to miss \u2013 I miss you a lot.\nHunter Keay: I\u2019m sure, you will. Call me anytime, if that\u2019s actually true. So Andrew, you\u2019ve talked about obviously the important to driving volume, right. I get it, to get those load factors up. But how confident are you that the new RM system that you implement is going to be able to get you there. Giving you a limited experience with it? And if you could talk about how the forecast tool is performed during COVID and how you\u2019re going to think about using it going forward to get your loads up. Thanks.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Hunter. Our forecast will completely worthless. We\u2019ll pay you that much. The reality is that obviously history, it was no predict. But I know, and I can\u2019t speak to the details, but [indiscernible] who heads up on my RM group, work with Amadeus and they came up with some very clever tools to help the analysts, manage the demand environment that we\u2019re in. Yes. To your point, we want to see the RM system really tested until we get volumes running through the pipes, but we had a fantastic implementation. Team is fully trained, ready to go. So I\u2019m still confident that great things as well as the automation is going to occur there.\nHunter Keay: Thank you.\nShane Tackett: I might just add having spent time in RM that I think unintended sort of benefit having demand go to zero is actually net of good for our RM new tool. Like, I think there\u2019s a lot of risks when you cut these over midstream at normal levels of volumes and that we get to train the forecast perfectly now as it comes back at demand comes back. So I\u2019m actually positive on this.\nHunter Keay: Thank you, Shane.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone. And congrats, Brad and Ben and happy birthday Andrew. My one question is probably a longer-term one, Ben, but you have the Boeing deal with pretty conservative balance sheet the oneworld agreement coming up. Is the future looking bright and what are you re-imagining in a post-COVID world? Is this the time for you guys to be a bit more aggressive maybe than in the past?\nBen Minicucci: That\u2019s a great question, Brandon. First and foremost, I mean, we\u2019re looking short-term and long-term. First and foremost, we\u2019re going to get on solid financial footing, getting to positive cash flows and getting back to profitability is just job one, rebuilding the network and really getting this one world partnership to work. That\u2019s really in our sites. I think if you look at our history, and this is \u2013 thanks to Brad, as we\u2019ve always positioned the company to take advantage of opportunities out there. And we don\u2019t know exactly what they are, but being on our toes and looking at what\u2019s going on with the environment and then being opportunistic is what Alaska is done, it\u2019s whole career. So we do have a strategic plan, but we also look at opportunities out there and we\u2019re going to take it as it comes and we\u2019re in a just a fantastic position to do it.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Brandon.\nOperator: The next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Brad, good luck for the future. Ben, congratulations. Maybe a couple of follow-ups, kind of what you discussed so far. One is, your commentary on the ramp and traffic that you expect the back half of the year and your focus on filling the planes, first, really stands out. I mean, is it fair to say that you expect to outgrow the rising tide through 2021 and 2022, given that you look like you are going to be a little bit more aggressive. And second, are you seeing any evidence of the booking curve extending or kind of picking up in the back half of the year for transcontinental route specifically?\nShane Tackett: Hey, Ravi, this is Shane. I\u2019ll let Andrew take the booking curve question. I think you may have been talking about our capacity ramp as we go forward. And yes, I mean, right now, like, we\u2019re \u2013 I think the thing that I would convey is we\u2019re right on the initial plan we set, which was to be 80% of our former size by this summer. The fleet order gives us the chance to get back to full capacity full sort of pre-COVID capacity in 2022, if demand is there and then the potential for growth beyond that. We want to get back to relatively high rates of growth. But we\u2019ll only do that, if we\u2019ve got the financial machine underneath it working and sort of justifying those investments. And it\u2019ll be sort of interesting to see how demand comes back and what the shape of the economy in this kind of new post pandemic period is. And we\u2019ll be able to, I think, be good as a business in any economic situation. And if there are good opportunities to grow, we\u2019ll be first to go after them is the way we\u2019re thinking about it.\nAndrew Harrison: And just on the booking, I think, we\u2019ve seen this in December, there was a strong demand to book into the spring and the summer. COVID cases have been down on a steady downward trend for the past three weeks on a seven day rolling average, and we\u2019ve seen a steady increase on our bookings and our net bookings year-over-year steadily improving pretty much every day. In fact, yesterday was another very, very solid booking day. California\u2019s starting to open up a little bit here. So a lot to come, but we are on a improved trajectory and I\u2019m not guaranteeing that\u2019s going to continue, but we\u2019re certainly headed in a good direction.\nShane Tackett: Andrew, for several weeks now, we\u2019ve had bookings that are 50% higher than our employments. So there\u2019s definitely is optimism about the future.\nAndrew Harrison: That\u2019s right.\nEmily Halverson: Yes. Let\u2019s go ahead and take one more question and then we\u2019ll wrap the call up.\nOperator: Okay. The final question will come from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Brad, of course, I have to echo huge congrats. Ben is just spot on with your accomplishments. And Andrew happy birthday. And it wouldn\u2019t be a proper birthday, of course, if we didn\u2019t celebrate with a question here. So I guess just on the expectation, for business travel to return to 50% by year end. To what extent, does the AA relationship and entry into oneworld accelerate that March back to a 100%? And as the expectation that you could potentially get there in 2022.\nAndrew Harrison: I think that \u2013 when I think about business travel real quick, Dan, is just that number one, we need to get the vaccine out and get that going well. And we still got a ways to go there. Number two, tell the managers after decide on their duty of care and how much friction they\u2019re going to put in for people to travel. And so that\u2019s an area. Number three corporate America has to open up and receive people for business that is yet to happen. And then the fourth one is the CFO factor, obviously, I think budgets are going to be reduce for awhile. All that being said, there will be \u2013 I do believe in the back half strong step change in demand and as we\u2019ve shared working with American Airlines and oneworld on a global partner we\u2019re seeing very solid and strong interest in new contracts and terms and network and utility that we can provide at corporate contracts. So we\u2019re very bullish on getting a better increase share of business travel.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. Thanks for the time guys.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks very much, Dan. And I think this does wrap it up. Thank you everybody. It\u2019s been fantastic. I know that Ben and team are \u2013 we\u2019ll look forward to talking with you all on 90 days. We appreciate your interest in the company and this team will be talking to you down the road. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Sia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analyst. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director, Investor Relations, Emily Halverson. Please go ahead.\nEmily Halverson: Thanks, Sia. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings call. On today's call, you'll hear updates from Brad, Ben and Shane. Several other members of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. The global health and economic crises continue to significantly impact our business and outlook. This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a third quarter GAAP net loss of $431 million. Excluding special items and mark-to-market adjustments, Air Group reported an adjusted net loss of $399 million. Special items this quarter include $322 million associated with employee separations, $121 million of asset impairment charges that were triggered as a result of certain owned aircraft being permanently parked, and a $398 million benefit related to the CARES Act program wage offset. Our average daily cash burn for the quarter was approximately $4 million. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release. And now I'll turn the call over to Brad for his opening remarks.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Emily. Good morning, everyone. It's been eight months since the initial moments of this crisis, when all airlines, including Alaska, saw bookings fall off sharply. Air travel virtually ground to a halt. And as they always do, the people of Alaska and Horizon rose to meet the challenge. We identified eight critical work streams, covering areas of our business that needed to change rapidly. We built plans for each of these areas and we got to work executing the plans. The work streams included the safety of our people and our guests; the sizing of our fleet, network and workforce; cost and overhead reduction as well as liquidity management; guests and employee communications, a whole host of commercial activities and working with the government and other airlines on the CARES Act. These efforts were coordinated by our project management team under the direction of Sandy Stelling, and individual work streams were executed by people throughout the company. I'd like to share some data points with you to demonstrate the remarkable progress our people have achieved today. First and most importantly, our team sprinted into action to ensure the safety of our employees and our guests. We made over 100 changes to our operation as part of our Next-Level Care program, including enhancements to aircraft cleaning, social distancing, mandatory mass, open middle seats and guest service with reduced contact. Our data shows that our employees, as well as customers who have flown have very high confidence in our safety. Second, our network team cold flying from 1,300 daily flights prior to the pandemic to just 350 nearly overnight. We're back to 760 flights today, and we'll soon be at 840. Third, we've historically carried about 130,000 people per day. In April, that number dropped to 5,000. Our commercial team took decisive action to block middle seats, drop change fees, extend the lead status and communicate with guests in new and innovative ways, all in an effort to build confidence with folks who have not yet come back. Their efforts are working as we've seen a month by month steady uptick in the number of passengers work hearing and as future bookings are trending at even higher levels. Fourth, parking aircraft and putting them into storage is more complex than most people would guess. The Alaska and Horizon maintenance teams parked 177 of our 329 aircraft, and they've now safely brought 110 of these back into service. Fifth, getting our employee resource levels rise has been an all consuming effort for company leaders, union leaders and our employees. Volunteers step forward to support our fight for survival and nearly 7,000 employees took short-term leaves of absence, and we've now had over 4,000 employees volunteer for long-term leaves, incentive lines and early retirement. Sixth, our finance team has led our work to rightsize our operation in reduce spending. And we've reduced our cash burn from approximately $13 million per day to $4 million per day. These heroic efforts along with the money received from the U.S. Treasury mean that our debt level, net of cash are unchanged from prior to the crisis. This is an incredible achievement, and one that we believe few of our peers will replicate. Seventh, our finance, legal and treasury teams tapped into nearly $4 billion in new liquidity well in excess of our $2.5 billion goal. And finally, we continue to fight to maintain jobs for our people, and we've been extremely proud to work with labor leaders and other airlines in the effort to secure further payroll support from the government. Our government affairs team has been highly engaged and they continue to be, as we speak. Shane and Ben will provide more detail on several of these areas in a moment. In today's environment, the sequential transfers from month to month tell the clearest story of progress, but I do want to share a bit about our quarterly results. In the third quarter, Air Group's capacity was down 55%. And as Emily said, our adjusted net loss was $399 million. Our total revenues were down 71% for the quarter, which is sobering, but it's up 11 points from last quarter and we believe it will be amongst the best results in the industry. As I mentioned, over 4,000 employees volunteered for programs that were designed to reduce our need to furlough as we rightsize. Starting October 1, these individuals began their early retirement, extended leaves and incentive lines. I want to recognize and thank each of them for their contributions and for their dedication to Alaska. Many of these people have been with Alaska for decades and they are the folks who truly built Alaska. They did nothing to cause this crisis, and yet they've made a substantial personal sacrifice to contribute to our future and to save a job for someone else. I'm very proud of our finance team, is doing a terrific job managing liquidity. Today we have $3.7 billion in cash on hand, and another $1.8 billion in stand by liquidity for total liquidity of $5.5 billion. Having this in place has allowed us to get through the initial phases of our response and shift our focus from survival to recalibrating and restructuring for long-term prosperity. The former leader here used to remind us that running a business is like designing and building a house. No one knows what kind of weather we'll have, but we could build a house to withstand the worst storms and also to take maximum advantage of the good weather when it comes. We believe we've done this at Alaska. No airline would choose the crisis we're experiencing today. But with our strong balance sheet, our low costs and low reliance on high fairs, and our great service and highly loyal customers, we believe we're better positioned than any other airline to survive this storm and to capitalize on the good weather when it comes. I want to, again, thank our people for everything they're doing. And with that, I'll pass this over to Ben.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Brad. To start out, I too would like to add my appreciation for the employees, the one we have said goodbye to this month. I\u2019ve spent a large portion of my career leading our operations team. So I know the passion and dedication of our frontline workers. We will miss them and we truly want to thank them for their incredible careers that helped shape the values of our company. And I look forward to the day when we're able to ask all those who are in furlough to return. Typically, our third quarter call shares guidance for the fourth quarter and lays off plans for the following year. While volatility has come down relative to Q2, there's little additional clarity about the nature and speed of the demand recovery. Despite that, we will continue to communicate keenly about what we know, including the planning assumptions that are shaping our thinking about the next year. A major driver of demand recovery will be whether our customers believe that flying is safe. Our operational experience in the last eight months has shown that the transmission rate of COVID-19 in the air travel environment is lower than in the general population. It's been said, but it's worth repeating that hospital grade HEPA filters on our airplanes remove 99.9% of airborne particulates and fresh air is re-circulated through the cabin every three minutes. The results of recent scientific studies bolsters our confidence that air travel is safe for the large portion of the population, especially with the additional layers of safety we have implemented. Studies published this month determined that cabin design and airflow systems create the equivalent of over six-feet of social distance between passengers, even on a full flight when masks are worn. One study showed that given airflow infiltration systems only 0.003% of airborne contaminants can reach any one person. Another study showed that it would take 54 hours of sitting next to a mask wearing COVID positive passenger to catch the virus. They also concluded that the risk of contracting COVID-19 during air travel is extremely low compared to typical daily activities. We are very encouraged by what our own experience and the scientific words suggest that it is safe to fly. We continue to work with our guests every day to educate them about the health precautions that are in place, and while those who have now considered high risk, can be confident to return to air travel. Last week, Hawaii lifted quarantine requirements for visitors with a negative COVID test. We have seen recent strength in bookings for the islands. I personally flew there to meet with local officials and experienced the program for myself. It was fantastic to be back in the islands. Our flight was full except for open middle seats and guests had done their pre-arrival COVID test ensure they are negative. Although the arrival and screening process still has hiccups that need to be resolved, meetings with government and state officials gave me confidence that Hawaii traffic will steadily return over the coming months. Despite the evidence that flying is safe, we must acknowledge that many customers are not flying because they are not comfortable doing so. To boost guest confidence in the near-term, we will continue to block middle seats through January 6. However, we are currently mapping a framework that will set the stage for the unblocking of seats as conditions support doing so. We expect to bring back middle seat occupancy in early 2021, beginning with shorter haul flights in geographies like Hawaii where required testing is already reinforcing traveler confidence. Our decision to move forward will be responsive and calibrated to changing conditions, things like rising COVID cases or more restrictive state postures that could change our plans. Similar to how we added back capacity, seeing higher loads and incrementally brought back more onboard service, we recognize we have to be thoughtful and deliberate in creating confidence for our guests throughout this transition. Typical load factors with middle seats blocked should be in the 45% to 55% range, which is equivalent to 65% to 80%, when adjusting for available seats only. Blocked middle seats will continue \u2013 of course act as a headwind towards our goal of achieving cash breakeven results. Turning to our planning scenarios for the coming months our assumption is unchanged from the last quarter and expect to be about 80% of 2019 capacity by the summer of 2021, with full pre-COVID recovery to be well into 2022. As we've demonstrated in Q3, our mindset is sustained nimble and to modify these plans as circumstances evolve, while we plan to fly 50% of prior year Q3 capacity, the pace of recovery was slower than expected. So we adjusted our flying down to 55%. Given what we are seeing in demand today, we are preparing for our operations to be for our fourth quarter capacity to be approximately 40% alone prior year levels with October down 45%. Remains the case that 70,000 to 80,000 passengers per day or about 60% of normal levels is the threshold at which we can achieve cash burn zero. We believe the following factors are relevant for continuing with near-term improvements as we move into 2021. The scientific studies released will help both public confidence and understanding on the safety of air travel. As expected, there is strong correlation between the reopening of destinations and demand. Hawaii and other warm destinations are strengthening as guests look for a work from anywhere locations and vacation destinations. More recently, we've seen that marketing and promotional efforts can be effective in today's environment. In August, we launched our first Buy the Row promotion, which offered buy one, get one pricing. Allowing guests to secure a full row to themselves with middle seats blocked. This promotion was well received and demonstrated to us that marketing to aspirational travelers, reinforcing our safety messaging and offering the right price does have a stimulant effect in today's environment. And lastly, the upcoming holiday travel season, coupled with the permanent removal of change fees appears to be driving more advanced bookings. Business travel remains under more pressure than leisure, but we're talking with our corporate partners of our future with one world and other ways to support the return of business travel. Today, we are honored to join Microsoft and SkyNRG to introduce a partnership focused on making business travel greener with sustainable aviation fuels. We admire Microsoft\u2019s leadership and we're grateful to partner with them to bring travel back in a way that cares to both individual guests and the environment. As we progress forward we know there's significant work still to be done, to ensure we have a thriving post-COVID network and a business model that can drive us to, and then beyond our pre-COVID size. I want to echo Brad's thanks to the individuals and teams at Alaska and Horizon who are working so hard to control what can be controlled in this moment. For the reasons I've shared today, I'm optimistic that we will see our way through this crisis and emerge stronger forward. And with that, I'll pass it to Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Ben and good morning to everyone on the call today. In my comments this morning, I'll provide brief updates on our liquidity, cash burn performance and cost restructuring efforts. Last quarter, I shared details with you about the $3 billion of liquidity that we added to our balance sheets since March, including the $1.2 billion EETC we completed in early July. We have secured an additional $1.9 billion in allocation under the CARES Act loan program. The terms of this program were ultimately attractive to us. The loan comes at a reasonable cost with maximum flexibility, which we view it as a priority. We don't want to add long-term embedded debt in interest costs, if we can avoid it, especially if we ultimately find we do not need it to finance losses. All of us at Alaska want to thank Secretary Mnuchin and his team at treasury for their efforts to develop and move this loan program forward in a very short period of time. The CARES Act loan program allows for incremental draws through March of 2021, after a required initial drop 10% of our allocation. Our $3.7 billion of cash balance today includes 135 million from an initial draw. We plan to make final decisions on how much to draw sometime after the new year. If we added the entire remaining CARES Act loan allocation available to us to the 3.7 billion we have on hand, our total effective liquidity is $5.5 billion, which at current burn rates is approximately four years of liquidity. While we have some remaining assets we can borrow against, as we sit today we don't foresee any additional liquidity efforts being required right now. The next decision in front of us is whether to pay down our refinance, our credit facility, and 364-day term loans due in March and April of next year. I'll reemphasize a data point, Brad highlighted, which is that we actually closed the third quarter with adjusted net debt of approximately $1.7 billion, which impressively is flat with the year end 2019. In very round dollars, we did burn 1 billion since the onset of COVID. However, we paid down 250 million of debt and the PSP grant provided 750 million to fund most of our payroll over this period. This underscores the importance of the PSP grant program, which was instrumental in protecting jobs and helping us to bridge the extreme financial deterioration we saw in the first six months of this pandemic. That deterioration continues of course today and only continued PSP support can reliably help avoid balance sheet destruction for the industry. Balance sheets that will be needed to fuel future industry recovery and growth, which would we believe support and accelerate the broader economic recovery in growth needed in our country. Turning to cash burn on a company size adjusted basis, our $4 million of cash burn per day compares well to others in the industry. As a reminder, our burn figure has thus far included cash revenues and most cash outlays, including debt service and CapEx. However, now that we have fantastic liquidity and we've reduced and stabilized our spending, we will increasingly focus on cash flow from operations trends as our primary cash metric. Total cash remains important, but as we incur more one-time outlays such as severance and lump sum payments to employees and potential large debt payoffs, our mindset is that watching total liquidity, net debt and operating cash flows is more appropriate than an all in number that will be lumpier and therefore potentially less meaningful. Very early in the pandemic we haven't articulated a goal to reach cash burn breakeven by year's end. While I'm happy with our progress on cash burn reduction and believe we may have the best results on this metric in the industry, we do not expect to hit our target by December for three primary reasons. First, we are bringing capacity back into Seattle somewhat faster than originally planned. Second, as mentioned previously, blocking middle seats caps the effective load factor we can achieve to a level slightly under what's required for cash breakeven. And third while trending consistently positive, the return of demand has been slower than our original guests back in April, which admittedly we developed with very little to go on at the time. Given what we know today, I do expect our cash burn to continue to improve during Q4. For the next several months, we expect our monthly cash outflows to be about $450 million to $475 million per month, given the amount of capacity we are planning to deploy and required debt payments. Month-to-month, there will be some timing effects but that is a decent range for the next quarter or two. I do anticipate that as we've done today, our cash burn progress towards breakeven will be ahead of the industry. At this point, it will require further recovery of demand and likely the removal of middle seat blocks in order to achieve. Turning back to costs, in July we initiated early out programs and extended leave options for all of our frontline teams. We had over 700 employees take advantage of permanent early outs and over 3,300 individuals take extended leaves or voluntary furloughs. This allowed us to reduce the number of involuntary \u2013 sorry voluntary furloughs \u2013 this allowed us to reduce the number of involuntary furloughs necessary in October to around 400, in addition to the 350 management positions that were permanently eliminated. As a result of these programs, we recorded a one-time special item in the third quarter of $320 million. Temporary payroll savings from these decisions are expected to be $375 million in total and permanent annual savings from the early out programs and our management reduction in force will be $132 million annually. The temporary cost savings begin to taper down in April of 2021 and sunset in late 2022. Our leap programs allow us to recall employees to support the operation should we need to, which would bring costs back more quickly as those employees return to full pay and benefits. Although I will say our goal is to bring back our flying and our people as soon as demand allows us to. Beyond the actions we've taken to reduce payroll costs, we are also making progress on the structural cost reductions we discussed on the last call. I shared previously that we were targeting initially at least $250 million of permanent structural cost savings to help return us to pre-COVID CASM-ex levels even if we were to remain a 20% smaller company. Several initiatives are underway to help meet this goal the largest of which include, first, the aforementioned permanent payroll savings of 130 million annually. Second, our efforts to improve the ownership cost and cost efficiency of our fleet, over the next three years we will see the expiration of 42 of our 61 Airbus leases, which represents an opportunity to either extend those leases at farer lower rates to what we pay today or possibly replace them with larger more efficient aircraft. Third, given payroll is 35% of our cost structure, we intend to return to our pre-Virgin acquisition productivity levels, which were the highest we've ever achieved. This will require bold leadership and also commitment of our people as we work to restore this historical competitive advantage. Fourth, we've completed the elimination of at least $35 million of non-wage overhead spent. Fifth, we've identified $50 million in supplier renegotiations of which we've achieved over $25 million to-date from hotels, healthcare providers, software licensing, and changes to airport vendors and rates. And there are several other initiatives, including real estate cost savings and moving E-175s into markets in the state of Alaska where demand cannot support continued mainland flying. I believe that these initiatives are the right first steps to begin restoring our cost structure. There's one thing we have learned and are committed to as a leadership team, it is that low cost discipline is simply a requirement of this industry, if you want to be able to survive in the downturns and thrive in the ups. So 90 days ago, we were hoping for a better quarter brought-on by the ebbing of this health crisis and a return to carrying our guests around the country, that didn't fully happen, but each month has improved since March and despite how intently focused we are on weathering this downturn, we are ultimately optimistic. Our guests want to travel, we have superb liquidity, as Brad outlined. We have unmatched competitive advantages. And we have an amazing group of 22,000 people dedicated to making this company successful. And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator, and thanks for your time, everybody. So I just have one question. When you talk about bringing capacity back faster than you intended, but you're still not able to reach positive or breakeven cash flow or cash burn. Why would you bring the capacity back sooner when it makes sense to not bring the capacity back just yet and wait on that?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Maybe I'll start, Helane, then I'm sure Andrew will want to chime in. I think one of the variables in that is the fact that we blocked middle seats and decided to continue to do so through the end of the year. And I think what we're seeing in some of the more peak periods is there's a potential with the middle seats block. We would be spilling demand, which we really aren't in a position to want to do. And so it made sense for us to build out more of our pre-COVID Seattle network, much, much quicker, a little bit quicker than we had originally planned to do, but Andrew could add to as well.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Hi, Helane. I think, and again, the key word there from Shane was sort of planned at the beginning. But we're quite confident in what's happening in the fourth quarter. And our percentage of flying in leisure markets in the fourth quarter is significantly more than it was last year. And we're seeing a lot of good flying in our leisure destinations, some destinations. And of course with Hawaii opening up, we were actually down 88% in Hawaii capacity in the third quarter. We're going to be down only half that in the fourth, given the opening and the testing going on. So we feel pretty good about the type and nature of our flying in the fourth quarter to continue to grow this and generate new revenues.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then for my follow-up, Andrew, while I have you, can you talk about credit card spending and signups and what you're seeing there in this environment?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, I think I just went back the last 10 weeks about bookings in actually new credit card accounts actually. And our new credit card accounts have been increasing every week on average by 5%. And as far as our overall credit cards spend goes, it's been stable. I don't think we normally disclose what percentage that is down. But I will say that it's significantly better than passengers and bookings right now. But given the economy and everything like that, my personal view is that our credit card is performing quite well.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Thanks very much. Thanks, team.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Helane.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: The next question will come from Andrew Didora with BOA. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning everyone, and thank you for the questions. My first question is for either Ben or Andrew. With the leisure driven demand, and Ben, in your comments, you mentioned that promotional activity is stimulating some travel for you. Can you maybe comment a little bit on the types of competitive actions that you're seeing out there in the market, particularly on pricing given that leisure is so sensitive to this item?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. You say the normal pricing activities, we have just in the normal marketplace, competitors doing things with fizz. I think overall the business is way more stable, but I think mostly right now for us at least is focusing on bringing the people back. Just on old people I talk to, once someone has flown their confidence in flying again is materially stronger. So we believe that getting passengers to fly is really, really important. I think overall our average fare was down about 17% in the third quarter. But again, I'm not personally seeing anything out of the usual as it relates to pricing actions.\nBen Minicucci: And Andrew, it's Ben. And I think, like I said in the script, I think we're seeing the ability to stimulate traffic with lower fares. And we have this great thing with Russell Wilson, which I didn't mention that. Every time Russell Wilson throws a touchdown or two or three, you get a 10% discount for every touchdown he throws, and we're seeing good reaction to that. So thanks for your question.\nAndrew Didora: Sure. Thank you for that. And then just my second one, just for Shane, now there\u2019s some great color on some of the structural cost savings, maybe any initial thoughts on how you're thinking about unit costs once you get through the crisis, maybe perhaps relative to 2019 levels? That's it for me.\nShane Tackett: Yes, thanks, Andrew. And I'll follow on with that. I'm a big supporter of running the ball this year with the Seahawks. And Russell got 19 touchdowns. This is a lot of discounts. But we're happy that customers are getting good discounts right now. Yes, Andrew, I know everybody's interested in that. We are anxious to sort of come out with something, in terms of a target with a date attached to it, but we're not going to do that today on this call. I think we need a little more time to really understand where we think that the sort of capacity is going to go over the next 12 to 18 months, and then really lock in some of these savings initiatives. So I think I totaled about $190 million that we're very confident. We've got line of sight and capturing, and we've got significantly more than that that we're working on cost structure. And we'll continue to come to you all with more clarity and more specificity as the earnings calls go by over the next couple of quarters. Right now we are really, really focused on getting within \u2013 a handful of percentage points of our pre-COVID chasm max sometime next year. But we're not at a point where we can totally forecast and give you a date on that yet.\nAndrew Didora: Fair enough. Thanks, Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: The next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. Regarding your comment about the $450 million to $470 million a month cash outflows, could you give us an idea of kind of what that was in the third quarter and if it includes kind of the cost reductions that you've outlined? And also just along with that, what do you expect in terms of debts and severance in like fourth quarter in 2021 just so we can have an appreciation for the other types of cash outflows?\nShane Tackett: Yes, Savi. So in Q3, it was less than that. We had a little bit less capacity deployed. I believe our total operating expenses are 1.1x or something like that. So I think with debt, it was probably $400 million, $415 million or something like that. So it's up a bit with the incremental capacity. What was the second part of the question?\nSavi Syth: Sorry, I didn't realize that that includes the debt. I was just wondering what other \u2013 if there's any severance cash components or other cash outlays that's not part of that core component that we should be mindful of?\nShane Tackett: Yes. So we had about $30 million in a one-time sort of severance lump sum that hit October. There's \u2013 we don't expect any more than that at this point. So that'll be in our Q4 results and it's part of that number. In terms of the Q4 sort of $450 million to $475 million that it includes cost restructure items, recall that on our Q2 call we had said our goal was to hit exit rate savings of $250 million. So, the $190 million I just gave you on an exit rate basis would be in that number. And any more we can do between now and the end of the year could improve that a little bit.\nSavi Syth: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe another, just to follow-up on the cash breakeven comment that you made about 60% of passengers. Is that kind of at flattish yields and kind of \u2013 what kind of ATL burn are you assuming in there?\nShane Tackett: Yes. I'll let Chris give some color on ATL because we prepared for this question and he's got a lot of color on it.\nSavi Syth: Great.\nShane Tackett: But we are assuming lower yields. Maybe I won't share what the specific planning assumption is, but we are assuming pricing is depressed for a bit.\nChris Berry: Yes. And, Savi, on ATL, I mean, most folks I think on the call know air traffic liability, it's really that cash we collect in advance of sending someone on a trip, right? So over time that mix has changed dramatically. So if you look at where we were pre-COVID about 95% of our total $1.2 billion of ATL was related to tickets with a definitive departure date, and 5% were related to credits like refunds and things like that. Well, that mix has changed a lot and we're about 50-50 now. So about $600 million of our $1.1 billion air traffic liability is related to these refunds that we provided to customers over the past few months. So that's a lot more difficult to forecast when that's going to be used versus the ticket ATL. And so we're looking at that right now. Andrew and his team are doing some promotions to entice people to use those credits maybe a little bit differently. But to give you some color in Q3, about 15% to 20% of all new bookings, where by using these credits versus cash. And typically that's about a 2% of total bookings using these credits. So we are seeing a cash headwind because of that. But we're doing a lot of things on the promotional side to make sure that customers have a choice, whether to use those credits or use something else or convert those to miles by just giving our customers more options as we look at that, so that we can avoid sort of a run on the bank and that credit.\nShane Tackett: Chris, you were saying that it's roughly $50 million of revenue in a month that's not\u2026\nChris Berry: Bookings a month. That's right. That's right. \nShane Tackett: Does that help, Savi?\nSavi Syth: Super helpful color. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning. A follow-up on Savi\u2019s question and I recognize that ATL is part of the equation, but could you simply express cash breakeven on a revenue basis, that's how Southwest and others are doing it?\nShane Tackett: Sorry. I want to make sure I understand the question, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: Well, you were discussing kind of very even on a passenger on a volume basis, but with lower yields. I'm just wondering, just put some goalposts around the actual revenue figure expressed as a percentage of 2019 that gets you in the ballpark at zero cash burn.\nShane Tackett: Yes. It's close to 60%, 62%.\nJamie Baker: And that\u2019s not negative 60% to 62%. That's 60% to 62% of 2019, correct?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Correct.\nJamie Baker: Okay, perfect. Perfect. And then second question, and thank you very much for that, can you give us some more color on demand trends to Hawaii? In particular, how quickly did they react to the recent headlines? And also what level of revenue are you running in the fourth quarter as a percentage of last year? American made the comment today that some of their short haul international beach markets are sort of minus 30%. I recognize that your capacity is going to be down about 50% touring from the islands, but how should we think about the revenue component there?\nAndrew Harrison: Jamie, it\u2019s Andrew.\nJamie Baker: Because it seems like everything is pretty favorable at the moment.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think what I can tell you, what I've seen personally is that once Hawaii announced this program and the opening up, we started to see bookings obviously increase materially and we continue to see every day higher bookings than the day before in Hawaii. I would just say though that we're sort of going to be having about 19 flights a day, starting in November, going into December when we used to have like 30, 33. So there's a long way to go, but I think for us, as you know, it used to be double-digit percentages of our capacity and revenues. Hawaii was dropped down to like 2%. So that at least for us as our revenue recovery goes is a good story. As it relates to bookings in general, I think what's encouraging a little bit is that the close-in bookings out, what they've always been in getting a little bit better, but what we are seeing is people willing and more comfortable to book further out. And that trend has been increasing week to week to week. So all that being said, we are headed in the right direction on those fronts, although it's slow going.\nJamie Baker: Would that imply on a positive Hawaiian \u2013 in the first quarter then, possibly?\nAndrew Harrison: That's a great question, which we will not be answering that, but thank you.\nJamie Baker: Great. Fair enough. Old habits die hard. Thank you, everybody. Take care.\nOperator: The next question will come from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Good morning. Shane or Brad, when you think about your capital structure post-COVID, how much more conservatively do you think it needs to be as a result of kind of what's transpiring? Does all this not change that, you just kind of hope it doesn't happen again? Or do you think you need to run the business with some sort of significant net cash position? Any thoughts there.\nBrad Tilden: Yes. It's a great question, Joe. I think we are \u2013 we really feel supported. Our long-term strategy of keeping a conservative balance, even we've actually kept a pretty cash position, the whole sort of financial profile on the P&L side are low cost, low reliance on fares. We sort of feel like a time like this validates that strategy. As we look forward like would that change, would we want a higher percentage of cash to revenues or lower adjusted depth of cap, I think that's something we sort of want to look to. I'll tell you, as we said in the script, I personally am really, really hardened by the fact that we are sitting here at September 30 and have not taken on net debt as a result of this crisis. It's sort of an amazing statistic and the government gets credit for that. I mean, the $725 million of comp definitely, definitely helped us, but that helped us most in April and May when it was bad, we're doing a much better sort of on our own now. So I personally \u2013 but you guys, you make us smarter with your questions and it's something we should think about, but if myself, I think what we're seeing today sort of validated Alaska's profile going into this thing, I think it was a pretty good cash position, a pretty good balance sheet, excellent sort of set up for the marketplace in terms of low fares and low costs. And I'm not thinking at the moment we'd have a lot of changes coming out of this crisis.\nJoseph DeNardi: Shane, what do you think?\nShane Tackett: I actually totally agree with Brad. I think we might carry a little more cash for a little while until we get really confident in the recovery. But once we do, I think we had a really nice position going into this and it's worked out well for us over the last six or eight months.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. That's helpful. And then Andrew, can you talk about when you or when BofA thinks spend on the covering card will get back to where it was in 2019? And can you remind us, I guess the status of the contract between you and Bank of America? Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. We have a number of years left on the contract. We don't really disclose the exact dates, but there's a few years left on that. As we shared historically about $1.1 billion cash generated by the program, as I shared in my earlier remarks the economy is obviously going to have an impact and you can do your own modeling on credit card impacts of negative GDP. But I think the best thing I would share with you today is that our program has continued to grow. We've been flattish spend on our card holders for the last four weeks. But again, it's at a level that is okay, it's not really bad.\nShane Tackett: No, like, Andrew, correct me if I'm wrong, but I would like if you look at spending in the economy of this card, the vast majority of the spending is not on airline tickets. It\u2019s some things other than airline tickets. And I would expect that our card is completely doing as any other credit card out there, probably better. It's people are spending less money on trips and going to shows and going to movies. And so credit card spending is down. But I would think that our card spending is right in line with credit activity in the economy at large.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I\u2019ll say, we know from speaking to the bank and others that our card is performing very well than other cards. This is a true statement.\nJoseph DeNardi: Are you on a trend to get back there sometime next year or is that way too soon? Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison: And I plan on commenting on that. I think I would just roll all these comments into the whole cash flow discussion that we've been having.\nShane Tackett: And the economy, it's sort of like, how's the economy doing and what's the form of payment \u2013 credit card form of payment in relation to economic activity. I'm not sure we have unique insight on this one.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Yes. Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: The next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Hey, everybody. Good morning. The PSP extension; if it's passed in the next few weeks, would you contemplate bringing these folks back onto the payroll, but just telling them to stay home until demand recovers to the point where they're needed? Or would you just bring them back and put them to work and just burn the cash like PSP is designed to be burned?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Hey Hunter, good morning this is Shane. Yes, I think we \u2013 our mindset is we want the right level of staffing for the amount of volume we've got today. And I think there are some provisions in the program that we have to and of course would follow. So some of that is at the choice of the employee, but what we had done previously is, really offered leaves and we had enhanced some of those leaves. I don't know who would go back to enhanced leave structures, but we want to get back to having the right head count for the volume that we've got and so that's our focus.  We've got targets for every division. I\u2019ve mentioned in the script, we'd like to get back to pre-Virgin productivity levels over time. And that's really where our mindset is right now. The tough thing I don't \u2013 we don't that there are different types of leave programs just based on the complexity of each of the professions that we have here. We don't generally have a mindset that is one where we want to pay a lot of money to people to not be working. It's a really unique sort of approach that's kind of had to happen just given everything that's going on right now, but that's not where our basic mindset would be. So we would try to get people to continue to take leaves if they could do that and just have the right number of FTEs on staff that we need to run the operation.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And as a follow-up, I mean, are you sure that you'd have enough folks? I mean, you have minimum service requirements, presumably restored as part of PSP. You'd probably have to \u2013you said in the 8-K you probably recall this part of people relatively quickly. Are you going to have to pull some of the 4,000 back from voluntary leaves as well? And to that, like if PSP comes and then answer the question is, are you going to have to rehire the \u2013 bring back the 400 folks and then bring back another 500 folks from early leave? And then what sort of other costs would you incur in addition to just obviously labor costs to use PSP? What other friction costs arise? I mean, pulling planes out of storage and incurring more landing fees and things like that, what sort of incremental cost, how do we know that getting PSP is actually a good thing for the cash balance six months later?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Really good question, I don't connect the two in terms of the recall relative to PSP. During the first PSP program, we had thousands of people on leaves during that \u2013 unpaid leave during that period of months as well. So I really think, our staffing is going to be a function as I said of the capacity we're planning to fly.  I think the downside case would be if there was another sort of really a negative trend on demand or something in forward months where we currently have more aircraft than we would find that we needed at the time. That's something that we're cognizant could happen, it's not what we think is likely to happen right now and so there's not a lot of incremental friction costs due to PSP, if we want to bring planes out, it's going to be because we've decided we want to operate that capacity.  We're well within our current requirements for service right now with the current fleet we have. So we don't need incremental airplanes to do that nor do we need incremental people right now to meet those minimum conditions.\nHunter Keay: All right, Shane, thank you very much.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks Hunter. \nShane Tackett: Thanks Hunter.\nOperator: The next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Just with regard to fleet, appreciate the lease returns that you've outlined here. What is the primary factor you're trying to solve for? Is it operating costs or is it capital and should we be positioning Alaska has like a very, very disciplined capital story at this point or are you just sort of biding your time to put in a big order on the MAX? \nShane Tackett: Hi Duane, it\u2019s Shane, thanks for the question. We're going to make this decision \u2013 there's a lot of factors that are going to go into it, but we're going to make it based on an MPV and on a return perspective. We think we can do it in a way ultimately that also helps the P&L and that is totally responsible in terms of how we manage capital. And we've talked about this very openly, there's a case to be made that we can replace lease content with new lease content. So we \u2013 and I know you all look at that as it is a commitment over a long-term, but it's less immediate cash out the door. So I think there's a lot of flexibility here on how we do this.  Strangely enough, I think we're just \u2013 we're sort of myself and Matt and the treasury and fleet teams are very anxious to be able to go and get out of some of these pretty onerous leases that we have on the A320s and get into better aircraft or much better leases for us. So it's a couple or three years still to fully see its way through, but we're going to be very cognizant of how much cash we're using. We're going to be very cognizant of debt-to-cap, those sorts of metrics, we're not giving up on any of those sort of historical ideals that we've had, but\u2026 \nAndrew Harrison: It's both, its return on invested capital. The return story's going to be there, the ROIC story is going to be there. \nShane Tackett: Yes.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes. It's definitely an opportunity and I appreciate that. I guess, for now how should investors be thinking about the annual CapEx over the last \u2013 over the next few years? Thanks for taking the questions. \nShane Tackett: Yes, that's another great question. I put that in sort of what Andrew in terms of forward, look on unit cost as well, where we know that folks want to know kind of what our appetite for capital is over the next little bit. We're not in a position to give you a strong forecast today and it's just because it's still in flux. It's we haven't made decisions yet. So as soon as we do make decisions, we'll be very transparent about those and we're just not at that point yet. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: I guess you have made comments about deposits that you have out there and no more cash would go out the door until those deposit surbs are absorbed. Is that still the case or has that changed? \nShane Tackett: Nope, that's totally consistent with our thinking today. We intend to draw those down before we use fresh capital. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you. \nBrad Tilden: Thanks Duane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks Duane.\nOperator: The next question will come from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Actually a quick follow-up to Duane's question, so on the fleet decision, what's the gating factor? Do we need for the MAX to be flying again, if you guys make the decision, is it just lessors have their handfuls? And so, you don't have a great line of sight on what the new lease cost will be. What's the gating factor for you guys to kind of pull the trigger on this?\nNat Pieper: Hey, Katie, it's Nat Pieper, thanks for the question. I think as we've been clear and consistent all along, we love all of our airplanes, but the A319s and A320s are uneconomic relative to others. It's a logical time as we're resizing our fleet getting it to best-match demand, to really figure out how do we get the best economic aircraft on the field and with the A320s, you can either shrink that suite, we can extend leases or we can replace them with something better.  We're talking to both Boeing and Airbus. We're talking to leasing companies, no surprise. Shane and I have a lot of friends these days on the phone. And I think what we're looking for is the right set of opportunistic chances to come into play. Of course, the MAX needs to be recertified for that to be a viable candidate airplane and everything we're hearing from Boeing is positive on that front. So it certainly factors into our thinking as does the supply demand imbalance for aircraft in the market.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up on demand, one of your competitors noted that the correlation between bookings and COVID cases seem to be breaking down, I guess, first are you seeing the same thing? And then if so, is that driven by purely by parts of the country that aren't subject to travel quarantines or are you seeing more momentum on demand from innovation like your pilot tests here in terms of getting people tested before flying to Hawaii? Any clarity that would be helpful, thanks.\nBen Minicucci: Yes. Thanks Katie. The way we think about it is really we're in wave three, there was wave one, wave two hitting in the summer and wave three right now. And we're very much seeing everything that our competitor is saying as it relates to that. I think a couple of things, I think number one, and you hit on it is that, it's really occurring more in the middle of the country or outside of that core network, inside the coasts are in a decent shape, all things being equal. So we're not seeing the impact there. And I also think that there's just, as we talk more and all the more layers of safety, more people fly and when they fly, they're okay to fly again.  I just think there's a little bit of positive momentum in that out, again we are just seeing our guests grow every single week over the last 10 weeks and we have not seen that momentum slow.\nCatherine O'Brien : Got it. Thank you very much. Go ahead.\nBrad Tilden: I'm sure this is available in public sources, industry resources as well, but bookings in the last three months have definitely been increasing at a higher rate than employments. And so I think there is a greater disconnect between what coronavirus cases and so forth. I think as Andrew said earlier, people that have flown are having a good experience, are willing to come back. These data sources that are out there, the Department of Defense, the study, the IOTA study, they are \u2013 safe to fly. We totally believe that it's safe to fly. And I think our customers are increasingly having more confidence in flying. So I think it all bodes well for the future.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great color. Thank you so much, Brad. \nBrad Tilden: Yes. \nOperator: The next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nMike Linenberg: Hey good morning. Just a couple of quick ones here, actually really a two part question, just with respect to your decision to block middle seats into January. Ben, you\u2019ve spent a little bit of time talking about the science and suggested just based on what you said that, maybe there was less of a need to do it. And then Shane, you even talked about spilling traffic. So I'm curious on the decision to extend it, is that also driven by competitive reasons? And then sort of a follow-up on that by blocking that middle seat maybe this is more to Andrew, just your ability to yield manage up. My sense is that, with loads where they were across the industry, many carriers have really struggled to push fairs up and it's true, your yields are better, but I'm just curious anecdotally or even if you can give us something more tangible about your ability to hold out inventory for a longer period to get that higher fare. Thanks for taking my questions.\nBen Minicucci: Yes. Mike, thank you. It's a great question. So the way we look at it is, we know it's safe to fly. I think after eight months of being in this thing, our personal experience and these latest scientific studies have just proven what our experience has shown is that it's safe to fly. The issue is that we know that, I'm sure if you talk to your family and friends, and you talk to other folks that society as a whole probably is not in the same place where they're believing that it's safe to fly.  So our view is that we've got the next couple of months where we can educate even our own employees, educate customers that it is safe to fly as we slowly ease into the end of the year. And so that's how we were thinking about it. I mean, honestly it's safe to fly right now, but we've got some work to do, just getting the information out there. Then as we get into the new year, like we said \u2013 we're going to calibrate how we're going to open up the middle seats. And I think we have a good plan really early into the new year, again given the things don't change radically from where we are today towards the first and second quarter.\nMichael Linenberg: Then would you consider, if Christmas bookings are strong would you consider on some flights removing that pre-January, first week of January?\nBen Minicucci: You know what I would say with everything Mike is, we want to be nimble. We want to look at all the information, want to look at what's going on there. Right now, we've made a decision that we're going to block through the end of the year. And that's been our thinking, but again we'll gather all the information and we'll make the right decisions every step of the way with our customers and with our employees in mind.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Then just the Andrew piece on ability to yield up?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, I think so a couple of things, as we said we're going to be blocking through January 6, that's what we tell our guests and they should have confidence when they book that we'll be blocking those seats. But to Ben's point, we're going to be revisiting that going forward, RM will do what they will do and yield up on big flights. But at the end of the day there is a fixed basis cost of flying an aircraft. And obviously the economics of the business we'd much prefer to have low fares and put more people on the same departure than to add more departures.  So I think, as we go into the new year and we continue to watch this environment this'll be an important part of our economics and how we bring cash flows in and so more to come on that. \nMichael Linenberg: Great. Thank you everyone. \nBen Minicucci: Thanks Mike.\nShane Tackett: Thanks Mike. \nOperator: The next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for having me on. Shane, I just wanted to come back to those structural cost opportunities and I think getting back to 2019 CASM-ex, just to clarify is that structured around being roughly 20% smaller? And I think there was a follow-up as well being revenue breakeven around 60% to 62% of where you are in 2019 is that also assuming roughly 20% smaller airline?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Brandon, so the way we've tried articulate this is even if we're smaller by 20%, we want to reach those unit cost goals. I'm not saying we're going to be smaller by 20%. Our assumption for next summer is we are \u2013 we want to get back to our pre-COVID levels and then grow from there and we think we've got a business model that can do that, but we're going to be smart about it. And we've got to see the returns in order to get there to the degree that we're able to approach our pre-COVID size, it will be incrementally easier to get to our pre-COVID CASM-ex with the structural cost reductions that we're identifying and executing.  And so there could be some upside over time as we re-approach sort of our pre-COVID size. The 60% to 62% is simply the percent of revenue we need to get back to relative to 2019 at any size in order to get to cash breakeven.\nBrandon Oglenski: Well, I appreciate that. And I think, you clarified that as well that you're targeting $250 million in savings and you're confident on the 190 million, could you go over those last few buckets of savings because it went really fast. Do you mind?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Sorry, the ones that I said in the script that had sort of actual dollars attached for wages, it really from the early outs in the management reduction in force, non-wage overhead categories of at least $35 million, supplier rates we have $50 million, $25 million of which we've already secured and that's hotels, some of our software licensing healthcare some other areas. And then suite is a big one and that might be a little longer in terms of the timing, productivity and some real estate savings as well are a couple of the other categories I mentioned. \nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. \nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Brandon.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Brandon. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Yes, sir. The final question will come from Myles Walton with UBS. Please. Go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one clarification and one question. On the clarification, the mainline fuel efficiency up 12% it's been trending in that direction. I'm just curious from a fleet perspective can you just clarify on the sustainability of that level of efficiency? And secondly, on the regional as a percent of the network as you reconstitute here, should we think about it going back to 10% of the network versus the 20% you've been running? Or is there any difference in changes to reconstitute the network, how you're thinking about the regional composition as well? Thanks.\nBrad Tilden: Hey Myles, maybe I'll take both of those just to be super efficient. On the fuel efficiency thing, there's three drivers, one is we're relatively flying more fuel efficient aircraft, so the ones that we have parked tend to be some of our least fuel efficient aircraft.  Two, there is just \u2013 they're starting to come back, but there weren't taxi really lines for a long period of time. So we're not burning fuel sort of waiting for planes to get onto the runway. And then light loads is the third contributor, and so I don't \u2013 as flights come back as people come back and are full fleet comes back and more roughly comes back, you'll see that not perform as well.  And then I think, long-term in terms of what the network shakeout is, it's a bit up in the air. I think our focus right now is getting our main line operation back to pre-COVID levels, which would put us back to the 90-10 split that we had prior. We've got a couple of regional aircraft on order several years from now. And we don't really \u2013 we're not actively working on something right now, different than that.\nBen Minicucci: But the regional flying will be pretty much back to pre-COVID level in the late November, December. And so that percentage change is going to be moving around as we bring more mainline back. \nMyles Walton: Okay. Thank you so much.\nBrad Tilden: Already, I think that concludes the time that we've got today. We appreciate everybody's interest in us, and we look forward to talking with you all in 90 days time. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call and this call will be available for future playback at alaskaair.com.

My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded, and will be available for future playback at alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director, Investor Relations Emily Halverson.\nEmily Halverson: Thank you, Erica. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 earnings call. On today's call, you'll hear updates from Brad, Ben and Shane. Several other members of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. The global health and economic crises continue to significantly impact our business and outlook. This morning Alaska Air Group reported a second quarter GAAP net loss of $214 million. Excluding special items and mark-to-market adjustments, Air Group reported an adjusted net loss of $439 million. Special items this quarter include approximately $69 million of lease return charges that were triggered as a result of certain aircraft being permanently parked and a $362 million benefit related to the CARES Act payroll support program wage offset. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release. And now, I'll turn it over to Brad for his opening remarks.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Emily and good morning, everybody. As you all know, we're now nearly five months into the deepest and most uncertain downturn in aviation history. While we've weathered many crises before, this global health pandemic and economic devastation are unlike any the industry has faced before. Here at Alaska we're focused on two priorities: first, keeping our employees and guests healthy and safe; and second, ensuring our airline is here to support and serve them in the future. I'm very confident that we're taking the right steps to get us through the crisis and to ensure our long-term success. In the second quarter, our leaders and frontline employees took dramatic action to reduce our capacity to significantly lower our cost trajectory, to fortify our liquidity and to moderate our cash burn rate. The men and women of Alaska and Horizon have always been at their best in the face of adversity and this could not be more true today. Here are a few examples of their efforts. Our health and safety team led by Max Tidwell have led the charge in ensuring the health and safety of our guests. They've partnered with infectious disease experts from the University of Washington and other medical advisers to add layers of safety throughout the travel journey that build our guest confidence in flying. Ben will touch on these measures in a moment and many of these are also highlighted in our press release. Our crews and frontline workers have continued to provide our guests with remarkable care. Scaling down our operation, revising schedules and changing policies have introduced a great deal of change and complexity to our operation. Our people have handled this complexity with poise and grace, educating our guests about the in-airport and onboard policy changes and providing them the best and safest experience possible. In the back office, our alliance teams and many others have continued to lay important groundwork for our future by moving our partnerships with American and oneworld forward. We're pleased to announce that we've received our formal invitation to join the oneworld alliance. And we challenge our teams to accelerate their behind-the-scenes efforts to push for our entrance by the end of the year. This is admittedly an aggressive goal. And our finance and legal teams have worked with dedication to preserve and enhance our financial strength. In July, the team secured new EETC debt financing of nearly $1.2 billion, increasing our already strong liquidity position to $3.7 billion today. We entered this crisis with a strong balance sheet and this liquidity infusion gives us even more staying power.  As Emily mentioned, we reported a second quarter adjusted net loss of $439 million which excludes the benefit of CARES Act payroll support program. These results came while flying at capacity levels that were 75% below the prior year. This is a sobering loss. It's the largest quarterly loss in our history and it's obviously not a sustainable result.  Our total revenues were down 82% for the quarter. And as bad as this number is, we believe it will be significantly better than the industry which is a testament to our route structure and our low fares. Our adjusted operating expenses were down 47% for the quarter and excluding PSP wage offsets, our wages and related costs were down 20%.  In the second quarter, we were among the fastest in the industry to bring our cash burn rate down. During the month of June, our absolute cash burn rate of $4 million per day was best in the industry on a size-adjusted basis. We expect our July cash burn rate to be up in part due to slowing ticket sales.  We're fully focused on getting our cash burn rate to zero. As you know, it's our goal to reach this objective by year-end and achieving this goal will require two things: one it will require us to do everything possible to manage costs and to help our customers know that they are safe flying with us; and two it will require a more positive national backdrop with respect to the virus. The news of late has been negative with cases up, return-to-office schedules delayed, quarantines extended and schools announcing remote learning for the fall. We take great pride in controlling everything that is within our control. We will continue to do this and I am very confident that Alaska will reach cash breakeven at or near the front of the pack with respect to our airline competitors.  Once we get beyond cash breakeven, we have confidence that our low-fare low-cost structure and our strong network footprint will continue to be a source of strength, but the reality we likely face is that a recovery to 2019 levels will take at least two years.  Flexibility is essential in this environment. But given what we know today, we are planning for our business to be smaller for the foreseeable future. Ben will share more details in a moment, but our current plans are to be 35% smaller than last year in October and then building gradually to 20% smaller than 2019 levels by the summer of 2021.  We've made some difficult changes to reduce management positions and we're working on programs now for our frontline employees. We've made significant progress already and I'm optimistic that we'll continue to reduce the number of furloughs required through early-out programs, leaves of absence and incentive lines.  Ben and Shane will talk more about these in a moment. To be clear, our employees did nothing to cause or contribute to the economic environment that has led us to make these challenging decisions and they've given everything they've got to push Alaska and Horizon forward. These two facts make these decisions incredibly difficult. We look forward to a day when we return to growing our airline.  For today, we're focused on structuring our organization for our current reality and this means adjusting our fleet size and our employee base. While this is a necessary step, I know that everyone here has the resolve to set a strong new foundation from which we can and will build our airline back to the size and growth trajectory we had prior to the crisis. Before I pass this over to Ben, I want to recognize the heavy weight that many people in our country, including many of our employees are carrying in these trying times. On top of the tragedy of the coronavirus, our nation is grappling with long-standing and deeply rooted racial injustice. We all have a responsibility to do better, and I want the black employees at Alaska and Horizon to know that this is a responsibility that those of us in leadership embrace. We stand for helping one another and we stand for being good to one another. We are committed to listen, to learn and to do everything we can to effect positive and lasting changes in our company, in our communities and in our country. And with that, I'll turn this over to Ben.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Since this crisis began, our leadership team has been focused on creating plans for whatever scenario we may encounter to candidly communicate those plans with our people and then to execute to the best of our abilities. Before updating you on how we're doing that, I'd like to provide some context for what we're seeing in the current environment. By several measures, it is clear that the low point in this down cycle was in April. And we have now begun the slow likely uneven climb to recovery. April load factors were 16% as passenger counts had bottomed early in the month at only 4% of normal levels. Flight searches and new bookings hit a low point the following week demonstrating confidence in future travel was also eroding. Load factors then improved to 52% for June, due to both returning passenger demand and actions we took to right-size our capacity. Passenger counts increased to an average of 30,000 per day or 20% of normal and flight searches at alaskaair.com rebounded to better than 50% of normal. These developments came as markets along the West Coast and the Southwest, including Texas, Phoenix and Las Vegas, moved to reopen and people's confidence in flying grew, driving leisure demand back to approximately 50% of normal levels. We expect July load factors to show further improvement to approximately 55% on a sequential 5 point increase in capacity from June. But, as Brad mentioned, we've seen some of these upward trends stall more recently as many of the geographies where we fly have experienced an increase in case levels, which paused many of the local reopening plans. Demand is not something we can fully control, but we are doing our best to earn guest confidence and create the right environment for an eventual strong return in demand. Today, we recognize that customers fall into one of three buckets: those who will travel, those who might travel, and those who won't travel. By delivering best-in-class, health and safety policies and clear communications, we're connecting with those who will and those who might, providing them confidence that flying is safe. Even those who won't travel today, have the potential to say they might travel tomorrow and we believe we must be earning their trust as well. Sangita Woerner's team has done a fantastic job implementing the program we call Next-Level Care, offering layers of safety through every single stage of travel and helping our guests build confidence for flying. Our safety measures include: making the preflight experience as contactless as possible and adding a health agreement during check-in; requiring masks for both guests and employees and empowering our crews to enforce the policy with the ability to issue a formal warning to any guest who refuses to do so; using the latest air filtration technology and hospital-grade filters to remove particulates and fully recycle air in the cabin every two to three minutes; exceeding CDC cleaning guidelines and using high-grade disinfectants to reduce the risk of transmissions on board; and keeping middle seats open through September 30 preserving our guests' ability to create personal distance while flying. In our Alaska Listens survey we've surveyed thousands of guests and what they care most about are consistent mask policies, the blocking of middle seats and clean airplanes. 80% of those surveyed also reported that our Next-Level Care measures are working and they feel strongly that we've created a healthy and safe environment for flying. Alaska is also a strong advocate for temperature screening and we are actively lobbying for screening to be implemented at airports by TSA. Collectively, we believe these actions we're taking will lay the groundwork for guests to confidently return to flying when they are ready. Shifting now to our longer-term plans. We are committed to doing whatever is necessary to improve our competitive position and set the stage for future growth. Our top financial priority remains improving our cash burn rate and progressing towards our goal to achieve cash breakeven by year-end. To put this in context, I'll share some of our planning assumptions. When we spoke with you last quarter, we knew very little about the crisis we are in today. The future is still largely uncertain and volatile, but the second quarter provided some key insights that help refine our thinking. Today we are planning for Q3 capacity to be down by approximately 50%, and Q4 will be down by approximately 35%. At these capacity levels, we are also making a planning assumption that cash bookings will recover to 40% to 60% of normal by December. This is not guidance, but demonstrates the parameters that we are operating within as we work to restructure our company. We believe these are reasonable planning assumptions for a few reasons. First, in June we saw that traveler confidence and psychological safety are strongly connected. As destinations moved to reopen and health concerns began to subside, leisure demand returned quickly. This tells us that the desire to travel is there just below the surface. Unlocking this potential requires ongoing societal progress and cooperation through behaviors like mask-wearing, better faster and more reliable testing methods and improved treatments like a vaccine. We believe this progress will be made even if slowly. Together these factors would support continued leisure recovery. Second, we're in the midst of the biggest demand contraction in the history of our industry. As we all know, there are far too many seats flying today for the demand that currently exists. Adding capacity back in a disciplined manner is important for the health of the industry and is critical to our company's cash breakeven goals. Planning for a business that will be 35% smaller in the fourth quarter has implications for our operation and for our people. We have been clear with our employees that no one has a crystal ball to the post-COVID environment, and we will adjust course on capacity if our assumptions don't materialize. Whatever demand and revenue scenario we face, maintaining the strong liquidity position we have built is paramount and our goal to achieve cash burn breakeven is a primary factor in the scenario plans we're putting together. Shane will share those details in a moment. The strong showing from teams across the organization in the second quarter gives me confidence that we are prepared to manage the change and challenges we're facing. I am so grateful for our dedicated and talented people and I know we will emerge from this crisis stronger than we came in. With that, I will pass it to Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks Ben and hi everyone. Last quarter we spoke to you about the factors we were focused on as we were beginning to manage Alaska through the initial shock of the COVID-19 crisis, including building our liquidity and aggressively managing our cost profile to preserve cash. Today, I'll provide an update on both areas, as well as share initial thoughts on restructuring Alaska for the future. On the liquidity front, we began 2020 with $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. Since March, we have added over $3 billion to that liquidity from a $400 million draw on existing credit lines, $425 million from a one-year loan in March, $163 million in new financing secured by aircraft, approximately $1 billion in payroll support via the CARES Act, and in July we added $1.2 billion of cash through a EETC transaction. Accumulating this level of liquidity in about 90 days' time is a superb achievement with credit due to our teams in treasury, finance and legal. The EETC is a new addition to our capital structure and the team was superb in telling Alaska's story, attracting new investors, and closing the $1.2 billion raise at reasonable rates. I would add that, while we moved quickly, we also had clear objectives we applied to guide our thinking about how to initially add liquidity during this crisis, which were: one, retaining strategic and financial flexibility; two, achieving a low cost of financing; three, maximizing cash yield from our collateral; and four, avoiding dilution of our equity base. Our current financing mix nicely balances these objectives and leaves room for us to take further action, if we need to. Today, we have $3.7 billion of cash on hand. We have $1.1 billion of unencumbered aircraft and non-aircraft collateral, and we also have our Mileage Plan assets available to use as collateral for future financing. In the immediate term, given the uncertainty going forward, we do intend to continue to evaluate and pursue smart ways to add liquidity. We are in ongoing discussions with the United States Treasury for participation in the CARES Act loan program, which could provide an additional $1.1 billion in financing, utilizing our Mileage Plan assets as collateral. In July, we signed a non-binding LOI with Treasury and anticipate final terms would be reached over the next eight weeks. In parallel for the ongoing discussions with Treasury, we are evaluating other avenues of collateralizing Mileage Plan, and other assets as well. In addition to raising capital, the most important goal we have is to aggressively manage our cash burn rate. As mentioned, we do believe we were successful this past quarter in managing cash burn down at the quickest rate in the industry. This progress is a testament to Alaska's low-cost culture and the commitment of employees throughout our organization. In fact, in the second quarter our adjusted operating expenses reduced by 47% on 75% less capacity. We typically view our cost as 40% variable in the near-term, so to achieve a 47% reduction is a good result. Regarding the cash burn rate, ours declined from over $400 million per month run rate exiting March to $120 million in June. As a reminder, we define cash burn as all operating cash receipts or cash that will turn into revenue, plus investment earnings offset by all cash expenditures including debt service and CapEx. We exclude financing raises or payroll support funding from this metric. The improvement between March and June was driven by improved bookings with stabilized cancellations, payroll savings of $45 million through the use of voluntary leaves, reducing management schedules, and flexing crews down to contractual minimums, variable cost removal on reduced capacity, and the immediate suspension of discretionary and reduction of overhead spend. July's cash burn, however, will be higher than June's driven by the slowing of forward ticket sales and the variable cost of incremental flying in the month. As Ben mentioned, our planning assumption today is for capacity to be down 35% in Q4, and we are planning for cash booking scenarios of down 40% to down 60%. I want to expand on what that will mean for our cash burn goals, our people and our cost structure. To achieve cash breakeven by year-end, while operating at levels 35% below 2019, we must reduce the size of our workforce. Today we have approximately 23,000 employees and we would likely need as many as 7,000 fewer active in the fourth quarter. Our goal is to mitigate to the greatest degree possible involuntary furloughs. As of today, over 30% of our employees are on voluntary leaves of absence and we will continue to offer that program for the remainder of the year. In July, we initiated early-out programs for all of our frontline workers and offered incentive leaves to pilots. While we will need to send out Warn notices on August 1st to potentially impacted employees, these mitigation efforts will reduce the number of involuntary furloughs that we expect to face in the future. Also, we have made the decision to reduce our management positions by 300 or 15% effective October 1. These are in addition to prior reductions of about 200 over the past couple of years. It goes without saying these decisions have regrettable and meaningful impacts on employees who invested their careers here. While extraordinarily difficult, these actions are necessary given the realities of our business going forward. Beyond these immediate decisions impacting our payroll, we are also finalizing our plans to repair our cost structure and to ensure our ability to reach cash breakeven even in a severely depressed revenue environment. It is our intent to ultimately return Alaska to pre-COVID CASMex levels even if we are a smaller company on a sustained basis. To begin that effort, we are targeting to achieve structural cost reductions that would hit a $250 million savings run rate exiting the year. We'll have more to say on future calls on specifics of our restructuring plan. As we turn to questions, I would close by saying that, while all of this is easy to read off of my script, the truth is these things are very hard to do because they impact people. We are truly drawing lessons from our past, where tough, but balanced decisions were made by those management teams, which then put Alaska on a course to achieve all it has the past 15 years. And that mindset hasn't changed. We have to run a good business in order to have the future we want for our people. And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hey, good morning. Maybe Shane or Ben, can you just talk about maybe some of the conversations you're having with your corporate customers? You talked about maybe the kind of the three bucket of your customers. And can you maybe speak to kind of the confidence you have at maybe the pace at which corporate returns and maybe how much does not return? And I know it's a difficult question, but maybe just kind of the framework you're using to approach that. Thank you.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks Joe. I'm going to let Andrew. Andrew's been doing some work on that, so Andrew can provide some color.\nAndrew Harrison: Joe, thanks for your question. Yes, we're obviously talking about corporate customers weekly. We're seeing what I believe the whole industry is seeing is that the corporate travel is massively down over 90%. A big part of what the corporate accounts are dealing with is this concept of duty of care. And so with the extension of closing of office spaces right now we're not really seeing any thawing in the business demand. And so as Shane has been discussing, we are just going to be structuring our business in a way for a more prolonged comeback of business. That said, we've always excelled on the leisure side and that we continue to expect to occur.\nJoseph DeNardi: And then Shane, just on the loyalty program, if you use it as collateral for the loan package from treasury, how much additional I guess financing capacity do you think exists against it? Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Yes. Thanks Joe. I appreciate the question. So as you know and I think this is one issue we are running into with the CARES loan program with Treasury. They're capped in how much that they can actually allow us to finance with that program. And we believe that they're capped at a rate that's well below the total value of Mileage Plan. And so, it was our intent to pursue getting additional financing out in the public markets. Recently, we've been presented with terms that would limit our ability to do that and that wasn't something we expected to be part of the terms with Treasury 45 days ago. So we are still processing that working with Treasury in making sure that they understand that we think our ability to get full value for Mileage Plan from multiple sources partly from them and partly from public markets is in fact in everybody's best interest. So we're working through that. I think what we showed last time, we kind of gave you guys the roadmap that suggests that the Mileage Plan value was a little over $5 billion. And you can sort of apply your best guess on LTVs or how much we could get from it. But the government is capped at $1.1 billion and we think we can raise much more on the $5 billion or more base of value that we have.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. It's helpful. Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Thanks Joe. \nOperator: Your next question is from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hi, good morning. Appreciate all the color on the cash burn and everything. I was kind of curious, so does this $250 million structural program, I realize it's a stretched goal but does that get you to cash breakeven today, if things do not improve the way you're thinking about it?\nShane Tackett: Thanks Savi. I would -- little bit they're totally connected. And I want to make sure that everybody is clear. It's really a run rate. It's an exit rate that would annualize at $250 million. So it's not necessarily structural reduction of $250 million between now and the end of the year. It's definitely going to be part of the formula that gets us to cash breakeven. I think even on the 40% to 60% revenue scenario we would have to do this to get there. But beyond that obviously cash breakeven is a waypoint on our way back to some level of profitability and paying back our debt and growing again. And there's no doubt in our mind that we will have to be very aggressive on restructuring the company to ultimately get back into a growth trajectory and to pay down this debt that we've taken on.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And then if I might follow up on the revenue answer and commentary. So I'm just trying to understand as you think through kind of the projection here. The September average is it kind of fair to assume that September doesn't do as well as August on a year-over-year revenue basis because it historically relies more on business passengers or are you kind of based on kind of the build you're seeing in leisure etcetera is that not a fair assumption?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Savi I'll -- and I don't know if Andrew wants to add color. I think it's a fair assumption that September would be worse than August based on what we're seeing today. I don't know that I would sort of say that those are the drivers. But as Andrew mentioned, we don't expect business travel to be back anytime soon certainly not by September. I think we would have hoped and expected that had the country not had to sort of go back into a shutdown mode that we would be seeing, incremental gains sequentially through the quarter. And that just doesn't look like it's going to happen right now and that's kind of what Brad and Ben, both touched on in the script.\nBrad Tilden: Yeah. Savi, it's Brad. I think there's normally -- maybe there is business seasonality which would help most Septembers. But, September is still, the weather is still good. Kids are going back to school. I really think what we're seeing is what all airlines are seeing is the news feed has just changed that the coronaviruses have spiked. Quarantines are moving from July 1st to August 1st to September 1st. They could go longer. Employers are announcing basically that they don't want their people traveling and that return-to-office schedules are being delayed. Schools in a lot of our geographies -- that's the driver. And we've seen it. We tried to say this in the prepared remarks. But, right, sometimes you see this up more clearly in retrospect, but we were on a really nice clip through the July 4th weekend, in terms of -- seems like every day there was 1,000 customers more than the previous day. But, as the narrative changed and as the headlines changed, I do think every airline has seen softness in bookings for future travel. And that's the thing that's making us nervous about August and September. While we're on it, I do want to say that we're committed to managing our schedule responsibly and we're committed to doing everything we can to get the cash burn of zero at or near the front of the pack of the industry. So we're not giving, these industry commentary, as an out or anything like that. We're going to manage what we can control as good as anybody out there I believe. But I just do think folks should know that the environment is -- and I think you know this already. The environment is quite a bit different than it was 30 days ago.\nSavi Syth: Make sense. Appreciate that. Thank you.\nBrad Tilden: Yeah.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Savi.\nOperator: Your next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Hey, good morning.\nBrad Tilden: Hi, Hunter.\nHunter Keay: So I think you're secure enough for me to ask you this question. Obviously COVID is an opportunity to make a lot of changes that can't be made when times are good. So, what are two or three things that you think Southwest Airlines does really well that you think you can mimic for yourselves?\nBen Minicucci: Well, Hunter, it's Ben. I think right off the bat. I think our company respects Southwest tremendously. They're a great company, and they're led by fantastic people. I think when you look at Southwest, I think, their success lies on a core of having a low-cost structure. And that is something, as you know we focused on our whole -- at least in my whole career here and Brad's whole career. So, a low cost matters in good times or in bad times. So I think if there's one thing that we both admired about Southwest and will continue to emulate is that a strong balance sheet. Shane said it, the less cash we burn, the less we need to pay off when we get out of this. So, we need to get through this crisis, get to cash breakeven, start paying on this debt and get back to our trajectory of growth, and then just having enough dry powder to take advantage of opportunities. And that's why we're seeing Southwest just fantastic growth and we have the same mindset. So, there are a lot of great things about them that we've admired and we\u2019ll continue to do so. Brad, I don't know if you want to answer.\nBrad Tilden: It's good.\nBen Minicucci: Yeah.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And then maybe you said this, I'm sorry Shane if not. You said it will take two years to restore the schedule of 2019 capacity. Does that mean that it should take about two years to get to that CASMex of 2019 or better too? Is that fair?\nShane Tackett: Hey, Hunter. Yeah. In the script that's what Brad mentioned that we -- while we don't have a crystal ball, we're looking out and thinking it's going to be a two-year process. I would say we would want to be left of that. And we're not in a position to give you specific dates at this time. But I think what I said in my script was our intent is to get to pre-COVID CASMex even if we're a smaller company on a sustained basis. And so we're working through that. We'll have more to talk about on the next call I'm sure on this topic. But no, I don't think that we're waiting to get back to pre-COVID capacity to reach our pre-COVID CASMex.\nHunter Keay: Okay Shane. Thanks a lot.\nShane Tackett: Thanks Hunter.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Good morning. Just -- first just a quick follow-up. My line was cutting in and out. You were discussing a cap at Treasury. Maybe I misunderstood, but what specific cap were you referring to?\nShane Tackett: Yes. Hi Jamie this is Shane. So, they are limited in how much they can loan to each of the airlines right? It's a $25 billion package and it's apportioned based off of capacity pre-COVID. And so they can only loan us up to $1.128 billion. And what we were saying is we think our Mileage Plan assets could fetch more than that in total. We don't want to be limited on how much we can go do with other parties.\nJamie Baker: All right. Okay. We're good then because I thought maybe you were referring to some arbitrary cap that they had put on what they can accept in total in terms of -- from the industry on loyalty as collateral. So, I apologize for that. Getting back to a pre-COVID ex fuel CASM level on a smaller footprint, do you believe you can get there without changes in wages and work rules?\nShane Tackett: It's a good question Jamie. I'm not going to totally speculate on that at this point. I will tell you that it will require us to reach pre-sort of peak levels of utilization and productivity which we've got to do. We were I think one of the best in the industry in terms of the productivity of all of our Air Group assets airport assets airplanes. Because of growth congestion integration dual fleet we've stepped off of those peaks recently and one way to get back to where we need to get back there is to reclaim those peaks. So, I totally appreciate the question. I get where you're coming from. I think it's a little premature to know exactly how we're going to go do this but we're going to be willing to talk about this stuff as we move forward.\nJamie Baker: Got it. And if I can sneak in a final one. I assume you're in possibly daily contact with officials in Hawaii. Do you care to hazard a guess as to whether the modified September 1st date holds and how forward bookings are looking beyond that date?\nAndrew Harrison: Hey Jamie its Andrew. We've obviously seen it extended a couple of times now. We're staying in close contact. I don't know where it's going to be, but I certainly think there's a high risk that that may slip again. But again we just monitor that and we take each day as it comes.\nJamie Baker: Fair enough. Thank you everybody.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks Jaime.\nOperator: Your next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for the time.\nShane Tackett: Hi Kate.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey guys. So, on the month of June cash burn improvement we saw through the quarter from your initial guide back at 1Q earnings. I know you gave some color on what drove that better performance. But can you just help us think about proportionately how that better performance was driven between cost and better demand? And then as a team it seems you have quite the history of finding incremental cost savings. So, any ongoing projects that drive cash burn down from that $200 million figure you've gotten July out there even excluding a better demand backdrop? Thanks.\nBrad Tilden: Kate, I might start and get Shane is going to talk about the cost side. But I think a big driver is our network and our low-fare proposition. If you actually look at our revenue line, we were down -- our revenues were down 82% which I said in my script. That's a bad result for any business for any industry, but it might be the best in the industry or very close to the best in the industry. So I think the combination of our route network, where we fly? How we fly? Our fare structures, our loyalty that was something that served us well in the second quarter. It's something that's going to serve us really, really well in the future. I do think Shane, the cost side of it is a -- Ben you're talking about that's a muscle that Alaska has historically had and relied upon and that's something we're going to be at the gym making that muscle work even better for us. Maybe you can talk about that side of things.\nShane Tackett: Yes. Kate, it's a great question. I would go back to it was really important that we got all of the variable cost out that we thought we should and we did. And I talked about this last quarter a one-to-one relationship on the variable costs which is good to prove. We always think we know what the variable costs are but we were able to prove that out. There were a lot of things that we did in the immediate term that were probably more temporary and that's why we're starting to shift the conversation to structural cost reductions. A lot of the stuff in this quarter was just suspension of all discretionary spending really aggressive offering of voluntary leaves which as I said in the script 30% of our folks took which was a huge help on the payroll line. There wasn't a lot of structural stuff that we had done in the quarter though. And that's what we've got to go start to work on. The first thing that we've done is reduce the management team size which I mentioned in the script as well. And we're working on that list of ideas that we've got to go execute on to get the rest of this goal that we've got out in front of us.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Great. Maybe one, I don't know how this would factor into your thought process on driving those structural costs out. But any updates for us on the fleet decision to remain a two-aircraft-type carrier go back to single fleet? And then how should we be thinking about lease return expenses for the rest of this year and next? Obviously not as big of a factor as it was pre-COVID, but still one to think about? Thanks.\nNat Pieper: Catie, it's Nat Pieper. I think no question the fleet is a healthy proportion of the structural savings that Shane is talking about. And academically you kind of can think of it this way, if you're going to keep a mixed fleet going forward you better leverage that to get advantages in ownership cost, better lease pricing and using competition and also on the revenue side having different airplanes to match the different markets. The counter to it is on a single fleet you better get operating efficiencies. And so, as part of the structural savings, we've got to figure that out. And as we start to narrow down the Airbus aircraft that we have we parked all 10 of our A319 last quarter and two of our A320s. We've got 39 leased Airbus A320s left that have expirations over the next three to five years. And we're starting to creatively look at ways to phase some of those airplanes out. So, a lot of leverage in that question and a big piece of achieving the structural savings goal we want to.\nCatherine O'Brien: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, Operator. Hi, gentlemen and Emily, thank you for your time. \nEmily Halverson: Hi, Helane.\nHelane Becker: So can you guys codeshare with JetBlue through the American codeshare or just on your own?\nAndrew Harrison: Helane it's Andrew here. Number one, I think, we don't have a relationship with obviously JetBlue. And number two, we're not in a position to go into the Privity of contract details with our West Coast international alliance. I will say that, we are very excited and very committed in discussions. And you've seen the recent oneworld invitation. But both American and Alaska, I think are really well positioned to grow our presence and strength off the West Coast both on the corporate side, the leisure side. And we've spent a lot of months putting together a very compelling alliance on the West Coast and we're very excited to start to get that into motion.\nBrad Tilden: Yeah. International isn't top of mind for people today understandably, but competitively being able to go into the marketplace, when corporate travel is back and have a robust solution that covers an extraordinary domestic network, but also international is important. So we're going to push this thing hard, so that when we have international travel again, which we will, we're really well positioned. We're super excited. American has announced service from Seattle to Bangalore, and Shanghai and London. And the oneworld offering out of Seattle and other West Coast cities is just going to be really, really strong. So we're excited about this, and we're going to push it hard.\nHelane Becker: Yeah. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then for my follow-up question is, as you think about coming out of whatever we're in now this COVID this dreadful situation and you think about winning the recovery as a smaller airline, do you think about -- I mean is it -- does this really give you a chance to pull out of markets that maybe didn't make sense before but that you were sort of flying because you'd either always flown them or because Virgin America had been in that market and they had kind of always flown them? Like does this give you a chance to be more thoughtful about where and when you fly?\nBrad Tilden: Helane, I think the answer is yes. And Ben and Andrew may have something they want to say to this as well. But I think, if you actually look at it, a lot of those changes have been made. It does give us a chance to sort of to re-rack the route network. And as you've seen, we're taking cities through the -- the way I sort of think about it Anchorage, we say anything that we can fly out of Anchorage we do fly. You see us do that. Seattle, we've done a lot to fortify our position. Portland, I think there is opportunities for us to solidify and grow. We've got strongholds in the northwest in cities like Spokane and Boise, and Redmond Oregon and Missoula and Bozeman. And there is opportunities to connect those northwest cities, which have a ton of mileage by members to cities like San Jose, San Francisco, LAX and San Diego. So we're doing some of that. Andrew you've done some stuff very recently out of LAX, which -- I think the answer is yes. There is a chance to sort of reconfigure and build the network around what we do best. In terms of holding your breath for additional things, I don't know that, I would. I think a lot of those -- a lot of those moves have been made. But Andrew maybe you disagree with that. I don't know what you'd say.\nAndrew Harrison: No. I think Brad's spot on. And I think if you look at our pull downs in our network in general and even in California, we are still in the majority in the utility of the California network just at a significantly reduced frequency. And as Brad mentioned, really some of the L.A. moves is really just a general reshaping of our network. But I will agree with one thing in respect of all of this is that there is a rebaselining of the nation's networks. And you are seeing all carriers having to make deliberate choices about where they're going to serve and where they're going to make adjustments. And I think that's going to play out over time and we'll make sure that we are focusing on that as we move forward.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s really helpful, Brad and Andrew. Thank you very much for your help there.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Helane.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Your next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Just a philosophical question may be given that a lot of the questions were asked about leverage limits at the board level. There are so many interesting questions right now about collateral and all the things you could potentially lever up your Mileage Plan, your brand, office furniture, paper clips all of the things you could potentially lever up. Why are there limits? Does it make sense to borrow against every last scrap of collateral that you have right now? And if not why not based on the history of the organization?\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Duane. I think that it's -- what's imperative for us is to weather whatever shape the downturn and sort of choppiness of recovery is. I think even with all of the raisings we've done we're still sub-60% debt-to-cap. And if we continue to go out and get $1 billion to $2 billion of additional liquidity, we'd be under 70% or 75% debt-to-cap. So we still have the balance sheet room to where -- I think the question is totally valid, but a little premature because I don't think we're running up against kind of the limit of using what sort of, non-traditional assets like brand and sort of, other things like that to go and further solidify our liquidity. But I'll tell you our view is we are going to go raise the amount of cash we need to weather this and we'll manage the cost side super aggressively. Once we get to cash breakeven it's academic, we can sit there for as long as we need to. So we're talking about both, but they're both paramount in our mind. There's not I think a limit right now in front of us where we're saying it's too much and we're going to stop. Once we get there though we obviously will come back and share that with you guys.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Certainly not a criticism of where you are now. But I guess drawing on the long-term history of the company what's the downside\u2026\nShane Tackett: The balance obviously and we've talked about this a lot internally very, very openly with our employees is anything you borrow and you actually use to finance losses, you got to pay back. And you got to pay that back through cash flows in the future and that steals from your ability to grow. And we don't want to steal from our ability to grow. So we have a mindset about how much total net debt we're hoping we come out of this with at the end of the day and that it's at a rate that allows us to aggressively pay it back while still growing the company out in 2022 and beyond.\nBrad Tilden: Shane, so we want to borrow, we just don't want to use the money. So like one mental model we have is have the finance team, hard at work borrowing, I don't know if it's as much as we can, but borrowing really shoring up our liquidity. And then hopefully things get better and we start paying that money off. That's kind of the mental model that I see for the finance team. It's do everything we have to do to ensure our sort of, staying power. But then at some point we'll have a vaccine things will be better. And as soon as we get there we start reducing those debt balances.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Appreciate the thoughts.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Duane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Duane.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just two here. You know, Brad your initial comment and you followed up with about -- the testament your cash burn being where it is probably best among the industry appropriately sized. You mentioned it being a testament to your route structure and low fares. And then Andrew I know on Helane's question you sort of touched on some of the changes you're making to the network. But when we sort of look at the changes that you have made and have announced, you've probably made more changes to your network really in the last three to six months than I would say the competition.  And I'm just curious how much of it was a function of responding to COVID-19 and maybe moving aircraft out of business markets and putting them more into leisure-oriented markets or how much of this was maybe a function of the American agreement back in February where you want to reposition airplanes so that maybe you have better connectivity across both networks or maybe it's a little bit of both. I'm just curious about sort of the thinking and what's driving the change to the network.\nAndrew Harrison: Hey, Mike, I mean, just at the highest-level summary, I think the most significant changes I think you're referring to are really boiled down into serving secondary Pacific Northwest markets from California. I mean, if you look at the vast majority of the changes in numbers at the high level that's what they would be. And I think these are markets where we are strong. We've got good regional aircraft right now to do this makes sense for us, and that was sort of part of our strategy shift. And as we got into this, it still made sense to do those. I think some of the other changes you've seen are just retweaking and looking at for instance L.A. and making sure that we're positioned on the leisure side which we're solid at. So I think overall, but I think at the end of the day if you look at the network, it's essentially utility-wise the same except that frequencies are significantly down right now in these massively depressed transcon market in California. And we've pretty much maintained everything in Seattle from a destination perspective.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe to Ben on the airport side. We've heard airlines as an industry talk about ways to improve peace of mind with customers finding ways to get them to want to travel again. And the concept of temperature screening by the TSA, it's been kicked around for some time now. It feels like several months. And yet I'm not sure if it's gone anywhere. What are some of the gating issues in trying to move that along?\nBrad Tilden: This is on temperature screening. Diana, you've done some work there. Yes.\nDiana Rakow: Yes. So we are strongly advocating for the TSA to take up temperature screening. We're doing a proof of concept with the Port of Seattle here in the Sea-Tac Airport. Honestly, I think there's some just varied science on whether or not it actually does sufficiently screen people, whether there's enough people that are caught with temperatures high enough to actually screen them out. And so there's ongoing debate about whether or not it's worth putting it in place across airports. But we are continuing to ask for it. It's another layer of safety in addition to all of our steps in Next-Level Care. And it could increase guest confidence.\nBrad Tilden: Like we have them here in the building honestly everywhere we go in. I'll tell you, it's slick technology. I don't know if you have it. You just put your face and literally two seconds it takes your temperature. And we're just saying look, it's just another level of confidence for customers that come in to say, look, your temperature is normal. It's just another step in making sure that people are getting on board airplanes that are safe. So we're going to continue advocating for it. Likely not go as fast as we would like, but we're going to continue pushing on it, because I think it's just part of the confidence of society and people flying.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nBrad Tilden: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess Brad at a high level, should investors expect that you guys not only want to manage to like a cash breakeven level or backing up before full recovery or should we even expect that like if this drags on longer that you guys could move towards earnings? And is that I guess from the outside looking in is that even a prudent decision because if you expect demand to come back maybe you don't want to cut costs that far. Can you just help us out on that?\nBrad Tilden: Yes. You broke up a tiny bit there Brandon. So can you just summarize the -- your cell phone or something broke up a little bit.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yes. Sorry about that. I guess, I was just asking whether it's prudent for you guys to be managing towards positive earnings in this environment or is that not the right mindset.\nBrad Tilden: No. I think it's the right mindset. I think there is a balance that any business would look at in terms of staying power and liquidity and sort of doing everything you need to do from a cash flow P&L fundraising perspective to be in total control of your future, while seizing strategic opportunity on the other hand. And I do think if you guys have followed Alaska for 10, 20, 30 years through these different crises you've seen us be very contrarian. You've seen us make some of our boldest bets when things are down. So I think it's a good question. I think for now though demand is really, really down for all airlines. And so, we believe the right move for Alaska at this juncture is to get our schedule right, given the demand that we have and to continue to do the things that we're doing on the liquidity side. On the cost structure side, I think we want to do the things that make us better and stronger coming out of this. I don't know -- what I'm trying to say is, if we do see opportunities we want to have the balance sheet and the mentality and the will to take advantage of those opportunities. Right now what we see is an imperative to sort of get resized given the extraordinarily weak demand that all airlines including Alaska are seeing.\nBen Minicucci: Brandon I'll add on that. I think when you look at our Q4 capacity down 35%; I think we're in a good place. I don't think that's overly aggressive, overly conservative. It allows us to flex up or down and allows us to manage costs and also take advantage of an uptick in demand. So I think we're threading the needle pretty well on that.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you. Sorry about the cell phone\nBen Minicucci: No worries.\nOperator: Your next question is from Darryl Genovesi with Vertical Research.\nDarryl Genovesi: Hi guys. Thanks for time. Andrew or if Nat's on the line, I think at the time you closed the Virgin America deal you had to scale back the American Airlines relationship. Would you just remind us what you're not allowed to do with American and whether you're waiting on any regulatory approvals to reramp that relationship or the relationship with the oneworld carriers more broadly?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Darryl I think there was a couple of components about 50-plus markets in all. But essentially, we weren't allowed to cooperate on all the Virgin America overlap markets which were essentially California. And then secondly at a high level on our hubs, so Seattle, Portland, San Francisco etcetera we were not allowed to put our code on American's flight out of our hubs and vice versa. So the best way to think about it is that, the historical Virgin America network was sort of off limits. And then secondarily really getting connections beyond American's network and beyond our network was still fine. So we continue to operate within those parameters obviously and look at what options on what we may need to do going forward. But I will say as it stands today, we still given those have a lot of opportunity to work with American.\nKyle Levine: And Darryl, this is Kyle. On your second question, we're totally clear of regulatory requirements. We cleared those hurdles I think in early May or so.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay. And then Shane offered up this $250 million target on the structural cost takeout. I mean is there -- even if you're not ready to disclose the number yet, I mean is there something similarly substantial on the top line as it relates to the oneworld membership?\nShane Tackett: Oh, yes. So Darryl, yes, we haven't really put any sort of information out in terms of what the value of that might be. I don't think we're going to do that this morning either. But suffice it to say, Brad I think and Andrew both did a really good summary. The opening up of the globe through our major West Coast hubs and focus cities is going to create a lot of value for customers that we think we're excited about.\nAndrew Harrison: And the other thing I would just add is it puts us on an international platform as it relates to our loyalty members. And something that we've always been missing in the Pacific Northwest is a good seamless global connectivity story with elite reciprocity across the globe and this is going to bring us that.\nDarryl Genovesi: Perfect. Thanks a lot guys.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Darryl.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Myles Walton with UBS.\nMyles Walton: Hey, good morning. Just a couple of cleanup questions if I could. The first on cost reduction in the third quarter, 47% in the second quarter. What's the bogey that you're putting there for the third quarter?\nShane Tackett: Yes. I don't think -- we didn't guide to that Myles and so we won't give you a specific number. I think incremental capacity will add some costs. And as mentioned, there are a lot of things that we just sort of took down. 70%, 80%, 90% maintenance spend was an example of that. You can't do that forever. We've got to start bringing aircraft out of storage and we will have to start maintaining those. So there are some things that we'll layer back on on the cost side and that's why it's important that ultimately we see a better sort of backdrop on the national sort of public health front so we can get some of this demand back going again and sort of regain the trends we saw in late June, early July. But I would expect the cost removal to be a little less in next quarter versus this but we haven't guided to anything specific.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And then one other cleanup. On the yield in the second quarter obviously, up 30% year-on-year. Can you just give any nuance to what was going on there? And I guess the outlook for the rest of the year looks more normalizing to prior trends?\nChris Berry: Myles, this is Chris Berry. The yields for the second quarter were a bit odd, simply because we still have some residual stuff from the Mileage Plan program on flown miles that really related to the Virgin America acquisition years ago. So that sort of stayed about level and that's why you see the yields pop in Q2. If you look at the real like raw passenger yields, they really were not up nearly that much. Raw passenger yields were up probably about 9% for the quarter. So you'll see that fall off as we move into third and fourth quarter and it will be more relative to year-over-year it will look a little bit more real realistic.\nMyles Walton: Thank you, guys.\nBrad Tilden: Okay. I think that's our final question. Thanks everybody for tuning in. We look forward to chatting with you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

My name is Chris, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded, and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director, Investor Relations, Emily Halverson.\nEmily Halverson: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings call. This morning Alaska Air Group reported first quarter GAAP net loss of $232 million. Excluding onetime cost and mark-to-market adjustments, Air Group reported an adjusted net loss of $102 million. Onetime costs incurred this quarter include approximately $160 million of asset impairment charges that were triggered as a result of the significant decline in demand for air travel and market conditions. These impairments included approximately $145 million of aircraft and aircraft related parts, as well as approximately $15 million of financial and intangible assets. On today's call Brad, Ben and Shane will be discussing the impact of COVID-19 on our business, and sharing details about our response to the economic and health crises. Several other members of our management team are also on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business, which were updated today, can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit cost excluding fuel. And as usual, we've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release. And now I'll turn the call over to Brad for his opening remarks.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks Emily and good morning, everybody. Thanks to all of you for joining us for our first quarter call. This call comes at an unprecedented time for our industry. Many people have lost loved ones or at distance from their family and friends, and others have lost confidence in the future because of concerns about the economy or their own financial situation. People are justifiably fearful about the future. In the face of one of the greatest challenges in the history of aviation, our people at Alaska and Horizon are doing extraordinary work to respond to these circumstances. Our pilots, flight attendants, customer service agents, ramp service agents, mechanics and others, continue to come to work and be their best in an extremely difficult environment. They're caring for our guests with kindness, while delivering safe and remarkable service to those who are traveling. All of us on the leadership team are grateful for their dedication. I also want to thank the very dedicated leaders at Alaska and Horizon, including folks around this table who are wholly focused on responding to these crisis in preparing Alaska to sustain itself and grow stronger in a highly uncertain future. Their commitment and their love for what they do and for this company give us all confidence that Alaska is going to come through this crisis stronger and better. We would typically use our earnings call to discuss our performance for the quarter, to provide an update on our strategic efforts and to share guidance for the remainder of the year. But that does not make sense today. Instead, we'll be sharing with you what we know at this juncture, how we're thinking about future scenarios given the macro uncertainty and how we plan to bridge what is essentially an economic closure across our country to a future where Alaska is stronger and better and fully prosperous. As Emily mentioned, we incurred an adjusted pretax loss of $102 million for the quarter. This was the result of 14% decline in passenger revenue, driven by the near complete loss in demand that we began to see in early March. This is our first quarterly loss in over a decade and it is sobering to report. There is no doubt that our second quarter loss will be much higher, and there's a very high uncertainty about the third and fourth quarters. Safety has always been our top priority and this crisis has caused us to review and approve our procedure. We've implemented several changes, including expanding and enhancing the cleaning of our aircraft, including the use of high grade registered disinfectants and electrostatic sanitizing spray. We're requiring our flight attendants and CSAs to use masks. We're limiting load factors and seat availability. We've modified boarding procedures to encourage self-scanning of boarding passes and to encourage slower boarding to prevent crowding. And we suspended or reduced most in-flight services. Additionally, beginning next week masks will be mandatory for our guests. These changes can be difficult at first for both guests and crews, but our teams have handled them with professionalism. We anticipate further changes to our policies and procedures in the future, and we will continue to be industry leaders with health and safety standards. As we think about our industry at air travel more broadly, we're highly confident that people in the future will want to physically connect with one another and see other places. We're also very confident that they will value an airline that offers them safety, low fares and the type of personal hospitality you would see from a family member. As you know, we have taken and are continuing to take aggressive action to preserve our financial position. Shane will detail all of this. But we've acted swiftly to build on our already strong fortress balance sheet and have made some very difficult decisions to manage our cash burn rate. We've gone from a monthly burn rate of $400 million one month ago to approximately $260 million today, and our commitment is to get to $200 million by June and the breakeven by year-end. Just two weeks ago, we received $992 million in payroll support from the federal government. The program was the result of decisive bipartisan actions on the part of our federal leaders, and we very much appreciate their efforts to provide direct support to airline employees. The passage of this bill demonstrates one of the bright spots that exists during this crisis. The opportunity for all sides to come together and work toward a common good. We are thankful for the efforts of the president and his administration, Congress, Secretaries Mnuchin and Chao and all and many others for their efforts in providing this vital support to help our industry and our economy weather this downturn. While our full attention is focused on the situation at hand, we've always operated with our eyes on the Horizon and that focus continues today. We have been historically and are today financially conservative. We're proud to be the only pre-deregulation to not have filed for bankruptcy. Throughout history, our people have worked our way through challenge after challenge, and we've gained new skills and capabilities as we've gone along and we've come away from these challenges better and stronger. We have every belief that will be the case this time, and we are fully focused on this outcome. With that, I'll pass it to Ben.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Brad and good morning, everyone. I want to begin by sharing a few of the facts we know. Our home base Seattle was among the first places in the country to be hit by the pandemic. In Washington, [Technical Difficulty] gatherings and close [Technical Difficulty]. These communities and their leaders have shown great courage in handling the situation. While necessary these actions had a significant negative impact on our business. With many of our largest hubs in these two states, we began to see signs of demand deterioration in late February. On March 11th, we saw cancellations overwhelmed gross new bookings for the first time ever. We have since experienced 56 days of net negative bookings. The largest wave of cancellation appears to be behind us. However, daily cancellations do continue to modestly exceed gross new bookings. We are attentive to gradual improvements in our daily passenger count, which remain 90% below normal levels for us showing very modest week over week improvement. In March, we reduced our capacity 12% versus prior year, primarily through closing cancellations and consolidating frequencies. Soon after we cut April and May capacity by 80% and expect to cut June flying similarly as well. The top near-term challenge we face is to reduce our current cash burn rate of $260 million to $200 million per month by June, and to achieve our commitment for cash breakeven by year-end. To do this, we will lean heavily into our competitive advantages. Because it is impossible to forecast the shape of the recovery with any certainty, we are planning potential courses of action from multiple recovery scenarios. There are several factors about our business model and our competitive advantage that I believe will benefit us in any recovery scenario. First, we have built our business to have structurally lower cost than our competitors. Alaska has a history of managing our low overhead, high productivity operation and this remains a guiding principle going forward. Our CASM ex-fuel is 20% lower than legacy airlines, which enables us to compete more effectively with low fares. More than ever, we see a future where low fares and low-cost matter and we have resolved to strengthen our cost advantage as much as possible. As Brad mentioned, we've received payroll support program funds from the federal government. These funds cover approximately 70% of our original budgeted payroll through September 30th and allowed us to keep employees on the payroll, while the airline is operating at significantly reduced capacity. This relief affords us more time to be thoughtful about restructuring decisions and how we will shed costs. It also presents opportunities to redeploy management employees and crew whose work has slowed to utilize their time with purpose where possible. For example, many management employees have been redeployed to other divisions or to clean aircraft. And on the crew side, we're taking advantage of this shortfall in demand to retrain Airbus pilots is Boeing pilots to avoid both opportunity costs and economic costs. Shane's going to share more detail on our cost saving opportunities that we're planning for. Second, we have strong hubs with some of the best customer loyalty in the industry. Even with passenger count significantly down, the loyalty of our guests shines through. We welcome words of appreciation in person and over social media from travelers who have the need to travel, including medical personnel, loved ones going to meet and care for family members and employees or business owners whose work requires them to travel for essential reasons. In fact, our guest facing communications and positive sentiment across social media was recognized last week by the Airline Passenger Experience Association as the best in the U.S. airline industry. And third, our network orientation in our fleet are well suited for the recovery ahead. It is likely that recovery will first bias towards domestic travel, our limited international exposure and our fleet of narrow body aircraft will be assets in this scenario. As you know, we began a full fleet analysis last year. These crisis have made it imperative that we take a fresh look at our long term plans to ensure we select the best, most efficient aircraft for our future state. This will be another important aspect of our cost restructuring. Finally, our employees are aligning their commitment for the challenge ahead. Alaska has experienced being an underdog and we are battle tested. Today, we face new challenges and the gravity of those challenges is understood by our people. Each day of this crisis, I'm struck by the dedication I see throughout the organization, our crews that work together with leadership and experts in all of our guests facing health and safety policies. Our call center employees have supported thousands of guests with challenging transactions and issues. Our finance, legal communications and government affairs teams have rallied from many long work weeks as we navigate changing business conditions. Thousands of employees across the company show their support through letter writing to the U.S. Treasury to help obtain industry support. While the prospect of a smaller industry and a potentially smaller company that's something we would have wanted, we are realistic about the challenges ahead. We have more fight in us and we will do what it takes to make Alaska emerge stronger. As always, we're focused intently on controlling what we can control. Outside of our control but also important is understanding what will influence demand recovery trend. To name a few factors, travel restrictions and stay at home orders that are likely to be lifted at different times, unemployment and broader economic trends and evolving public sentiment about whether to travel for what reasons will all be considerations. Our role is to have robust plans for any scenario we may encounter to communicate honestly with our people about those plans and to execute against them to the best of our ability. We commit to doing that over the next several months as things become clearer and to emerge from this crisis as stronger and better company. That means getting to zero cash burn by December and setting up the conditions to control our destiny. And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Ben, and good morning to everyone joining us. My comments will focus on why we are confident Alaska will bridge this period of no demand, and continue forward as one of the industry's strongest performers. Appropriate place to start that discussion is cash on hand and our remaining capacity to create additional liquidity should we need it. We began 2020 with $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, to which we added $400 million from existing lines of credit, $425 million from 364-day term loan. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, we added an additional $50 million in secured financing. In April, we received $992 million for payroll support via the CARES Act. Together that totals $3.35 billion. Today, we have approximately $2.9 billion of cash and marketable securities on hand, meaning we burned about $467 million of cash from the beginning of the year. Our cash burn rate is a critical figure that we're managing aggressively, and today it is about $260 million per month. With demand at essentially zero, our $2.9 billion at this rate of burn would sustain us for 11.2 months. However, we intend to increase how long our cash will last. Our commitment, as Brad and Ben have both previously indicated and I will reiterate now, is to achieve $200 million cash burn by June and to reach cash breakeven by the end of the year. We know this will require significant work and hard decisions on cost removal and restructuring. While we are very focused on managing our cash burn, we also have multiple channels we can tap to add further liquidity to our current $2.9 billion, including more than $2 billion of high-quality unencumbered aircraft. Banks and investors we've spoken to have indicated interest in lending against these assets with reasonable terms. We have an additional $500 million of real estate and spot assets that we can borrow again. We have a very valuable loyalty program that can be tapped for liquidity. We have available to us as much as $1.128 billion in CARES Act alone. And although in the category of having no current plans to tap, we believe our equity would be a very high interest to investors as well. This $7 billion to $8 billion of collateral and $1.1 billion of CARES Act loans, we believe represents well in excess of $4 billion of incremental liquidity potential. Taken together, our on hand liquidity, our access to additional financing and our aggressive goals to reach cash breakeven results by the end of the year, will ensure that we bridge this downturn and are prepared to rebuild our success during a recovery. The increased debt load that will result as we navigate this crisis is obviously not our ideal long-term setup, but we are first and foremost focused on ensuring the survival of Alaska when the industry stabilizes, we will return our focus to repairing the balance sheet just as we did post Virgin acquisition. To discuss cash reduction and preservation efforts, I would share the following. We have right sized our schedule commensurate with demand and have seen a very strong linear reduction in non-wage variable costs. We have reduced discretionary and overhead spend by nearly $50 million per month. We have deferred nearly $600 million of capital expenditures for 2020, bringing our plan CapEx to under $175 million, which includes no additional aircraft capital spending. We have suspended share repurchases and dividends, and we have reduced executive pay, reduced management hours by 10% and have over 5,000 employees who have opted to take unpaid leaves for at least the next 60 days. And we have also implemented extended payment terms and thought and in many cases achieved payment relief from suppliers. I'd like to elaborate on a couple of these items. First, as mentioned, we've dramatically cut capacity in Q2 and anticipate operating a reduced schedule for the balance of the year. As a rule of thumb, I view our non-wage variable costs to represent 50% of our cost structure. Most of our operational contracts do not have minimums and so scale almost perfectly. Although, I acknowledge under the current climate this has been extraordinarily difficult on our suppliers, wage costs are our largest cost tool and tend to be less variable. Our frontline workgroups all have minimums within their contract that ensure they receive a certain amount of pay. We have adjusted down to those minimums, which reduces payroll by about 10%. And in partnership with our union leaders, we have also entered into other agreements that allow and incentivize employees to take leaves, which as mentioned represent over 5,000 people currently. With these efforts, I expect payroll costs will be down 30% from plan for at least the next 60 days. And we expect our CARES Act payroll support funds to cover the vast majority of our payroll through September. To-date, none of these changes are structural and there remain significant work to be done to achieve any longer term changes to wage costs. Turning to aircraft. Given the temporary grounding of a significant portion of our fleet and our initial assumptions about demand over the next several quarters, we have determined that at least 12 mainline aircraft would be permanently parked, including 10 A390s that were among the smallest and least efficient aircraft we have, and two leased A320s that had not yet been reconfigured to our new interior. The rest of the parked aircraft are being stored and maintained so they can reenter service. And we will make decisions about when and how many of them do return to service in the future. So we are working all of the costs levers hard to drive towards our commitment of zero cash burn by the end of the year. And to clarify, our cash burn rate does include the impact of refunds and cancellations and excludes the impact of CARES Act, payroll support funding and additional financing. It does factor in all of the self-help I've just described. Reaching our goal of $200 million cash burn by June and cash breakeven by the end of the year will require more work on our cost structure. But I believe we will get there. Our people attack tough goals like this with intensity and commitment. And I believe that all 23,000 of our people understand that if we can achieve a breakeven cash burn rate, our destiny is back squarely in our control, which means we are also in control of building towards a better future again. And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Just on the kind of getting to cash burn zero, or breakeven by the end of the year. I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on that and is that -- how much of that do you expect to come from the revenue side? And then on depending, I'm guessing on the kind of demand recovery. What kind of decisions and how quickly could you scale to that?\nShane Tackett: The way I want to talk about the cash breakeven is it's an objective that we have to get to. So we look at the recoveries having to cross through zero. We've got to get there. We've put a marker out in front of us eight months from today. We actually don't know the exact path to get there. We don't know exactly what revenue is going to be. But what we're thinking is regardless of the revenue environment, we've got to make the decisions necessary to take the actions to get to cash breakeven. Obviously, we'll talk to you all a lot more as we get through some of that decision making process, and have better clarity about what Q4 looks like. But we're not relying on any particular revenue outcome to get there. On the scale question, I just want to make sure I understand. Are you thinking about if demand is better than we're thinking, or I just want to make sure I understand\u2026\nSavi Syth: And then clearly, you know unless you have a V-shape recovery, you have a lot of kind of difficult decisions in front of you. And just how quickly could you scale the operation to kind of a new demand level. Is there kind of a reality on like how quickly you can scale that? Just I'm guessing some of the biggest fixed costs so how do you get it to a new level of demand if we don't see a V-shape recovery.\nShane Tackett: If you're talking about like sort of scaling down. I mean, I think we don't know exactly how long that's going to take. I think there's a part of our business, like I mentioned, 50% of which is variable, it just moves with the operation. We've been really happy to see those costs almost perfectly linear with capacity. The other 50% is payroll and a lot of just overhead and fixed costs. The overhead and fixed costs that we can make decisions on those are tough, but we can act on that quickly. I think it's really when you talk about the size of the company and how many people we have that's something that takes more time. That's something that we've got to go talk with our labor leaders about and sort of work through over the next several months. But the most important thing is we've got to know what size of the company we're aiming for and we just don't know that as we sit here today.\nSavi Syth: And if I may just ask a clarifying question on the cost. Really helpful to have the kind of cash burn side, but on the kind of the P&L standpoint. What would you expect costs to be in Q2 generally?\nShane Tackett: Yes, unit costs I don't think are providing any guidance to I think\u2026\nSavi Syth: Just overall\u2026\nShane Tackett: I think Savi the 50% that\u2019s variable linear, I think you can calculate very, very closely just given our capacity. And then we're not really quantifying the other side of the business or revenue at this point. If we do we'll be clear about that in the 8-K or something to make sure you guys know that.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg: Just I guess two here. On the payroll Support Program, the 992. I believe you called out that you could potentially get something from McGee. I know that\u2019s small but every dollar matters. And the 992 that you got, it seemed like you got it in one installment. I know other carriers are getting it in two or maybe more installments. I'm curious why you were able to get all of it. And then I have a second question. Thanks.\nShane Tackett: The Treasury gave us the option of taking it in a couple of installments or all at once. We looked at it closely. We didn't think there was a real difference. There's no -- it's not a different amount of money. There's no difference in terms. And so we decided to take it all at once. I think a couple other carriers may have and some have taken it in installments. But it was just a choice given to us so we took it all at once. And McGee, is in process. I believe on the payroll support grants, there were well over 200-250 applications. The focus was sort of the largest carriers to begin with. They're in that process. I think we expect to hear back from treasury sometime this week. I think their sort of qualified amount was around $40 million. That would be if they got 100% of what they applied for. Nobody is getting 100%. So it's hard to know exactly what they'll get. But they are in line to still receive funding from the payroll support portion of the grant.\nMichael Linenberg: And then just my second, just reading between the lines, training Airbus pilots to fly Boeing jets and putting Airbus planes on the ground. I guess it's probably safe to assume that the fleet decision is being made in real time. I guess the one issue is the A321 NEOs. Did you have any additional on order that were expected to come in, or have you taken all the newer Airbuses? Just thoughts on that and maybe any additional color you can talk about the fleet decision? Because again, it looks like it's being made in real time. Thank you.\nShane Tackett: I might start and go to Ben. Those are good three questions in one question. But no more A321s on order. We've taken the 10 and so that's the answer that. I would -- and Ben talk more about our thinking about fleet and sort of what we're doing. And I just want to connect a couple of things. We are training 240 pilots off of the Airbus onto the Boeing. That is really a byproduct of the fact that we determined these 12 aircraft aren't going to fly again. And if we do decide to backfill that capacity at some point, we expect that capacity would be backfilled by Boeing that we have on order today. And so just it was prudent to do that. We've got very limited flying. We have a full payroll. We have pilots that we have the opportunity to get into the training schoolhouse without costing us growth. So there's no opportunity cost. And it's not totally free but it's close to free training at this point. So it just made a lot of sense to marry those two decisions up to part those 12 aircraft and train pilots over. But Ben may have more to say on future fleet.\nBen Minicucci: As you can imagine, we're doing a lot of modeling with different fleet structures. And just to give you a sense of what's guiding us and we have the zero cash burn rate goal that we're aiming for and also we're going to restructure the company to low cost. A dual fleet does have higher cost for us, so that is a factor which we consider. The Airbus 321 is a great airplane, we like it a lot. We wanted to bring all these factors together. We're going to look forward to the future. We\u2019re going to look how we're going to reconfigure this company for the best success. So a lot of things are in play. And as the months play out, we'll get more clear on what our direction is.\nOperator: The next question is from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Shane, just on the cash burn. I'm assuming that the $200 million by June assumes kind of a similar revenue environment to what you're seeing now. What can you get that to by the end of the year if this revenue environment continues just so we can kind of think about things apples to apples?\nShane Tackett: It does essentially assume demand is similar to what we're seeing right now. I'm not going to hypothesize about exactly where we would be if there was literally zero demand at the end of the year. We're very focused on getting the cash breakeven that's what we're sort of putting in motion. That's where we're forcing ourselves to look at different scenarios and make decisions. And it's just, there\u2019s the range of potential outcomes in Q4 so wide, it doesn't make a lot of sense to hypothesize on where we\u2019ll end up, especially on the revenue side.\nBrad Tilden: The way we got to that is, that's what we believe is required for us to be able to control our future. It's like all of these airlines, we've got decent liquidity. Shane detailed, we've got good plans to raise liquidity but that gets us to a finite number. And then you have a burn rate and at some point, you do have to take control of your future if you want to control your future. And so that's our mentality, is we've got it. If we can get to zero, if we can commit to a zero cash burn rate by December, we're in control of our future in 2021 and beyond. And if there are opportunities to present themselves on the landscape, we can take advantage of those opportunities. We can mitigate the downside. So it's going to be painful, we believe is going to be painful. But there's just a lot of belief in the goodness of making a commitment like that and the good things that will come. Another point I was going to -- you guys are asking good questions, Savi and Mike as well. But we do believe Alaska is configured to be a bit more agile than the average airline, if you look at us right now. Our fleet is all it's basically, on the Alaska side, is all narrow bodies. As Mike pointed out, we're moving now 19 or 20 Airbus airplanes to Boeing. So I think we're going to be a little bit more able to scale up or scale down depending on the demand that we see than some of our competitors. I think we also like the fact that our business is more oriented towards leisure travelers and our business is more oriented towards domestic travelers and narrow body travelers. So all of that stuff sort of informs us. We believe that we can sort of sit here and say, how we don't know. But we think that if we sort of define the future that we need to have, we think we can get there. And we think if we get there, we'll be in control less -- fewer bad things will happen to our people, and we'll be in a better position to take advantage of opportunities that we see. So that's the more thinking around the goal.\nJoseph DeNardi: Shane, you mentioned $2 billion of unencumbered aircraft, $500 million in real estate and then $7 billion to $8 billion of collateral. So does that imply that the loyalty program is kind of $5 billion-ish? Did that surprise you? And what do you think being kind of the -- is it safe to assume that that would be the last line of liquidity that you would look after? Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Yes, I think the math is probably fair, because you sort of added up the only ask that I didn't put a price tag on. So fair enough. I think that we've know it's a valuable program for a long time. In terms of what our order preference of raising money is honestly, we're not in a position to share what that is right now. We're still working on what the best opportunities and options are for us. There's a number of different vehicles we can go down the path of tapping, mileage plan is one of those and it's on the table. But there's no certainty about which one we'll do at this point.\nOperator: The next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Can you just put a comment as to how the negotiations with treasury are going? When we might have some timing around the loan outcome? And also, as a follow up to the previous question. Did you specifically list loyalty as an asset on the loan application that you are willing to pledge?\nShane Tackett: I would just start by saying that the discussions with treasury and their advisors from the very beginning on the payroll support grant through today have been very, very productive, super professional, it's a great group of people back there trying to do everything they can to support the country, support the economy, give it away back in the future and there is probably nobody working harder right now than that group of people back there. On the loan side, it has been in a bit of a low. We did talk last week with treasury advisors. I think they're very intent on beginning to get more clarity on what these loan terms and conditions and collateral will look like in the coming weeks. So we anticipate a more active dialog in the next five to 10 days. And yes, we did list the loyalty program listed essentially. Most of our asset base, which was sort of expected to be listed just based on the way that they gave us the application.\nBrad Tilden: Those are all options of collateral\u2026\nJamie Baker: And then following in with Mike's but that's I'll try to do only got two part follow up question. So on fleet and I apologize if you mentioned this in response to this question it was breaking up a little on my end. But have you reached the walkaway point in the MAX contract? And how should we be thinking about that as it relates to future CapEx? And then second, in the release you mentioned lease deferrals. Can you add any color on that as to the duration and when repayment is going to take place? I'm sure it's in your cash guide. But is that a net cash saving for the year, or did you just shift lease payments from the second quarter to the fourth, for example?\nNat Pieper: Let's start first with the MAX question. So Boeing's been a terrific partner of ours for years and years. Our original order for the MAX 32 airplanes and Boeing's got a considerable amount of predelivery deposits on hand of ours, we're working with them and sorting through what the right scenario is for that. And I think that's part of the fleet discussions and analysis that we're having internally to figure out what's the most efficient fleet for Alaska moving forward. Regarding the lease deferral discussions, we started those really in the second week of March, and have had pretty good traction. Very diverse lease base within Alaska and have been able to secure lease deferrals with all the two of our lessors and are appreciative of the partnership with them. I wouldn't think of it, Jamie, as a 12 month process. So deferrals that we get eventually within that 12 month window, we're going to repay those amounts with the exception of discussions with each of those lessors should the revenue environment continue to be super challenging. They understood from the beginning we may have to come back and have a second fight.\nOperator: Your next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen. You line is open.\nHelane Becker: So, here\u2019s one question for you. I think Horizon received money and so does SkyWest, and they're both providers to you. Have you gone to them and asked them for the payroll support program cash that kind of directly attributes to your business?\nAndrew Harrison: Obviously, Horizon is a wholly owned subsidiary. So that comes to Air Group and I will tell you SkyWest has been a fantastic partner. Along all of these days, we've looked at that contract. And they helped us through this financially and we also -- the costs, the labor that they incur to fly for us, those care funds have been flow through to us in our contract.\nChris Berry: I would say we also having the same discussions with ground service providers and other contract folks out at the airports who have also received those cares grants, so we're having those conversations with all of our vendors that have received some form of federal support.\nHelane Becker: Right, because otherwise they'd kind of be double dipping.\nChris Berry: Right.\nHelane Becker: And then my other question is, are you changing your operations at Paine Field to kind of focus back on CTAC given how low demand is? And the other part of that question is, Seattle was one of the first cities to experience the virus. And I'm just kind of wondering if, as Seattle and the State of Washington and the State of Alaska have opened up a little bit. Have you noticed any recovery in bookings?\nAndrew Harrison: Just with respect to Paine Field, we've obviously materially reduced capacity just like everywhere else. We run 175 airplanes out of very low trip costs per se and we just keep it bare minimum service there and that's where we're at right now. And we have a lot of our folks who live up in around that area and that they enjoy the travel out of it, so that's what we're doing there. As you've heard on many the analyst calls, we've reached the bottom. I mean, the bottom is the bottom obviously. But I would say that although extremely modest, we continue to see passengers carried every day on our network, grow a little bit by little bit day in and day out. But it won't be until there's a material change in the stay home orders that we expect to see any material shift in that. So we're still heavily reduced demand as of\u2026\nBrad Tilden: Diana, do you want to talk about what's happening in our state and other important geographies in terms of where we think shelter-in-place orders are and so forth?\nDiana Rakow: We have seen the curves out here flattened. But like the rest of the United States, they haven't necessarily gone down. And our leadership out and a lot of our West Coast states have worked together to have sort of this four phase approach. That said, we haven't actually opened up significantly. Washington State is still in phase one. We've opened up construction. And as of today, outdoor recreation and some other areas but not significantly opened up in terms of the workplace or groups gathering. And then in California, Governor Newsom just announced that Friday we will move into phase two of the four phase approach, which means that some barber shops, retail will open to sidewalk delivery, some manufacturing workplaces and again construction. But we have a ways to go in terms of sort of truly opening up the economy. Every state is kind of taking their own approach. But the way that we think about it is both what is the state of play in our hub and what's the state -- respectively and what\u2019s the state of play sort of at the other end of that spoke. And then just for Alaska and Hawaii, there's still some quarantine restrictions. So we're watching each of those states closely.\nOperator: The next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O'Brien: So maybe just a couple more on your cash burn figure, it\u2019s hard to believe at this point. So first is on that month of June rate, what is your assumption on revenue? Are you assuming receipt, less refunds and prove from where we're trending today? Or you're assuming no improvement there? And then maybe just one more on that breakeven year end cash burn figure. I just want to understand that. If demand was to remain at current levels, would you be able to take actions to get to that burn to breakeven? Or I realized there\u2019s many more questions and answers on recovery. But just thinking if you had, just wondering if do you have the tools to get that breakeven even if demand kind of stays down here? Thanks.\nShane Tackett: Yes, on the June number. I would just say we're assuming that it looks very similar to April and May to be honest. So, no real recovery. It would be great if we saw forward demand pick up and people start to book travel for later in the year, but we're not necessarily counting on that. On the, you know, what if sort of scenario, I'm not going to sort of go down that path very far except to say that there is no scenario under which we're assuming we can't get to our target and so it's incumbent on us to go after it as hard as we can and to get there and we're not going to take that goal and commitment off of the table, certainly not as we're sitting here talking today and so, lots to be seen on where that may end up in terms of Q4 revenue, but our job is to go work the things that we can control and get ourselves to cash breakeven for all the reasons that Brad said.\nCatherine O'Brien: I have one more. So can you walk us through how you're thinking about additional liquidity raises? So what type of demand recovery scenarios? Are you making contingency plans for in terms of those future potential liquidity raises? And I guess what I'm really trying to get a sense of is, how many months of liquidity are you comfortable with having on balance sheet, assuming that we don't see an improvement from current levels and in demand over the medium term? Thanks again?\nShane Tackett: I think for us and I think others who have gone before us have said that there is a real asymmetrical risk with should you get more cash under the balance sheet or should you not. And so our bias is more liquidity is not going to be something we regret. At the same time, I think what we're trying to also I'd be very clear about is we don't want to burn through that cash. In a perfect world, we know we're going to burn through a lot over the next several months, we know we'll burn through a lot in 2020. We would like to get to an equilibrium as we get into 2021 and then hopefully demand stabilizes, the industry stabilizes and we don't have to sort of burn through anything else that we can pile on the balance sheet, but our job number one is to make sure we're here, that we bridge this downturn and that we have an opportunity to take advantage of any potential opportunity on the other side.\nBrad Tilden: Shane, all that burn, that's just -- if you raise the liquidity and get your burn under control, you pay the liquidity off and you're in good shape. If you don't manage your burn, it's just dead. The burn burdens the company. Katie, my own thing is I think we're going to be aggressive on the fund raising side. I just think that's the personality and the profile of Alaska Air Group but we hope that we don't come out of this with like, I don't want to say the number, but an enormous amount of debt on our balance, it's going to be a high number, we just don't want it to be $6 billion, $7 billion of debt on our balance sheet. That would be a difficult thing for us to manage with. So that's why managing our burn rate is so important.\nOperator: The next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nMike Maugeri: This is actually Mike Maugeri on for Hunter. So I saw that you are beginning to operate some tag flights which I assume is due to the DoT minimum service requirements. Can you just talk a little bit about what that's doing for your operation and if that portends to how your network might look post COVID?\nAndrew Harrison: So really we only ask for exemptions for a couple of cities, but the tag flights and also what we call loopers where we sort of do a little bit of a circle. These are a very efficient way to serve multiple markets when there is low demand and instead of flying two flights, we can fly on one single aircraft. The way the crews are working right now, we can easily fit our crew times within those trips and, of course, crews will stay over in the hotels especially on the transcons and then come back. I think we launched about 11 markets this month and we're going to be doing some more, but I think in this time, we are going to be looking at how can we serve our guests to give a maximum utility at the lowest cost and a win-win for everybody and that's what we're going to be looking at.\nBrad Tilden: And Andrew, its more based on our desire to take care of our customers than an order from the federal government.\nAndrew Harrison: Absolutely, yes.\nMike Maugeri: And sort of I guess a follow-up to that, how do you think about serving multiple airports and one metro area again in the post-COVID world, say Dallas with Love Field and DFW is it sort of worth the complexity there to sort of serve your customers. Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, you know what I will say is we have spent an exorbitant amount of time as much time as Shane's been talking about on the financing and the business. We've spent a lot of time in our network and where everything is and so we're also looking at many many scenarios on how to build and raise our network back up to strength in the future and that's what we're doing right now and we have nothing more to really add as it relates to that.\nOperator: Your next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Shane, I just wanted to say, I hope you're enjoying the nice, easy start to your new role. For 2Q, you've given us your monthly cash burn, what is the amount of capex and debt service that's included in that and how much of the payroll support are you excluding from that, that you expect to take here in the 2Q?\nShane Tackett: So I'll let Chris chat through the question on CapEx, but just to be clear, the way we're talking about cash burn, any money we raise and we would put the government grant money and loans in that bucket, we're just putting that into the cash and liquidity bucket. It's not part of our calculation. Our calculation is simply whatever revenue we're able to get in the door less all of the cash that's going out of the door and so it's pretty clear from that perspective. We're not offsetting any of the cash expense with grant money.\nChris Berry: So from a debt service standpoint, it's about $60 million a quarter and it's a little bit lumpy throughout the quarter, but just put in your model $60 million per quarter for debt service. On the CapEx side, as we mentioned earlier, we've eliminated all the aircraft CapEx. What we have left is pretty minimal and I don't have a number for you, but it's a relatively small number for a few projects that are still ongoing. I just don't have that number in front of me right now, but it's pretty small.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then, your comments about having some concern about where debt goes and being able to pay it down on the other side really resonate because this is after all a bunch of equity analysts that are on the call here. What are the long-term implications for capital spending given that goal and thanks for taking the questions.\nShane Tackett: I just mentioned, you guys are asking awesome questions. We wish we had like more clarity and more answers. We were sort of intent on sharing whatever we know today and not really hypothesizing so much and so that's in the category where it's really too early to tell. If we do our job right, we get the liquidity we need, we get down to the cash breakeven goal, we manage the business well and then we are able to see a recovery at some point. We'll be balanced in terms of managing growth opportunities and sort of getting back to baseline levels of capacity while we're also needing to go back and pay down debt. I would just reflect on our last earnings call and I think Brad said for the 20th call in a row that we were very proud of our couple of year paydown of the Virgin debt that we had acquired and we're certainly focused on getting back into that range of debt to cap. There is some flexibility on the fleet side. We do have a lot of PDP money on deposit with Boeing and we can take aircraft under some of that and so there is an opportunity for us to -- without new cash going out the door actually flex back up from whatever our new normal is out in the future, if that makes sense and is helpful.\nOperator: The next question is from Darryl Genovesi with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nDarryl Genovesi: I know it's early for this, but I wanted to ask a little bit more about how this is going to affect your long-term planning process and I'm not sure if its for Brad or Ben or Shane, but what we're going through now represents somewhat of a paradigm shift. Before now, our downside scenario modeling efforts usually centered on a financial crisis like demand environment. So a 20% peak-to-trough decline give or take and what we're seeing right now is clearly much worse than that. So two questions. First is, I guess, one that would fall into the category of one that you know. What was the range of demand assumptions that have typically informed your long-term planning processes before now. In particular, what was the bare case assumption that you would sort of model around when you were trying to figure out how to size the airplane and whether to buy an airplane or not. And then secondly and I guess this one kind of falls in the hypothesis category, but regardless of the timing achieved by the recovery, is 2020 now likely to represent the bare case that you'll model to going forward?\nShane Tackett: I think that we historically had similar sort of downside model that you're talking about. I think inherent in a lot of our planning and decision-making was we wanted to have an ability to manage through crises that were of the size we had seen in the past, give or take and to do so as comfortably as possible from a financial perspective to be able to weather those and just make sure we were here to participate in the recovery and nobody obviously had modeled something like we're going through today and so it is creating more question about how we think about downside cases in the future, but again, we're about 60 days-ish or something into this and we're really now just pivoting our focus to managing the economics as we get into Q4 and into next year. We just haven't had a chance to really think through what we think a new normal pattern might look like and what downside cases might look like. We're certainly modeling a range of 2021 demand assumptions right now, all better than we see today, but certainly much lower than we saw in 2019.\nDarryl Genovesi: And then on the ATL, I continue to be surprised by how resilient these have been across the airlines that have reported so far. Can you provide some color perhaps on how the Air Traffic Liability trended intra-quarter and how much risk there is to the $1.1 billion balance in Q2?\nChris Berry: If you look at ATL on our balance sheet, it's inclusive of normal what you would consider traditional ATL which is tickets that are there for future travel and it also includes our voucher or credits, what we call e-wallet on our side and that's where there is just a residual value or some sort of credit in that we're holding on to as a liability that has no future date assigned to it. So what you saw in Q1 was really especially March, a significant shift from that traditional ATL into credit or the vouchers and so you didn't see ATL overall come down. So as we look at that, that certainly is something that we're looking at and we're trying to model right now how that rolls through and it really totally is dependent on when demand comes back. We cannot model that with any sort of precision, but what we do know is we continue to see sort of refunds and cancels as Andrew and others mentioned and others are seeing in the industry and the majority of those are going into this e-wallet or this credit balance and so as we look to the rest of the year and as demand starts to come back, then that's when you will see that start shifting back over into traditional ATL as people book their tickets.\nBrad Tilden: Cash inflows will lag revenues [Multiple Speakers]\u2026\nChris Berry: Correct, that's exactly right, but we don't have a lot of precision on that model yet simply because we don't know when demand is going to start coming back[Multiple Speakers]\u2026\nBrad Tilden: I might just add a little color. I think there is about $600 million of traditional ATL right now in our number. The cash refund -- the credit split has been 70% to credit or a little bit higher. So you can sort of infer the potential downside if we saw refund activity continue to be what it was over the first couple of months of the downturn here.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call to Mr. Tilden for any closing remarks.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks very much for tuning in everybody. We look forward to talking with you at the end of the second quarter. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. This call will be available for future playback at alaskaair.com. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ALK", "quarter": 4, "year": 2019, "date": "2020-01-28 22:40:05", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Catherine, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group's Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer session for analysts. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Emily Halverson.\nEmily Halverson: Thanks Catherine. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. In today's prepared remarks, you'll hear updates from our leaders Brad, Ben, Andrew, Brandon and Shane Tackett. Several other members of our management team are also on hand to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. This afternoon, Alaska Air Group reported fourth quarter net income of $181 million on both the GAAP and adjusted basis with the latter excluding merger related costs and mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments. Air Group's reported adjusted earnings per share for $1.46, $0.05 ahead of the first call consensus. These results compare to adjusted net income of $93 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax margin expanded 470 basis points to 10.9%. This marks the fourth quarter of sequential improvement in our margin expansion. For the full year 2019 Air Group reported record revenues of $8.8 billion, adjusted net income of $798 million and adjusted earnings per share of $6.42. Pretax margin was 12% with adjusted operating cash flow of $1.8 billion, and adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion. Our debt to capitalization ratio declines to 41% and our return on invested capital was 12.2%. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward looking statements on our expected future performance, which may differ materially from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brad for his opening remarks.\nBrad Tilden: Thank you, Emily, and good afternoon everybody. As we discussed in the last couple calls, we feel that 2019 marked a turning point for us as we got to the bulk of our Virgin America integrations and begin to see the returns on that investment. And more importantly, as we focus our energy on running a fantastic airline and on executing initiatives, which we designed to strengthen our long-term competitive advantage. As Emily shared, today we reported that our 2019 adjusted pretax income grew by 43% to nearly $1.1 billion and our adjusted pretax margin expanded 3.1 point to 12%. Our operating cash flow was exceptional as it grew 37% to $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow of $1.1 billion and our net income to free cash flow conversion of about 140% were also very strong. We've now paid down 75% of the $2 billion we borrow to buy Virgin America and as Emily said, our debt to cap ratio is now down to 41%. These results deliver terrific value for our owners. In 2019 ROIC grew 280 basis points to 12.2% and our earnings per share for the full-year group 44%, which is the highest growth rate of any airline that reported so far. Of this value we've returned $250 million to shareholders in 2019 through dividends and share repurchases. Brandon will talk in a moment about our capital return plans for 2020, which will include the $0.10 increased our annual dividend which we announced today. We've made progress on many fronts. But we're especially pleased with our momentum on commercial initiatives designed to improve the guest experience and drive revenue gains. For both the fourth quarter and the full-year we expect our unit revenue growth will be the best in the industry. I want to congratulate Andrew and his team for this exceptional performance and I want to thank our Frontline employees for operating safely and reliably and for operating -- and for offering genuine and caring service to our customers. These things are sometimes overlooked, but I think we all know that no airline nor any business for that matter can deliver on value creation opportunities if the underlying product is not inherently good. Its not just the leaders of Alaska that believe we have outstanding people. J.D. Power, Cond\u00e9 Nast, Newsweek and U.S. News and all -- U.S. News & World Report, all spoke up in 2019 to validate our views. Tomorrow over $130 million in annual performance-based pay bonuses will go out to all Alaska and Horizon employees. This is the 10th year that our program which focuses all of us on safety, low-cost, remarkable service and financial performance will pay out. And the average over those 10 years is about an extra month of pay per year. Even with these results we've got work to do. At our 2018 Investor Day we shared our roadmap detailing plans to return pretax margins to the range of 13% to 15% over the cycle by improving performance in the controllable parts of our operation. This is our number one financial priority in 2020. And as I close, I want to take a minute to recognize that this will be Brandon's last earnings call. Brandon has been with Alaska for 16 years and has served as our CFO for almost 10 of those years. As you know Brandon is an exceptional CFO and he's been recognized as one of the best CFOs in the industry because of his financial abilities and because of the clarity with which he communicates our plan to use the investment community, as well as to our employees. We will miss Brandon dearly. And all of us at Alaska wish him and his wife Janet the very best in retirement. Shane Tackett will be Alaska's new CFO effective March 3rd. Many of you know Shane well and we're excited to see him step into this role.\n,: Last week leadership team and I returned from two weeks on the road for employee meetings in seven cities across our network. The goal of these meetings was to share our strategy for 2025 and we found employees throughout the operation were energized about the road ahead. This industry can be challenging, but our people know what it takes to win. A relentless focus on safety, an on-time operation, truly remarkable service and a low-fare, low-cost, high-efficiency financial profile. We continue to do the things well and will continue to grow. You'll hear more about this from others today. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Brad and good afternoon everyone. At our Investor Day in the fall of 2018, we laid our a roadmap to achieving our goal of 13% to 15% pretax margins and a series of revenue and cost initiatives that would move us closer to that goal. Building on that momentum, we been working on our strategic plan for the last six months that sets the vision for Alaska for the next five years. The plan builds on our strengths and addresses key areas of opportunities for our company to thrive in a consolidated and increasingly competitive industry. The plan is comprehensive and for obvious reasons we won't share specific details, but at high level that's focused on three areas. The first is growth, which includes how we build our network and hubs. How we unlock the value proposition of our brand in California. How we build the best-in-class merchandisers. How we become the best-in-class merchandisers. And how we drive guest and employee facing innovation. Second is people, which addresses how we continue to nurture our fantastic culture. How we build excellent labor relations. And how we develop that leaders in the industry. And third is our business model, which builds on our strong safety culture and operational excellence. Our path of being leaders and sustainability. And our focus on creating a robust financial engine that allows us to generate appropriate financial returns over the long term.\n.: Building these muscles as required enormous discipline. Of the last 10 years, we've demonstrated our ability to be at or near the top of the industry in each of these areas. We know that preserving these competitive advantages is key to continued profitable growth. But we're seeing increasing congestion in our largest hubs that is challenging us. Gary Beck, our new Chief Operating Officer and his leadership team will be laser focused on operational excellence and changing processes, so we can continue to operate in our congested hubs with a low cost, high productivity mindset. Recently, we began building another muscle that is key to our future as a growth airline, building our commercial advantage through improve merchandising and demand generation. We saw the impact these efforts had on our performance in 2019 and believe there's additional opportunity to improve in these areas. Andrew will be sharing more about these plans in a bit. Finally, our business model. You know that we are committed to achieving a 13% to 15% pretax margin and that remains unchanged. Additionally, we been working on concrete goals around capital allocation specifically related to free cash flow generation and returns of capital. You hear us talk often about the value we create for our guests and employees in our board has always been supportive of this. They've challenged us to also model the same clarity and our long-term commitments to owners. So we've created a document that we hope to share with investors this spring that provides insights on our management philosophy and that covers the financial targets that we should be held accountable to. The working title of this document is called the Owner's Manual. We plan to share more about it at our Annual Shareholder Meeting on May 12. If you don't typically dialing for that, I suggest that you do so this year. Before I hand it over to Andrew, I'd like to mention several achievements during the quarter. First, we completed our busiest holiday travel season ever. Our fantastic people helped over 11 million guests get to their destinations this quarter. Both Christmas and New Year's falling midweek, demand was higher than usual as evidenced by elevated load factors in yield throughout two holiday weeks. And despite a rough Christmas week operationally, our people providing excellent service to our guests and I want to thank them for their efforts over busy couple of weeks. Second, with the recent ratification of the Joint Collective Bargaining agreement with our Airbus and Boeing aircraft technicians, all workgroups across the company are integrated, completing a significant milestone in under three years after the merger with Virgin America. Third, Horizon delivered one of the best financial and operational performances in its history in 2019, with lowest unit cost ever. Gary Beck and the entire team at Horizon have led a remarkable transformation. Congratulations to them and looking forward I may going to see how new Horizon President, Joe Sprague and the team build on the success, including continued cost management and moving even more to best-in-class C175 operational performance. As I reflect on my almost 16 years with Alaska, I know that our success has been fueled by our fantastic people, many of whom I've been here for decades building our brand and the special connection we have with our guests. Our culture and focus on kindness is truly unique and we will continue to nurture that even as we continue to grow. Our employee meetings over seven cities the last two weeks were inspiring and energizing and it gives me confidence, we can execute this ambitious plan. And now, over to Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Ben and good afternoon everyone. Eco what you've heard from others. The commercial business ended the year on a very strong note. Our total revenue grew 7.9% in the fourth quarter on just 3.5% capacity increase. This translates to unit revenue growth of 4.2%, which we believe will exceed industry by over 350 basis points. Both leisure and business demand was solid this quarter. I'm pleased report that New York and California Transcon performance were both among the top three TRASM improvement stories for Alaska. Our team have worked hard this year to recover from the challenges we faced early in 2019 and have made a positive impact turning those markets around. This is a testament to what we know to be true, putting the right aircraft in the right markets when combined with Alaska's high quality product and service is a win for both our guests and Alaska airlines. An important contributor to our revenue growth has been a premium product. You may recall the prior 2017, our mainline fleet was segmented into just two classes. First, in main cabin with the regional fleet only main cabin. At that time premium product revenues comprise just 7% of all revenues, with 70% of revenue generated by main cabin seats. Today first class and premium class represent 22% of our total revenues. This mix will grow as we complete the reconfiguration of the airbus to bring the premium product mix in line with the rest of the fleet. On the regional side of our business, we also see solid demand for premium seating on the Embraer 175s. We are intentional about how we manage our premium product business. Our goal is to keep out premium cabins affordable, provide generous benefits to our loyalty members while competing effectively against our peers. In the fourth quarter, first class revenue was up 19% on 13.6% more seats. Premium class revenues were up 16% on 14.5% more seats. This momentum will continue into 2020 as we complete the remainder of the retrofit and focus on more effective merchandising of our premium cabin. RASM from our premium products was 54% higher than generated by our main cabin and a six-point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2018. On the loyalty front, we once again saw double-digit percentage growth in our revenues this quarter. Revenues include mileage plan commissions on a credit card as well as redemption revenues included passenger revenue. This quarter's performance caps off incredible years of growth in our loyalty program since the acquisition. I'd also like to note that this quarter's results concluded four consecutive quarters of year-over-year RASM growth and a strong close to the year. Total revenues in 2019 grew 6.3% to $8.8 billion on 2% capacity growth. RASM for the full year is up 4.2% more than 200 basis point of industry. An additionally, this represents approximately 50 basis point over expectations we've shared with you at our Investor Day in the fall of 2018 and represent the highest full-year relative RASM increase since 2011. We started talking you about an inflection at the beginning of 2019 and we are pleased that our results this year demonstrates that we achieved. As Ben mentioned, it is imperative that we carry the momentum we built in 2019 forward and we will be squarely focused on building strength in the areas of merchandising, demand generation and innovation. To improve the execution of revenue initiatives and the guest experience, my organization has recently undergone a structural realignment to better anticipate and serve the needs and desires of our guests. The drivers of our revenue have fundamentally changed over the past decade, where that were once predominately driven by main cabin ticket sales, we now manage a fully segmented cabin that houses numerous in dollar segments including first class, premium class, save affairs and loyalty revenue. A new organizational structure better reflect how we do business today and we'll improve both the guest experience and our revenue performance. The company is long been a leader in merchandising and technology, a key enhancement to the commercial organization was appointing Charu Jain as Senior VP of Merchandising and Innovation. This new division will also include responsibility over distribution and e-commerce. Charu who was previously Alaska's CIO brings the technology experience. She'll be working with all our leaders to not only drive merchandising, but innovation that will be squarely anchored in revenue generation, improving the guest experience and developing tools for employees so we can deliver our products and service with excellence. We are very confident that Charu's leadership will drive us to regain a top position in the disciplines. Also on the technology front, the implementation of our new revenue management system is well underway. This project is a multiyear investment, which will bring advanced forecasting capabilities along with revenue and network optimization support. We pay plan to complete the first phase in the back half of 2020. While incremental revenue delivered in the first year is small at around $20 million. The capability and supports will unlock more significant revenue potential in the years to follow. As I shared on our last call, our 2020 revenue includes the carryover of 2019 revenue initiatives and synergies of approximately $125 million, and this will be concentrated in the first half of the year. Half of this represents synergies such as cross fleeting and the other half revenue initiatives such as the annualization of Saver Fare and other ancillary price changes. Additionally, the focus we're putting on merchandising, demand generation and innovation is expected to drive additional revenue growth with most of the opportunity skewing to the second half of the years, some of the larger initiatives require the activation of new technology. We will be updating you on the progress of our 2020 initiatives throughout quarterly revenue guides. This afternoon, we established our first quarter guidance ranges. Capacity growth will be approximately 4% and unit revenue is expected to grow between half a point and three and half percentage. While Q1 is the weakest seasonal period in the industry, we've seen indications of strength in the early weeks of the quarter relative to last year. To-date, pricing is been stable and structural changes to our network in January and February to better match our network to demand patent is resulting in some nice load factor increases and we expect to outperform industry unit revenues this quarter. 2019 with a strong year company by great momentum, delivering margin improvement through higher RASM and a better guest experience remains the commercial team's number one priority as we enter 2020. We've demonstrated our ability to identify and execute against high-quality self-help measures in 2019 and are confident that the additional opportunities we've identified will be similarly successful in 2020. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brandon and Shane.\nBrandon Pedersen: Hey, thanks Andrew. Good afternoon everybody. As part of our transition you're going to hear from both Shane and me to today as we walk through our Q4 and full-year performance and talk about 2020. We were pleased with our fourth quarter results. Net income and earnings per share both nearly doubled. Our 10.9% pretax margin was 470 basis points better than last year on the strength of unit revenues, solid execution against our cost plan again and a modest decline in fuel prices. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of margin improvement and the largest. For the full-year adjusted pretax margin was 12%, a 3.1 point improvement over last year and meaningful progress on our path to 13% to 15% margin. Profits increased because our teams executed well on the initiatives we laid out at our 2018 Investor Day. Our fourth quarter unit cost increase seven-tenths of a percent on 3.5% increase in capacity. We weren't happy with the result. We did have a modest reduction in capacity given December's weather and some related costs, but we also saw some late adjustments to employee benefit accruals including high dollar adjustments to pilot disability accruals and large medical claims that came in the last couple weeks of the year. Brad mentioned our performance-based pay program and I thought it might be useful to connect our year-end benefits related adjustments to the PBP payouts earned by our people. These late adjustments reduce the payout of an employee making $50,000 a year by $275. We need to improve the structure of these programs to better manage these costs prospectively. Overall, our full-year cost performance was solid. Our teams across the company both in operational roles and support roles did a nice job developing aggressive plans and then hitting them. It's notable that our full-year CASM increased only 2.3% on 2% ASM growth. You might recall that our initial guidance for 2019 was for 2% to 2.5% unit cost growth. We achieve that while absorbing $48 million of costs associated with the new Collective Bargaining agreement with our IAM and AMPA represented employees, not in the original guide. Productivity was good, but we still have lots of opportunity to get back to peak performance. Overhead was down 3.5% or $25 million year-over-year helped by the outstanding work of our supply chain team and their very successful initiative to improve terms with our business partners and the steps we took to right size our corporate staff. In fact there's more work underway to simplify reporting structures and make us more agile. Now over to Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thank you, Brandon, and good afternoon everybody. My remarks today will touch on both capacity and cost guidance for 2020. And then briefly on our fleet plan and owners manual. Regarding capacity, it remains our intent to grow between 3% and 4% this year. This does assume midyear MAX returned to service which given Boeing's press release last week and the likely requirement for sim-based training for MAX pilot is still uncertain. Regarding cost guidance, we believe unit costs will be up about 2% for 2020, excluding the impact of a new agreement with Alaska's pilots. I would also note, the 2% excludes any impact to capacity due to the MAX delivery timing, as well as any costs associated with potentially required training related to returning the MAX to service. We'll continue to update both our capacity and cost guidance as we gain more certainty about the timing of the 10 MAX aircraft we are scheduled to receive this year. To discuss costs a little further we just wrapped our annual budget process and although I'm happy that we have a plan that will again grow our pretax margin, we continue to have opportunity on our cost structure. As you know, during integration, we intentionally be prioritized to a modest degree our cost focus. That is now behind us and we know that our long-term health is secured only with the ability to offer low fares and high-value to our guests and that to offer low fares we need to be relentless again in our focus on efficiency and low costs. While goals are aggressive for 2020 in light of a few large headwinds, we are committed to demonstrating our continued focus on cost discipline in the quarters and years ahead. For Q1 specifically we expect unit cost to increase roughly 3% and the 4% ASM growth that Andrew mentioned.  Another important area of focus is our long-term fleet plan. We have an opportunity to replace 61 A319 and A320 aircraft with larger gauge, more efficient asset, either MAX 9s and 10s or Airbus 321neos, all of which would give us the ability to generate more revenue while lower unit cost. The economics of up-gauging over the next several years are compelling, and we're looking forward to finalizing plans to do this is one of our main 2020 objective. The ultimate timing of a fleet transition will be balanced to smooth incremental training costs especially if moving to a single fleet, and will also be done in a manner that ensures we can meet our free cash flow and capital return goals. We\u2019ll have more on this topic in the quarters come. Lastly, Ben talk to you about our owners manual, which is something we are excited to share more about later this spring. Alaska led by Brandon these past 10 plus years has established a history of balanced and consistent capital allocation, balance sheet help and cash flow generation that has served the company, our guests, our employees and our owners as well. The owners manual will serve to build on this history by documenting and memorializing goals in several areas including free cash flow generation, leverage, returns to shareholders, ROIC and pretax margins. It also discusses the factors that have driven and will drive our continued success including the way we serve customers, how we offer value to and create loyalty with guests. And the critical importance of operating with excellence and being a great place to build a career for our people. As Ben said, we will share this in May at our Shareholder Meeting. And with that, one last [Indiscernible] back over to Brandon.\nBrandon Pedersen: Thanks Shane. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. We produced a record $1.8 billion of operating cash flow before pension funding, while net CapEx was approximately $700 million resulting in $1.1 billion of free cash flow, a $760 million improvement over last year. Free cash flow conversion was exceptional at approximately 140%. CapEx was lower than planned because of MAX delivery delays, but plan CapEx was also low because of the intentional constraints we put on CapEx two years ago in order to improve our ability to generate free cash flow. Our number one capital allocation priority for 2019 was to re-deleverage our balance sheet. We paid off more than $600 million of balance sheet debt that have now paid off $1.5 billion or 75% of the amount we borrowed to acquire Virgin America. We close the quarter with a debt-to-cap ratio of 41% and with a trailing 12 months net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.9x. We also made a $65 million contribution to our defined-benefit pension plans which are now 86% funded. Last quarter I mentioned that our treasury team was working hard not only to prepay debt, but to restructure the debt that remains to take advantage of the low rate environment. They've done a great job. We have $1.5 billion of balance sheet debt remaining, 79% of that is fixed and the overall portfolio rate is currently 3%. Current maturities average only $250 million per year over the next three years, rounding out our fortress balance sheet, our 113 unencumbered mainline and E175 aircraft and $400 million of undrawn lines of credit. On the capital return side, I hope you all saw that we once again increase the dividend this time $0.10 per share or 7%, signaling our board confidence that we're on the right track and our current expectation that 2020 profits will be eclipsed that of 2019, given that our leverage is basically where we want it we\u2019re poised to increase returns to shareholders with the going in assumption that share repurchases will increase by more than 3x to $250 million this year. When combined with the higher dividend, we expect return $430 million to our owners this year, the second highest amount in our history. Before we go to Q&A, I thought I might offer some closing thoughts through a more personal lens. First, you've heard about our competitive advantages. They are real and durable. But the secret sauce of this company is our people. Sure that might sound cliche and I know investors can't model it, but its actually the truth, not just a way they connect with our guests but how resilient and determine they are across all corners of this special company despite our 87-year history of being the underdog. Second, I couldn't be more enthusiastic about our new CFO. There is nobody here better than Shane that understanding the proper drivers of our business. And finally, we have an awesome strategic plan that's exactly the right plan for where Alaska is today. And we have an exceptional group of leaders especially those around this table that have been incredibly lucky to work with who will make it come to life. Its going to fun to watch. And with that, let's go to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good afternoon everyone. I think I'd be remiss to not start off by saying congratulations Brandon on your retirement, but I'm sure you know that you will be miss by all. And then from there, I guess, I'll start off with the cost question. So just -- on your cost 2020 outlook, so thinking back, this year's costs were up 2.3% on 2% capacity growth, which as you've just highlight includes about 100 basis points of labor headwind from new agreement featuring [ph] this year? And then in 2020 you're expecting unit cost to increase the similar amount and what could be 150 basis points more capacity. Can you just help us walk through any headwinds you're facing this year? Or any big cost tailwinds dropping from 2019 to help explain that pickup in unit costs? Thanks.\nShane Tackett: Yes. Hi, Katy, this is Shane. I'll take that. And just [Indiscernible], I do think we had a really good year in 2019. If you recall at Investor Day in 2018 we laid out a multiyear sort of roadmap that articulated $160 million of cost savings that we were going to go after over the next couple of years. I think we did really well on a number of those selling related expenses, constraining overhead which was down $40 million. Brandon mentioned the supply chain work that was done this year. So that's all really good. We do have more work to do on the productivity side of the business, asset utilization side of the business. In order to get those unlocked we need to be able to grow more and to do that we just need more stability in our fleet plan, and we need to unlock some of the constraints in the way of growing which include crew training, and again just sort of knowing which aircraft are going to have over the next year or two. There are a couple of headwind areas principally airport related cost. That is a place we used to be super efficient at, it was maybe 3% or 4% of the cost structure, it 7% or 8% now and I think it can be elevated for a while as aging infrastructure airports does need to be upgraded and we understand and support that. And then, we do have a big maintenance sort of driven expense item this year both on the Airbus and the Boeing side. A lot of the Airbus related costs are related to beginning to account for lease returns that begin in earnest next year.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, great. Maybe just one quick follow-up on that one. So on the lease returns, do you have any sense or could you give us some color on like what portion of the CASM that's driving this year? Thanks.\nShane Tackett: Yes. Katy, I think we do know that, but I don't think we've given that level of detail on the call. \nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. And maybe just one more on the MAX. So couple of your peers were negatively impacted by lost capacity due to grounding of the MAX in 2019 have reached agreements with Boeing, that should reduce CapEx going forward. Could we see downside to your $750 million CapEx forecast, not only just from the timing shift but also from potential reduction in purchase price if the MAX remains out of service through later this year.\nNathaniel Pieper: Katy, it's Nat Pieper. How are you?\nCatherine O'Brien: Thanks.\nNathaniel Pieper: We're talking with Boeing as I think every other airline is on the planet right now. With potential delivery schedules, as you know, we were supposed to have three airplanes last year and take seven more in 2020. It's part of our longer-term fleet strategy and looking at growth and replacement going forward and there's just going to be more to come on that.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. Thank you.\nNathaniel Pieper: Thanks Katy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon. Just a little bit of slightly different side of coin to Katy's question on CASMex, but I think Shane you mentioned that your -- the plan is to expand pretax margin. So kind of curious on the revenue side, it seems like there some confidence and maybe you'd outperformed -- you be able to continue outperform in the industry. I'm not quite clear on kind of all the drivers there and what gives you confidence as with everybody having these various revenue initiative. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that?\nAndrew Harrison: Hey, Savi, it's Andrew. I think a lot of things that we've had an opportunity to do that we're going to continue to see. The first is, as I shared in my prepared remarks, we do have carryover synergies and initiate that are quite significant. And most of the other carriers had their basic economy in already and of course the synergies in cross fleeting and other things. So that's the benefit that's going to come through. The other thing is that we are really hitting our stride now. We're squarely focused on running our core business. The network team is doing a magnificent job at getting seasonal schedules tighter, more efficient, more productive working with the ops groups and we are now moving away from integration is squarely focused on getting our revenue initiative in more quickly and doing a much better job of it. Overall, from what I'm saying in the first quarter, we feel really good about how all those things are working together on the revenue momentum front.\nSavi Syth: Thanks. And then Brandon, if might ask you a question as Brad pointed out, you been doing this for -- Alaska for 16 years and I think longer being part of Alaska. Just wondering over this time, what you consider to be advantages that Alaska have today you didn't see when you kind of joined? And maybe what are the challenges that you see today that are different than that maybe 10, 15 years ago?\nBrandon Pedersen: Hi, Savi, that's an interesting question, just off the cuff. What I would say is we're way more discipline than we were 16 years ago, and that just comes from us maturing as a company and getting a better leadership team and focusing more on process that cuts across the operation and how we think about our service and also things cuts across the finance part of the business, as well. In terms of challenges going forward, I think it's just continuing to grow profitably in an industry where four carriers have 85% market share. But I'm confident as I said that we've got a mix of competitive advantages, some tangible and some intangible that will allow us to do this going forward, and I'm really optimistic about the company's future.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse.\nJoe Caiado: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Congrats again, Brandon and Shane. Congrats to Kyle Sangita, lots of congratulations to go around over there. As you as you work on putting together your five-year plan, how was the uncertainty around the MAX impacted that process internally? Have you had to delay certain decisions? Or could it even be seen as an opportunity as you revisit your delivery schedule with Boeing? Shane, you talked about, you're thinking about up gauging, might this actually afford you more flexibility in terms of fleet or CapEx planning as you think about putting together that five-year plan?\nNathaniel Pieper: Hey, Joe, it's Nat Pieper again. I think what we've been focused on is really defining our fleet requirements for the next five to 10 years covering our replacement needs and covering growth. Shane mentioned the 61 A319s and 320s that we currently operate and those are the airplanes that are the primary candidates for replacement. We're looking at the MAX 9 and the MAX 10, looking at the A321neo, and there's going to be upgauge benefits for us with that better cost performance, better revenue performance. Boeing's challenges with the MAX did cause us to rework the sequencing of events and some of our timing. But we're confident that over the next six to nine months we're going to come with a good decision for Alaska. Later this quarter, we're going to start the acquisition process. We will work it through the summer, and we're confident we'll come up with an answer in third quarter, fourth quarter of this year.\nJoe Caiado: Appreciate that. Thank you. And then maybe just a quick question on this owners manual, understand more details to come at the annual meeting. We certainly look forward to that. But just can you describe the document a little bit more and its intended purpose? Is that something that would be accompanied by formal changes to the proxy, management compensation structure? Is it more sort of a philosophical documentary or guide post for management. Just how should investors think about that document? Thank you.\nChris Berry: Hey, Joe, this is Chris Berry. It really is more of the latter. I mean, it's, a pretty comprehensive document, but it shares our competitive advantages, our management philosophy, our style, and then really sets up these guideposts for long term financial performance. And so you'll see that laid out in the owners manual. We'll spend more time with you all after we make those announcements to share more of the detail on the sausage making, but that's generally how its laid out.\nJoe Caiado: Got it. Thanks, Chris.\nBrad Tilden: Chris gave a great answer. I might just sort of maybe add some perspective from the board. Our Board of Directors got very interested in this process. We had two or three investors come and speak with the board 18 months or 24 months ago. The basic idea was we feel like we do articulate how we bring value to our communities, to our customers, to our employees, and they really not just us to say, get more articulate about what the deal is for people that own the business. And I think we've had a lot of fun putting the manual together, I think -- I hope, as we put it out there, I hope you all give us feedback. But it's -- the idea is that we don't want our stock to be a trading vehicle. We don't want as a shareholder roster to be filled with short term investors. We want this to be a fantastic place for you to invest over decades, and we want to be part of getting more respect for the industry, getting people to invest in the airline space to have a mindset when they invest that it's going to be a great long term investment. So this is sort of us taking a stab at putting -- making some commitments. We know that we've done well when we've made public commitments about what we want to do. So it's Ben and Chris has said, we'll roll this out in May, but we're anxious to get your feedback to it and then have it get better as we move along.\nJoe Caiado: Appreciate that insight. Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Brandon, and congratulation Ben, it's been a real pleasure with you, dude.\nBrandon Pedersen: Thanks Hunter.\nHunter Keay: Sure. So I have a question.\nBrandon Pedersen: Did you want me to say it's been great working with you dude?\nHunter Keay: No. That's enough for me for now. Thanks Buddy. Giving your comments Ben on hub congestion and Shane some of the comments you made about rising airport costs. So what's the company view on this proposed second airport in the CTAC region? Thanks.\nBrandon Pedersen: Hunter, you're talking Paine Field?\nHunter Keay: No, I'm talking about the proposed -- didn't the city Council talk about that there can be some proposal is going to be debated at some point in 2022. about building a second airport in the region just completely from scratch.\nBen Minicucci: Yes. This is a great chance for Diana Birkett Rakow to jump in and she's been working on this, Hunter, and, Diana, why don't you share your thoughts on?\nDiana Rakow: Sure. Thanks. Hunter, you've been reading some good, Washington State News. So, the legislature passed a bill last year to set up a governor commission's board to look at potential options for growing capacity across the region. That could be at Paine Field. That could be at another airport in the region, and asked for a recommendation to the governor by January 1, 2022. Shane Jones, who is our Vice President of Airports is on that commission along with many others. And we're very interested in the results. We certainly know that we have fantastic growth in this region, and we have constrained airport space and we want to make sure that we can continue to grow.\nHunter Keay: So Yes, what's your view on it? Do you do you want it to happen? Or I mean, what's your what's your company view?\nDiana Rakow: Yes. We do want it to happen. We're really glad that the Commission was set up. We don't have a bias yet as to where that capacity increase occurs. Obviously, there's some underway at CTAC. But we need more than that, and we're anxious to get through the evaluation to make sure we do have a thoughtful answer about where. And it more maybe one location and maybe more than one location at the end.\nHunter Keay: Okay, great. Thanks. And then the second question, Andrew, you talked about sort of the revenue initiatives and network initiatives. It looks like seasonality is kind of creeping back into the P&L a little bit. And that means bad margins in 1Q, and really good margins in 3Q. You guys kind of got away from that a few years ago, and the balance was something you talked about. As you make network changes to sort of return to areas of strength, does it also reintroduce a little bit of sort of quarter-to-quarter seasonal imbalance in your annual earnings results? Is that something you're trying to manage?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. That's how that's been squarely on my team's radar. In fact, just to be frank, I'm watching January and February of this quarter very, very closely, because we made some very significant network moves. And what I'm seeing right now is very decent load factor increases company by yield increases. So, I think going forward, our job will still be in the first and the fourth quarter. But the first quarter is really our biggest challenge. And I think as we move the network around, as we upguage, as we do a lot of other stuff, I think we'll get this a little more in line. But our first quarter is probably going to be always the weakest.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, everybody, and just to kind of echo the sentiment of everyone else. Brandon, it's been a great run. So on that note, I'm going to ask a pension question, but you can deflect over. One more pension question, right. But I don't know if you may have mentioned it earlier. But do we see in 2020, do we see a benefit in the non-op from maybe better than expected returns in your pension in 2019?\nBrandon Pedersen: Yes, definitely, the non-op portion will be a small favorable improvement year-over-year.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And then just my second question, and maybe this is more to Andrew. When we think about, you talk about growth, and I sense that, it's all about margin growth and earnings growth. But we also look at sort of where your supply growth is relative to the industry. And the 3% to 4% number, if we were to go back, 12 plus months pre MAX, was that where the planning was for 2020? Maybe 2021? Or is that maybe even a bit on the low side, because you've had some pretty meaningful network changes. It does seem like you've pulled back some trans cons and some longer hauls. That 3%, 4%, how has that changed maybe post MAX is what I'm asking? Thanks.\nAndrew Harrison: That's good question. I think, well, for 2019 we were more deliberate about slowing our growth as we tried to get the integration behind us. I would say for 2020, our growth is lower than we would like, just to be honest. And the MAX for sure, has pushed on that a little bit. But also, we're working through this multi fleet and crew and all the rest. But at the end of the day, as we've shared, it's 4% to 6% growth. And I'm looking forward to getting through some of these decisions and challenges so that we can move this forward.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And just one just one last word to Brandon, and I presumably you picked the march week, the first week of March, because that's when S&P upgrades you to investment grade, right? We should assume that?\nBrandon Pedersen: Bless you, man.\nMichael Linenberg: Congratulations.\nBrandon Pedersen: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thank you very much operator, and Brandon, I will echo everybody else's comments wellness [ph] working with you. Shane, we're looking forward to working with you. And Brandon, I'm looking forward to seeing what your next chapter is going to look like. So two questions. One is, are you doing any accruals for prospective contracts like for the pilot contract? Or is that an after the fact item?\nBrandon Pedersen: No. It's an after the fact item for us.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then my next question is kind of unrelated to some of the things we've talked about so far. With --I know you guys have a lot of co-chair agreements and interline agreements with various international airlines, especially ones in Asia, and China. And I'm wondering if you're seeing any declines in passenger transfers between your airline and those airlines? Or if it's way too soon with what's going on in China?\nAndrew Harrison: Helane, it's Andrew. We've looked at it. The International connectivity to and from especially China and some of Asia is a very small number for us. And so, as we look at our growth and traffic right now, it has not been impacted at this time because of this.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then just one other question. On Transcon, do you have to rethink your decision not to have live flat seats, as you grow that business or are you not going to grow that business going forward? Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Thanks Helane. Actually, that's a fair question, but I have been extremely encouraged by what's happened in the Transcom business. How we've restructured our pricing and the product and the loyalty growth that we've seen. So right now, the product that we have on board is working very well for us. And I still see upside, even going forward. So for me right now live flat seeds is not something that I'm consider -- that we're looking at.\nHelane Becker: Okay, great. Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks Helane.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hey, good evening, everybody. Brandon, congrats.\nBrandon Pedersen: Thanks Joe.\nJoseph DeNardi: I felt like some of the commentary around the fleet transition and the capital that could go with that what was a little bit cryptic. So can you just maybe provide a little bit more clarity around maybe how capital intensive the business could get over that period? Or what your commitments in terms of returning cash to shareholders would be through that? Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Hey, Joe, it's Shane. Yes, we're not sort of in a position to have a lot of precision around that, just because we don't know what this deal might look like or deals might look like as we go out and look at acquiring aircraft. But certainly, replacing 61 aircraft over a period of time is going to require some capital. A lot of those as you know our lease today, there's a chance that we could replace some of those with leases. But our goal is to sort of get the best value and the best deal for Alaska as we go through this process with the manufacturers. And we'll say more about this when we roll out the owner's manual, but also be very committed to returns to shareholders assuming we have good profitability, which is what we're planning to have over the next several years.\nBrandon Pedersen: And just Brandon maybe just a follow-up, but it's not intended to be cryptic at all. It's really just the uncertainty around the timing and what we actually do that will drive CapEx for the year. But just to reiterate what Shane said, that's really one of the purposes of the owners manual was to allow some guidelines to make sure that we're meeting our commitments on balance sheet strength and free cash flow generation.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, and then Brad I think, either you or Brandon have mentioned how much of the Virgin debt you've paid down about 73 times over the past 12 months. So, it's clearly something that you think is important. Can you just give -- help us understand what we should interpret that as like what happens when all of the debt is paid down? What, why is that so important in your view? Thank you.\nBrad Tilden: Yes, well, we'd never done M&A before. If I recall, we paid $2.6 billion, the equity value for Virgin America we financed to, 2 or 2.1 billion of that were debt and Brandon, you can audit me as we go here. But that was different, and we are super proud of a very conservative balance sheet, a conservative financial profile. And it was important to get the balance sheet back to what investors think of, what we, how we think of ourselves as quickly as we could. So we are really proud to have paid off 75% of 2 billion and now it's 74 times or whatever that we have mentioned that. I think the other reason that's important is, is all of this and some of the messaging we're trying to do today. All of this positions us to move forward. Now. It's, as you go through every -- you always learn things, but these are big things. There's all kinds of systems and brand and loyalty and single certificate, reservations. There's so much stuff that needs to be done and for a while you are actually really held into that space. But what we're trying to say is that's behind us now, we're no more looking through the rear-view mirror. We're looking forward where what are the things that make Alaska great, what are the things that make it great for investors and customers and investors? Sorry, investors, customers, employees, and let's, let's -- let's put all eyes to the front windshield moving forward, continuing to make a great airline even better. So that's what we're -- that's the messaging we're trying to do. I'm not sure how well we've done it, but that is our mindset.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks, Brad.\nBrad Tilden: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey there. Another shout out to Brandon. It's important to me to try to one up hundred sentiments in particular. So, I'm actually planning to send you an aircraft model as a gift currency glass because at that run, it won't run afoul of my compliance policy. It\u2019s a perfect gift. Question on the on the two-week road show that Brad spoke enthusiastically about in the prepared remarks. Presumably the mood amongst the rank and file is positive, but could you identify the typical areas of dissatisfaction?\nBen Minicucci: Hey, Jamie, it's Ben. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m thinking back within several roadshows across all our big hubs, there were a lot of questions related to some internal things, internal systems that we needed to operate better within the company, so it's and this will be stuff that borrows you guys with timekeeping systems and scheduling systems. But I would say overall what was really good for me, my big takeaway is they were really energized about the vision and the plan over the next five years. There was growth and the big thing, yes, one of the biggest things was that the Virgin America questions weren't there anymore. These people were gelling as one team, and it just felt for the first time in three years doing all these road shows that it felt like the airline was one, and that was so inspiring. And again, we did all our big stations it was a lot of fun.\nJamie Baker: Okay, thanks a lot. Second, when I think back, pre-merger Alaska, went through a phase of innovation. I think you were the first with, self printing bag tags, I remember to experiment with our RFID key chain that would check customers in when they enter the terminals. So obviously that switching back before smartphones. It's not going to impact my 2020 model or anything. But was that, was that just a phase? I mean, I'm wondering if the march to 13% to 15% margins also includes, once again, pushing the envelope in terms of technology and I think it more about what the customer experiences, not too much, distribution. Is this also a mandate for choose area?\nAndrew Harrison: Hi, Jamie, this is Andrew. It absolutely is, and I think if you just look at the airline industry today, it's not as much about networks anymore. Obviously for the big guys. I fly everywhere. It's about the guests. It's about the interaction of the guests. It's about making it easy and bringing that all together. And I think on the innovation front we got distracted by the integration. And I think what I'm really excited about is organizationally, and I think it's okay to say too we also have an order. Excuse me. We have a subcommittee of the board now, that's focused on innovation, that true and I are accountable to. So, I think you're going to see some real momentum here. You're right. 2020 won't be started. But on the next few years is a big focus for us.\nJamie Baker: Excellent. I appreciate the color. Take care, everybody.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey thanks, not much more to add at this point. Best wishes Brandon on the next chapter. Not sure if you'd be willing to talk about it. But do you have a non-compete and if you do, how long does it last?\nBrandon Pedersen: It last\u2019s 15 years. And actually, not willing to talk about it because it's not focused on Air Group going forward. So next question please?\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Fair enough. On free cash flow. Great to hear you're stepping back up the buyback in 2020. Just checking the math a little bit, because if you truly are done re-deleveraging, it feels like it could be substantially bigger than what you've outlined. So, should we think about this as a starting point? Or are you looking to build cash for now?\nBrad Tilden: Duane, maybe I'll take that one. Yes, we're not looking to build cash. We ended the year with a billion five. That's probably about where we see it ending next year as well. You are absolutely right with the math that you are doing. There will be more, but it's all dependent on what we end up doing with the fleet decision. That's why we started at 250. But we're going to be flexible on that and we have capacity under our existing repurchase program to do more than 400. So, we'll wait and see.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And then if I could sneak one last one in for Andrew sorry for the baseball analogy. What inning would you say you're in with respect to the premium revenue push, both in inventory, availability, availability and your ability to merchandise it? Thanks for taking the questions.\nBrad Tilden: Yes, I'd say we're sort of in the final innings as far as putting the inventory on the shelf. We took 25 175 and all the conversions. We're now turning over to upselling and all the rest of it. And we've got, we've got ways to go there to do a better job there.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Duane.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nMatthew Wisniewski: Hey, this is actually Matt Wisniewski on for Brandon. First Congrats, Brandon. But I just had one quick question. One that is think about to get some additional color on how we should be thinking about growth this year. Last year, I was focused on regional this year shift towards the main line. Whether that's new markets. And then, in the case of the Max not returning, what levers potentially could you pulled it potentially mitigate the impact whether it's utilize, utilization or anything else?\nBrandon Pedersen: Yes, basically, the -- I'm sorry, I got distracted on growth\u2026\nMatthew Wisniewski: Where it was reasonably, geographically where it\u2019s going to be\u2026.\nBrandon Pedersen: The growth is 100% mainline, the regional is shrinking just a little bit. And then we do have some levers to pull, whether it's paint lines, mod lines or some other things that we really don't want to, but if we needed to, we might be able to squeeze some more out, possibly Airbus lease extensions as well.\nMatthew Wisniewski: Okay, thank you.\nBrandon Pedersen: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.\nMyles Walton: Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering in the context of the 3% to 4% capacity growth you are looking for in 2020 kind of what you're looking for from the regional versus the main line and also in the context of your fleet planning decision? How intertwined is the exercise of the options and the 175s to the decisions on the main line side, and did they kind of have to happen in sequence?\nBrad Tilden: Just on the growth as I just shared it's all mainline this year, regionals flat down.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. And on the question about the options for E175, we've, we've done a bunch of regional growth recently, we're going to focus on mainline, fleet plan over the next several months and then by the end of the year miles, we do plan to make some decisions about what we want to do with the regional fleet over a five to 10 year period as well.\nMyles Walton: And you guys have that kind of unique advantage of having in the past operated the single fleet and going to get the complexity of the second type and I know in the prepared remarks you, you hinted at the evaluation of that single fleet benefit. Can you maybe lay out economically what you've seen as that complexity costs of the dual fleets and maybe what that is as a put, if you decide to maintain a dual fleet?\nBrad Tilden: Hey Myles, I might not provide a specific number. We do -- we have looked at it, there are clearly some hard costs associated with just crew and some maintenance, provisioning and those sorts of things, some training, there are a lot of soft costs that sort of get lost that it's hard to quantify around just schedule efficiency and making sure you have the right planes in the right, the right cities on every single flight and it gets more complicated during the regular ops. But I mean, it's not insignificant and so if we maintain a dual fleet, we'll just need to make sure we can get the revenue out of the aircraft.\nMyles Walton: All right, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi with Vertical Research.\nDarryl Genovesi: Hi guys. Thanks for time. Hey Andrew as a follow-up to Savi the 2019 RASM outperformance of the industry really just reversed the underperformance that you saw in 2018 despite the synergies and commercial initiatives. So just wanted to ask you when you say you will be similarly, you think it will be similar successful in 2020? Do you think that you have enough in the toolbox actually outperformed domestic industry RASM in 2020? Particularly starting in the second quarter when the prior comp start to get more difficult?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, and again, I'm only going to comment on the first quarter, but I think what I would share is that we have some good initiatives and some good momentum here to continue to grow unit revenues over the course of every quarter this year.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay. And then Brandon, I apologize in advance because the overall body of work speaks for itself. But Shane, without completely front running the Investor Day message, what do you think Brandon might have done a little differently over the last 10 years?\nShane Tackett: Brandon was a particular stickler for not allowing us to enjoy box lunches, but expected us to work at the same time. But I'll probably adopt that, it was a good a good message of reality.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay. And then Brandon now that Shane has completed the airing of grievances in a [Indiscernible] way as possible, how sympathetic to this situation where you feeling when you came up with this 2% CASM ex-guide?\nBrandon Pedersen: Honestly, I'm really not to dodge the question. I actually do love the discipline we have in the 2020 budget. And I know everybody's aligned around, just really getting back to a place where we reinforce that competitive advantage. We have that as the cost advantage. And I don't know what you thought of the headline 2% number was that some uncertainty with respect to capacity, but I'll tell you we are really focused on making sure that this place rocks when it comes to cost performance.\nDarryl Genovesi: Right. Thanks a lot guys. Congrats, Brandon.\nBrandon Pedersen: Thanks.\nBrad Tilden: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay, and your last question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, thanks good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Congrats Brandon and Shane. Nicely done, echoing everybody else here of course. So I guess a couple questions Andrew or Shane, I wonder if you can elaborate a bit more on how you plan to integrate the Max's into the fleet once they come, so, specifically once you get the green light from Boeing, how much time are you building in for filling the plane before they go into service? So like, a one month booking window two months. And I just, I guess what my question is getting at is could this shorter booking window, way on system revenue? And are the new revenue initiatives that you, you kind of outlined intended to offset some of those challenges?\nBrandon Pedersen: Yes, Dan, we've got we've got pilots that are available to fly. I think at the end of the day, what I would say is, is that we're going to start this thing off, we're just going to fly it up and down the West Coast. But we will have enough flexibility, given the number that we're getting to be able to weave these into the schedule, maybe first as spares and then build into revenue production over a period depending on the market 60 to 90 days.\nShane Tackett: But Andrew, I think it's true, we're going to sell as if we plan to lift the capacity one way or the other. So, I'm not going to shorten the booking window, right, but we intend to deploy the Max's.\nDan McKenzie: I see. Okay, very good. And then, the reference on the premium revenue and the repaired prepared remarks. What is the plan growth on premium seats this year? And, and where are you at in the premium seating reconfiguration of the Virgin fleet?\nBrandon Pedersen: So where the growth is going to slow significantly, we've got about 20 units to convert, of which the front cabin goes from 8 seats to 12 seats, but at the end of the day, we're now really Dan the opportunity is now we've got all the premium class out there all the 175 out there, and all the conversions that's really the upsell and growing that nicely.\nDan McKenzie: Understood. Okay, thanks for the time you guys.\nBrad Tilden: And I think that is my understanding is correct. I think Dan McKenzie was our last question for the quarter. Thanks, everybody, for tuning in. Thanks for being a part of this and we look forward to talking with you after the first quarter earnings and we as Ben said, I hope many of you can join our shareholder call where we talk more about the owner's manual. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. This call will be available for future playback at Alaska air.com. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ALK", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-10-24 22:05:07", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Thea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group's Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Emily Halverson.\nEmily Halverson: Thank you, Thea. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. I started to get to know many of you. But for those who I haven't yet met, I've been with Alaska for four years in the accounting world, and I'm looking forward to working with each of you in my new role. In today's prepared remarks, you'll hear updates from our leaders Brad Tilden, Andrew Harrison, Brandon Pederson and Ben Minicucci. Several other members of our management team are also on hand to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. This afternoon, Alaska Air Group reported third quarter GAAP net income of $322 million. Excluding merger related costs and mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments Air Group reported adjusted net income of $326 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.63, ahead of first call consensus. These results compare to adjusted net income of $237 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.91 in the third quarter of 2018. Our third quarter adjusted pre-tax margin expanded 360 basis points to 17.6%. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements on our expected future performance, which may differ materially from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings really filed today. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brad for his opening remarks.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks very much, Emily, and good afternoon, everybody. Before I get into this quarter's results, I want to take just a moment to acknowledge the recent incident at one of our Co-Chair partners in the state of Alaska, PenAir. One of their Saab 2000 aircraft overran the runway in Dutch Harbor one week ago today, and this tragically resulted in one passenger fatality and one guest being in critical condition for one day. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the guests who are on board, to their families and loved ones, and to our partners at PenAir. This is a somber reminder to me and to the rest of our leadership team of the grave responsibility that we shoulder and of continued need for us to underscore the importance of safety with our people and our partners at every opportunity and to backup this understanding with our actions every day. Now moving to our third quarter results. I want to congratulate the fantastic folks at Alaska, Horizon and McGee for delivering the industry's best customer service and operational performance, which together drove our strong results. Our revenue was up 8% for the quarter on 3.4% more capacity. And Horizon had a terrific quarter as they grew capacity by 24%, while reducing non-fuel cost by 1.5 points, as they absorb all 30 of their new E175 aircrafts that have been delivered over the past three years. The team at Horizon led by Gary Beck has increased productivity for the fifth quarter in a row, and has met our goal for guest satisfaction in all but one month this year. Additionally, our commercial team has been working very hard and they produced industry-leading unit revenue growth of 4.5% on solid demand as evidenced by our highest quarterly load factor in the last five years. It is fantastic work like this that expanded our pre-tax margin by 360 basis points to 17.6% our best results in two years. If we look at our results on an absolute basis, our adjusted net income for the last 12 month was $709 million, and that's up nearly 30% from the prior 12 months. We converted that net income to $1.6 billion of operating cash flow. And with our effort in the last couple of years to adjust capital spending, our free cash flow was very strong at $695 million. In other words, we're converting 98% of our net income to free cash flow. Our company is producing good earnings and converting those earnings into solid free cash flow. We view free cash flow conversion as one of the critical measures of how we drive value for our shareholders. While it won't be the case in the next couple of years, in the last two years, we've been using our free cash flow to pay down acquisition debt and also to return cash to shareholders through our dividend and share purchases. On debt reduction, by year-end we will have repaid $1.5 billion or 75% of the $2 billion we borrowed to buy Virgin America. And at 42%, we are quickly approaching our long term adjusted debt to cap goal of 40%. Strengthening our fortress balance sheet positions us to be flexible and opportunistic, and to make the best strategic and capital allocation decisions in the future. We carried a record number of guests this past summer. Our team's full focus has returned to running a great airline, and it is showing. I'd like to share two recent achievements. First, our people were once again recognized as the best U.S. airline by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler in its Annual Readers' Choice Awards. This is the second year in a row that we won this award, and we're continuing an 11-year run that Virgin America had before us. We can't thank our boys enough for their skill and dedication in serving our guests. And second, three important labor deals, which represent over 6,000 of our people were ratified this quarter. We're proud to get these deals done for our folks. And Ben will tell you more about them in just a moment. If you've done the math on our recent guidance, you've likely estimated that our 2019 margins will be somewhere around 11% to 12%, up from just below 9% last year. We're encouraged by our progress, but we do not believe we're at the destination. On the subject of ROIC, we expect to end 2019 in the range of 12% to 13%, which is up significantly from 9.4% last year. As we look beyond 2019, we're developing plans that will put us into our stated pre-tax margin range of 13% to 15% over the business cycle. Andrew and Brandon will now share more detail about the quarter, and then Ben will round it out with some discussion on our five year strategic plan. The plan addresses our products and loyalty strategy, our revenue initiatives, our cost structure, our network structure, a vision for our fleet and more. We're challenging ourselves to create specific blueprints so that we can deliver in critical areas and thereby honor our commitments to all of the people who are depending on us. We're excited about the plan and we look forward to sharing components of it with you in the quarters ahead. With that, I'll turn this over to Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments this afternoon will focus on third quarter revenue performance, progress on guest pricing initiatives and revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. Our 4.5% improvement in unit revenues is 260 basis points better than the industry, and highlights the effectiveness of our revenue initiatives and the work we are doing to harness merger synergies. Our third quarter result was our best absolute RASM in the past three years, and as Brad mentioned, our load factor was the highest we've seen in five years. Demand was healthy across our network during the quarter. This was demonstrated by 1 point improvement in load factor and 3.5 percentage point improvement in yield. Hawaii, which has been experiencing elevated industry capacity and soft pricing performed well. Notwithstanding the fact that industry capacity and our own capacity were both up nearly 7% we still produced a modest unit revenue increase. We've continued the strong momentum that we started in Q2 in our transcon markets out of California and New York. Earlier this year, these regions were under a lot of yield pressure. Teams across the organization came together to diagnose the problems, develop a plan and execute the plan. Through cross fleeting, the addition of satellite Wi-Fi, dialing in the schedule and cash structure and a committed focus to improving the guest experience, we achieved meaningful RASM and margin improvement. Our value proposition hinges on offering low fares, while providing award winning service, generous rewards and premium product, and our people are delivering on this. Our revenue improvement is a direct result of our initiatives and synergies. At Investor Day, we shared a roadmap we view laid out our intention to deliver $330 million in incremental 2019 revenues. Unlike in the first and second quarter, our initiatives delivered their full annual run rate this quarter. Three quarters into the year, we are confident that we'll deliver on the $330 million. I'm going to share more on go-forward initiatives and synergies in a moment. We also continue to see double-digit percentage growth in our loyalty revenues, which as a reminder, comprise award redemptions and credit card commissions. A large driver of this result was the 8% increase in redemption revenue on our metal, evidence of our generous availability for award travel. We continue to see growth in both mileage plan members and credit card holders, and are particularly encouraged to see that nearly one-third of our year-to-date growth in credit card holders are guests living in California. Nearly half of all of our guests are members of our loyalty program, which has consistently been recognized as the best in the industry, another bright spot with the improvement in the styles of our premium cabin products. First Class revenue was up 16% on 10.5% more seats. Premium Class revenue was up 13% on 12% more seats. Our network has shifted over the years to where nearly 50% of our capacity is at trip length of five hours or longer. This drive strong demand for our premium products, and we're very pleased with these results. As we build out our Airbus interiors to add more premium seating, we expect premium revenue growth will continue to outpace system wide revenue increases. Besides premium seating, we've made significant investments over the past few years in our product, while building our hubs and focus cities on the West Coast. These improvements include satellite Wi-Fi, new interiors on Airbus aircraft and investment in our lounges. This quarter, we expanded our lounge capacity nearly 60% when we opened our 15,000 square foot lounge in SeaTac's North terminal. Guest satisfaction scores at the new lounge are 15 points higher than the system average and day pass sales have doubled. We've also seen record breaking trends in lounge membership growth. In the first month after opening, new member enrollments were quadruple our program average. We're applying our learnings from the North Satellite lounge to our new San Francisco lounge set to open in early 2020. And as you know, our lounge members are mostly elite and high frequency travelers. So these facilities are very important to us. Before I move to guidance, I'd like to highlight that we made network adjustments that we announced during the third quarter, which are aimed at creating more desirable connections for our guests between our hubs and focus cities in California and our focus cities in the Northwest. These include flights from California to Spokane, Redmond Missoula, Boise and Anchorage. As we grow capacity at a lower rate than we have historically, our focus is on careful reallocation of capacity given the seasonality in our network, as well as growing market share and our strategically important markets on the West Coast. Initial signs are encouraging as we are already seeing positive results in demand and margin generation from these types of changes. Looking to Q4. Our capacity will grow moderately at approximately 4%. Our Q4 RASM guidance range is up 1% to 4% on much harder comps from Q4 of 2018. This guidance reflects our optimism in our revenue initiatives, as well as the continuation of demand and pricing trends we are currently seeing Many of you ask regularly about how we're doing on revenue synergies, which we laid out at our Investor Day in November of 2018. As we shared with you at that time, our total expected merger synergies were $300 million, $240 million of which are revenue synergies. We realized $65 million of these through 2018. And as mentioned earlier, we're on pace to realize the full $130 million that we expect this year. All of that cost synergies have effectively been realized to-date, leaving $105 million of revenue synergies that we still need to achieve. Approximately $60 million of this is slated for 2020 and $45 million in 2021. So we'd like to sort of tie off these historical synergies and commitments, and establish for the record that our remaining commitments heading into 2020 is for $60 million in revenue synergies and the annualization of our 2019 revenue initiatives, which will be approximately $65 million. So in total, that's $125 million in 2020 or about 1.5 of RASM. We will be adding our 2020 revenue initiatives to this commitment and we'll share these with you on our call in January. Continued delivery of revenue growth is my team's top priority, and we're optimistic about what we can bring in 2020. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.\nBrandon Pedersen: Thanks, Andrew, and good afternoon, everybody. We're pleased to report 38% improvement in both adjusted net income and earnings per share, as well as our third consecutive quarter of margin improvement. As others have highlighted, our 17.6% pretax margin reflects that 360 basis point expansion year-over-year, and was a direct result of the initiatives we laid out at Investor Day last year. With our Q3 results and our Q4 guidance issued today, we're on pace to have a full-year pre-tax margin of between 11% and 12%, which would be up 200 basis points to 300 basis points from last year and meaningful progress on our path to 13% to 15% margins. Since Andrew touched on the revenues, I'll focus on the cost performance for Q3 and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Our unit costs increased 3.4% on a similar increase in capacity and the result was about 150 basis points better than our initial guidance in July. It bears mentioning that the quarter included $24 million in signing bonuses associated with the ratification of new deals with Alaska's AMFA and IAM represented employees. Without the signing bonus, our CASM would have been up less than 2%. We saw excellent cost performance for most of our operating divisions, although some cost did shift out to Q4 and even a little bit into Q1 of next year. Pilot cross-training is an example. We've talked many times about our dual-pronged strategy to manage costs, those being high productivity and low overhead. Productivity was strong during the quarter, Aggregate Air Group productivity which we measure using which we measure using guests per FTE came in better than planned, and improved nearly 2 points from prior year. Year-to-date, productivity for our airports team and our guests contact team deserves special mention as both have exceeded productivity targets for both plan and prior year -- and over prior year. On the overhead side, there's another good story here too, overhead is tracking nearly 3% or $16 million under prior year for the first nine months of 2019. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect CASMex to be up slightly on just less than 4% increase in capacity. This would be the best quarterly unit cost performance, since the fourth quarter of 2016. We're benefiting from higher growth, offset by some of the timing shifts we've been talking about over the last couple of quarters and higher rate wage rates, following ratification of the new contracts. The modest increase in Q4 cost will bring the full year result to 2.2% CASM, ex-growth on a -- excuse me, 2.1% capacity growth. Normally, we would celebrate unit cost declines, not increases. But given the step change increase in labor costs we've had this year, and the very low growth relative to our recent history, we're pleased with the results and it demonstrates what we can achieve with a back to basics approach, to cost execution, with a sharp focus on productivity and operating our business with a low overhead mindset. As you've heard, our teams are working diligently on our 2020 plan, including our cost plan. We recognize that low costs widen the competitive moat we have versus higher cost legacy carriers, and are critical for us to eventually return to the higher growth levels that we've historically enjoyed. While we don't plan to share guidance with you today, I can share some higher level context for the cost challenges, and opportunities, we face in 2020. First, notable headwinds include, first, a higher number of scheduled engine and airframe events in 2020. Second, we'll begin to see the cost impact of Airbus lease returns. Although, we only have one return scheduled for 2020, we have nine return scheduled for 2021 and we began accruing for these lease return costs 12-months in advance, and third increased airport costs. Offsetting those headwinds however, we see the following opportunities. First, higher ASM growth over which to spread our fixed costs, we'll grow between 3% to 4% next year with that growth nearly all coming from lower unit cost mainline growth as Horizon has now taken all of their E175s deliveries. Second, further productivity gains. Third continued simplification of our overhead structure, including changes that will allow us to be more agile and more quick with our decision-making. And fourth annualization of many of the benefits of our supplier cost reduction initiatives, which generated more than $35 million in savings in 2019. Our planning mindset is one of aggressive cost management and progress toward our 13% to 15% pretax margin goal, and I look forward to sharing more detail with you on our year-end call in January. Turning to the balance sheet; we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. Total cash flow from operations for the first nine months of the year was nearly $1.5 billion, excluding merger related costs and the pension contribution, while net CapEx was $525 million. This resulted in approximately $950 million of free cash flow, which marked a nearly $460 million improvement upon last year's results. At full-year consensus, free cash flow yield is almost 11%. Free cash flow conversion over the first nine months of the year was exceptional, but we're benefiting from very low cash taxes combined with a low capex year. Our number one capital allocation priority for the year has been deleveraging our balance sheet. As Brad said, we closed the quarter with a debt to cap ratio of 42% and a trailing 12 month net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1. By year-end, debt to cap will be at 41% and as you've already heard, we'll have paid off 75% of the merger related debt. Our treasury team has done a phenomenal job this year not only working to re-deleverage the balance sheet, but has also taken advantage of the historically low interest rates to refinance and or restructure our debt to low fixed rates. At the end of the third quarter, our weighted average interest rate is at 3.2% with over 75% of our portfolio now fixed at historically low interest rates. Rounding out our fortress balance sheet, our 104 unencumbered mainline an E175 aircraft and $400 million of undrawn lines of credit. Our strong performance this year has also allowed us to make some positive changes to our capital allocation plan for the year. First, we elected to make a voluntary pension contribution of $65 million to our defined benefit pension plans, which are about 80% funded in the aggregate. And second, we increased our planned full year share repurchase from $50 million to $75 million, given our strong cash flow. During the quarter, we bought back $28 million of our shares including $10 million over a two-day period at a volume weighted average price of around $58 per share. With the dividend, which we have increased six-times since we initiated it in 2013, we expect to return $248 million to our shareholders this year, or more than 25% of our free cash flow. Coming back to our five-year plan, our fortress balance sheet positions us to substantially increase returns to our owners and or place an aircraft order that would fund growth, and allow us to retire smaller, less efficient aircraft which would improve both our ability to generate additional revenue and lower unit costs. As we finish up our long-term fleet steady, we're also developing an order strategy that allows us to best leverage our market position and structure delivery timing that preserves our ability to generate free cash flow. And now I'll turn the call over to Ben.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks Brian, and good afternoon everyone. As the financial results highlight, it has been a productive summer here at Alaska. With the bulk of the work of the integration largely behind us, we are focused on realizing synergies and initiatives and improving our cost profile. A large part of that is providing visibility into our future labor costs. And as Brad mentioned there were three new labor deals ratified during the quarter; one with our aircraft technicians, another customer service agents and reservation agents and clerical workers and a third with our ramp, cargo and stores agents. We are thrilled to have these labor agreements in place to recognize who we believe to be the best employees in the industry, while also securing long-term contracts that provide line of sight for the company over the next several years. In the case of our aircraft technicians, they have now begun cross-training on both fleet types, which we expect to be completed by the first quarter of 2020, further enhancing productivity and operational reliability. In addition to our industry-leading financial results, our frontline teams are delivering outstanding operational reliability, and award winning service to our guests. As you know, we track these metrics religiously internally, but just as importantly, it is validated by external sources too. To add to the recent recognition by Cond\u00e9 Nast as the best US airline, Alaska was also just recognized as America's Best Customer Service and Airlines by Newsweek, Best Airline Rewards Program by U.S. News & World Report, the top rated airline and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and ranked by Forbes Magazine as one of the top 100 Best Companies to Work For in the world. These awards are significant, not only because we'd love to see our people recognized, but because they highlight that staying focused on our core competitive advantages resonates with guests and really does make a difference to the bottom line, even while executing a complex merger. We are creating a future that continues to build on these core principles, which drive preference for our product and operational reliability. They include low fares, and low costs, best-in-class customer service, the industry's most generous mileage plan, a fuel-efficient fleet, a well loved brand and a fortress balance sheet. As we've navigated the integration over the past three years, we've admittedly put certain longer-term strategic planning efforts on pause. We believe it was the right thing to do to ensure we completed the integration on an aggressive timeline that exceeded expectations and allowed for a singular focus on returning to the well oiled machine that Alaska is known to be. This past summer, our senior leadership team has been focused on building out our five-year strategic plan that addresses where we want to take our network, our fleet, brand, loyalty program and financial performance. While we aren't yet ready to share the specifics I'm pleased with how the plan is taking shape. There is still work to do, as we refine the strategy that has helped shape our past success while we develop new strategies to build an even stronger Alaska for the future, centered around sustainable growth, our people and a strong business model. We have a lot of work left to do. But the improvements, we've seen this year and the momentum we are building with our network, our product, our people and our financial results give us a ton of confidence in the future success of our company. And with that, we'll open up the line for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: Maybe one for Andrew first. So, you called out the $125 million in Alaska specific revenue initiatives you've got next year, does that include any future initiatives? I'm pretty sure it has the annualization of this year and then continuation of some of the merger revenue synergies. Think you guys have a new M&A system coming online next year, should that drive any initial -- any incremental benefit or is that a right contemplating the number. Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, that's right Katie. What I shared was the carryover synergies and initiatives from 2019 is going to be about 1.5 points unit revenue. In January on our call, we will share with you the incremental revenues we expect from our initiatives for 2020. So, we'll do that in three months time.\nCatherine O'Brien: And then maybe two quick ones on costs, so great cost performance again in the third quarter, guessing that we should assume that since you maintain the full-year cost outlook was that mostly timing or something else going on there? And then maybe just on the lease returns next year, are there any maintenance reserves that you're going to put those against here on the cash side? Thanks a lot.\nBrandon Pedersen: Hi Katie, it's Brandon. Maybe, I'll take those. On the cost, we were really pleased with our third quarter cost performance as well, you're right. We maintained the full-year cost or the cost number at the same level. So we did see some of those costs that we've been talking about shifting out of Q2 and Q3 into Q4. That explains the vast majority of it. ASMs are down slightly. Yes, that's basically it. On the second question maintenance reserves, yes, that's a really complicated area. Of course, there will be offsets associated with how we treat the maintenance reserves as we settle all these lease return obligations up, but that's factored into -- we'll factor that into the guidance.\nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Can you just remind us, maybe what the gating factors are on getting more aggressive on the buyback, if it's to completely repay all the debt you borrowed or to hit that leverage target, which you seem quite close to now?\nBrandon Pedersen: I tried to cover it a little bit in the prepared remarks you know we are awfully close to our leverage target. We're going to end the year at 41%, our goal was 40% that wasn't an exact goal. I think we're going to cross into the sub 40% territory early to sort of mid-ish next year. I don't think, we've necessarily decided if we're going to pay off all of the Virgin America debt, although we simply could. The point really that we're trying to convey is that our balance sheet is rock solid, and it gives us some optionality whether it's increased returns to shareholders and or position us to do something with the fleet that doesn't impact the balance sheet too negatively.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then, I think you have covered it as well. But, it's been a long day already admittedly, so I apologize. Just on the headwinds and tailwinds for costs and where those net out. I don't know if you're in a position to give guidance yet on 2020 CASM.\nBrandon Pedersen: No, we're not. I mean, we're going through the planning process now, and what I can say is, is that we've got a lot of cost momentum going into 2020. But our people are working their budgets really hard right now.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, thank you very much.\nBrandon Pedersen: Duane, I might jump onto the sort of capital allocation question. I think everybody knows here, we strategically we felt like the industry is changing, we needed to get bigger. We bought Virgin America, borrowed $2 billion in the last 2.5 years, have paid $1.5 billion to that off and the one thing we know is it in 2020 and 2021 that we won't -- we might pay down a little bit more debt, but I think mentally we're sort of crossing a threshold year that we're done dealing with the Virgin America debt and we're going to be looking forward, looking at new capital allocation opportunities for the company.\nOperator: The next question is from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Andrew, you talked a little bit about some of the network changes that you've made kind of focusing on some of the shorter haul business markets. But, it is looking and it seems like it is shorter haul and you're kind of moving away from the transcon. Could you talk about what you're seeing on the transcon and why you need -- that the transcon might be funding some of those shorter haul growth?\nAndrew Harrison: I'm not quite sure on the transcon, we've actually increased that flying especially out of Pacific Northwest with the seasonality. Really, if you look at the network moves, you're seeing a number of what I'd call Mid Continent flights out of California that quite frankly have a very seasonally pull in the fourth quarter and certainly the first quarter. And so, what we've been doing with aircraft is instead of doing that, we've been flying those aircraft up into our core Pacific Northwest, and connecting directly with some of our larger focus cities, and then we've also increased our capacity out of the Pacific Northwest during the winter quarters to take advantage of the seasonality there. Overall, as I've mentioned in our notes, our transcon network from California is significantly improved and it's doing good things. And so, we continue to commit to that, but those are most of the changes it's just really some of the short-haul is going up -- the Pacific Northwest instead of Mid Continent.\nSavi Syth: And then you mentioned Hawaii did well in the third quarter. I know there were some easy comps. Just, as we kind of look forward, any thoughts there since that was kind of one of the bigger areas and just a follow on to that, last time we talked about Alaska as well and is that -- I think that was supposed to be just like a summer -- a seasonal pressure, but just want to clarify that, that was still the case.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, on the Hawaii, you're right, there was some bad weather and volcanoes and all sorts of other things that were happening last year, but I think what we're seeing is still very solid demand, great load factors and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our airplanes are really configured well, especially for Hawaii with that premium class cabin, the first class cabin which has great demand on Hawaii flights and just the service we provide. We're really made for these longer-haul flights and so, we feel really good about that. Of course, with Hawaii, if there's more capacity comes in, that puts yields under pressure, but we feel very well prepared for that. On the Alaska story, you're right. In the summer, we have a lot of people who like to fly to Alaska. Some folks are flying wide-bodies longer distances, but we cater to very much demand on the West Coast and we do a good job connecting it. So, I don't see that to be a huge issue as we move into 2020.\nOperator: The next question is from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Starting on a housekeeping item, the fuel efficiency, that's implied by the fourth quarter guide shows more deterioration year-on-year than what we've seen earlier in the year. Also the sequential decline is a bit more than customary, I recognize there's probably some wiggle room in there around completion factor. But, is that just a modest shift to shorter stage lengths, because that's been going on for a while, so I'm just -- I'm surprised that it's more pronounced in the fourth quarter.\nBrandon Pedersen: Are you looking at ASMs per gallon or what's your metric that you're looking at?\nJamie Baker: Yes, ASMs per gallon.\nBrandon Pedersen: The only thing -- I don't have that at my fingertips, but the only thing I'm guessing is that on a year-over-year basis, it reflects the increase in regional flying as a percentage, given the fact that Horizon took so many E175s late last year, and then into this year and I'm guessing that's probably the contributing factor.\nJamie Baker: And second and this sort of follows on Duane's line of questioning, you talked about some of the headwinds and tailwinds, puts and takes on ex-fuel CASM for next year. I'd forgotten about lease return accruals for example, so thank you for that. But, I'm wondering if you could expand that narrative from costs to pre-tax margin? Synergies are obviously going to be a tailwind, you've talked about that, but how are you thinking about the other dynamics as it relates to pre-tax margin, next year? Fuel -- the industry impact of the MAX coming back, more Southwest service to Hawaii, what are the three or four items in the tailwind and the headwind buckets?\nShane Tackett: Jamie, its Shane. Good afternoon, this is an excellent question. I don't think I'm going to sort of delve into anything that gets close to guidance. But as we -- I'd just remind you that we laid out a roadmap to get to 13% to 15%, 18 month ago at Investor Day, I think as Andrew noted, we've got a bunch of commitment to you all that we need to deliver on, on the revenue side to sort of complete what we had talked about there, and we intend to do that next year -- and we intend to add to that amount ultimately ultimately and that's what Andrew alluded to in the script in terms of new initiatives that we'd like to talk to you guys about in the first quarter. On the cost side, I think at Investor Day, Brandon mentioned or I did, we always say its 4% to 5% sort of just core cost pressure, internally within the company. We're growing 3% to 4%. So, we're trying to find ways to continue to manage ourselves to a number that's more in line with our historical norm of flattish on the cost side, but our goal would be to see margins ultimately continue to expand. But, we haven't done all that planning yet and to your point that the industry dynamic is changing. So, we obviously will be talking to you all, more in the coming months about next year.\nOperator: The next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: So here's my one question, you are supposed to have some MAX this year. I think you're thinking all 10 of them are going to come next year, and I know they're not in the schedule, et cetera. But are you -- given those issues are you thinking about the Airbus aircraft on a more serious basis? I mean obviously, you are not because you're doing lease returns, but are you thinking about more Airbus aircraft unless Boeing aircraft or are you still kind of focused on the 73s?\nBrandon Pedersen: I want to re-introduce to you and introduce to the rest of the folks on the call, Nat Pieper. Nat's our Senior Vice President of Fleet, Finance and Alliances that sounds like a perfect opportunity for him to share his views on that.\nHelane Becker: Thanks Nat.\nNathaniel Pieper: Just a quick reminder, we of course have Airbus aircraft as well, 319s, 320s and A321 neos. It's all really part of the fleet initiatives that we've been working for some time. It's a core component of our three to five-year strategy and in the 15% margin targets. We're looking at near-term opportunities to retire inefficient aircraft, as well as longer term looking for the best aircraft for our future network. We're confident in the margin accretion possibilities, there's going to be up gauge involved, new aircraft obviously feature a step function improvement in airframe and engine technology. So we're working closely talking to manufacturers, and really hoping to bring something out here in the next handful of months. We're going to order in a financially prudent way, obviously and manage our CapEx and cash flow and end up with an airplane that we know our guests and our Alaska team mates are going to really want to fly.\nHelane Becker: I just had one follow-up question. I don't remember who talked about airport costs, but I've heard other of your peer group complain about airport costs to, but when to -- and actually Spirit, this morning they commented that airport costs should be a pass-through. So, wouldn't you -- as you think about those airport costs wouldn't you think about raising fares in those markets so that you recover some of that cost?\nBrad Tilden: I might jump in Helane. The first thing -- one of the fun things about these jobs is you get to see your own people move up and sort of move around, you see new people coming to the organization. Nat is a tremendous addition to the team. I've known Nat for -- I don't know, how long, Nat? 15 years or 20 years now and it's just delightful to have you here. I think you're making an excellent point on airport cost. Other airlines may have different perspectives, but the truth is not only airports, but a whole lot of our infrastructure needs a lot of investment and SETAC Airport as an example, our home it needs a lot of investment and we have to -- we want them to invest efficiently, we want them to build the right projects, but we've got to be their partner in there. The investments need to be made, and I think they are investments that any of us would make, if it was our home or a car or whatever. So, yes and of course we do want to find a way to recover those investments through modest increases in fares that help us sort of keep the whole value proposition together. But, I don't think SETAC's that unique. I sort of think airports all across the country need investment, and that's sort of the season we're entering. We've been in it to some extent, but I think the next 10-years 15-years we're going to be seeing this in a lot of airports.\nOperator: The next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: So you talked a lot about the 8% growth in redemption Shane, can you talk to me about your current assumptions on breakage, which I think are around 17% that seems high, how do you feel about that number right now and sort of the modern loyalty era. And all else equal, forget the P&L for a second, would you rather see that 17% breakage go down or go up?\nChris Berry: Well, this is Chris. Hi, how are you.\nHunter Keay: Okay. I already know your answer.\nChris Berry: So you know what -- Shane answered it too, but the 17%, yes, we do actually look at that on a semi-annual basis, really to say is that still falling in line with our expectations and the reality is it, we would change it, if it were materially different from that. In terms of whether we would want that higher or lower I can tell you, my answer from an accounting standpoint but it's not probably the answer from a business standpoint, so I'll let Shane if he wants to take that or Shane or Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: I'll just take that. I think, Hunter I get the accounting side and all our estimate. But, I think, at the end of the day we want the breakage to go down. If the breakage goes down, that means people are using our program and we saw a lot of volume come through this quarter. So, we want to grow it, and make it stronger and healthier. So, that's just my take on it because I think breakage goes down strength and loyalty go up.\nHunter Keay: So if that were to change, you would prefer to actually force that down whether it's a change to the policy of miles or how people use them -- giving them more opportunities to use and things like that. And in that case, you would probably have to lower your breakage assumption, but obviously for a net long-term benefit. Is that fair?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes.\nHunter Keay: And then, Brandon can you elaborate on this aircraft order strategy? What's going on with that? What do you mean by that? Is that like smoothing of capex, is that fleet types, like what do you -- what are you talking about?\nBrandon Pedersen: It's all of the above. It's just doing it in a way that makes sense, both for the needs of the fleet long term, not just today and in a way that preserves our ability to generate free cash flow and do this in a way that allows us to do other things from a capital allocation standpoint too.\nOperator: The next question will come from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg: I guess two here and I guess for Andrew. What's going on with the American relationship, it does look like maybe there is a potential. I don't know if there is a phase out as we look into 2020 or maybe the code share goes away. Can you just -- can you update us on that?\nAndrew Harrison: The reality is that after the acquisition of Virgin America that's when the fundamentals of our relationship with American actually changed. The Department of Justice said, we couldn't do certain things around code and everything else, and just given the size and overlap at the time, there was a lot of adjustments made, a couple of years ago and most of that -- all of that economics is through our system today. So really what you saw is, we still have a partnership with American just -- it's still a good partner, we're working together on our mutual interests. We still have a lounge program with them, we're still connecting guests through their Chicago hub and they are connecting folks here. But, we've really shrunk it and the footprint is smaller. I think at the highest level, which is I think a testament to Alaska Airlines a couple of years ago 15% of all of our traffic was code and into interline basically dependent. Today it's only 7%. I think that's just a testament to our ability to have grown, to cover most of the destinations where folks go, and then of course use partners where we can mutually benefit and work together.\nMichael Linenberg: And I want to make sure that you said that you're still going to continue to connect through Chicago, is that interline or is that code share because like, if I look at schedules today, I still see the Alaska code on say Denver LA, or Austin LA where it's the American metal. Does that code go away, is that going away this spring, or is that...\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. Going forward, it all winds down essentially from the Pacific Northwest. You can connect through to Chicago to about 20 destinations, and then on American you can connect through our hubs to about 20 destinations. So the code share will really basically be very, very small.\nMichael Linenberg: And then just one other question. When I think about competitive capacity in your markets, as we look into, not just this quarter and also March quarter March quarter 2020, because there has been -- you alluded to this on the call earlier, there has been a lot of network adjustment and in many cases, you know to fund -- as you mentioned the growth into the Pacific Northwest from say LA and San Fran, in some cases you pulled down a whole bunch of capacity, in some markets where there was a decent amount of competition. So, I'm curious about what that number looks like, if you have that at your fingertips for both the December quarter and March quarter 2020 what the competitive capacity is?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, competitive capacity in the fourth quarter is only up about 1.6%. The first quarter is higher than that. It's showing about 4% right now. But of course, I think the first quarter is scheduled to still influx and I'm not sure what's going to happen with schedules with the MAX and everything like that. But, I think to your point, moving around some of this capacity has in some ways reduced some of the overlap, but net-net, we're still putting roughly the same amount of seats in California. At the end of the day, we're just pointing the airplane to different places.\nOperator: The next question is from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Brad, two questions for you. I think for the last two years, you've been the only CEO in the industry, who's incentive compensation is driven in part by the airline's growth in credit cards. Can you talk a little bit about what change in terms of how you spend your time, how you manage the business before that was a metric versus after? And then, what was the motivation of the Board in making that a metric for your comp? Thank you.\nBrad Tilden: Honestly, we went to the board with that idea, following our acquisition of Virgin America, and we just realized that you didn't -- we just really believe in the all idea of building loyalty, building preference, getting people into the club and we've seen the power of that in the rest of our network, and as we bought Virgin America and moved into California it was -- I mean, it's interesting you talk about me and it's certainly true. But, what we really wanted was that in the compensation base of 23,000 people, and that's what happened. So, I think it was 10% credit card loyalty and 10% mileage plan. 10% and 10%, that's how I think also, 10% credit card and then 10% mileage plan. We just wanted the fantastic army of people at Alaska Air Group really focused on growing customers growing their loyalty, and so that is -- is that, that's what it was all about. I think the leadership team went to the board and proposed it, and the Board said, absolutely it sounds like something that will drive long-term value.\nBrandon Pedersen: And Joe, this is Brandon. Just as a reminder, we have a gain sharing plan that is consistent across all of our employees, not just the leadership, but across the front line as well. So, it really gets down to alignment.\nJoseph DeNardi: And then Brad I try and ask you this question every now and then, I'll ask it again. Just given your experience to-date with the Virgin transaction and turning that deal into value for shareholders, how successful do you think you've been and kind of in the context of your balance sheet, nearing a point where you'd be in a position to do something. Does M&A look more or less appealing now than it did before the Virgin deal? Thank you.\nBrad Tilden: Yes, thanks for giving us a chance to talk about this. We, at that time -- if you go back to when we considered this it was when we announced it was April, 2016. I think we felt like, we had an amazing economic engine, a great brand. We're really proud of our culture in the way people take care of customers, we felt really positive about the long-term prospects for the industry. But, we did feel like industry conditions were such that we just needed more real estate, and we wanted to have strength beyond Alaska, Seattle and Portland. So that was the idea behind the Virgin merger. It as you guys know, you go through life, you learn stuff. When you do stuff, you learn stuff and it was -- it was a lot of work. But, I think everyone here is feeling optimistic, we're feeling good that we're getting through it, and I think we really feel that we have materially enhanced sort of the cash producing sort of capability of this economic engine. We've enhanced career of security for our people in doing that. As you mentioned, I'm extraordinarily proud that we borrowed $2 billion to do it. You guys know, our people did it with no investment banks with no, nothing like that, they just went to the banks and borrowed $2 billion on their own and we're going to pay three quarters of it off, in three months' time, so we're really proud of the team. As we look at doing more, you know I just think, my own view of the world is it's a combination of organic growth and M&A. We've done amazing with organic growth. I'll just tell you -- and different people around this table may feel differently. But, as I look at the next few years, I sort of see the biggest opportunity us growing organically, pushing -- taking what we are proud of what we feel like we do well, and pushing it organically into markets where we're already strong.\nOperator: The next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: I want to come back to the puts and takes on the cost discussion because I actually did hear the headwinds, but maybe could you elaborate again on where you see the tailwinds on cost looking in 2020. And again, I'm not looking to get guidance from you.\nBrad Tilden: On the tailwind side, there's actually a number of those as well. First of all, we're going to be able to grow a little more next year than we've grown this year that will help. We're going to continue to work productivity, you might remember that we focus on two different things for cost control; productivity and overhead. Productivity is a huge lever going into next year. We have continued simplification of our overhead structure that's the other prong. And then, our team just did a great job on a lot of different initiatives. The supplier cost reduction campaign was one of them, and I think all of those initiatives that we worked hard to get this year's cost down will continue to bear fruit, as we go into next year as well.\nBrandon Oglenski: And it seems like the Airbus restyling how far along are you in the fleet there?\nBrad Tilden: Yes, in terms of the number of airplanes that we've reconfigured -- we'll have...\nBen Minicucci: We'll have -- so 60% of the fleet will be reconfigured by the end of the year, Brandon. This is Ben. So we have roughly 73 airplanes, we'll have 42 to 44 done by the end of the year.\nBrandon Oglenski: So if anything, we would see the benefits from that even more so in 2020. Is that correct?\nBen Minicucci: Correct.\nBrandon Oglenski: And then, I mean maybe this is just way too premature, but you guys obviously are delivering pretty decent results this year. I mean, does that make you go back to the drawing board on long-term growth because I think Brad in the past you said, if we can get into that targeted margin range, then we would think about expanding the network at a faster pace. Is that still the framework?\nBrandon Pedersen: No, we're very comfortable of 4% to 6% growth. We used to talk about 4% to 8%, 8% is pretty big on a company our size now, so 4% to 6% is a pretty good clip. And if we can grow 4% to 6% per year for over four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 years, that's a lot of growth. And we want to make sure that we can do it in a prudent way that keeps our balance sheet intact, where we can achieve our margin goals, it all needs to fit together, but we're really optimistic about our ability to grow 4% to 6% and we feel like that's the right growth rate for the time being.\nOperator: The final question is from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.\nDan Mckenzie: Just following up on that last question, it's really sort of house cleaning the 60% of the A320s that were reconfigured with the new seats, what percent of the flying does that equate to? Brandon Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc. Well, we have to have 53 A320s and on a fleet of 235 mainline airplanes.\nBen Minicucci: Dan, just a lot of the benefit from those actually comes on the revenue side, just to be frank. We're taking the first class cabin from 8 to 12, and we're going to have adding premium seats. And I think, it's anywhere from one to three extra seats per aircraft. So, it's actually more of a revenue boost than a cost one.\nShane Tackett: And so the big thing is we're moving the airplanes primarily North-South, here we're doing a lot of East West flying. Most of the airplanes as of January will be -- its north-south line, which will be more helpful, putting the Boeings and A320 Alliance transcon.\nDan Mckenzie: Going back to the prepared remarks about realizing the $330 million in incremental revenues that were targeted. What inning are we in with respect to saver fares? And I guess, how are you benchmarking to the industry at this point and I guess I'm just thinking the industry as a whole, seems to be finding more upside in this particular bucket. I'm just wondering what you guys can share.\nShane Tackett: We got these out really in full force full force in Q1 of this year. They've performed well, they performed above what we had committed to and talked about, and I don't think we've shared -- updated sort of take rate numbers or economics, but they've performed quite well. Our guess, just based on what we hear other people talk about is, we're on par, if not maybe a little better on the buyout of saver and that's really what we want. We want as few people as want to be on the actual ticket. We like the fact that people buy out more than we had originally sort of estimated. In terms the -- and I think, we've got a full quarter next year to annualize, it was only sort of partially in Q1 of this year, and then we've not really done anything to try to optimize it anymore. So, there is the potential that, after we have used it for a year, we just get smarter about how we're managing it and it's sort of a tool in the toolkit. So, there's probably more value to be had, we're not quantifying that today. I don't know if we will when we get here in January either, but it's still more upside from saver for a little while.\nDan Mckenzie: And if I could just squeeze one last one in intra-California earlier this year, I think was a headwind to revenue production, or maybe it was partially last year that's changed. I think, you highlighted in the prepared remarks it's doing well. And I'm just wondering, is this in any that's gone from being a RASM drag to a RASM tailwind at this point or how are you thinking about this piece of the network puzzle?\nAndrew Harrison: Dan, my prepared remarks were more around transcon, and we don't like to get into the details of specific regions. But what I will tell you is that this flying has also benefited from all the initiatives that we've shared with you and rolled out. And so we are seeing improved profitability across our network and including in intra-California as a result of our changes.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks Dan. Thanks everybody for tuning in. We'll talk with you again at the -- for our full year report out in January. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. This call will be available for future playback at alaskaair.com. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ALK", "quarter": 2, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-07-25 22:55:54", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, my name is Fiya, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group's Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Vice President of Finance & Controller, Chris Berry.\nChris Berry: Thank you, Fiya, and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2019 earnings call. It's good to be back with you all. In today's prepared remarks, you will hear updates from our leaders Brad Tilden, Ben Minicucci, Andrew Harrison, and Brandon Pedersen. Several other members of our management team are also here to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. This afternoon, Alaska Air Group reported second quarter GAAP net income of $262 million. Excluding merger-related costs, mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $270 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.17, ahead of the first call consensus. These results compare to adjusted net income of $206 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.66 in the second quarter of 2018. Our adjusted pretax margin expanded 300 basis points and our earnings per share grew 31%. We generated $735 million in free cash flow and we paid down an additional $140 million of debt during the quarter, bringing our total debt payment up to $1.2 billion of the $2 billion we borrowed for the Virgin America acquisition. This quarter marked great progress toward our long-term goal of 13% to 15% pretax margins. And as a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements on our expected future performance, which may differ materially from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit cost excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release. And now I'll turn the call over to Brad for his opening remarks.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks very much, Chris, and good afternoon, everybody. We're now two-and-a-half years past our acquisition of Virgin America. The vast majority of the integration work is now done and we're beginning to realize the benefits from our significantly expanded network and the synergies for bringing the two airlines together. We've integrated our work groups, our reservation system and our back office functions faster than any other major airline integration. And with our relentless focus on low fares and low costs, best-in-class customer service, the industry's most generous mileage plan, a fuel-efficient fleet, a well loved brand, and a fortressed balance sheet, we are well set up to move toward our targeted annual growth and our targeted pretax margin of 13% to 15% over the business cycle. We made great progress executing our plan this quarter with a 300-basis point improvement in our margin and we're implementing initiatives that we shared with you at our Investor Day last November to drive further margin expansion in the quarters and years ahead. As you know, we as a leadership team are fully committed to producing the right margin and returns for our owners, given the $8 billion of capital that you've invested so that we can invest in our growth and provide the right benefits for all of the people who depend on us. Our long-term formula of focusing on high productivity, high asset utilization, and low overhead is working. I want to thank our operating division leaders for their cost performance relative to plan so far this year. In fact, given solid cost savings from plan, our team was able to maintain our full-year cost guidance even after adding back the cost of new labor deals. And on that topic, we were really proud to announce two new labor deals this quarter. First, a two-year extension with our aircraft technicians which allows all of our Alaska mechanics to work on all of our mainline aircraft. And this is an agreement which has been both negotiated and ratified. And second, a five-year extension with the 5,200 employees, represented by the IAM, which is being voted upon as we speak. We're pleased to come to these agreements with the finest employees in the business and we're hopeful that the agreement with our IAM represented folks ratifies in the coming weeks. On the revenue side, I thought we also had a good result this quarter. I want to thank our teams in revenue management, e-commerce and marketing who had the best improvement in unit revenue that we've seen in the past 30 quarters. We're currently in the middle of the busy summer travel season, and our people are running an excellent operation and taking great care of our guests. Genuine and caring service is what makes Alaska different and we're also proud of our 22,000 folks at Alaska and Horizon for earning their 12th consecutive JD Power Award, along with other recognition we've received from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Cardenas, Travel & Leisure, WalletHub and many more. It's clear that our folks are doing a terrific job. The JD Power Award is especially gratifying this year as we passed the 800 point mark for the first time in our history. And as it was the final award in the traditional network category, carrier category as the categories have changed going forward. Our results for the first half of the year make us optimistic about the rest of 2019 and beyond. As you all know, we're running our business so that this will be a great place for our people to work, a great place for our customers to fly, and very importantly, a great place for our owners to invest. We've got more work to do to execute our plan and we are fully focused on getting that work done. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter, total revenues grew 6.1% to $2.3 billion and a 1% increase in capacity as unit revenues increased 5.2%, well ahead of our initial guide of 3.5%. Our pretax margin was 15.8%, 300 basis points better than prior year and our adjusted earnings per share improved 31%. As Brad mentioned, we still have plenty of work ahead of us, but the momentum is encouraging. For example, the recently ratified transition agreement and integrated seniority list with our technicians brings our Boeing and Airbus mechanics together and provides a two-year extension giving our technicians in the Company more certainty through 2023. The agreement recognizes the high caliber of our maintenance team with pay increases, signing bonus, and enhance productivity. This integrated agreement is a significant milestone at Alaska, as we now have joint agreements and integrated seniority list with all of our work groups, and less than three years from the date we acquired Virgin America. It is a huge accomplishment and allows us to come together as one team, continue to build on our a strong culture and fully leverage the synergies we planned from the acquisition. I also want to thank our 5,200 IAM represented employees for their absolute professionalism over the past several months, as we've finalized the recently announced tentative agreement for a new five-year collective bargaining agreement. With our last deal signed over five years ago, this group was the furthest out of market amongst all of our labor groups and represents about 25% of our employees. We won't know the results of the vote for a few more weeks but I'm excited to get these well deserved raises and improvements to our folks who represent Alaska so well and deliver outstanding guest service day in and day out. These two agreements will increase our wages and benefit costs by approximately $50 million annually, and about $48 million this year, including one-time signing bonuses and other costs of approximately $24 million. The impact of these new agreements is included in our cost guidance today. We are pleased to come to these agreements and we want to thank the IAM and AMFA for their continued partnership as we work together to provide great wages and benefits for our people and set the stage for a successful financial future. Our focus over the next few years is on implementing the initiatives on our road map to build brand strength, improve our product and guest experience and to strengthen our financial muscle as we strive toward a best-in-class investment for long-term owners. Looking back on the second quarter, here are some of our biggest accomplishments. First, as Brad mentioned, our employees were awarded with our 12th consecutive JD Power Award, a true testament to the exceptionalism of our people. I couldn't be more proud of the hard work they put in every day to take care of our guests and run a great operation. Second, we are now realizing the full run rate of the $330 million of revenue initiatives and synergies we launched over the last several months. This includes the increased benefit from the cross-fleeting of our higher gauge lower unit cost Boeing aircraft into the most capacity constrained markets with overflow demand. We should see the biggest impact from these changes during the peak summer travel season in Q3. Third, we completed the painting on all of our Airbus aircraft and we are 25% through the interior renovations, which will provide more premium seating and increased revenue per aircraft. Fourth, after a rough operational start to the year, due to the Pacific Northwest storms, we have claimed our way back to first place year-to-date for on-time departures and second-place in DOT on-time arrivals and I'd be happy to address the nuance of these two measures in Q&A. For the second quarter, we were first among the top carriers in both of these categories. And on the regional side, Horizon is topping the leader board when it comes to operational performance, number one in the regional industry year-to-date by a wide margin. I want to give a shout out to the entire team at Horizon for a complete turnaround in their performance over the past couple of years. Each of these along with the everyday accomplishments of our teams across the Company is pushing us to be better tomorrow than we are today. We talk a lot of run here about turning the dial, a little each day to make incremental improvements. We are always pushing ourselves to be better. So as we continue to turn the dial and with the win now at our back, I'm confident in our team's ability to outperform. And with that, I will turn the call over to Andrew for his commercial updates.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks Ben. And good afternoon, everyone. My comments this afternoon will focus on the second quarter revenue performance, guest-facing initiatives and revenue guidance for the third quarter. The 5.2% improvement in unit revenues was a welcome result of what was a volatile revenue environment in the first quarter and represents our best unit revenue improvement over the past seven years and our best absolute Q2 RASM in the past three years. Industry pricing stabilized for the most part as we ended the second quarter, which included the dissipation of low close-in fares. As we ended this year, we had a goal of outperforming industry RASM by approximately 200 basis points. We beat industry RASM by approximately 190 basis points this quarter. Ex-MAX related unit revenue outliers for some carriers, our revenue initiatives and synergies delivered on that goal. Breaking Q2 down further, I'd like to provide a bit more detail on the year-over-year unit revenue increase. First, in terms of challenges. Although not as impactful as the first quarter, we continue to see softness in Hawaii pricing due to the significant year-over-year growth in overlapping weighted competitive capacity of 6% to 7%. We also saw increased industry capacity from the Lower 48 into the State of Alaska putting some pressure on our long-haul Alaska yields. This competitive capacity continues through the peak summer period. These two regions represent about 22% of our system, with unit revenues negatively impacted by about 50 basis points, which is less than what we had originally guided to. Turning to the positive, our strong unit revenue performance was driven by the following key areas. First, our synergies and initiatives continue to ramp and they reached their full run rate during this quarter. These initiatives improved our Q2 RASM by 350 basis points, which we guided to on our first quarter call with Saver fares the largest contributor to this improvement. We continue to feel confident in the $330 million of combined 2019 initiatives and synergies we guided to at Investor Day last November. Second, we had tailwinds of about 100 basis points from the Easter shift and another 100 basis points from changes in our award redemption structure that had negatively impacted RASM in Q2 last year after our reservation system cut-over when redemptions got away from us. Third, underlying pricing stabilized and steadily improved through the quarter. Nine of our 11 operating regions representing 88% of our capacity experienced positive year-over-year unit revenues including California transcon markets that were significantly impacted by pricing actions in Q1. A quick note on transcon markets. I want to thank all of our operational and commercial teams that have rallied around improving our performance in this region. We've made several changes including more focused marketing, cross-fleeting and a concerted effort to improve both cancel rights and on-time performance. Most importantly, our station and in-flight crews have been focused on delivering consistently great guest service, all to help improve the financial performance and guest experience of these important routes and it's working. Although we have a ways to go, we did experience significant improvement in RASM and double-digit increases in California transcon margins year-over-year and we see continued momentum as we head into Q3. And lastly, we continue to see strength in our loyalty revenues, which increased 5.7% on flat passengers. The percentage of our flyers during the quarter that were Mileage Plan members and credit cardholders improved 2.7 points and 1.2 points respectively, which is very encouraging. As we mentioned in previous calls, the commercial team is focused on a number of network and product enhancements this year that our guests have embraced. First, our Alaska Global Partners network is expanding again with our new partnership with EL AL with new direct flights out of San Francisco to Tel Aviv. This is in addition to the direct service to Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore and Dublin and have all been added or announced from Seattle by our partners. With our 17 global partners, our Mileage Plan members can earn and redeem miles to more than 900 destinations worldwide. Second, as Ben mentioned, we are installing new cabin interiors on our Airbus and 737-700 aircraft that both align and improve the guest experience. We've completed 25 so far. Each Airbus renovation increases total seat count and builds in a greater mix of First and Premium Class seats. These are beautiful aircraft and our guest reaction has been extremely positive. Third, we have now completed satellite Wi-Fi installation on 44 of our mainline aircraft and the feedback from our guess has just been fantastic. This, along with our in-flight entertainment boasting the most movies in the sky, provides our guests with a top-notch in-flight experience. In fact, our entire regional jet fleet is also equipped with Wi-Fi and on-board entertainment. And finally, two weeks ago, we opened Phase 1 of a stunning new wing of the North Satellite terminal here in Seattle featuring our new 16,000 square foot flagship lounge for our guests. We've also started construction on a rooftop lounge in San Francisco that we expect to open next year. So looking to Q3, our capacity growth picks up modestly to approximately 3% and our Q3 RASM guidance our range is 2% to 5% reflecting the benefit of our many revenue initiatives and merger synergies, our expectation of stable pricing through the peak summer season, offset by continued pressures we are seeing in Hawaii and long-haul Alaska flying that I mentioned earlier. We are designing our product, network and revenue management processes to enable growth with the financial objective to achieve our 13% to 15% long-term pretax margin goals. In fact, we recently announced that we are implementing a new state-of-the-art Amadeus Revenue Management system, which will be fully deployed by next year - by the middle of next year and will result in better revenue performance in our 2020 and beyond. With the structural changes we've made to our revenue model, we continue to feel confident in our 2019 objective to outperform industry RASM and look forward to building on this solid platform for used accounts. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.\nBrandon Pedersen: Thanks Andrew, and good afternoon, everybody. Our second quarter adjusted net profit of $270 million and earnings per share of $2.17 were both 31% better than the second quarter of 2018. This marks our second consecutive year-over-year improvement in quarterly margins and is the largest year-over-year margin increase since Q2 of 2016. It's evidence that our plan to improve returns is working. Andrew touched on the revenue performance. So I'll touch on cost performance for Q2 and the outlook for the rest of 2019. We set up this year with an aggressive plan to keep unit cost growth to between 2% and 2.5% on a roughly 2% increase in capacity, no small task given the cost pressures we faced and before the impact of any new labor deals. Teams across the Company have risen to the occasion and managed costs in the first half of the year in such a way that we've been able to maintain full-year cost guidance that falls at the low end of our initial range even after absorbing the impact of the AMFA and IAM deals that Ben talked about. These agreements will add approximately $50 million annually, with approximately $48 million impacting this year, including $24 million in the back half of this year base wages and $24 million in signing bonuses that we expect to pay in Q3. For the full year, we now expect non-fuel unit cost to grow by 2.2% all in. Looking at the quarter, unit cost ex-fuel rose by 2.3%, much better than our initial guidance of plus 5%, much of the beat is solid execution, although some of the outperformance as a result of certain costs shifting to the back half of 2019. Pilot training costs are a great example, as cross bidding between mainline fleet types is now happening, but a little later than expected, this will put pressure on pilot productivity shifting up to $15 million of training cost into Q3 and Q4, from the first half of the year. Nevertheless, we continue to see encouraging improvements in productivity and our ability to control overhead costs. Let me provide a few examples. First, Horizon's overall productivity measured by passengers per FTE is up 3.3% this quarter and unit cost ex-fuel are down 16% on 20% capacity growth. Productivity in the Flight Ops Division is a particularly bright spot as training costs have declined significantly and hard time has improved, especially on the E175. I want to congratulate the Horizon team on these fantastic results. Second, as we mentioned on our last call, our supply chain team has been working a plan to lower prices we pay to our vendor partners. The results have been outstanding. We expect to save more than $30 million this year positively impacting costs across many divisions. A third example relates to flight attendant premium pay. During the transition, we had a heavy reliance on premium pay to make sure our flights were all covered. Today, our in-flight team is having to use much less of it because of a much more normalized operation and better processes in the department. And finally, overhead is down by more than $15 million or about 5% so far this year. Over the last year, we've made changes to the size of our management staff not only to save payroll costs but more importantly to improve our speed and agility and reduce the number of layers between our leaders and both our customers and our frontline employees. These changes are important as we seek to more positively and tightly manage our Company towards the future that we are seeking. Looking to Q3, we expect CASM to be up approximately 5% on a 3% increase in capacity, which given our full year guidance would imply a 1.2% decline in unit costs in the fourth quarter. The third quarter increase reflects the cost shifts I mentioned, timing of expected variable pay accruals and the impact of the new labor agreements, including our expectation that we'll pay as I said earlier $24 million in one captive time cost during the quarter. July marks the beginning of our annual planning process. As we think about 2020, we're mindful of our need to continue to aggressively manage our unit costs in a way that maintains or expands our competitive cost mode versus the legacy carriers. Doing so ensures that we can offer low fares, grow, and achieve our 13% to 15% long-term margin target. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. Total cash flow from operations for the first six months of the year was nearly $1.1 billion ex-merger related costs, while net CapEx was $330 million. This resulted in $735 million of free cash flow again ex-integration costs which was nearly $400 million higher than the first six months of 2018. At consensus, full-year operating cash flow would be about $1.5 billion and free cash flow would be about $775 million assuming CapEx of $725 million this year. That's more than 3 times the amount we produced in 2018, the result of the direct outcome of our decision in early 2018 to reduce capital spending in order to improve free cash flow. We've produced free cash flow now for nine years in a row and positive operating cash flow for more than 30 consecutive years. Maintaining this track record of positive free cash flow is an important part of our capital allocation strategy. A fortressed balance sheet was also a hallmark for this Company - of this Company for many years and we're quickly back to that - moving quickly back to that position. We've repaid $280 million in debt so far this year, including some repayments that were made in June that will offset with some new borrowings in the third quarter as part of our broader effort to take advantage of the low rate environment, lower our borrowing costs, and move to more fixed rate debt, given the tight spreads and inverted yield curve. I want to give a shout out to our treasury team for the work they've been doing and thank our banking partners who have adjusted rates downward. We're on pace to reduce our debt balance by about $350 million in 2019 and we've already paid off $1.2 billion of the $2 billion we borrowed for the merger. With leases, our quarter-end adjusted debt-to-cap stood at 45% and we're on track to end the year at about 42% and reach our 40% goal sometime in 2020. We have 100 unencumbered Boeing NGs and Embraer E175s and $400 million of undrawn lines of credit. We have returned $110 million to our owners via the dividend and share repurchases, we set a plan to return $220 million to shareholders this year and will hit it, which is a nice way to close. You've heard today, a number of examples of where we set a plan and we're executing on it. The results are encouraging. We're delivering industry-leading operational performance and our customer service is award winning. On the financial side, we have revenue and cost momentum and our balance sheet is strong and if we continue to execute our plan we'll be in the top quartile in the industry for profit margins, balance sheet strength, and free cash flow generation. And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: A bit of an unfair question because you just look to be delivering a really good 2019 on the cost side, but what have you done for me lately, just as we think about 2020, I wonder if you can walk through some of the headwinds and tailwinds that you're seeing in 2019 and how they progress through 2020?\nBrandon Pedersen: Savi, it's Brandon. I'll start and then maybe Shane can jump in. That's a super important question as we start to think about the 2020 plan. As I mentioned, we're already waiting into that process. We recognize that low costs are a super important competitive advantage that we've had for a long time and will continue to be an important competitive advantage as we go forward. And it's going to be a big part of us getting to our 13% to 15% margin goal. A lot of the initiatives that we have in place will provide benefit into 2020, we walked through a bunch of that at Investor Day, I think we've got a lot of momentum as I said on that stuff. Shane, you want to?\nShane Tackett: I might only add something. I'll be a little generic. I think the biggest sort of specific challenge we have going forward is just all these lease returns. There's a lot of complexity that goes along with that. However, there is a lot of opportunity to continue to save cost out of the operation and out of the Company. There's tons of stuff we can do on productivity, utilization all of those things we talked about at Investor Day, we really haven't fully tapped yet. I would say this year is really more about getting the muscle to manage costs back and in the next couple of years, it's starting to manage those down more aggressively.\nSavi Syth: And then on the network side. This unit revenue guide is really good. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about as you understand the network changes and how that's affecting your seasonality - if we should know - now how we should think about if those kind of you're going to have a peak year summers here and 1Q being kind of a much weaker, how we should think about kind of the network and how that affects the quarters?\nAndrew Harrison: Savi, it's Andrew. I think this comes back to opportunity and when we acquired Virgin America it actually made us more peakey, now Q1 and Q4 were deeper problems in Q2 and Q3 were stronger. So what you'll see is sort of the traditional pattern, Q2 and Q3 very solid, Q1 being the worst, and I think as we move forward as we look at our network for 2020, we are working hard on how we make Q1 much more balanced and much stronger going forward.\nSavi Syth: And so not necessarily in place for 1Q '20 but just going forward, is that fair?\nAndrew Harrison: There's already changes being implemented in the first quarter and we're continuing to finalize those. So we are in the process.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: You spoke enthusiastically about loyalty in the quarter. I assume that was a consolidated observation, why wouldn't it have been. Would you be willing to discuss loyalty returns - loyalty returns, excuse me, in the Seattle market specifically. I'm obviously curious if you're losing any share there as your primary competitor pushes its own loyalty scheme. I've got to imagine California is what's really driving aggregate loyalty improvement, but I'm curious if Seattle is declining?\nAndrew Harrison: This is Andrew. Thanks for your question. Although we don't normally talk on specifics, what I can tell you without absolute question is that the Pacific Northwest loyalty continues full steam ahead. Certainly we have a lower base in California and the percentage-wise increases are obviously larger there, but actually all of the things that have been going on has just only pushed us to work harder and stronger here in the Pacific Northwest. And we continue to see solid growth in Mileage Plan members and credit cards and revenues in the Pacific Northwest.\nJamie Baker: Excellent. Second question, I know there have been several industry attempts to raise Hawaii fares as of late, as near as I could tell, they have not succeeded. Is that the correct interpretation? Or did we get some fare increases during the quarter? I'm just curious if there is any cause for pricing optimism, given that you're still calling that out - that market out as challenged as a RASM headwind in the quarter?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, I think for - on the Hawaii side, there has been marginal attempts at pushing things up a little bit. There has been nothing major at all. I think what really we're fighting here is significant seat increases year-over-year in this marketplace. And so, but we are filling the airplanes although you know at cheaper fares. But again, that's one of the assets that we have here with First Class, Premium Class and new Saver Fare product, all of these things are working to help, in some cases, overcome some of the softness in the fares.\nOperator: The next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Given your informal outlook Brandon for north of 6 bucks and free cash flow this year, what would you need to see to get more aggressive again on the buyback?\nBrandon Pedersen: You just did the math based on the numbers I used in the script?\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes, sir.\nBrandon Pedersen: Here's what I would say is we've been really focused on what we've called re-deleveraging the balance sheet, as I said in my prepared remarks, a fortressed balance sheet has really been a hallmark of this company for a long time. Our balance sheet is super, super strong. I think right now we're really going to keep deploying capital to getting the balance sheet to exactly where we want it, and then think about broader return to shareholders once we get there.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: You've been very clear and consistent on that. And then just for my follow-up piqued my interest with the Amadeus RM system upgrade middle of next year. What specific capabilities do you think this will provide for you? And is there any sort of transition risk around that as you rotate over to that system? Thanks.\nAndrew Harrison: This is Andrew. That's a great question. We always worry about transition risk. We're working off honestly 20-year-old technology and we've had to design and build a lot of technical reports to manage around that. So this will be next generation state of the art. It will also allow us to do O&D pricing, which today we just don't have any capabilities for and it's also going to be allow our analysts and our teams to be much more focused on the macro matters, and the system will take off a lot of the heavy lifting there doing at the individual analyst level, so we can get better results. So we'll talk to you more about that as we move into 2020, it's an initiative we have real revenues tied to that. We're not ready to share that yet. And then on the revenue risk is always risk, but the team has a fantastic plan as they are going to start to layer in markets independent from the system, so a little bit of an overlap, if you will. And so we're going to do this in a measured cautious manner, so that we don't expose ourselves to any real significant revenue risk.\nBrandon Pedersen: We're not going to go to true or O&D pricing out of the gate, we'll stick with - change vendors but go to segment pricing and then in time, we'll move to a --\nAndrew Harrison: O&D will be later on when we are ready to pull the trigger on that and we'll start with certain regions and will turn those on, in the new system and then we'll just continue to roll them out.\nOperator: The next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: So just a couple of questions on your cost outlook here. First, I wanted to clarify, does your CASM outlook include the signing bonus from your recent contract gratification, meaning you're not as seen as special item some of your peers do?\nBrandon Pedersen: Cathy, it's Brandon. Yes, our cost guidance includes the signing bonus.\nCatherine O'Brien: So - there are my math. The new rates and the signing bonus are about 90 basis point headwind here to your CASM outlook for the year. So I mean and in your new CASM outlook including that is only 10 basis points better than what you were previously forecasting. So I guess what's driving that improvement, I think my math that leaves most of that made up in the June quarter. I know you guys talked about a few things that are trending better than expected. But in the back half, is there an opportunity to see some of that cost strength continue and maybe even trend down, despite the new deal?\nShane Tackett: Cathy, it's Shane. Thanks for the question. I'll sort of reiterate what you said and what we said on the prepared remarks. The team did a fantastic job managing costs in Q1 and Q2. I think we may have even surprised ourselves a little bit how well we managed them. And I think that if we continue to do that, there is opportunity in the back half of the year. There are some costs that we know are shifting, Brandon mentioned those, some of the pilot training costs and a few other areas, but we're still seeing real strength on managing overhead, managing productivity, managing selling expenses, as an example, in the quarter, revenues were up 6%, selling expenses were down 3% which is just a really wonderful result. Usually those correlate together and go up at the same rate. So we're finding areas to marginally improve the Company all over the place and we'll continue to mind that in the second half.\nCatherine O'Brien: It really impressive because, at least, on my math fully offset just by the June quarter better performance there, the new deal. And then maybe one for Andrew. We keep hearing about how Saver fares is trending better than expected, but I don't think we've officially gotten a raise that $100 million annual target. Any comments still waiting for more testing there or should we be expecting [indiscernible] there at some point?\nAndrew Harrison: Katie, I would not hold your breath because we don't plan on giving out specifics and updating that other than to tell you that the 330 that we shared, we feel very solid about. Saver fares has actually performed better than we had thought, some others a little bit less though, but we're just going to stick to the high level numbers versus go into all the details, but it's doing very, very well for us.\nOperator: The next question will come from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRajeev Lalwani: Andrew, a couple of straightforward questions for you. As far as the MAX, what sort of benefit or impact are you seeing there, whether it's in your third quarter guide or your second quarter guide? And then your latest read on competitive capacity and how that's trending? And then finally, any color on development markets and maturity there and whether or not there is much more opportunity ahead of you?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, thanks. The best way for me to talk about the MAX is just to really look at the industry seats and what we're dealing with and as is very public knowledge we saw a number of closer in pull downs by carriers to accommodate the MAX. So we've sort of been a recipient of that. If you look forward though, our competitive capacity on a weighted basis is actually down 0.7% in the third quarter. And again I think that's in no small part to the industry capacity coming down, which I think brings good things for everybody when capacity discipline is carried out that way. The other thing I would tell you is that on the new markets in the maturity, we still have, we've seen really good improvement. Some were on average I think up to about 85% of normalized yield and they continue to improve and a little bit some of the California markets especially so. So there is still upside for us as we continue to mature these markets.\nCatherine O'Brien: Can you quantify maybe that last one. I mean, how much you've seen so far or how much more there is to go?\nBrad Tilden: As it relates to the guide no, what I think, what we continue to want to see in our developing markets, which were much smaller percentage of our network now, but we still want to see high single to double-digit unit in our revenue increases in those markets, but I don't have a dollar figure our RASM number to quantify that for you.\nOperator: The next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: So, I had two questions. My first question is related to what field and what are you doing there and will you not be serving that market anymore? Is that the way to think about it?\nAndrew Harrison: Helane, this is Andrew. No, we are absolutely serving Love Field. I think what's got little confusing on all of that, is that, we have as you know there's a lawsuit going on. I'll let Kyle touch on that in the second, but we have to gauge there, there is a lawsuit going on and we have 13 flights a day. What we've done is, there is uncertainty around how that lawsuits going to end up on what's happening. So, we had scheduled more flights. So, what we're doing is holding to our 13 flights a day. What we're doing is concentrating now on full markets, which is Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. And that's sort of what we are going to be flying here for the foreseeable future. Then Kyle, did you want to comment?\nKyle Levine: Sure, hi Helane. Yeah, the litigation really just applauds on, it scheduled to go to trial in September, we'll see if that sticks or not. In the meantime the judge has been very active and keeping up settlement discussions among the carriers and the city and I'm afraid to say there so far not been much progress there although people are talking.\nHelane Becker: Okay, and then my second question was on transcon. So I think in the first quarter that was a kind of a problem and I didn't hear you mentioned whether that was improved in the second quarter and how that looks for the summer?\nKyle Levine: Thanks Helane. Yeah, it was, it was a real problem in the first quarter and in the prepared remarks and just what we've been sharing as we are very, very encouraged with what's happened there. We have significant unit revenue increases in those during the second quarter was pricing stabilized that's continued into the third and we have seen double-digit margin increases in those transcon routes and in part, notable part that our employees of really rallied around those markets, around the guest service both in the aircraft, on the ground, we're making sure the satellite flights get on there, SoC has done a magnificent job getting the 99.5% completion rate, so we are just all in focusing on the guest experience and it's making a difference.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then, could I just follow that up with one MAX question. Would you consider keeping A320s to backfill the MAX?\nBrandon Pedersen: Helane, this is Brandon. I'll take that one. You know, we have three A319 plus 320 airplanes that are due to be return between now and the end of 2020 and we're going to stick with that for the time being. Those are already in process to one degree or another. We do have MAX is coming in next year, our MAX exposure was pretty darn small, we were supposed to get three in the last few months of this year. It's perhaps one now. Those two that we are not going to get this year, will probably come if things play out like we're hearing they might play out in the first quarter. So, the capacity issue for us isn't nearly as acute as it is for some other MAX operators.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes. Hey, Andrew, you called out the improvement in pricing indicated it's stabilized and improved through the quarter, could you just give us maybe some additional color to show how things trended and then is that continuing, that trajectory continuing into the third quarter?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, I think really around the pricing environment, I would say it's - our biggest problem is obviously close in fares and business fares, we're very, very low during the first quarter. So those are substantially going away in a stabilized. The fare environment I would say in a number of areas are still sort of down a little bit year-over-year, but stable and again, the way we've overcome that of course is with all these new revenue initiatives and a lot of the changes we're making to the business. So, for me personally, the way I would describe the fair environment for Alaska is one of stability and we are working with that and we're not seeing any real changes in demand and demand continue is actually to be quite robust.\nMichael Linenberg: And then just the second question. And Andrew, this is to you as well. I realize it's early with the Paine Field operation, but how has the start-up been and when you look at the clientele, are these passengers who formerly flew out of Seattle, are they, are they new customers, may be coming from other carriers, what can you make of the Paine Field start-up, just curious about how it's going.\nAndrew Harrison: I don't remember about, starting, you know, what we did in Pain with eight new markets and starting off with 18 frequencies has been quite amazing, other than Portland and Seattle, we probably got a little too much, excuse me, Paine port and we got to probably a little too much capacity there. But on the whole, all of these markets are well into our average load factors now and the yield is working its way up. And I think we couldn't be more impressed and excited with how the startup of that operation only after three months has gone. I will say that we probably seen a lot of our non-frequent flyers actually are flying at a Paine Field on, my initial got would be a lot of the loyal customers will and they are, some habits are hard to break. But what's really exciting is we're seeing a lot of non-core loyalty members taking advantage of the close location of Paine Field and demand has been very, very good.\nOperator: The next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Brandon, you sound very excited today by the way, I just want to mentioned that, and appreciate you guys not pulling out the signing bonuses special item that's really good stuff, it's noticed. I do have a question for you on selling expenses. I know this is Shane or Brandon. How is it down so much? I know that some of that's accounting reclassification but even if you take that away adjusted. It's still down by tens of millions of dollars over the last couple of years. Is this something you like renegotiated with Virgin? What are you doing to get that down? How much more is there to go? Thanks.\nShane Tackett: Hunter, this is Shane, yeah, you pretty much noted, we did get an opportunity to renegotiate a lot of deals that Virgin had that got closer. Our rates and a lot of those cases we are able to actually bring our rates down at the same time, so that stuff that has taken place over the last year or two, it includes not only the cost of distributing tickets like through travel agencies and GSSs and medic partners but also our core passenger service system. We basically renegotiated all of those in the last three years are really attractive rates of the Company.\nHunter Keay: So there is such a thing as a merger synergy then?\nShane Tackett: There you go.\nHunter Keay: Okay, good. And this is a little bit more of a high-level question, but I know if you've noticed, but the market to Hawaii has changed a lot over the last 10 years and there's a lot more sort of long-haul narrowbody fine with neo's and for time MAX is where, there's more outer Island destinations being served from smaller communities that was not previously really able to do without these neotechnology and MAX technology. I feel we're starting to see that a little bit in Alaska. You mentioned some overflow of Seattle, you're seeing American put for example a 321 neo at a Phoenix into in the Anchorage, are you prepared for this? How are you thinking about over fly being a permanent issue as more Airlines get the neo's, and are you prepared to sort of cannibalize your own connecting traffic with the MAX\u2019s if you need to do that sort of like Hawaiian is doing with their neo's.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, I do Hunter, it's actually, you're observation is spot on. I think the way that we look at it is, the opportunity for others is the same equal opportunity for us. I mean we fly all of those East Coast destinations from Seattle. We have a strong, obviously network actually in the state of Alaska including strong feed. We fly into Chicago. So I think a couple of things. I think there could be opportunity for us going forward, given the aircraft type to do some of that our self. There will be occasions where there is true over fly and traffic that we might have challenges getting, but at the end of the day, we have a very, very strong network up there, a very, very strong loyalty proposition, and we will continue to fly where Alaskans need to go on a non-stop basis and as we go forward.\nBrad Tilden: Yeah, Hunter, something like two out of three Alaskans are members of our Mileage Plan. And I would agree with Andrew, if there is a desire for more longer distance flying into Alaska hubs, we should be competing for that. The other thing I'd just note is just the relationship between the economies in the State of Alaska and in Seattle in particular is extraordinarily close, whether it's government, or fishing, or timber, or whatever, tourism whatever industry we might be talking about, a lot of those business connections are here. If someone doesn't want to go to Houston for oil or something like that, that's a customer that we are going to have to compete for if they're doing mortgages since flight. But I think a lot of it actually is Seattle business.\nAndrew Harrison: And a lot of it's just really just been in the peak summer season as well.\nBrad Tilden: That's exactly right.\nOperator: The next question is from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Andrew, just on RASM performance in 2Q, up about 5%, 3.5 points or so from the initiatives. So 1% increase in capacity led to maybe a 0.5 increase in core PRASM if you want to call it that, like why is that a good result? Why isn't there more traction in PRASM given your kind of modest capacity growth?\nAndrew Harrison: I mean, the way the simplistic way I look at this is, firstly, what we've committed to, is number one, we want to grow unit revenues in line with the industry and the industry also has initiatives and revenue initiatives in there and if you look at our revenue and synergies that's about 400 basis points. So what we're really saying is we're going to grow at the right, the industry is that includes their initiatives, plus another 200 basis points on top of that. So that's how we are thinking. We think that's a very strong result. I'll also, I think our stage length increased by about 1.5% during the second quarter, which also puts downward pressure on unit revenues and we're also seeing significant increase in stage length, even in the regional business as well as their mix gets more, a little bit long haul. So overall, and then the last thing I'll just point to is our margin. We have close to a 16% margin for the second quarter and we have powder left in both our cost and revenues. So overall, what you're seeing is a track that we're headed to a 13% to 15% margins and so you're right, it can be better and it will be better as we continue to move this thing forward.\nJoseph DeNardi: And then, Andrew, I guess I was a little bit surprised given how important revenue generation is doing airline business that you're using 20-year-old technology. I would have thought that that his upgraded a little bit more frequently, so why is that? And what is the revenue opportunity from that?\nAndrew Harrison: So again, we have a system. And again, it's just all priorities. And I think when we acquired Virgin America, much of what we're looking here massive step change in the size and complexity of our business. So we definitely it's time for a new system. We will be sharing with you as part of our outlook for 2020 what our revenue initiatives will be, including the revenues there. So we're not prepared to speak to those today.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes. And is it material?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, yes it is.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nBrad Tilden: Its revenue management, leadership, analyst and we have the top-notch commercial analytics team that that makes up maybe a little bit for us upgrading the systems.\nBrandon Pedersen: And it's all it's with the vendor where we\u2019ve now, it's not like to have an updated software, but it's a new platform that we are moving to. Good. I think Kevin Crissey might be next.\nOperator: Kevin Crissey with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nKevin Crissey: Yes, thank you very much. And I just continue on with the Amadeus quickly, why choose Amadeus is my understanding is it the best aspect of that is the international component, does that suggest maybe a more of an international focus going forward or was there some other reason for that vendor selection? Thank you.\nAndrew Harrison: Without going into details. We did a very starrer RFP looking at all the vendors and it came down to cost, it came down to capabilities, it came down to what our RM Team needed and wanted for our network today and our future network. So that's, that was the decision.\nBrad Tilden: But to be clear, I don't think new international service. I don't think that was a big driver.\nAndrew Harrison: Not long haul service, no.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatt Wisniewski: This is actually Matt Wisniewski on for Brandon. So I know it's early for 2020. But as growth starts to ramp in next year, I mean, turn to a return to growth. I'm wondering if you could share any kind of attributes on what are the priorities for growth are and what, how we should be looking at that. And then as a secondary in the context of the 4% to 6% growth how much flexibility would there potentially be in that, specifically in the context of the margin targets? Thanks.\nBrad Tilden: Matt, it's Brad I might jump in here. I think the first priority, we've got just in the incredible economic engine in the Pacific Northwest. So the first priority would be feeding that engine and doing everything we need to do to sort of defend and grow markets out of the state of Washington, in the state of Alaska, the state of Oregon. I think the second priority we've got some important new geography in the State of California and San Francisco and LAX, in particular, I think it would be doing the flying that we need to do in those markets to provide just the important base utility for business travelers and others in those markets. And I think after that. I think there are. And Andrew sort of hinted at this. There's opportunities for us to do a better job of connecting the different parts of our network in strategic ways. And so I think that would be the third priority. Finally, we've always got an opportunity to make sure when we have multiple frequencies in a city pair to make sure those flights are well timed to make sure that we're flying back and forth from the West Coast to the middle of the country that are times are friendly to West Coast customers. So, those are in my own mind, those are sort of that would be sort of a top to bottom sort of priority about how we would think about future growth. Sounds like Matt might be off the line.\nMatt Wisniewski: No, thank you. I appreciate it. That's really helpful.\nOperator: The final question is from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.\nDan McKenzie: And not many as question as well, presumably that gives you more merchandizing capability versus what you have today. Is that a fair characterization?\nShane Tackett: Dan, it's Shane. I'll just take this, because I have them to be the person who installed the merchandising system. We actually have one. We use fare today. Amadeus has a really good one as well. We're super happy with our partnership with Fair Logics as well, but if there was an opportunity to move to Amadeus. We could do that, but we've got a really good robust merchandising platform today.\nDan McKenzie: The other sort of technical question here with respect to the increased premium seats coming from the reseat, the Airbus, can you revenue manage these seats real time as they come online or is there some conservatism on that until you reach a critical mass, either in terms of aircraft or as you think about the plaintiffs?\nShane Tackett: Dan, this Shane again, I launched PC. So I guess, I'll take this one too. The only real conservatism is making sure that if we sell the seat the PC seat shows up. As you know, we don't really assign a specific shell to a market until we're closer in. So trying to sell a seat six months ahead of when we actually assign the aircraft that's always, that's the calculus, we try to go through. So there is a little bit of a ramp up period as these come online, but it doesn't take that long for us to be able to, to pre-sell through the entire window.\nDan McKenzie: So on a new aircraft comes on these premium seats maybe don't sell at a premium for like the first month or how would you characterize the delay?\nShane Tackett: Yes, the way we do it, just not to get too technical , but we have like 20 planes coming then we might sell 10 planes worth for about a quarter and then the next quarter we'd sell 15 planes worth next quarter we sell 20 planes worth so might take two or three quarters to burn in.\nDan McKenzie: And then one final question here, I wonder if you could talk about the Airbnb restrictions that were recently passed in Hawaii. How are you thinking that might or might not impact travel to or demand to Hawaii?\nShane Tackett: Yes, I think you know we like everyone are watching that, I think, my understanding is about 5,000 units of inventory coming offline for a Hawaii only. It may result in people flying to the other islands for a better availability and costs and we flight all of those four islands. But again, that's something we'll be watching over time. Our bigger focus obviously is how many seats going into Hawaii, because at the end of the day, Hawaii is about supply and demand.\nBrad Tilden: Okay. I think we're not going to hear from the operator again. Thanks everybody for tuning in today for our second quarter call. We look forward to speaking with you all again in 90 days time. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. This call will be available for future playback at alaskaair.com. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ALK", "quarter": 1, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-04-25 23:01:44", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Catherine, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Matt Grady.\nMatt Grady: Thanks, Catherine. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2019 earnings call. In today's prepared remarks, you will hear updates from our CEO, Brad Tilden; our President and COO, Ben Minicucci; our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen. Several other members of our management team are also on hand to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. This afternoon, Alaska Air Group reported first quarter GAAP net income of $4 million. Excluding merger-related costs, mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments and special charges, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $21 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.17 ahead of the first call consensus. These results compare to adjusted net income of $18 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.14 in the first quarter of 2018. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on Risk Factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release. And now I will turn the call over to Brad for his opening remarks.\nBradley Tilden: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Though we still got a lot of work to do to get our business performing as we would like, we're encouraged by the progress we made in the first quarter. Last quarter and at our Investor Day in November, we discussed our multiyear plan to produce profit margins averaging 13% to 15% over the business cycle. We also discussed our intent to achieve those margins by improving performance in the controllable parts of our operations. Viewed through that lens, the first quarter results were solid. On the revenue side, our initiatives began to deliver on schedule and in some cases, ahead of schedule. And on the cost side, we outperformed our guidance by delivering better productivity than we planned despite completing fewer ASMs than planned. So in factors we control that drive long-term value, we're headed in the right direction. That said, the underlying improvements we're making to the business were masked somewhat by two unusual factors: first, a series of winter storms in February that significantly disrupted our operations; and second, a substantial drop in close-in fares in our California and New York-based transcon markets, which extended through most of the quarter. These items had a significant impact on our revenues. And though we are not satisfied with our results, even if we exclude the impact of these events, when we do adjust to the noise they created, we see our initiatives gaining traction, and we see momentum in the business. To put it more directly, we believe we're on track to deliver higher margins and returns in 2019 as we indicated last quarter and at Investor Day. Regarding the storms, I want to first thank our terrific employees who through their skill and determination got us through the most significant winter weather the Pacific Northwest has seen in 50 years. Our teams went above and beyond to keep our guests and each other safe, and to minimize the number of flights we had to cancel. We did end up canceling 1,100 flights. Our customer service and reservations agents did an outstanding job dealing with the cancels and reaccommodating our guests who were impacted. We're grateful to all teams across the organization who worked diligently to keep the airline moving during this time. And looking ahead, we're optimistic about the rest of 2019. The summer travel season is almost upon us, it should provide a more stable pricing and operating environment. And the integration with Virgin America is largely behind us. We're on track to realize $330 million in revenue synergies and initiatives this year, and we'll harness these opportunities to improve our margins and grow earnings per share. We slowed our growth to let recent investments mature and to focus our energies on making better use of what we have. We're investing in our people and our product, and we're coming together as one team to realize the great potential of our platform. As we do these things, we will be leveraging our competitive advantage over a larger and more powerful route network, and our profitability will improve. And as our margins improve, we'll also get back to growing the airline, albeit, at a more moderate 4% to 6% annual pace that we believe is appropriate given the size of our business today. We got a lot to cover today. So at this point, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben Minicucci, our President and Chief Operating Officer. As a reminder, Ben took on expanded commercial responsibilities in September of last year with the changes we made to our old structure. Ben, over to you.\nBenito Minicucci: Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. After years of participating in these calls and responding to your questions during Q&A, I'm pleased to participate in our prepared remarks today and provide you with an update on our business. In the first quarter, total revenues grew 2.4% year-over-year to $1.9 billion on roughly flat capacity, as unit revenues increased 2.2%. Our pretax margin improved to 1.5%, 20 basis points better than prior year, and our adjusted earnings per share also improved versus 2018. I'd like to echo Brad's comments that we're encouraged with the progress we're making towards our multiyear goals despite the challenges we faced last quarter. With the integration almost complete, our attention has turned to streamlining and improving our business at the core. As we implement the initiatives on our roadmap, we're building greater awareness of our brand, aligning our guest experience, improving our product, and starting to make headway on productivity. All of these efforts tie back to our strategy of attracting new customers and building guest loyalty in West Coast markets. Here are a few examples of our team's recent accomplishments: first, we began to capture material revenue synergies as we swap more of our Boeing and Airbus aircraft into the most appropriate routes. As of March, we had cross fleeted our higher gauge, lower unit cost Boeing aircraft into the most capacity-constrained markets with overflow demand. This will improve our margins going forward, especially during the peak summer season; second, we've now repainted 66 of our 71 Airbus aircrafts, and we'll complete all 71 by June. Airbus interior renovations are also in full swing, and Andrew will provide a further update on those in a moment. Third, our flight attendants began flying together as fully-integrated teams on January 31; fourth, last week, we completed our Flight Path program, a series of face-to-face workshops with our people to reinforce our culture and bring us together as one team. Over 20,000 employees attended these sessions with leadership over the past 6 months, and they've helped us move forward as one team toward our strategic and financial goals; fifth, although our operating performance was really challenged in February, as we navigated the winter storms, our team recovered well and took great care of guests. Key performance metrics have improved substantially in March and our departures on zero and controllable departures on zero are looking quite good in April. Sixth, we launched our new Saver Fare product in January. This was the most significant change we've made to our product and pricing lineup in years. And as we adapt to it operationally and respond to questions from some of our guests, the incremental revenue it has generated has thus far exceeded our expectations. And last but not least, we continue to enhance our network and product. In March, we launched service from Paine Field and added new international connections through our global partners. We are also upgrading our cabins, over Wi-Fi offering, employee uniforms, and the guest experience at the airport with the opening of the North Satellite terminal at Seattle in June. Each of the steps are making our airline more accessible, attractive and valuable than ever for our guests. Our momentum continues to build on all these fronts. We still have a lot of work ahead. We are making good progress optimizing our network, building guest loyalty, and ultimately, increasing our profitability. Before I turn the call over to Andrew, I would like to comment briefly on our longer-term growth potential. We always said the merger with Virgin America was about growth. And we still stay that today, however, given our slower growth this year, some investors have asked whether our thinking on this has changed. A short answer to that is no. We still see lots of opportunity for profitable growth, especially in California, leveraging the valuable airport assets we acquired with the merger. We're taking a pause this year to let our recent network investments mature and increase returns. But beyond this year, we will leverage our competitive advantages especially, our low costs, our award-winning service, and our generous loyalty program to continue delivering profitable growth in the years ahead as we've done historically. We're just getting started on what we can and will deliver for our guests, our employees and our owners, and we are confident that our trajectory is heading upward. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew for his commercial updates.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Ben, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll be covering our first quarter revenue performance, updates to our product and service, and where we see Q2 revenues given what we know today. As Ben just stated, in the first quarter, total revenues rose 2.4% to $1.9 billion, and a RASM increase of 2.2%. Despite navigating severe winter storms and the collapse of the close-in industry pricing that lasted for an 11-week period in California-based transcon markets, we still delivered on our goal to outperform our domestic peers on unit revenue growth. The first quarter can present challenges. Given it's seasonally our weakest, but this year was especially choppy with close-in fares, which we highlighted on last quarter's call. When this noise behind us, we see positive revenue momentum heading into the spring and summer. Close-in fares have firmed over the past month and our synergies and other initiatives are set to reach their full run rates mid-second quarter. Before turning to the future though, I would like to provide more insight into the puts and takes that resulted in our 2.2% RASM increase in the first quarter. So in terms of tailwinds, our synergies and initiatives ramped up on schedule and contributed a combined 300 basis points of RASM increase. Saver Fare, the largest component of these, exceeded our expectations as more guests chose to buy out of the product than we planned. As Saver and other initiatives reached their run rates in Q2, we expect this tailwind to grow. Due to the initiative strength as well as pockets of improved pricing, we saw many areas of strength in the quarter. 9 of our 11 operating regions delivered positive unit revenues and some significantly so, compared to our West Coast yield environment that was up only slightly. Our loyalty member base and credit cardholders also continue to grow, especially in California. Total Mileage Plan revenues grew 7.3% or 3x faster than our overall revenues. Now moving to headwinds. The winter storms and the 1,100 cancellations they caused in February directly reduced Q1 revenues by $15 million and Q1 RASM by 20 basis points. In addition, California transcon markets, specifically San Francisco and Los Angeles to the New York Metro and Boston airports, were one of two operating regions to experience negative RASM in Q1. These markets representing 14% of our network saw significant weakness in close-in pricing from January through mid-March. Since tickets purchased close to departure date generally sell for above-average prices, this close-in weakness had a material, 110 basis impact on Q1 and explains most of the variance to our original guidance. These prices were isolated, however, and do not affect the way we think about our revenue trajectory for the rest of the year. Close-in fares rebounded significantly in mid-March and have continued to firm since, consistent with their typical seasonal pattern. We are cautiously optimistic on California transcon pricing as we head into the spring and summer. Hawaii was the only other region to experience revenue softness in the first quarter. This was reflected in our original guidance due to lower pricing that has been in market since September of last year. Importantly, though still negative, pricing in Hawaii has remained quite stable of late and in some cases has improved. Looking ahead, the commercial team's focus continues to be on improving margins through higher unit revenues. And while Saver Fares and other images are major contributors, we're also implementing a number of improvements to our network and product this year that I would like to summarize briefly. First off is our service at Paine Field, which began last month, offering 18 departures to 8 destinations for a greater utility and convenience for our guests that live north of Seattle. Results from the first few weeks of operation have been very positive. Next our Alaska Global Partners network is expanding with new direct flights out of Seattle from Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong, Japan Airlines to Narita, and Singapore Airlines to Singapore. We're also beta testing the ability for our guests to book international flights on our global partners directly through our website. And third, we're installing new cabin interiors on our Airbus and 737-700 aircraft that align and improve the guest experience. Each Airbus renovation increases total seat count and builds in a greater mix of First and Premium Class seats. And we're on track to complete all 71 retrofits by this time next year. Fourth, satellite Wi-Fi, which is 20x the bandwidth of current offerings, satellite is being installed on 26 aircraft to date, is already operating on transcon flights and will be installed across our fleet by mid-next year. And lastly, the new North Satellite terminal at Seattle opens this June featuring a new 15,000 square-foot lounge for our guests. We'll also be opening a rooftop lounge in San Francisco next year. For all of these reasons, we are optimistic heading into the second quarter. Our ASM growth is a modest 1% and competitive capacity growth eases to 1.7%. Our Q2 RASM guidance range of up 2% to 5% reflects the sequential improvement we expect and assumes 350 basis points of incremental revenues from synergies and initiatives, a 100 basis point benefit from the Easter - timing of Easter, which is offset by 100 basis points of continued headwinds from pricing softness in Hawaii. As we leverage the significant self-help opportunities in our plan, we expect Q2 RASM to outperform the domestic industry by a greater margin than it did in Q1, and our target is to outperform our domestic peers by 200 basis points for the full year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.\nBrandon Pedersen: Thanks much, Andrew. Just to recap. Air Group posted a first quarter adjusted net profit of $21 million or $0.17 per share, up from $18 million or $0.14 per share in 2018. On the surface, the result is only up modestly versus last year, but the improvement is more substantial after factoring in the headwinds we faced. Notably, this was the first quarter we've improved pretax margin since Q2 of 2016, and the result indicates that we've begun the steady upward climb toward higher margins and returns. We still have more work to do on both the revenue and the cost sides of the business to achieve our margin target. My comments today will focus on costs. Overall, we were pleased with our cost performance in Q1. CASMex fuel ended up 2.8% or 200 basis points better than our initial guidance despite completing fewer ASMs than planned. About half of the 200 basis points was timing, and about half was better than planned execution across much of the organization. This result gives us increased confidence in our full year cost outlook and more importantly, demonstrates our ability to protect our low cost structure despite slower growth. Unit costs are - low unit costs are, and have been for years, a key source of our competitive advantage. And despite the solid quarter, we need to make more progress on productivity and manage overhead lower. Let me give you a couple of examples of where we did this well in Q1. First, mainline pilot productivity was 2.5 points better than planned. This was great, but productivity still trailed last year; second, productivity in our res group was 7.5 points better than planned and a full 12% better than prior year. Kudos to the res team for a really strong performance this quarter; and third, overhead spend was 5% lower than last year after adjusting for some timing items, reflecting the management reductions we made in 2018, cost synergies, and lower spend in a host of other areas. In addition, our cost reduction efforts also extended to our vendor relationships. As we mentioned at Investor Day, we're engaging many of our external business partners this year to renegotiate the rates we pay, and the initiatives are starting to deliver real savings. I want to recognize the supply chain team for their leading - for leading this effort and thank the vendors that have made pricing and other adjustments that will help us to continue to lean out our cost structure. Looking to the second quarter. We expect CASMex to be up approximately 5% on a 1% increase in capacity. The higher sequential costs reflect the continued mix impact of substantially higher regional growth this year as well as our current maintenance timing, which continues to be front-loaded in the first half of 2019. While this guidance is consistent with our previous Q2 guidance, it does represent better overall performance since our Q2 capacity growth is now 100 basis points lower than our initial plan. For the full year, we have lowered our CASMex guidance by 20 basis points to 2.1%, reflecting the savings we captured in Q1. As a reminder, our full year cost guidance does not include the impact of any new labor deals we may complete in 2019. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash. Total cash flow from operations for the first three months was $490 million ex merger-related costs, while net CapEx was $110 million over the same period. This resulted in about $380 million of free cash flow, ex integration costs, which was nearly $300 million higher than in Q1 of 2018. Increased profits and lower CapEx should lead to consistent year-over-year improvement in free cash flow throughout 2019. This free cash flow is allowing us to continue to deleverage, which remains our #1 capital allocation priority. We've repaid a net of $140 million in debt so far this year, and we're on pace to reduce our overall debt balance by about $350 million in 2019, including $70 million of pre-payments. We also crossed somewhat of a milestone this quarter, having now retired more than $1 billion of the $2 billion we borrowed to acquire Virgin America. With leases, our quarter-end adjusted debt-to-cap stood at 47%, and we should end the year at about 43%. We now have more than 90 unencumbered Boeing NGs and Embraer 175s, and $400 million of undrawn line of credit. As we repaid debt, we've also returned $55 million to shareholders via the dividend, which is currently yielding about 2.3% and share repurchases. We still expect aggregate returns to exceed $220 million by the year end. And once we achieve debt-to-cap closer to 40%, we'll have greater flexibility to increase capital returns to our owners, and to pursue other opportunities that are consistent with our balanced approach to capital allocation. Let me close by returning to a few of today's themes. We're working hard despite setbacks from mother nature and other factors to improve the financial returns this business is generating. Merger synergies and initiatives are creating revenue momentum. We're enhancing the guest experience. Our loyalty program continues to grow faster than passenger growth. Our cost outlook has improved. Our balance sheet is strong, and our expanded network footprint gives us significant runway for growth longer term. Nothing in this industry is without challenges. With the noise of Q1 behind us, we are optimistic in our outlook for the rest of the year. And we look forward to leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver superior shareholder value in the years ahead. And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: So just two questions. One, can you talk about the cadence or the trajectory during the second quarter of what you see in terms of bookings in and revenues that give you some degree of confidence hitting the numbers for the June quarter?\nAndrew Harrison: Helane, it's Andrew. I think firstly, with our revenue guidance sort of the range, and you can see there's an acceleration of growth there. But just as we sit today, just the visibility we have from April that's nearly done and then looking at advances as well as looking at the fare environment at it sits today, we feel very good about how the next three months are going to come in, all things being equal that I see today.\nHelane Becker: Okay. So are there areas of strength that you can specifically speak to?\nAndrew Harrison: I think what we're seeing a little bit is - in our prepared comments we talked about couple of regions that were softer and the headwinds in Hawaii. But I would say, across most of our regions, we are seeing normal strength as we head into spring and summer in both the booking patterns and the fare environment firming up. So we feel pretty good about that as we move forward.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then Andrew, just another question for you on loyalty and card. You mentioned that the card continues to grow and exceed your expectations, I guess. Are you seeing - it continues to grow, but has the growth rate slowed off the tougher comps?\nAndrew Harrison: I would - we'll still hit, without getting into details, double-digit growth in both Mileage Plan and the credit card in the first quarter. And in fact, California growth was double the systemwide growth rate. So I would say that we're still seeing very good momentum even in the base that we're growing off increases.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.\nRajeev Lalwani: Andrew, a question for you, first. You made a pretty bold statement in terms of your ability to outperform on RASM going forward. Some of your peers that you're sort of alluding to are highlighting kind of low-single-digit, maybe even 2%, 3% growth in RASM, and so 2 points above that would be a pretty big number. Can you just talk about your comfort there? I mean, if you look at just your 2Q guide, it's not too dissimilar from where JetBlue, Spirit, Southwest are. So you are kind of in line with them today. But I'd love to just hear more about how you're thinking about it in terms of some of your comments?\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Rajeev. Firstly, as we see what the domestic unit revenue growth were for the industry, we beat that by about 160 basis points. And as we go into the second quarter and just seeing what others are guiding to, we feel pretty good with the self-help initiatives that we're putting in to continue that. I mean, at the end of the day, if you look at the comments that we made, and our midpoint of our guidance, which is 3.5, it's basically we said, 3.5 points from initiatives in self-help. There was a bonus there for the move of Easter and then you deduct Hawaii from that. So essentially, what we're saying is that all of our growth is going to come from initiatives. If industries fares go up, we'll do better, if they come down, we might have headwinds. So that's sort of how we sit today.\nRajeev Lalwani: Okay. And Brandon a question for you. There's obviously been lots of discussion around the MAX and some of the headwinds it's causing for your peers. Can you talk about how you're going to navigate that? I think you start get some deliveries as the year progresses? And what incremental training could do? That sort of a thing?\nBrandon Pedersen: Rajeev, it's Brandon. It doesn't really impact us a ton this year. We have three MAX scheduled for delivery June, July and October. Obviously, we're watching the situation closely, but we don't expect much of an impact on the capacity side, certainly. Ben, you might want to comment on the upside or training side?\nBenito Minicucci: I think you're right. I think we'll see very minimal impact with the three airplanes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Brandon, I might have missed it in your prepared comments, but when would you expect to hit that 40% debt-to-cap level as we proceed through the year?\nBrandon Pedersen: We would likely hit that in probably early to mid-2020. Did you say 20%, Duane? Just clarify.\nBradley Tilden: 40%.\nBrandon Pedersen: Yes. 40%, we would do in probably, as I said, early to mid-2020.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then any updated thoughts with respect to your 2020 growth rate and the profile of your cost structure into next year?\nBenito Minicucci: Duane, it's Ben. Like we said in our prepared remarks, Alaska has traditionally been a growth airline. We took a pause last year just to absorb the growth and focus on increasing margins. But what you'll see forward from us, we're a growth airline. You'll see anywhere from 4% to 6% over a period of time. So that's our mindset right now.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And maybe Brandon, just the longer-term thoughts on the cost structure into next year?\nBrandon Pedersen: I think we're really committed to having a low-cost operation. Costs have been super important to us. They will continue to be super important to us. We need to do more going forward, but we're early into the planning process, and don't have specifics to share at this point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Matt on for Savi. My first question would be in regard to Saver Fares. It sounds like you're having good progress with that. But could you talk about may be any potential learnings have had there? Operational complexities in terms of markets rolled out? And if it is exceeding expectations that $100 million target gone up? And correct me if I'm wrong on that target, by the way, please?\nBradley Tilden: Matt, let me start. When - like we said, the Saver rollout exceeded our expectations. It's been a really good rollout. And as you rollout new big changes like this, of course, we did have some issues operationally with managing what we call oversold list, but we're working through those right now with our frontline folks. And having that rolled out, we handled some customer questions on how this thing works. So there were a bit of issues we had to work our way through. But I would say those things are working well, and we're making our way through that. In terms of total dollars, I think, we feel totally comfortable about - we said $100 million. And when we look at - we look at it overall with all our revenue initiatives, we feel pretty good about that. And we've only launched it for four months. We'll give you more of a sense as we get more traction over the next few months on how it's going, but we're optimistic that we improve on that.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right, great. Thank you very much for the color there. And then maybe - maybe to Andrew or Ben, whomever. Could you talk maybe just high-level about your second half RASM trends? Any puts and takes there? How we can think of timing of initiatives or tough comps that are going on in the back half?\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks Matt. As we shared in our remarks, we plan to it full run rate on our initiatives and synergies by the middle of the second quarter, but we don't give any sort of guidance or outlook beyond what we've done on today's call.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.\nJamie Baker: Your cost guidance was careful to point out no incremental labor expense or - reflective of any contracts progress. Just so that we can establish where the market is, what competitors do you currently use in your peer set when thinking about wage expense? I ask because given how the company has evolved and particularly post-merger, it may be fair to say that, that peer set has changed somewhat. Not asking you to negotiate in public, just wondering who you kind of set yourself up against when thinking about where market wage rates are?\nShane Tackett: Jamie, it's Shane Tackett. Obviously, I'll be brief. I think, we generally look at all the major carriers to understand where they are. Obviously, our labor groups would look at those folks as peers. And what we try to do is find a way to get really, really competitive contracts, and at the same time, find ways to drive productivity up. It's the only formula that's going to work for the company over long term, and that's sort of been our approach with our labor groups over the last 15 or 20 years.\nJamie Baker: Okay. So it's fair to say that, that approach hasn't been altered in any way as the carrier itself has matured. Yes, I think it's totally fair, I'm just confirming that.\nShane Tackett: Yes, Jamie, I think our mindset in terms of high productivity and really competitive contracts hasn't changed. I think that obviously there's two parties in all of these discussions, and our folks need to feel like they have contracts that respect the work that they do and the contributions they make to our success.\nJamie Baker: Cool. And a quick follow-up to Helane's question. I apologize for sounding like a broken record. I've asked about loyalty on several of the calls this season. But the Virgin acquisition kind of put California into play, in my opinion. You've acknowledged stepped up competition there with Southwest. They spoke very enthusiastically today about rapid reward traction. So I just want to confirm - and I'm not of the view that some hold that loyalty benefits are competed away over time. But I just want to confirm that specific to California, not Seattle but California, you're not seeing any evidence of more aggressive card competition in that market?\nAndrew Harrison: Jamie, we see the usual periodic bonus offers that are just sort of glittery deals to bring people in. But what we believe the fundamentals are that over the long term, loyalty programs only work if you actually reward people for their loyalty and have [indiscernible] and deeply embedded built - generous mechanisms to keep people's loyalty. And so what we see right now is that our loyalty program and the growth that we've been able to achieve, we feel like what we offer to guests is being well received. And as I shared earlier, our California growth on both card and Mileage Plan is double the rate, albeit on a smaller base and our systemwide growth, which is double digits. So it's always moving around. But as we continue to roll out new products, people get to know us more. Our awareness gets higher. We feel really good about what we have to offer to folks who want to join our club.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: So Brandon, the first one is for you. So if better execution did drive some of that better March quarter CASM performance, is there anything that we should be thinking about that's unique to the March quarter that drove that better execution? Or if things continue the way they are, could we potentially see further improvements in the cost outlook as we move through the year?\nBrandon Pedersen: Catie, I don't think I would drive or call out anything specific in the first quarter that drove a number that was \"artificial.\" I do think it was really good execution across the organization. In particular, our team did a good job scheduling the airline. I think it's required that we continue to have this good execution going forward. I don't see anything that's going to derail that, but it's super, super important that we hit our plan. That's what we aim to do.\nBenito Minicucci: Catie, it's Ben. How we schedule the airline has a massive, massive impact on not only the productivity of people, but of assets. And I think what we're going to do now, we've got a full-court press with a team looking at how we optimize this network with a Boeing and Airbus product, getting the right airplanes on the right routes, maximizing utilization on airplanes, maximizing productivity of our people, and getting this to configure to how we had it before the merger. So I mean, that's our focus and I think you'll see just a steady improvement on that.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great. Congrats on the strong performance this quarter and hopefully more to come. And then one for you Andrew. So if you're noting that all of your June quarter RASM growth is due to internal initiatives and synergies, should we be assuming that you're not incorporating the rebound in transcon fares you noted earlier in the call into that guide? Just any color on how should we think about that would be great.\nAndrew Harrison: Catie, I think what I'm really saying that the growth that we're seeing net of everything is really being driven by the initiatives. That said, we gave a fairly decent range, a 3-point range, and we have a high end, of course. And so to the extent that things go the way we like to see them go, we will move up that range. To the extent not, we'll probably - the goal is we hit the midpoint.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Andrew, I just want to follow up, I guess, on that question. Is there some sort of offset on just kind of the base fare line from some of these initiatives? Because it does seem either conservative that 1% capacity growth shouldn't produce low to mid-single digit core RASM on top of the initiatives? Or is there kind of demand leakage somewhere? I mean, the competitive capacity outlook is pretty benign, why is it core RASM is stronger than what you're expecting?\nAndrew Harrison: I think, number one, we [indiscernible] guidance, which is what we have to do in the first quarter. So we're being a little bit more sober and prudent about how we guide. I would, you characterize a conservative guide, I wouldn't necessarily argue heavily against that.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, okay. And then I guess I'll join my loyalty brother Jamie with a question along those lines. Brandon, I never really understood why the Virgin transaction didn't trigger kind of a renegotiation of sorts with BofA, and an improvement economic. So given how clear it is that kind of the economics of loyalty have gotten better of late, is that something that we can assume you guys are kind of working on with BofA, and if you like to talk about what you think the opportunity there is? I would love to hear it.\nBrandon Pedersen: It's Brandon, that actually falls squarely into Andrew's area. He owns the relationship with the bank right now and perhaps, it's a good that if you would answer the question.\nAndrew Harrison: No. Yes. So we don't disclose - we renegotiated that not too long ago, and...\nJoseph DeNardi: It was like three years ago, wasn't it, Andrew?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, time flies. But we've had a small extension I think a few years ago. But what I would say is that a couple of things. Number one, these agreements in my career have never sort of gone their full tenure. Changes in the market condition, if there are some, are always I think, good things, especially if they're to the positive side. And we continue to talk to Bank of America on how we can continue to build a very, very strong relationship we have. So there may be some more market data out there today. But again, we'll digest that and continue to work with our program and make it the best for us and Bank of America.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Brandon, can you give me some color on the $26 million of merger integration costs. I've got three questions. Number 1, why were they up 20 million year-on-year? How much of that was cash? And when you guys going to be done pulling these out?\nChristopher Berry: All right. Chris is going to answer them instead of Brandon, Hunter. So 50 - about little more than half of it was noncash. It was related to a onetime sort of true-up vacation balances. When we integrated the former Virgin America crews into the Alaska crew scheduling or crew tracking system. So that was the majority of it that's noncash. The rest of it are things like paint lines for the Virgin America livery as well as some IT costs associated with moving former Virgin America data centers and consolidating those. So we should be - that was - the year-over-year impact is solely because - primarily because of that onetime labor vacation through our balances and it's not nonrecurring.\nHunter Keay: When was it done, Chris?\nChristopher Berry: When was it done. So the biggest because we have remaining or associated with the maintenance integration, which has not really started yet. And so that should be really over the next 12 months, 15 months. But we said, I think, $400 million of onetime charges were about $345 million from acquisition to date. And I still feel pretty good about the $400 million.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Chris and Brad, and then couple of years ago you guys resisted the urge of lie-flats because a couple - one of the reasons at least was because you thought you might make yours - your airline more prone to a downturn, which I felt was actually really insightful. But look, you've said before you try to attract new customers and the marketplace has changed. Not only Pacific Northwest, but now you're in these markets in San Francisco and Los Angeles. You've got the credit card, and your competitors are having some success with these lie-flat seats. So how are you thinking about that now? Are you fighting the urge to do it? Or is it something you guys have just decided we'll never going to do this and that's just who we are.\nShane Tackett: Hunter, it's Shane. I think I answered this question before. Our thinking haven't changed. And in fact, if you look at some of the pricing softness in the markets that you're talking about, a lot of that is actually on the premium side of the cabin. And so I'm not sure that the economics would be any different. In fact, they would probably be more challenging at this point. I think the question about do we have a good enough first-class product, which is again a very small percentage of the overall market that demands that. Is it good enough to compete with lie flat, I think it's a good question, and it's one we're sort of humble about and we're just - we're going to take a little more time to understand if we need to go a different route. We don't really have the aircraft to do lie-flat today. We've got some of the A321s. That's the aircraft you would want to do it on. So we said before, if we needed to go there we could. But right now, our sort of view is more loyalty and upgrade into our premium cabins, and less sort of all-out looking to yield in the premium cabins and that still works for us. Throughout the system, we think it will. If that changes, we'll be able to go lie-flat if we have to.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the levels Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. I want to go back to something in your prepared remarks, you talked about Alaska being a growth airline and you're excited for next year, profitable growth opportunities. I think you sort of referenced the acquired assets in California and presumably you were referring to San Fran and LA, LAX. And I'm just curious, those - obviously space is tight at those airports, and I was under the impression that your utilization of your current gauge there is actually pretty high, but just based on your comments it seems like maybe you are only using 60% or 70% of the space. Can you just give us a sense of how much maybe additional room at LAX and SFO you may have? And maybe you have some gauge coming online over the next 12 months or so that I'm not aware of?\nBradley Tilden: Mike, thanks for the question. A couple of things. I wanted to put in context was I know there were concerns about our growth and our - we are a growth airline, and our longer-term strategy is to grow. Now I said California, there are some constraints in San Francisco and Los Angeles. There is construction that sometimes constrains us. There is some coming up, but those are two places where we have considerable strength. So those are definitely options for us to grow, but we have a broader California network as well that we're going to look at as well. So our mindset is always 4% to 6%. And California, of course, we made the acquisition of Virgin America to get those valuable slots and gauge. So we're going to take as much advantage and get as much activity of the assets we have to grow. And we're not giving too much detail on that.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, not a problem. And just Andrew, the 9 of 11 regions where you had positive RASM in the March quarter, Andrew, as we look to the June quarter, is - are we going to be able to get to a point, where it's 11 of 11 or maybe 10 of 11?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, that is the hope. I think, as we move in - a lot of that's going to depend on the industry pricing. We have a lot of time spend at fares that are technically industrywide may be rolling off or not. But at the end of the day, I think, that there could be strength there. On the comments though we did say with Hawaii. I think just I'm not sure that's going to get to positive unit revenue just given the capacity that sort of come on board both there and the fare environment.\nMichael Linenberg: Andrew I didn't even know you had 11 regions. So I couldn't even name them, so I just - I'll ask that off-line.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Bank.\nBrandon Oglenski: Andrew or Shane, I guess, we've heard this commentary too from other carriers as we go through earning season here that leisure was soft up until I guess the end of March or beginning of April. Where do we get that - I mean, we've heard others talk about low World Cup fares on transcon as well. So what changed? Was demand not showing up? Or did we see capacity tweaks in these areas? Where is the confidence that things have improved into the summer?\nAndrew Harrison: Number one, I think really specially what went on with World Cup fares had nothing to do with demand and supply. I mean, it just - there was just the pricing actions taken by carriers that brought those down very, very low and they doubled - these fairs doubled overnight starting in mid-March. I think you for us specifically, the first quarter is always deeply seasonally weak and weak quarters affect demand to our network, affects the pricing up into Premium Class. So as we move into the spring and summer season, we are seeing the traditional strength that we've always seen in these markets. But at the end of the day, the fare levels out in the marketplace are somewhat flat give or take across the system versus last year, and we continue to see them move. So over the next 2 or 3 weeks, we'll learn more about where this is headed.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, I appreciate that. And then I wanted to follow up on the question about business-class versus your domestic First Class. Have you guys put the 900 on the transcon routes yet? And are you getting the relative revenue production out of the aircraft that you thought you would? I guess, more from like a square foot perspective?\nAndrew Harrison: Sure. We actually just - it was only really mid-March that we fully transferred all of JFK and New York to Los Angeles and San Francisco on to the ER and the 321, so - as we get into these demand periods. So we will get a lot more visibility to how they perform over the next few months. So that's just really started as we speak.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jose Caiado with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJose Caiado: I just have one quick follow-up question on the second quarter guidance. I guess you said that you wouldn't push back on the notion that there are some conservatism in Q2 RASM guide. But when I think back to the last earnings call where your provided first quarter guidance, I think, there was also an explicit statement at the time that there was no Q1 forecast embedded, less confidence in close-in pricing. So maybe that could have been characterized as conservative at the time as well and then it obviously came in materially worse than what you were expecting. So how were you thinking about that in the context of this Q2 guide here, the assumptions behind close-in specifically, just given your experience in the first quarter?\nAndrew Harrison: I think what we were trying to say on the first quarter was that we saw real volatility and choppiness in the fares, and we were just pointing that out as we - as part of the basis of our guide, is what we are saying, but - and then literally days after the call, we saw them continue down. I think what we're really saying here is, is that at the end of the day, we feel good about what we see today, but we see fares still move around a lot and there is a good chance that fares could continue to move up across the industries, the demand comes in. Honestly, we have seen seats come out close in due to the MAX groundings. We've seen carriers pull seats out of the market. We've seen numerous frequency reductions across our markets as late as last week into June. So some of these things will actually help RASM going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Darryl J. Genovesi with Vertical Research.\nDarryl Genovesi: The first quarter - the calendar first quarter was the first quarter of year-over-year fuel decline that we've seen in a while, perhaps the last as well. Within that construct we had a somewhat bifurcated revenue progression with Delta and American guidance holding up by-and-large while the more domestic-oriented carriers like yourselves and Southwest and JetBlue cetera had to cut. I knew there are some geographic differences. But I'm also wondering the extent to which this bifurcation may also be related to the global network carriers more mature customer segmentation efforts relative to yours in a fuel environment that perhaps engendered some competitive pricing behavior. Any thoughts on that, Andrew?\nBradley Tilden: I think you've confused, Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: I'm not. That was - it was an impressive question, but I'm going to - I'm not sure I quite understood it, and that's. I'd take it off-line.\nBradley Tilden: Better able to - with more segmentation history - better able to recover higher fuel costs. That's what you're asking, Darryl?\nDarryl Genovesi: Yes, basically. I know Delta and American have had basic economy for a while. You guys just rolled yours out. JetBlue doesn't have one yet. Southwest doesn't have one yet. The three of you [indiscernible] guidance. United, Delta and American didn't. I'm just wondering if there's a connection there?\nAndrew Harrison: Got it. I'm not sure but what I can tell you that we have going on that others do not have going on is this, the massive change going on in our business. We really - we forget about this - we just really rolled out Premium Class last year. So we had a 23% increase in Premium Because seats just in the first quarter. The Saver Fares having rolled out, the fleet. So we have a lot of choppiness and noise and distraction going on a little bit historically, just to be honest with you. So I don't know the answer to that question. But what I do know is going forward as our business settles down and we get a much better grasp of our levers, I'll probably have a better answer for you next time.\nBradley Tilden: Darryl, what I would add is, we believe, Alaska has competitive advantage. So we know there's a lot going on in the industry, but we have a great product. Everything from the Saver Fare we've introduced, Main Cabin, premium cabin, First Class. And we don't have lie-flats. But I think the net we cast over the customer population is pretty large. So we feel that we can weather a lot given our low cost structure and we just feel we're in a good place.\nDarryl Genovesi: Great. And then Brandon, I mean, if I may ask, on this 40% debt-to-cap target, can you just give us some sense of how you came up with that target in particular, how do you go about stress testing it. Apologies, I knew you've probably done it before, but as the cycle gets a little bit more mature, I think it becomes more important to understand these balance sheet metrics?\nBrandon Pedersen: No, no, no. It's a very fair question. What we did was we looked at the leverage that generally high-quality industrials keep and it's usually right around that, and if you blend that with absolute debt balance look, you blend that with the coverage ratio look, I think, all of that sort of works into this view of kind of 40% is a good place for us to be. We want to maintain an investment grade balance sheet. We want to have - I mean, all of that, that's basically the answer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Mckenzie with Buckingham Research.\nDaniel Mckenzie: Shane, I guess this question would be for you. From what I can tell the Saver Fare appears to be more mechanical and less dynamic today. First, am I correct in that characterization? And then is there potential to be more dynamic here and how do we think about what that could mean for revenue as we look forward here?\nShane Tackett: Yes, Daniel, you are right. I think we've gone out initially with a pretty sort of flat approach. We've really done it essentially based on how far people are traveling, and I think that's really what the industry has gone out with and more or less has stuck with. I think there is - we're starting to ask the same question you just asked me. Is there a way to get a little smarter at the flight level to move the buy up around. Our goal with this would be loss of buy up at pretty low price. We would love to sort of maximize the economics by getting a lot of people into the main cabin fare that's the better product. And so we want to make that buy up attractive to folks over time. So we are very motivated to figure out how to get more dynamic, as you say, with this but it's probably a couple of quarters away. We really do need a little history before we start changing that goal a lot.\nDaniel Mckenzie: Understood, okay. I guess second question here going back to pilot productivity, which was in the prepared remarks. I believe it was roughly - responsible for roughly 1/2 of the CASMex improvement in the first quarter. Based on the second quarter cost guide, which is unchanged here, it doesn't appear to be filtering through to the second quarter. And I guess I'm just wondering if that's correct? Or is there some potential upside here?\nShane Tackett: Dan, this is Shane. I'll take that as well. I think this was asked by somebody earlier. In Q1, we had a number of areas that we actually performed a little better than what our plan was. Productivity was one driver, and the one that was mentioned by Brandon was crew productivity. We had - we actually had good performance in a couple of other areas as well, distribution costs, selling costs, and overhead, which I think Brandon also mentioned. In Q2, ASMs were actually pretty low again and what I would say is we're still fully understanding why and how we got as good versus plan, as we did on the productivity side. And our goal is to definitely drive that through the rest of the year, but it actually was better than we had planned. So we are just making sure we fully understand what drove that so we can continue doing those things.\nDaniel Mckenzie: Understood, and if I can just squeeze one last one here. Just going back to the Investor Day and the fact that you shared around Mileage Plan members, generating 4x more revenue. Just given the loyalty growth rates that you've highlighted, to what extent is that helping to infect revenue today? And does that help revenue inflect more materially as we move throughout the year? I am just wondering if you can provide more color here as well?\nAndrew Harrison: Dan, it's Andrew. All of that holds true. And I think as we've shared earlier, the strength of the loyalty shows historically, what it does to the percentage of people we booked through AS.com. The percentage of those folks who actually spend more than the average fare, and as we see and as we look into California, we have been feeling more and more percentage of our seats on our aircraft with loyalty members in California. So we're going to continue to work that and we expect to see the same relationship between loyalty members in the Pacific Northwest, as in California, as we move them up the value chain.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey with Citigroup.\nKevin Crissey: Just one quick one. We've heard argues that your good results from a network and revenue perspective have been traditionally your legacy Alaska markets, and your weakest results have been your traditional legacy Virgin routes. Can you talk to that? And maybe put another way, what areas of Virgin network and assets are doing well?\nAndrew Harrison: Kevin, it's Andrew. We - I recall and maybe I've made, I made in earlier quarters, some very high-level comment around that Pac Northwest versus California. We don't share that level of detail, but what I would, going forward that was just initial half of the acquisition. What I will share with you is that what we have squarely in focus with all the initiatives we are doing with the cross fleeting, with the Saver Fares, with the loyalty growth, the productivity, cost reductions is continuing to improve the results of the California marketplace, which is as you know, a very highly competitive marketplace. And we have seen good solid trajectory there. We have a lot of work to do, no question, but our results continue to improve and that's exactly what we're looking to do.\nBradley Tilden: Kevin, it's Brad. I might add on that to that a little bit. In my time here, I've seen lots of different reasons for this company be - reasons that were challenge for sometimes for a period of years. When I first joined Seattle to the Bay Area - Pacific Northwest to the Bay Area was a challenged area. It's a highly contributing area today. When we first went into transcon's sort of a similar experience and it's really, really valuable part of our franchise today. Southern Cal to Mexico, if you go back a few years was not - was underperforming for some period of time. And so some of these California transcon markets aren't doing what we believe they should do. But it doesn't shake our belief in our need to be there and it doesn't shake our belief in our competitive advantage. So we're going - I don't know that we'll add a ton of capacity in these markets, but we're going to stay there. And we are going to fight it out, and we believe our company has real competitive advantage that will be rewarded over time.\nMatt Grady: And then I think that Kevin I thank you very much for your question. I think that might've been the last questions of the day. Thank you all for our interest. We look forward to talking to you at the end of the second quarter. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference. This call will be available for future playback at www.alaskaair.com.

My name is Sia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Matt Grady.\nMatt Grady: Thanks, Sia. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings call and for connecting with us at this new call time. In today\u2019s prepared remarks, our CEO, Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business; Andrew Harrison, our Chief Commercial Officer, will share an update on our revenue performance and outlook; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will discuss our results and expectations for costs and cash flows. As usual, several other members of our management team are also on hand to help answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call. This afternoon, Alaska Air Group reported fourth quarter GAAP net income of $23 million. Excluding merger-related costs and mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments and special charges, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $93 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.75, ahead of the First Call consensus. For the full-year 2018, Air Group reported record revenues of $8.3 billion, adjusted net income of $554 million and adjusted earnings per share of $4.46. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today\u2019s earnings release. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brad for his opening remarks.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon everybody. Last month marked the two-year anniversary of our merger with Virgin America, and as we look back over that time, we\u2019re very happy with how far we\u2019ve come. Just 24 months ago we were two airlines in complementary geographies with distinct products, operating processes and cultures not to mention separate FAA certificates, labor agreements and IT systems. Today, virtually all of that has changed. Our operating processes are fully aligned, substantially all of our systems have been merged, and all but one of our labor groups are under single collective bargaining agreements. To be sure, everyone in our organization has navigated a period of significant change in growth during this integration. We\u2019ve also faced material external pressures from fuel prices and competition, but we believe that competition makes us better and time after time this team has responded to competition with new strength and new capabilities. We want to thank our terrific employees who\u2019ve done so much to bring these two airlines together, while also continuing to deliver excellent service and reliability to our guests. We\u2019re very proud that they\u2019ve earned $120 million in performance-based bonuses, which will be paid tomorrow and we\u2019re also proud that this is our 10th consecutive year with payouts that are above our target, which as a reminder is 5% for most employees, 5% of pay. We\u2019re making great progress with the integration on a number of fronts. Culturally, our employees are coming together as a single team. Across the fleet, our guest experience is increasingly aligned and will reach full alignment early next year when we finish renovating the Airbus fleet. We\u2019ve already begun to swap Boeing and Airbus aircraft on the most appropriate routes, our flight [attendants] begin flying as integrated crews next week, which as you know is very early compared to other airline mergers, and we\u2019re working on the integration of our pilot schedules as we speak. All of this means, we\u2019re rapidly becoming a better version of ourselves with greater reach and scale with the same competitive advantage we\u2019ve always had and with fantastic opportunities ahead of us. The progress we\u2019re making is also starting to show up on our financial results. The fourth quarter was solid and represented a turning point in our margin trajectory. Unit revenues rose at the fastest pace we\u2019ve seen since 2011 and we expect continued RASM outperformance this year as we begin to harvest the value of our combined platform. At this time last year, we faced multiple-headwinds from aggressive competition, our own growth, new higher cost labor agreements, and rising fuel prices. Today, that picture looks very different. Our growth has slowed. Newer parts of our network are maturing and fuel prices are down. Demand overall is solid and we\u2019re beginning to implement the margin improvement initiatives we laid out at Investor Day. We have good momentum heading into 2019. Before I talk more about our future, I\u2019d like to provide a few details on the recent accomplishments of our people. First, our operation continues to run very well. Our CD zero, or our controllable departures leaving within zero minutes of their scheduled time was flat at 85.5% in the fourth quarter and it rose 1.5% for all of 2018 to 86.6%. Second, momentum is building at Horizon where our productivity is improving and where our on-time performance was the best in the regional industry last year. Third, we\u2019ve integrated 95% of our integration milestones and the remaining items once completed will improve the productivity and efficiency of our network. Fourth, we\u2019ve repainted 39 of 71 Airbus aircraft and will re-paint the remainder of the fleet over the next few months. Interior renovations are also underway and our first refurbished Airbus aircraft entered service two weeks ago. Fifth, our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger. We\u2019ve now repaid $866 million or 42% of our merger-related debt and we ended 2018 with an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of 47%. And finally, roughly half our employees have completed our Flight Path program thus far and the remainder are scheduled to do so by April 30. As a reminder, Flight Path is a series of face-to-face workshops we\u2019re conducting with our people. It\u2019s a mix of presentations, open and honest dialogue, and interactive activities focused on Alaska's culture and future. These sessions are helping us come together as a team, something that\u2019s been so important to our historical success and we intend to continue doing this sort of thing in the years ahead. Many of you have asked us about how recent economic forecasts and market volatility might impact us this year. As you all know, we like to focus our energy internally. Nevertheless, we will say that not unlike other airlines near-term bookings suggest modestly more revenue uncertainty in the first quarter, compared to the fourth as we move through the year\u2019s seasonal trough period. But in general, demand is solid, and we have not seen any dramatic shifts in the marketplace. Andrew will elaborate more on market conditions in a moment. Most importantly, we\u2019re determined as a leadership team to stay clearly focused on factors we control to deliver consistent value for our guests, employees, communities and shareholders. We believe that if we do this, we\u2019ll produce strong relative margins and returns regardless of the industry environment and that\u2019s our primary financial goal. For 2019, this means delivering on the $330 million of revenue initiatives and synergies that we\u2019ve detailed for you and hitting our operational and cost objectives. Andrew and Brandon will talk more about these in a moment. Summarizing and taking into account our general expectation for the industry, our multi-year goal is to produce profit margins, which average 13% to 15% over the business cycle by improving performance in the controllable parts of our operation. We believe we can and will do this as we unlock the value of our newly combined platform and since lower capacity growth supports us in this process, we believe our plan to increase capacity is 2% this year and by 3% to 4% next year is the right plan. We are on the road to delivering higher margins in 2019 and 2020 as we work with our people to leverage Alaska\u2019s substantial competitive advantage over our route network that now has greater reach and scale. With most of the integration now behind us, we look forward to doing just that in the quarters and years ahead. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks Brad and good afternoon everyone. Total revenue for the fourth quarter rose 6% to $2.1 billion on capacity growth of 1.1%. RASM increased 5.2%, which was our largest increase in several years. Slower capacity growth in a more stable competitive environment provided a favorable backdrop, while the network, brand, and loyalty investments we\u2019ve made to activate the Virgin America acquisition began to yield strong results. As we outlined for you at Investor Day, this positive momentum should continue into 2019 as we further enhance our revenue production through synergy capture and accretive initiatives. Before turning to our future plans, I would like to provide some additional color on our fourth-quarter results. First, same-store markets or markets in operation longer than one year, represented 97% of our capacity and contributed positive 5.7 points to RASM. Strong close-in demand and yields across most of our networks, due in part to the strong growth and business volumes, delivered roughly two-thirds of the increase, while accretive network adjustments made earlier in the year and strong mileage plan revenues contributed to the balance. We\u2019re especially pleased with the strength in business traffic, considering historically we\u2019ve had a much stronger orientation towards the leisure traveler. Next, developing markets, these are markets in operation between one and three years, contributed about a positive 70 basis points to RASM. These markets are a subgroup within our same stores and represented about 7% of capacity in the fourth quarter. They include the routes launched in 2017 that created a headwind for us over the last year. Today, these markets are comping positively with RASM, up 10% on improved yields and load factor. We continue to be pleased with the development of these routes. And then finally, new markets or markets in operation less than 12 months represented just 3% of capacity in the fourth quarter, and had a negative 50 basis point impact to RASM. As mentioned last quarter, the Hawaii market is navigating a period of elevated capacity and weak pricing. West Coast ASMs to Hawaii rose 8% in the fourth quarter. Yields were down year-on-year, and had a 125-basis point impact on our fourth quarter RASM, and that\u2019s consistent with our guidance. Though we expect yield weaknesses to continue this year, we believe strong growth in our loyalty program, the introduction of Saver Fares and our low-fares high-value positioning will enable us to weather the near-term environment better than our competitors. And speaking of competitive positioning, we\u2019re continuing to enhance our product offering. We have a number of upgrades planned for 2019 that will drive continued momentum for our brand and will translate to higher guest preference and stronger revenue growth over time. To name just a few of these improvements, first one, we're deploying satellite internet with 20 times a bandwidth of our current offering on a 125 aircraft this year. We\u2019re installing next generation interiors on a third of our mainline fleet. We\u2019re launching a re-imagined food and beverage program along with continued expansion of our in-flight entertainment offering. We\u2019re adding more Embraer 175 aircraft and now represent approximately 60% of our regional fleet and our equipped with first-class and premium cost savings in-flight entertainment and Internet connectivity. And finally, we\u2019re upgrading our lounges and opening a new flagship lounge in Seattle, which will offer handcrafted coffee beverages and premium food for purchase. All of these enhancements have been engineered to deliver high value for our guests at relatively low costs and will stand on their own from a P&L perspective. As our product improves, we are also highly focused on delivering the $330 million in incremental revenues from synergies and self-help initiatives this year, which we outlined at Investor Day. Let me give you a quick update on each of these. First, Saver Fare, which competes with basic economy offerings at other airlines is arguably the most important of all the initiatives and is on track to deliver at least $100 million this year. Our November product test went smoothly and enabled us to refine our processes and technology before rolling it out network-wide, which we did on January 7. The other product is still new, early results are encouraging and have tracked ahead of our expectations. We look forward to updating you more fully on Saver\u2019s progress in the near future. Once it\u2019s had time to mature and related revenues have ramped need a run rate level which we anticipate by Q2. Second, we have several ancillary revenue initiatives underway, our recent bag fees increase worth 50 million annually is also new to market and should reach its run rate by the second quarter. Other ancillary initiatives such as the exit row sales and change fees, they remain on track to deliver a further $50 million this year. And third, our ability to capture revenues synergies is accelerating now that key commercial integration projects are behind us. In Q4, we crossed the Boeing and Airbus aircraft on a handful of routes, but that number will increase significantly in the first quarter before reaching its 2019 run rate in Q2. Our loyalty program also continues to perform at a very strong level with revenues, which is redemption and credit card, up 17% for the fourth quarter. That\u2019s quite remarkable results on a 1.1% capacity increase. Looking to our first quarter, competitive capacity growth is similar to Q4 at 4.2%. Our own capacity growth will be modest at 1.2%, and we expect it to remain around this level through the second quarter before rising above 3% in the second half of the year. For the full-year, we still expect ASMs to increase approximately 2%. In terms of revenue guidance, we established a Q1 RASM guidance range this afternoon of up 2.5% to 4.5%, continuing the year-over-year gains we saw in the fourth quarter. Though this guidance includes a meaningful tailwind from our ramping synergies and initiatives it nevertheless shows a modest deceleration versus the fourth quarter for three reasons. First, Q1 year-over-year comparison is 200 basis points more difficult than Q4 of 2018, a 120-basis point of RASM has moved into the second quarter with a holiday shift and then volatility and file fares have increased in both positive and negative directions since late Q4. Since Q1 is our seasonally weakest quarter, we have put a bit less confidence in close-in pricing behind our Q1 forecast then we saw in the fourth quarter. Despite these impacts, we expect our Q1 RASM will outperform the industry by a wide margin as it did in the fourth quarter, and as we expect it will do consistently this year as we leverage the significant self-help opportunities of our commercial plan. Bottom line, we\u2019re entering the year with positive revenue momentum, which is a big change from this time last year. Delivering margin improvements through higher RASM continues to be the commercial team's number one priority in 2019, and we are confident we\u2019ll achieve it as we exploit new revenue sources that are largely within our control. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brandon.\nBrandon Pedersen: Thanks, Andrew. Hi, everyone. As you've seen, Air Group posted a fourth quarter adjusted net income of $93 million or $0.75 per share, bringing our full-year adjusted net income to $554 million or $4.46 per share. Return on invested capital was 9.4% or 140 basis points above our cost of capital. At $8.26 billion, this was Air Group's highest revenue year every, certainly something to be proud of, but overall our financial results are not where we want them to be. We finished 2018 on a very positive note. After several quarters of significant margin declines, our fourth quarter margin of 6.2% was roughly 100 basis points below prior year and our lower tax rates resulted in net income and earnings per share actually improving year-over-year. RASM strength nearly offset both higher fuel and nonfuel costs. This despite elevated Q4 CASM acts on the lowest capacity growth of the year, combined with a high level of maintenance activity and a jump in depreciation from the 11 new E175\u2019s we took delivery during the final four months of the year. It\u2019s worth noting that our Q4 cost performance was better than our initial guidance despite us having completed fewer ASMs than planned. As Brad said, the strong finish resulted in our people are earning $120 million of performance-based pay or PBP, which translates to more than 6.5% of pay for the vast majority of our employees. PBP pays based on achieving financial, safety, loyalty, and guest satisfaction goals. It\u2019s also unique in our industry because it aligns every employee, regardless of roll or level around the same set of goals. When combined with our operational rewards program, which pays when we meet monthly goals, we shared more than $147 million with our people in 2018. And we\u2019re proud of this payout because it\u2019s an example of how we\u2019re trying to run the business in a balanced way that benefits all of our stakeholders. We\u2019re providing good wages and benefits to our people and sharing $147 million of incentive pay with them for hitting important goals. Our guests are getting low fares and an improving product, and our owners are getting a larger dividend that I\u2019ll talk about in a few minutes. The fourth quarter marks a turning point in our earnings trajectory, and underscores the shift in focus we\u2019ve made from network expansion to business optimization and on generating higher margins. And although we have a lot of work left to do, Q4 was an important step in the right direction. For the full-year unit cost rose about 3% on 5% capacity growth, outperforming our early 2018 guidance of 3.5% CASM increase on a 6.5% growth in capacity. It\u2019s worth viewing 2018-unit cost in-light of step function increase in labor cost that we observed last year. Agreements we amended added 300 basis points to our unit cost. This headwind aside CASMex would have been about flat in 2018. Teams across the company deserve a shout-out for executing some of the most complex integration milestones last year, while also delivering the kind of back to basics cost performance that has been a competitive advantage for us. As we guided at Investor Day, 2019 nonfuel costs will be up 2% to 2.5% on about 2% ASM growth. This is an exceptionally strong cost plan considering low ASM growth, and the roughly 120 basis points of headwind we expect from a higher mix of regional flying this year. One important element of our 2019 cost plan is aggressively working to improve terms we have with our business partners, and consolidating our purchasing our efforts across multiple spend categories. Our supply chain team is leading this effort and I want to acknowledge our business partners who have already come to the table and stress for them the importance of this campaign to our near-term success. We're looking for long-term partners who can help us reduce cost today in exchange for future opportunities to grow their business with us. Our guidance does not include the impact of any new labor deals we may complete in 2019. We\u2019re in active negotiations with the International Association of Machinists, which represents our fantastic customer service, reservations, and ramp service agents, as well as other employees and support functions, and we remain in discussions with the aircraft Mechanics Maternal Association, representing our aircraft technicians. We hope to secure ratified deals with these groups and as we do, we will update our cost guidance accordingly. Our update this morning provides expected unit cost performance by quarter. Let me touch on the first quarter where we expect CASMex to increase by about 5%. There\u2019s some information on our investor update that should help investors understand it, but in a nutshell, here is a quick summary. First, on the cost side of the equation, there are several timing events that create tough year-over-year quarterly comps in the first quarter of the year. Those are, first, aircraft maintenance is significantly frontloaded this year, compared to back loaded in 2018. Second, the depreciation impact of 11 E175s that we took in the last four months of the year. And third, our Flight Path employee workshops, which ran from last fall and go through late April.  On the capacity side of the equation, it\u2019s our lowest growth quarter of the year and that growth is heavily weighted to higher CASM regional flying. Big picture, our costs will be up in the first half of the year, but should be about flat in the second half of the year. Our teams worked hard on the 2019 cost plan, and I have confidence in their ability to deliver on it, especially after the great performance in 2018. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.24 billion in cash. Total cash flow from operations for the year was $1.3 billion ex-merger-related costs, while net CapEx was about $960 million over the same period, resulting in roughly $370 million of free cash flow again ex-integration costs. Operating cash flow of course should improve in 2019, although the increase will be tempered somewhat by the higher cash tax rate. Our current expectation is 19%. However, CapEx declines to $750 million with lower fleet grow. So, free cash flow should still increase materially versus 2018. And we\u2019re sharing some of that immediately with our owners. As you've seen, today we announced the sixth increase to our dividend since we initiated it in 2013. We\u2019re raising our dividend by 9% to $0.35 per share per quarter or $1.40 per year, representing about $175 million of cash that will be paid to our owners and increasing our yield to about 2.1%. We\u2019re also planning to repurchase about $50 million of our stock in 2019 essentially offsetting dilution, however this plan is flexible. Our number one capital allocation priority continues to be fortifying our already strong balance sheet. In 2018 alone, we reduced on balance sheet debt by $470 million. With leases, our year-end adjusted debt-to-cap stood at 47%, 6 points better than at the end of 2017, and fully 12 points lower than the end of 2016. We expect to achieve our leverage target of debt-to-cap in the low-to-mid 40% range by the end of 2019. Here are four other data points that underscore our balance sheet strength. First, [indiscernible] recently reaffirmed our investment grade credit ratings. Second, we have 95 unencumbered aircrafts valued at about $1.7 billion. Third, we have $400 million of undrawn credit facilities, and finally our defined benefit pension plans, which have all been close to new entrants since January 2010 are 84% funded. Our long-term owners tell us they value a conservative balance sheet and it\u2019s been a hallmark of our past success. Let me close by reiterating a theme you\u2019ve heard several times today. We're working hard to improve the financial returns this business is generating. We\u2019ve shared with you our longer-term goal of achieving a 13% to 15% margin and 2019 should be a nice down payment on that. Our top line will benefit from merger synergies, slower growth, maturing markets and new revenue initiatives. Our loyalty is growing, our on- board profit is becoming more consistent. Our class plan is aggressive, but achievable. Our fleet is fuel efficient. Fuel prices are reasonable and our balance sheet is strong. And this team is very optimistic about what 2019 holds. And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hi, good afternoon. First question on the Transatlantic, I\u2019ve been trying to understand with the fleet changes, I realize that it\u2019s still pretty early stage with kind of swapping the Boeing and the Airbus Aircraft, I\u2019m wondering what the core underlying trend is in the Transatlantic and the markets where you have swapped if you can assume the improvement you would have expected?\nAndrew Harrison: Hi, Savi, it\u2019s Andrew. Essentially as we said in our prepared remarks, we\u2019ve pretty much affected the cross-fleeting that we wanted to do, especially in the New York area. I think what we see here, traditionally Q1 is our weakest quarter, and so actually what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve added capacity in a trough period on the transcon, so we really expect to see the real benefit from this really start to kick in March and going forward. So, we feel really good about these changes and they are a key part of course of our revenue synergies for 2019.\nSavi Syth: Thanks. And on the capacity front, I notice it\u2019s still early on in the year, but I notice that 2020 was kind of updated from like 4% to 3% to 4%, just wondering how you are thinking about capacity and what the flexibility is, especially with kind of few pulling back that I know a lot of uncertainty here on the macro front. Just high-level thoughts on growth here.\nAndrew Harrison: Again, this is Andrew. I think one of the things that we feel about the capacity increase for this year as you know we give a range. I think one of the things that for 2020 is also looking at what happens to the environment, how is that going to continue on, where are we at with our revenue generation and of course we have also, with multiple fleets we have pilots that are going through training, and so pilots will be another key area that we need to look at, but it will have a margin effect on our growth getting people through the training house as we continue to grow.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Thank you.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Savi.\nOperator: The next question will come from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg: Hi, good afternoon guys. I guess two questions here. Andrew, you called out the weakness in Hawaii, I think you said that was like 125 basis points of RASM headwind in the fourth quarter, how was that trending into the March quarter? Is it similarly under pressure or is it \u2013are we seeing some improvement?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes. I think for modelling you might want to just carry that forward into the first quarter. Capacity is less elevated in the first quarter, but also given especially geography wise the first quarter, especially for California is a weaker time, so I would just carry forward the same weakness that you saw that we have advised in the fourth into the first and then will be interesting as we get into the stronger months and capacity growth has started to slow mostly where we go from there.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And then just one other question on, you know I think \u2013 not even I think, at your Investor Day, you kind of hinted at or maybe even said that it seems like at the end of the day joining one world would make a lot of sense for Alaska and yet, you know when I look at just the partnerships that you announced over the last quarter or two with Japan Airlines, Aer Lingus, Finnair, Fiji, many of those companies are either in one world or associated with one world, at some point would it be better off for you just to have lots of bilateral relationships with one-world carriers, and not go through all of the \u2013 maybe complications in pain of joining the alliance, maybe like what Aer Lingus is doing, where they are taking that approach where they are going into the JV, but for now they\u2019re keeping one-world on the side? I mean, what\u2019s better for you from kind of Alaska\u2019s perspective?\nAndrew Harrison: Mike, I am going to put you on my alliance time because I\u2019m very impressed with your detailed knowledge of Airlines, that was impressive. I think what we had mentioned was really talking about one-world connect, we\u2019re not considering a full membership, so connect is a much lighter version and you still need your bilaterals, so, I mean, but your points are very fair one. I think if you look at our portfolio, the majority of our partners \u2013 our one-world partners where we have good bilateral agreements with them and we also have some independent. So, I think, as we look at this again, we\u2019re very much just in the research phase, but we\u2019re just looking to see if there is any benefit with all our partners, including American, but if there is not, we think we\u2019ve got a good strategy as it stands today.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay great. Thank you.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: The next question will come from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good afternoon everyone. First question maybe a little bit of a bigger picture question, maybe for Andrew, but how have you seen maybe your booking curve change since integrating Virgin America haven't you seen it move out further, if that gives you a little bit more visibility or are just more closer and given the corporate focus there and I guess as a follow-up to that, how have you had to just some of your revenue management practices because of that change in booking curve?\nAndrew Harrison: I might start it of, and I know Shane obviously saw that for a long time, but I will say that a lot of the changes we made to any of the booking curves we made earlier on Virgin America used to take a lot of bookings more closer in, our traditional comfort level was to take them further out and so we adjusted our booking practices there, but certainly we pull out a lot more Transcon markets now that are very, very competitive and so the JFK, LA is a classic example. So, we\u2019ve had to adjust how we look at that and how we book that, but I don\u2019t know Shane if you\u2019ve got any other commentary to add.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Andrew. I would just add, I mean Andrew nailed it spot on, the trade-off is if you hold out for yield or not, and then you sort of hope that it comes and when it doesn't you feel bad about your strategy and when it does you feel great and we traditionally like to manage that just further out the booking curve. So, we have seen the California booking curve get a little bit longer. The downside of all of these changes is whenever you change your approach you usually get it a little bit wrong out of the gate, which gives you an opportunity to optimize. So, I think part of what you're seeing now towards us is getting smarter and smarter about this market and managing it better.\nAndrew Didora: Interesting, thank you. And then my second question for Brad, you mentioned Horizon in your prepared remarks and that\u2019s clearly an entity that continues to drive your growth into 2019, but then kind of eases as you get later in the year. I think it\u2019s about a year or so ago you made some of the management changes at Horizon, can you maybe talk to how those changes have performed versus your expectations and what initiatives you have for Horizon as you look into 2019? Thanks.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Andrew. Thanks very much for asking that question. You know a little bit of history, despite the fact that horizon has been part of Air Group for 37 years now, there actually has not been nearly enough sort of management back and forth between the two companies over most of those years and so you end up with cultures that were more different than we were comfortable with, and we did get ourselves into a [mess operationally] a year and a half ago and Gary Beck is sitting in the room right now, came back after a super successful tenure as Alaska's Vice President of Flight Operations to become CEO of Horizon, and he took Constance von Muehlen with him, took John Hornibrook, [indiscernible]. A terrific team of leaders. And I think the turnaround of Horizon has been stunning. They are totally fine with \u2013 and it\u2019s not that the industry doesn't have \u2013 somebody has to work on Alaska, pilot attraction is something we all need to think about, but I was actually down in the schoolhouse a week ago, I guess it was a week ago today, and we\u2019re super impressed by what I saw and I just want to say this leadership team has done an incredible job. They\u2019ve also, a lot\u2019s going on with their fleet. Gary you\u2019re up to 26 E175s. So, in a short period of time you\u2019ve gone from being an all Q400 to pretty soon you will be 30/30. 30 E175 and 30 Q400s. So, thanks for the easy question Andrew and it\u2019s a chance to heap a little praise on the group of people that have done just a fantastic job.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you, Brad. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hi, thanks. Just with respect to your commentary about more conservatism with respect to close-in, are the off-peak periods behaving differently into the first quarter than they did in the fourth quarter sort of ex-shutdown impact if there was a way to isolate that? Or is it just sort of conservatism given the fact that the March quarter is highly dependent upon March?\nBrad Tilden: Yes. I think really the off-peak periods where there is really not a lot of demand and you see this across the industry, as the fares go down to the lowest level. And really January and February apart from after the first week of January and Martin Luther King Day and a few other, January and February are really quite weak. So, really \u2013 and this has just been history for us, but as a shared previously with the acquisition of Virgin America, our first quarter got heavier again, as far as our weakest period. So, we continue to work on that. As far as government shutdown goes per say, we have not seen any material impact at all to date as it relates to fares and travel although down the road and if Ben wants to comment that, if this continues there will be some real challenges operationally.\nBen Minicucci: Andrew it\u2019s exactly that. Everyone across the country is seeing some challenges along the TSA front and we're just hopeful this thing gets solved soon and things get back on track.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just to clarify, you had some off-peak in the fourth quarter as well, where you not seeing that in the fourth quarter?\nAndrew Harrison: So, what happened and I think this is general, we have seen but there was good fare momentum in the fourth quarter and then be sort of got in coming up to Christmas where the fares all collapsed and came down, business came down as the industry tried to fill seats coming up to Christmas and the softer period. The business fares have sort of come back, the leisure fares took a little longer to come back. So, again, even as we look at fare filings and the industry is putting 4% more capacity in general in the first quarter, I think it\u2019s still finding its way.  So, I think what I'm really trying to say is, there was a little more confidence in the fourth quarter just with the stability. As we moved into the first quarter and saw what happened over the Christmas holiday season and the fare filing activity in the first couple of weeks of January, we\u2019ve just been a little bit more cautious about where this is going to settle out.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Fair enough. And then just, can you give us an update on your thinking and analysis with respect to potentially moving to a single fleet type down the road? Thanks for taking the questions.\nMark Eliasen: Hi Duane, this is Mark Eliasen. As you know, we\u2019ve got 37 mainline claims on orders. So, we\u2019re looking at the fleets. We\u2019ve said for a long time that the question is whether we return to all Boeing or we continue with the mix of 321neo\u2019s and a Boeing fleet, but we don't have to make that decision right away. We're growing at eight airplanes a year, you can see that we\u2019re 37. We\u2019ve got some time to do it. So, we're learning a lot about Airbus as we operate that Airplane. We're learning a lot about the 321neo, and the way Airbus supports its customers and its launch customers. So, as we evaluate the plane, we\u2019ll be able to make a good decision and we're looking forward to that decision.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: The next question will come from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Hi, everybody. Thank you, operator for the time. To Andrew, this time around you didn\u2019t talk too much about your Frequent Flyer Program and your credit card acquisitions in the fourth quarter, and I was just wondering if there, you could just give us a little update on that or if it\u2019s gotten to the point where acquisitions slowed?\nAndrew Harrison: No, thanks Helane. That\u2019s a very fair question. I mean, the reality is that the trend that I have been sharing all year has continued. I think, maybe just feeling a little bit like continuing to be very, highly transparent about that program is probably doesn't serve us well in the long run and I think initially we did that just as a lot of the concerns over the brand and the Virgin America and the integration. We wanted to just make sure people felt really solid about our program and \u2013 but it has continued to perform, and as I made in my prepared remarks fourth quarter revenues for mileage plan which includes credit card and redemptions was about 13%. And so, it was very, very quite significant.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you very much. That\u2019s really all my questions.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Helane.\nHelane Becker: Sure guys.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Thanks. Hi, everybody. You know I love competing with Michael Linenberg, so obviously submitting my resume to the Airlines team as well. Just turning to the Q1 RASM guide, you know it\u2019s obviously helped by the high level of regional flying, you said at the Easter shift, which also bodes well for the second quarter, but you know, ordinarily is that regional contribution wanes in the second half? You'd expect RASM trends would moderate somewhat as well, I mean that\u2019s just kind of the math, I'm not asking you to necessarily endorse that. I am trying to understand though whether you believe that your revenue initiatives could offset that phenomenon, which in turn would suggest that quarter-to-quarter RASM trends would be reasonably consistent with one another throughout the year. Any thoughts on that?\nAndrew Harrison: That you can go into the RM Department, but so couple of things. On the regional side, a lot of the new markets that we\u2019ve been growing in these maturing markets where all in the regional side of the house. And also, with all these new regional aircraft, they are actually adding I think our first class ASMs are actually up 8%, excuse me, our revenues are up 8% for the first-class cabin, 6% growth. So, the regional fleet although it has \u2013 have higher unit revenues, but was also bringing a lot of premium class cabin as well, which we want to continue to sell.  I think, so I still see upside as we continue to mature the markets that the regional network is flying and we bring more and more first-class product into the market and Premium Class. And then to your other point, though, you know, first quarter, if you look at our revenue initiatives, whether it was the first bag fee, which came out December 7, Saver Fare came out January 7, the cross-fleeting, which I referred to earlier. We're on a very steep ramp-up during the first quarter. So, we still have a lot of confidence in the revenue initiatives, but it's really the second quarter and beyond that they will really take full hold than you really start to see them come through a unit revenue guidance.\nJamie Baker: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And second, just on the choppiness in regard to close-in pricing and this follows somewhat on Duane's question, but did you afford, maybe I missed it, any geographic commentary around those comments? Is it broad-based, was it SoCal? Transcon? I mean, the comments did catch me a little bit by surprise. Maybe just a little bit additional geographic color, if any?\nAndrew Harrison: I think just depending on the markets, but in general, I think we saw that across the system as its related to \u2013 and to varying degrees depending on the market. But if you go take a look, the industry has been very active in fares. You just look back and even December through to January, there's been a lot of fare adjustments coming up and down and again, just given our network and where we compete, we've just been a little bit cautious with that because it'll fall where it falls. But nothing specific geographic that would drive any specific comment there.\nJamie Baker: Perfect. Thank you very much gentlemen. Take care.\nOperator: The next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRajeev Lalwani: Hi, good afternoon. Andrew, actually just picking up on some of the last couple of questions as far as the volatility in close-in fares, what do you attribute it to? You've been doing it for a while. Does it maybe indicate that there's a problem with demand coming or there is competitive issues? Just some thoughts given your history.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, Rajeev, you know I just think that really \u2013 again, I'm only speaking from our corner of the world and you've seen everyone's guidance as we go into the first quarter. I just think there was a pretty decent shift between, you know as we went up to the Christmas period and then people getting ready for the first quarter and especially January and February, and we just saw a lot of fare activity. Fuel is also been moving around a lot. It's just been very active. I'm not saying it's actually good or bad. It's just a little volatile. So, as we look ahead, we expect things to calm down, especially as we start to move into the backend of the first quarter and move into a more solid period in the second.\nRajeev Lalwani: Okay. And then on lower fuel. I think the last time around we saw a big move down. Alaska had pushed capacity growth I think a decent amount. Why isn't that in the cards for this year? And then relating to that, this might be for Brandon. Should you keep a lot of the benefit around fuel, does that mean you could maybe start a buyback program before the end of the year?\nBrad Tilden: So, Rajeev, you're asking with lower fuel why aren't we growing more? Just to make sure I understand your question.\nRajeev Lalwani: Yes. And you've done that historically, right? That was a couple of years ago.\nBrad Tilden: Yes. Maybe just to take a step back and get everybody up to speed with how we're thinking about things. We are a higher growth airline. That's been our history. We bought Virgin America, we added a huge amount of capacity following that to sort of activate those markets. And the language I would use is we've throttled back here to \u2013 enable the markets an opportunity to catch up a little bit. And also, there's a lot going on internally here as we get pilots moving around, training, getting the right pilots trained on the right aircraft. There's aircraft going through interior mods that sort of affect pilot supply by aircraft type as well. So, I just think the way to think of it now is 2% this year, we're just sort of settling in a little bit. I think this is the wrong call to ask us really about growth in 2020 and beyond. We're not locked in on 3% to 4%. What we're saying is, this is the right amount of growth for us right now as we look at our business. As we get into the summer months, if we think \u2013 you know this is how we think. If we believe we can create incremental value for the owners of this business by growing, we will grow as we've done over the years. Personally, I'm an optimist. We all believe in our competitive advantage. I believe in our route network, all of that. I think we're going to find those conditions. When we find them, whether it's summer \u2013 I don't think we really want to be put in that box right now. But that's how we're looking at the world. Brandon, I think there was a related question on if we didn't grow, would we buy back more stock and I'll let you answer that.\nBrandon Pedersen: I think the question, Rajeev if I heard it correctly was if cash flows turn out to be stronger than maybe we're expecting because of the lower fuel prices, would we start doing more repurchase with that excess cash flow? And the answer is maybe. In the prepared remarks, we said, we were going to repurchase $50 million of stock this year, but we also said, this plan is flexible. And people should know, this plan is flexible. We're really focused on the fortress balance sheet that we had in getting back to it. We're damn close, but if we want to do more share buyback with excess cash flow, we certainly have the ability.\nRajeev Lalwani: That was it. Thank you, guys.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Rajeev.\nOperator: The next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hi, everyone. So, I'm not sure I'm prepared to throw my hat in the ring with Mike and Jamie there, but I also have a question on global partners. At the Investor Day, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe you mentioned that you consider selling partner airline tickets without an Alaska connection in the future. Do you have any update here? I think you said, it could be as early as this year.\nAndrew Harrison: Hi, Katie. Nice to hear from you. Thanks for your question. So, we are continuing that route. In fact, we are actually testing that as we speak. In fact, if you were to maybe look up San Francisco to Sydney on Qantas on alaskaair.com, you would actually find a flight. We're not heavily marketing that right now. There're limitations to it. You can't buy first-class or premium-class yet and a few other things, but we are well into our trials with our partners in talking to many of our partners about starting to sell their metal on alaskaair.com.\nCatherine O'Brien: Really interesting. And then, I would assume \u2013 would that be above the 330 million in initiatives you've got going for this year?\nAndrew Harrison: Well, that's an interesting question. Here's what I'll say is that, we have loyalty and we have initiatives around loyalty and of course selling internationally is going to be part of that portfolio. In fact, [our code share] in interline traffic actually increased 9% in the first quarter. So, our network and working with our partners has actually been a real asset for us.\nBrad Tilden: The real strategy there, Katie, is to grow our loyalty program and sort of grow \u2013 be able to be a one-stop shop, a full-service provider. I don't think that selling Qantas is going to bring huge incremental revenue to Alaska, but being a one-stop shop for our customers does have big value to us as a business.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. Thanks. And if I could just maybe ask one quick follow-up. What inning would you say we're in just in terms of network refinement, cross-fleeting, all of the initiative \u2013 like you kind of had to get under your belt after the reservation system cut over last spring?\nBen Minicucci: Hey, Katie, it's Ben Minicucci. Great question. I think \u2013 as you heard from the tone of the call \u2013 we're feeling pretty darn optimistic coming out of Q4. We're two years into this integration. What's up this year is still not all complete, but we're going downhill is the way I would describe it. So, whether it's the seventh inning, eighth inning, we're going downhill. We've got some major systems still to integrate, like our dispatch system, pilot crew scheduling, maintenance systems are big ones. And from a customer standpoint, it's just converting all these Airbus to the Alaska interior and getting that complete. So, by the end of the year, we're done. But we're just \u2013 we feel like we've got the wind at our back and we're going downhill, we're feeling pretty good.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thanks so much for that guys.\nBrad Tilden: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Hi, everybody. This Love Field situation is becoming kind of a mess between Southwest and Delta. You guys are kind of caught in the middle of it. So, a couple of questions around this. Does the settlement from the Virgin merger contain any contingency language that allows you to leave that place if operating conditions change there \u2013 if this legal case takes a weird turn like some sort of MAC clause? And then how core is that airport to you guys in the long run in the event that happens?\nKyle Levine: Hi, Hunter, this is Kyle. I'll take the first one and then turn it back to Andrew. Our consent decree with the justice department does allow us to move on from those gates if it were ever our wish to do so. The circumstances around that just generally are, the court could order us to have that outcome or we could go propose a solution to justice and they would have a right of refusal over it. But as far as the Dallas Love Field litigation goes, that's not our wish at all. We view those as important property that we purchased from Virgin America. We want to take a good shot at it. Even though we're cooperating with the judges and the other parties, we're standing firm.\nHunter Keay: Okay. That's good enough. Thanks, Kyle. And then, Brandon or Matt; how many employees a year has listened to these earnings calls and how has that changed over the last 12 months? If you sort of adjust for growth and headcount.\nMatt Grady: Hunter, I would say most.\nBen Minicucci: Hunter, I don\u2019t know if we have numbers. Hunter, it is Ben, when I talk to our folks, I think there's just pockets of people who are really interested. They actually own a lot of shares of Alaska. We've got a great ESPP program that they participate in. I know our union leaders to be honest, and we talk to them. They're also listening on the call. And then, to be honest, right after we do this, we rush over to the airport here in about an hour and we do an entire webcast. We kind of summarize what we talked about with all our employees. And then we have 3,000 people listening in. So that's kind of how we think about it.\nBrad Tilden: How about share ownership to while we are talking about this sort of thing, do we \u2013 I saw something recently do we \u2013 do you guys know that figure, it is pretty high. Percentage of our employees that own shares in the company. Hunter, I'm not positive how many listened to the Analyst Call. There are some that do, but when this webcast they'd be a lot more connected to.\nHunter Keay: The nature of the question was, I'm kind of wondering if during the struggles with the stock and the margins if you've found a lot more employees dialing in to these calls over the last 12 to 18 months or so? And whether that's an indicator of sort of morale or confidence or anything like that?\nBen Minicucci: I'll tell you, we talk about it openly. We have these Flight Path workshops that Brad talked about. And when we talk about running a balanced business about taking care of employees and customers and shareholders and communities. When we get to the shareholders we say, look, we've been under pressure honestly in the last 12 months and our job is to get the stock price to a place where we can provide good returns for our owners. So, we are totally transparent with our employees about that. And they understand.\nHunter Keay: That\u2019s great. I appreciate that. Thanks.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks Hunter.\nOperator: The next question will come from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.\nDan McKenzie: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks, guys. Just one housecleaning question on the Saver Fares. Where are you guys at with respect to that average upsell differential today?\nAndrew Harrison: We've not really spoken about that. I think we're only like two-and-a-half weeks into it. But as we said on our prepared remarks, we're very pleased with how it's tracking. And the $100 million that we share with you, we're very, very confident that that will be met this year. On the next quarter call, we'll give more of a brief on that.\nDan McKenzie: I see, Okay. And then, of course at the risk of kicking the dead horse here, just kind of going back to the choppy fares on off-peak demand kind of spread across the network. Should we be thinking that potentially is the link between lower fuel and lower revenue potentially leading to some of that choppiness or is it just over capacity? I guess I'm just trying to get a little bit more clarity. And I guess just related to this, how much of the benefit from lower fuel do you think Alaska can capture this year? Is it 100% of the benefit? 75%? Or something potentially a lot less than that as we kind of think about rolling through the year here?\nAndrew Harrison: Just on the first one \u2013 again, I want to make sure I don't overplay this choppiness. I think really what I've been saying is that just given the switch from the fourth quarter and then into the first quarter and capacity increases that we're seeing industry-wide. I think there's just been active fare management with the fuel moving around. But I think at the end of the day we're still seeing strong demand, our business demand is very, very strong as well. So that's sort of just where we are on that. I don't know \u2013 Brandon or Shane want to answer the fuel question?\nBrandon Pedersen: I mean, just anybody's guess at this point. And it really probably comes down to what happens with fares as you move through the quarter into March and beyond.\nDan McKenzie: I see. Okay. And then I just had one more follow-up here. And that's just really reverts to an earlier question I think maybe from Katie here. In the past, you guys have talked about connecting revenue from connecting widebodies coming into San Francisco from the partners, I guess. Passengers connecting at San Francisco from partners going onto your middle. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on that? What are you seeing? Is it material at this point? Is that something that can get turned on more fully as we kind of move through the year here?\nAndrew Harrison: As Brad shared earlier, the real benefit to Alaska and our loyalty program is not so much the incremental passenger getting of a wide body. It's really more our loyalty members getting access to long haul flights. They stay in our program, they accrue miles on us, they pay tickets on their partners that help our partners. So, it's a really good, strong ecosystem that allows our global partners good feed into the United States, and it allows us good access for our members globally and to earn miles. That's how we look at the world.\nDan McKenzie: Okay, thanks for the clarification. Appreciate that.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks Dan.\nOperator: The next question will come from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks for the time. Andrew, I was going to say thank you for all of the additional detail you provided in our prepared remarks, but then you said you didn't want to be transparent anymore on the loyalty programs, so I'm not going to say thank you. Just on the guidance for 1Q, 4Q initially was 1.5 to 3.5, you ended up at 5, how much of that was close in coming in better than expected? Just trying to get a sense for whether the first quarter RASM guidance was constructed similarly to fourth quarter.\nAndrew Harrison: Well, I think a couple of high level and someone else can jump in. We actually haven't been forecasting unit revenues. We used to be lucky to give you load factors and booking trends and stuff like that. Really, I think it's just in 2018, we've really been forecasting unit revenues for the Street. And with the amount of change in our business \u2013 we went from a three range at one point to a two-point range. So, I think on the fourth quarter there was some strength that came in for sure. But additionally, with all the moving parts in our business, we probably undershot our forecast. But I think as we get more and more of this under our belt, we get more and more confident about how we're forecasting the quarters going forward.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then, Brandon, in the investor day deck you had a capital deployment waterfall for 2019, which showed about 130 million left over for buybacks or more debt reduction. You mentioned the 50 million assumption on the buyback for 2019. Does that imply that there's 50 million left over after all the other uses, CapEx, debt, dividend? I mean, is that a comment on cash flow for the year? Can we plug the 50 million into what's leftover in your waterfall chart and back into your cash flow guidance for the year?\nBrandon Pedersen: Yes. You could kind of back into the cash flow guidance of the year that way because as we were constructing that chart, we were thinking about our likely capital allocation. We tried to give you more clarity on the call today. I think if you just take consensus numbers, for example, and you say that produces roughly $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion of operating cash flow. You got CapEx [of] 750, debt repayments of roughly 300, dividend 175, repo 50 as we've stated. It probably \u2013 I know you've got some integration funding left to do. That probably leaves around $150 million of additional capital that we haven't yet decided what to do with specifically. We could use that for share buybacks or we could take debt to cap down probably another two points.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. So, it's not to imply that your outlook for 2019 cash flow is less than consensus because you're going to have less leftover than what you had in that chart?\nBrandon Pedersen: No. We weren't trying to apply anything like that.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The final question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is actually Matt on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one from me. You talked about in the commentary and a couple times through Q&A about corporate business surge being strong. Is there something from the initiatives at the Investor Day or is this just general strength in kind of business fares we should think about? Any of the initiatives that are coming through from Alaska in this regard?\nAndrew Harrison: Hi, Matt, thanks for the question. Specifically, to the initiatives in the 330, there's not really anything materially baked into that. I think you're going to hear just a tad more from me on a quarterly basis about business given our new expanded network. We have a Vice President of Corporate Sales and we're actually doing a lot of cool stuff with our new network. And just starting to build more muscle there. So, I think part of what you'll hear from us is actually we have better insight now into corporate travel and business, which is a good measure of the economy. So, I think you're just going to hear a little more talk from us about that. It doesn't necessarily mean we have some massive initiative that you should be counting on for the 330.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.\nMatt Grady: Thanks, Brandon. And I want to thank everybody for tuning in for this quarter's call. As we break, I want to also thank Mark Eliasen for a terrific career with Alaska Air Group. This is Mark's last analyst conference call. Mark, you retire next Thursday or something like that. I want to thank you for a fantastic 10 years with this company, 38 conference calls and lots of airplane deals and airplane financing deals. Thanks very much. Talk to you all next quarter, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. This call will be available for future playback at www.alaskaair.com.

My name is Amber, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Matt Grady.\nMatt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Amber. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call today, our CEO, Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business; Andrew Harrison, our Chief Commercial Officer, will share an update on our revenue results and outlook; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will discuss our cost performance and cash flows. Several other members of our management team are also on hand to help answer your questions. Earlier this morning, Alaska Air Group reported third quarter GAAP net income of $217 million. Excluding merger-related costs and mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $237 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.91, ahead of the First Call consensus. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brad.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We are rapidly approaching the two-year mark since our merger closed and while there's still a lot of work ahead of us, we are extremely happy about the pace of progress and we remain confident in our future. We've now completed roughly 90% of the integration milestones and have done so at a pace that is equal to or more rapid than virtually any other merger in the industry. The performance of our core business remains strong and our brand and product are gaining increasing traction in California. As our network investments mature and the merger synergies accelerate, we're doubling down on the disciplines of productivity, teamwork and cost control, disciplines that have been the source of our competitive advantage for many years now. In the third quarter, our financial performance started to turn the corner with our employees delivering unit revenues and unit costs that were both better than plan. We were especially encouraged to see RASM stabilize in the face of multiple headwinds. We expect RASM to inflect positive in the fourth quarter as we begin the steady climb toward the higher margins and higher returns that we believe are achievable with our combined network. As we've discussed, we're not satisfied with our current financial returns. Fuel prices continue to rise and we need to do more to recover these higher costs. One way we've responded is by raising bag fees for the first time in five years, bringing our fees into line with those that are now prevalent in the marketplace. We announced these changes last week and Andrew will discuss them further in just a moment. Stepping back a bit, we see an industry environment that has not yet adequately adjusted to higher fuel prices. We've slowed our growth in 2019, as market dynamics simply don't argue for adding much new capacity. That said, we are comfortable with our current growth and we're very comfortable with our new network footprint. We have a solid plan in place to leverage the many factors within our control and to drive unit revenues and margins higher going forward. We're making it even more granular as we go through the budget process. We're confident that we're on a path to significantly improve our profitability and our free cash flow in both 2019 and 2020. Before I discuss future plans though, I'd like to highlight a few of our team's accomplishments in the third quarter. First, we were proud to win Best U.S. Airline from both Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler and KAYAK. The Cond\u00e9 Nast recognition is especially meaningful, as it continued a tradition. Virgin America had won this award for the past 10 years and now our folks have extended the streak to 11. Second, our operation continues to run well. Our CD zero, or our controllable departures leaving within zero minutes of their scheduled time, improved 90 basis points to an excellent 86.6%. Third, we continue to see operational strength at Horizon where our on-time performance continues to be the best in the industry and where our pilot staffing pipeline is full. Fourth, our mainline pilot seniority list was recently integrated which means that all but one of our workgroups has a single CBA and a single seniority list. And fifth, we achieved a number of additional milestones on the integration front. In August we started repainting the Airbus fleet and we've now repainted 16 of 71 airplanes. And we've also integrated our aircraft movement systems, which means we can now swap between Boeing and Airbus aircraft on short notice. The last accomplishment signals a shift in the type of integration work we're now doing. During the last 22 months we've been busy becoming a single airline. We were aligning hundreds of systems and processes, integrating guest-facing platforms and programs and working with our labor leaders to negotiate single collective bargaining agreements. Now that the vast majority of that groundwork is laid, we're dedicated to realizing the value of our significantly larger platform. For example, our nearly 6,000 flight attendants have been training on both aircraft types for several months now and they'll begin working both types on January 31. This will improve productivity. We're also preparing to fully deploy cross-fleeting by March of next year. This will drive higher revenues and margins and will help us realize another key merger synergy. And third, we begin to reconfigure Airbus cabins this quarter. We'll complete four to five aircraft per month between now and the end of 2019 when the entire fleet will be done. These changes bring with them a number of margin benefits including four additional seats, 10 additional first and premium class seats, a common experience for our guests and new opportunities to upgrade elites. In addition to capturing merger synergies, our plan for the next year includes the pursuit of several revenue and cost initiatives. We've always been proud to run our business in a balanced way where all boats rise as our business succeeds. And these initiatives will help us improve returns for investors as we move from getting the integration done to realizing the benefits of the merger. Some of the levers we're managing to improve profitability include slowing our capacity growth to let our investments mature, increasing segmentation due to the launch of Saver Fares which will produce $100 million in revenue next year, increasing bag fees and other ancillary revenues such as exit row sales which will produce another $100 million in revenue next year, optimizing our larger route network and schedule which is part of our broader plan to capture $130 million in synergies next year, improving the productivity of our operation, and finally controlling management head count through the difficult but we believe necessary step of eliminating some positions. This will save overhead, but more importantly it will improve the speed of decision making and the flow of information throughout our organization. Finally, we're continuing our tradition of maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're on pace to have paid down $800 million or 40% of the debt we took on to purchase Virgin America by year-end. We look forward to discussing each of these opportunities in greater detail at our Investor Day next month. For now let me conclude by saying that we feel confident we're on the road to producing better returns in the quarters ahead as we work together as a single team to demonstrate the true power of our combined company. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Brad, and good morning everyone. Total revenue for the third quarter rose 5% to $2.2 billion on capacity growth of 4.8%. RASM came in flat which was our best unit revenue result in five quarters. We had good progression during the quarter with unit revenues down 1.3% in July but up 0.7% in August and up 0.5% in September. This is only the beginning and we expect our unit revenue momentum to continue as we execute on a number of substantive initiatives to ensure that our recent trajectory continues into the fourth quarter and well beyond. Other bright spots worth a mention include Mileage Plan revenues were up 11%, Premium Class revenues were more than double at 122% and First Class revenues increased 8%. Once we work through some IT issues related to paid upgrades on the Airbus along with Airbus cabin modifications that begin this quarter to increase First Class capacity by 50%, we expect to see significant revenue increases from the front cabin in 2019. Before I get to the outlook though, I'd like to provide some additional color on our third quarter results. First, same-stores, or markets in operation longer than 12 months and representing about 94% of our capacity, delivered positive TRASM of 1.5%. Solid demand and stabilizing and improving close-in pricing across most of our network drove this result. Overall, we were pleased with the quarter's revenues given the 150 basis point headwind created by the higher level of award redemptions across our system which we guided to last quarter and have mitigated going forward. Now turning to new markets, or markets in operation less than 12 months, these negatively impacted RASM by 160 basis points versus the 210 basis points last quarter as new market capacity declined to 6% of capacity from 9% in Q2. New market mix is set to decline again in the fourth quarter to just 3% of ASMs. And by the end of the year we will have fully annualized the 44 markets we started last year when we made a strategic and long-term investment in the relevance of our California network. These markets continue to develop well. We are very pleased with the network foundation we have laid in California today and our focus now is the continuing maturing in the coming months, quarters and years ahead. Looking by region, we see a lot of strength versus last year. Yields are positive in the Pacific Northwest despite high single-digit industry capacity growth and we continue our significant focus on California and are seeing positive momentum across a number of leading longer-term indicators. Specifically, Mileage Plan membership continued its double-digit growth this quarter; credit card acquisitions also grew double digits and well in excess of passenger growth; brand awareness has improved 9 points in the past four months; and international traffic has increased 26% year-over-year now that our California network is accessible to our global partners. We forecast further improvement in all of these metrics as we finalize the integration and bring the guest experience on Boeing and Airbus into full alignment by the end of next year. The only region in our system that is experiencing materially lower pricing today is Hawaii. West Coast ASMs to Hawaii grew 9% in the third quarter and they're set to grow another 8% in the fourth quarter, while filed fares and yields are down significantly year-on-year. Nevertheless, we remain confident that we will be able to weather the softer near-term environment better than our competitors due to the growth of our loyalty program across multiple West Coast origin markets, the additional segmentation we will introduce next year with the Saver Fare and an onboard product that is very well suited for long-haul leisure markets such as Hawaii. So looking to the fourth quarter, we continue to trim our initial capacity plan as we settle into a growth rate of just under 2%, which is where we expect to be for the next few quarters. After years of elevated growth, we are happy with our network footprint and are now focused on optimizing it. Our fourth quarter RASM guidance range of up 1.5% to 3.5% continues the positive trajectory we began in Q3 and will be our best RASM result in six quarters. Our guidance assumes recent strength in close-in pricing will continue and factors in a 125 basis point headwind from soft Hawaii pricing. As we look ahead into 2019, we expect our positive revenue trajectory to continue as we implement a number of new initiatives that should generate in excess of $330 million next year. And to re-summarize some of the things that Brad mentioned, first, we're raising our bag fees for the first time in five years effective December 5 and we estimate that will generate $50 million in incremental revenues next year. Secondly, our synergy opportunities such as credit card growth, cross-fleeting, Airbus fleet modifications will produce an additional $130 million next year. Third, the launch of our Saver Fare product on November 20 will add another $100 million. And then fourth, the other ancillary revenue changes we have already implemented such as exit row sales and demand-based pricing for Premium Class will reach a $50 million run rate next year. In sum, we are optimistic about our revenue outlook. Driving margin improvement through higher RASM is our team's number one priority today and we will achieve it as we reap the benefits of the significant investments we've made in our network, brand, product and loyalty program over the past two years. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, Air Group posted a third quarter adjusted net profit of $237 million or $1.91 per share. Our pre-tax margin was about 14% which was a 6.6 point decline from Q3 of last year. Flat unit revenue performance was certainly positive in light of recent trends but inadequate to recapture much of the higher fuel prices and higher wages and benefits costs resulting from labor agreements we've amended over the last year. Like Q1 and Q2, our unit costs were better than our original guidance despite completing fewer ASMs than we had planned. About $14 million of our better performance came from lower incentive pay accruals as the higher fuel prices take their toll on expected full year profits and we failed to meet certain other non-financial metrics that are part of our annual goals-based plan that we call PBP or performance based pay. In addition, we had approximately $10 million of expense shift from Q3 into Q4 as the timing of certain maintenance and marketing activities was delayed versus prior plan. Yet, even accounting for these two items leaves more than a point of CASMex true cost outperformance in the quarter. This is partially a testament to the growth of the loyalty program, since more bookings are coming directly through our website and on our credit card today than at this time last year, which is our lowest cost form of distribution. But it also illustrates the hard work of our leaders and other employees who have delivered better productivity and have embraced the back-to-basics culture of frugality and cost discipline that has made us successful for many years. As mentioned, fuel continues to be a substantial headwind with per gallon costs rising 30%. Higher fuel prices alone reduced our pre-tax margin by 5 points, or about three-quarters of our year-over-year margin decline. Without the $12 million net benefit from our hedging program, higher fuel would have cost us an additional 55 bps of pre-tax margin. Consistent with our standard hedging process, we currently have 50% of our planned fuel consumption hedged over the next six months and our average strike price during that period is $70 a barrel. We expect Q4 unit costs to be up roughly 3.6% on a 1.4% increase in capacity, bringing our full year CASMex increase to 3.2% on 5.3% capacity growth. This compares favorably to our initial guide of up 3.5% on capacity growth of 6.5%. Bottom line, we're doing a good job managing costs this year with most of our divisions forecast to come in better than their original plans. We've talked in the last couple of calls about the rigor with which we've been planning for next year and how we've been laying the groundwork for the 2019 budget for several months now. Well, the 2019 budget process is now in full swing and we're leveraging opportunities for cost reduction in a number of areas, including network and schedule optimization, labor and aircraft productivity, hotel and healthcare costs, and reducing overhead. Some investors have asked whether 2% growth is a negative for our business because it will put pressure on unit costs. It is true, 2% growth will put pressure on unit costs, but 2% capacity growth is the right answer for 2019 margins, especially in light of our rapid growth in recent years, and growing faster than 2% when the environment simply doesn't justify more capacity than that just to take pressure off unit costs would be irresponsible. We'll provide more details on our 2019 unit cost plan at Investor Day next month. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash. Total cash flow from operations for the first nine months of the year was $1.05 billion excluding merger-related costs while net CapEx was about $550 million over the same period. This resulted in $0.5 billion of free cash flow. The free cash flow we're generating has enabled us to continue to re-deleverage our balance sheet. Through the first nine months of the year, we've reduced on-balance sheet debt by nearly $550 million. It's also noteworthy and bears repeating that we'll have paid off nearly 40% or a net of $800 million of the $2 billion that we borrowed to acquire Virgin America less than two years after deal close. That improves our balance sheet but also saves us more than $30 million in annual interest expense. I want to give a shout out to our treasury team. Over the last two months they've taken advantage of our balance sheet and today's credit markets to refinance or restructure $1.1 billion worth of our on-balance sheet debt. This effort will continue into the fourth quarter and when complete will lower interest expense in 2019 to the tune of $4 million. I also want to acknowledge our partner banks who worked cooperatively with us on this initiative. With leases, our quarter-end adjusted debt-to-cap stood at 49%, 3 points lower than last quarter and it should end the year at around the same level. Continuing to strengthen our conservative investment-grade balance sheet is our number one capital allocation priority right now. As we've repaid debt balances, we've also returned $155 million to shareholders during the first nine months of the year via the dividend and share repurchases. And we still expect that number to exceed $200 million by year-end, consistent with our initial plan. Let me close by offering some higher level summary thoughts. First, most of the major merger integration milestones are behind us and we're now squarely focused on two big things: culture and improving our financial performance. Second, the slower growth for 2019 will let us digest the tremendous growth we've had over the last few years. Third, our unit revenues are inflecting to positive and we have specific plans that will add $330 million of new revenue to the business in 2019. Fourth, our renewed back-to-basics focus on cost is evident and we're going to tightly manage costs again in 2019. And finally, the initiatives above give us line of sight to higher profitability in 2019. This will produce higher cash flow and when combined with lower CapEx will produce higher free cash flow which we can use to further re-delever the balance sheet and ultimately improve the cash returns back to our owners. And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: Savi Syth of Raymond James, your line is open.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Good morning, Savi.\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Hi, Savi.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: You laid out a lot of initiatives that should be \u2013 different initiatives that should be kind of being a nice tailwind next year. Could you talk a little bit about the progression as you go through the year on how those build?\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Hey Savi, this is Andrew. I think by, probably as you go into the second quarter, we should be pretty much at full run rate. The Saver Fares will kick in and really be up and running for sales beginning January 1. Bag fees are already going in and there's a booking curve happened. So, I would say that we'll start off a little lighter in the first quarter but as we go into the second quarter, we should be at full pace.\nOperator: Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank, your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, good morning everyone. Two questions here. I think, Brad, you basically said you're at a point now where you're comfortable with the network and I guess there were, what, 44 city pairs that were added, but there was also some culling, some cutting of frequency in some city pairs. Are we at a point now where going forward \u2013 and I guess maybe this is even the question for Andrew as well \u2013 that we're not going to see anything more material with respect to the network, like the big changes have occurred and this is the network of 2019 and beyond?\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. Michael, this is Andrew. That's right. I think if you look at the culling, we cleaned up Dallas Love Field to the East Coast. We took care of our Mexico City slots which weren't going to be long-term winners for us. And as we've shared previously, the network we inherited from Virgin America, we've made significant changes there. So, we feel really good about the network. Our big opportunity \u2013 Ben may comment on this \u2013 on the schedule, but also just the marketing times of our network and getting our flights leaving at the times we want them to leave is our next big opportunity.\nBenito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: And, Mike, also, we talked about the cross-fleeting of airplanes, putting the right airplanes in the right markets. So what we're doing by Q1 is making sure we deploy the bigger airplanes on the right markets and the small airplanes on the right markets as well.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then just my second question, you did a really nice job laying out all the different revenue initiatives next year, $330 million or exceeding $330 million but you also threw out some things that clearly are going to benefit on the cost side. I mean, Ben, you just mentioned cross-fleeting, your flight attendants are going to be working under a single contract January next year, you'll be able to sort of mix and match, that's obviously going to help on the cost side. Is there a number out there that we should use for the cost savings in 2019?\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Mike, it's Brandon, maybe I'll take that one. No, not at this point. We do have a lot of stuff going on but as I said in my prepared remarks, we're still working hard on the budget and we'll have more to say about that at Investor Day.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Hey, thanks. Not to start exactly where Mike left off, but obviously lower growth has been discussed as a headwind, but from a high level, could you just discuss the tailwinds that you see? For example, you've adjusted the plan lower at least a couple of times this year and my guess is there's some costs associated with that, with those mid-course corrections. Can you just give us your list of tailwinds that you see?\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Duane, hi, it's Brandon. Maybe I'll start with that. I mean, certainly the biggest tailwind to that is just the variable costs that come with the business and just the lack of startup costs and things like that, training costs I would say are a big one. You do have a certain element of the cost structure that's fixed and obviously with lower capacity growth, there'll be pressure on that, but to the extent that there are variable costs both on an ongoing basis and then costs that we incur in anticipation of further growth, those will be certainly mitigated in 2019.\nBenito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: And, Duane, it's Ben. As you heard some of the things that are coming together with the integration in terms of systems coming together and labor groups coming together, for example, our flight attendants will be flying together by the end of January of 2019, that drives productivity back into our business. So as we bring systems together and we start aligning the operations and how we run it, those are going to be tailwinds for us in 2019.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Thanks. And then just for my follow-up, on Hawaii, I wonder if you could provide a little more detail historically, because capacity has been up there for a while. You had a high rates of growth from an industry perspective 1Q, Q2. My guess is the industry was absorbing it. You've had some non-recurring events here, volcanoes, hurricanes and maybe there's some lingering impact. But maybe could you provide some longer-term perspective on Hawaii? And you've seen competitors come, you've seen competitors go, typically capacity finds a level. Maybe the incumbents have overshot a bit here. Would love some more fleshed out thoughts on Hawaii. Thank you.\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. That's a really good question. And you just said it. I think for those who've been in Hawaii, and we've been there 11 years now, Hawaii really follows supply and demand of seats. And there's been an escalation of industry seats over the last few quarters and that will continue, and we've seen what that has done to the revenue environment. I think specifically to us, a couple of important things to note. Number one is that we serve Hawaii from eight gateways off the West Coast, and many of those all four islands on a nonstop basis. So, we have very much \u2013 have our flights not anchored in any single or specific city. But what's really exciting I think is you heard about on the initiatives, as we roll out, many of these will directly impact the economics in a very positive way of our Hawaii routes, and especially with our onboard product now, with satellite coming onboard, with the Premium Class seating, First Class seating, food and beverage programs both in the main cabin, we feel really good about our product, our network and the incremental revenues coming into 2019 that will help us deal with some of the softness as the industry finds its water level.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Thank you.\nMatt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Duane.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, gentlemen.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Good morning, Rajeev.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Two questions, a RASM one and then a CASM one. Andrew, I'll start with you. You're seeing a nice inflection in unit revenues here in the fourth quarter. Would it be unfair to assume that you can just build on some of these numbers as we go into next year and then maybe just add on top of the 4Q levels the 3 to 4 points of revenue initiatives that you're seeing? Is that too optimistic or too aggressive?\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: No, Rajeev, I'll give you my personal views. But I think we are going to continue to ramp. I mean, I think if you just look at the industry's revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, I think our guidance is starting to nestle right in there amongst many of the ranges. And if you take into account all the real revenue initiatives that are kicking in as we speak, I would personally expect us to start to outperform the industry in unit revenue increases as we go into the first quarter.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. And then, Brandon, a question for you on the CASM side. So in the fourth quarter you've got 1%, 2% capacity growth and you're seeing 3.5 points of unit cost pressures or an increase there. Can you just help break that down? And I'm assuming we shouldn't be using that as a run rate for 2019 to maybe think of some of the headwinds associated with lower growth. I think you get where I'm going.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. Hi. Yeah, I totally get where you're going. It really just is a timing thing. I don't think the Q4 CASM guide should have surprised anybody, because our full year CASM guide really remains unchanged. When you put together a business plan and you make estimates of what certain things are going to land in certain quarters, and stuff is just slipping into the fourth quarter. So it's really timing more of anything else, not indicative of where we think we're going to be long term on the CASM guide with lower capacity.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then within that 3.5 points, how much is timing? Can you parse that out a bit?\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: You know what? If I went back to our original CASM guide for the fourth quarter \u2013 which I don't have in front of me, I bet it's probably \u2013 I would say it's probably most of it. Hold on, I'm looking at something here.\nChristopher M. Berry - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: This is Chris. About half of the increase in CASM really came from the decline in capacity. And then the other, we got about $10 million, $15 million worth of shift in timing of costs into the fourth quarter. So those two things together pretty much get to your CASM guide for the fourth quarter.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thank you.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning, everybody. A follow-up to Rajeev's question which was a follow-up to Duane's question, which was a follow-up to Mike's question. I know you don't want to give a precise cost guide, you're holding something back for Investor Day, that's fine. But I can't think of a time since standalone United that an airline was ever able to materially decelerate without seeing a substantive year-on-year increase in ex-fuel CASM, and they only pulled it off \u2013 this was quite some time ago \u2013 because they punted all of their 737 Classics. So, obviously that's not an option here. If ex-fuel CASM goes up 3% this year, which is the guide, isn't it a foregone conclusion that next year goes up more than this, it's just a question of magnitude?\nShane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Hey, Jamie, it's Shane Tackett. Love your questions. I think maybe I'd just start higher level. We spend something like $5.5 billion on non-fuel costs, and natural sort of inflation of that might be, I don't know, call it 5%, something like $300 million. I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that we have to go up $300 million next year, and that's sort of where \u2013 that's where our mindset has been, that's what Brandon has talked about throughout the year, that's what we're alluding to as we lay out cost initiatives. Similar to a list of revenue initiatives that were very well laid out by Andrew, we just need to do the exact same thing with costs. The other thing that I think you can appreciate is as we've gone through the integration and merger, there's just a lot of potential opportunity to go in and look at areas that got a little bit ahead of themselves the last couple of years.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Can't blame a guy for trying. Second, on the segmentation, and this is somewhat similar to what I asked last quarter, but many of your \u2013 well, not many \u2013 your peers have stumbled out of the gate with basic economy. Do you plan to roll out Saver Fares all at once on January 1? It sounds like that's the plan. I'm just wondering if staggering the rollout might be an option that would minimize execution risk.\nShane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Hey, Jamie, this is Shane again. And I might speak to this, I've been sort of principally involved with it. We are going to do a \u2013 what we're calling a soft launch on November 7 where we will start selling Saver Fares in a small subset of markets for flying in December and we'll use those lessons learned throughout December to figure out if it makes sense to launch fully on January 1. And it probably won't be January 1, it'll be like the 10th, we'll get through the holiday returns or if we need to go at a little slower pace. But I will say, as is often the case, we go a little slower on these sorts of things, and the benefit of that is we've been able to learn from others that have gone before us and so, we should be able to get here quicker than others have had in the past.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And just super quick follow-up. Are you going to disclose those markets or is it up to us to find them? I mean we \u2013 and which we can do, I mean, anybody can. It's just trial and error.\nShane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. No, I think we won't \u2013 we'll disclose them once we've got sort of the final decision on where they're going to be. We'll have Matt follow up with you all.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, cool. Thank you, everybody.\nMatt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thank you, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen Securities.\nHelane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, operator. Hi, team. Thanks for taking the time. When we look at the changes that you guys were talking about in terms of the retrofit of the fleet, where are we seeing that on the income statement? And is there a reason why, or is it in that line item for maintenance that was up 22% in the last quarter?\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Helane, it's Brandon. Good morning. In terms of the retrofit costs, those are capital and so you'll see those in CapEx, which will ultimately flow through in depreciation once those mods go into service. There's really nothing in the maintenance line per se related to reconfiguration of Airbus airplanes.\nHelane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Then was there a reason why those costs were up so much in the last quarter?\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: I mean, certainly there's reasons. It was just really timing of various activities and some of it is the power-by-the-hour deal that is, on a year-over-year basis, driving some of that increase. But we've talked about that a couple of quarters in a row now.\nHelane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, got you. All right. Well, thanks very much. Good luck. See you next month.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi. Folks, you guys are probably disappointed not to pay out PBP at target, and I'm kind of curious to know how you're thinking about setting PBP levels next year. Are you going to set them low? You like to set them generally sort of conservatively so you can make payments. I know that. But how are you preliminarily thinking about setting PBP targets and how should I think about that variable incentive pay line next year if you set them really low?\nBenito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Hunter, it's Ben. I think in terms of payout, we are going to be above target for 2018. So I just want to correct that.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Oh, okay.\nBenito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. So we're going to be above target. I think our philosophy hasn't changed in terms of how we set our performance goals. We want them to be aggressive and reachable. Like if you look at the last nine years, we've been about a month's pay. It's a little lower this year. I mean, fuel has been a big issue for us. And some of the other targets, we didn't miss. But I think we're looking hard at those goals. We're setting targets right now. And I think I personally feel good and where we're going to hit them. Just in terms of context, at least 20% of the PBP goals are non-financial elements like safety and customer service. So, there's always a good balance in terms of how we set them.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. And then a little bit more on Hawaii and Saver Fares to marry these two things up a little bit. How are you thinking about the appetite for those fares in Hawaii? And was one of the reasons why Hawaii might be soft right now is because of some of that basic version that's being deployed that you could see in filings of course by your competitors maybe ahead of your Saver Fare launch? Is that one of the issues that you think maybe you're optimistic that can get cleaned up pretty quickly once Saver Fares are in that market, if that makes any sense?\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah, I think it does, Hunter. I think what you're saying actually is system-wide for us. Our hands are a little bit tied behind our back because we don't offer Saver Fares. And so our competitors, one in four times they're getting an extra $25 to $35 more than we are. And that will be rectified going forward next year, and obviously we've seen that on Hawaii across all our major competitors.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thanks.\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thank you.\nMatt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Hunter.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Thanks, guys. Andrew, I wonder if you can clarify the positive RASM result in the Northwest despite high single-digit capacity. I wouldn't have guessed that that would have been the outcome. Is it that Anchorage offset some of the pressure at Seattle, is it just local economic growth in Seattle, is it corporate growth, all of the above? How do we think about the demand and revenue drivers in that market as we look ahead, because it seems like capacity may continue to be somewhat elevated there?\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. I think a couple of things. I mean, we've had new growth everywhere, not just California but also the Pacific Northwest. But I think fundamentally, and you've heard us talk about this, is back to basics. We have been \u2013 with most of this integration behind us, we are focusing back on our core disciplines and what we do and what we do well and I think especially with the Pacific Northwest, we've continued to mature markets, we've continued to look at our pricing environment and our network and our hub structure. Certainly Horizon has been performing exceptionally. We had real challenges last year as you know. So, I think all of those things are coming together. And loyalty continues to grow at very significant rates believe it or not in the Pacific Northwest, not just California.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Is there any international traffic benefit that's \u2013 I wonder if you can just elaborate a little bit more on that as well. You mentioned that in the prepared remarks. To what extent is that helping to benefit your revenues, not just in San Francisco but across your system?\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, on the international, it's not huge in the scheme of things. It helps us fill in some seats here and there but the real advantage on the international is giving our loyalty members access to the globe, helping fill our partners' planes with valuable revenue and giving our members award redemption. So it's a very profitable relationship for both parties and that's only going to get stronger.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: If I could sneak a third one in here. Brandon, the cash levels, now that Alaska is 90% integrated, you're essentially at your target leverage in the mid 40s, does that loosen up some liquidity for some incremental shareholder returns as we look ahead to 2019, or does it make sense to take down the debt a little bit further before you consider some more aggressive shareholder returns?\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Hi, Dan. I wouldn't say we're in the mid 40s yet. We ended the quarter at 49%. We'll be there by \u2013 we'll be at that same level at year-end. Here's the way I'm looking at it though, and I'm glad you asked the question because I think it's a super exciting story. As we look to next year and we see profit improvement and cash flow improvement and free cash flow improvement, our current maturities will be about $300 million. Once we hit that, we'll probably be in the low 40% range debt to cap, our dividends probably in the neighborhood of $160 million, $170 million. So anything in the free cash flow bucket beyond say $450 million to $500 million, that would probably be available for share buyback.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks, guys.\nMatt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thank you.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Dan, it's Brad. I might just weigh in. We have gone through this merger process and the profitability has been challenged. A lot of the theme of this call and the last couple have been the different initiatives we have to improve margins, improve returns for shareholders and we've got a lot of confidence in that stuff. That said, I've been super impressed with the cash flows the business have produced, what Brandon and his team have done with the balance sheet. To be sitting here two years into the merger having paid off $800 million of the $2 billion we borrowed and have an adjusted debt to capital below 50% is really something else. And we've got \u2013 I think you're asking a great question. We've got the ability to improve that even further in 2019 and then this business is producing a lot of cash flow that we'll have a good problem to have as what do we do with that cash flow that we're producing.\nMatt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Okay. Operator, I think Dan's off the line. The next question?\nOperator: Yeah. Sure. Next question is from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel Nicolaus.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you very much. Good segue. Brad, I think I asked you this question before, just going to try and ask it a little bit differently and in a multiple choice format. Has your experience with Virgin and the M&A process made you more likely, less likely or equally likely to engage in further M&A in the future?\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Everyone's \u2013 they're all doing their hands, they're pushing them sideways, Joe. Here's what we'll say about it is I think the industry has changed a lot. If you look 10 or 15 years ago, it took nine airlines to make up 80% of the pie. Today it's four. I do think we're all really, really happy of what this company has done for everybody that depends on us over decades and getting bigger was important. And so we're really happy with the merger in that respect. In terms of culturally, we bit off a lot and the interesting thing about business and life is you sort of learn as you go. I think in terms of us biting off another merger, our plate is more than full right now and we're just going to be completely focused on doing what we \u2013 what we've got on our plate right now, doing it as well as we possibly can. So thanks for the question though.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yes.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for getting me on here. Andrew, I want to come back to the revenue question area because it's been asked several ways, but if we think specifically about this Saver Fare opportunity, I think you called it out as about $100 million looking into next year. But if that's explaining some of your underperformance to the market, is it still fair to say, yeah, we can get back to market RASM and then some of these initiatives will actually be additive above and beyond that?\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think if you want to talk about bag fees, that's getting back to market, Saver Fares is maybe getting back to market although Saver Fares will help us compete very aggressively against other carriers that don't have Saver Fares. So that's a big win. But the big one that we've also been talking about is just really the synergies and bringing our product to life across the system is going to be very incremental. We won't be at \u2013 we've still got low fares, so I don't think we'll ever going to be at market RASM, if you put it that way. We rely greatly as well on our low costs to have the low fares. But I think overall, all of these things come together to provide a good rising tide for us next year.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate that. And, Brandon, I'm going to take it one more time on the cost side, see if we can get something out of you. But it seems like you do have a lot of integration activities ongoing this year. I got to believe that's impacting the operating cost structure too just from even an overhead perspective. Shouldn't some of that activity come down as we head into 2019 and could you help us quantify what that was this year?\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Brandon, thanks for the follow-up question to the follow-up question to the follow-up question and we appreciate that. Here's what I'll say. We have a long history of doing a good job managing cost because ultimately we know it's important to our success. We're going to manage the heck out of costs in 2019 and we'd be delighted to tell you more about that at Investor Day.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: See you there.\nMatt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Hey, thanks, everybody, for tuning in today. Investor Day is November?\nBenito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: 27.\nMatt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: 27. We look forward to seeing hopefully all of you at Investor Day in New York on November 27. Thanks very much. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

My name is Amber, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Matt Grady.\nMatt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Amber. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call today, our CEO, Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business; Andrew Harrison, our Chief Commercial Officer, will share an update on our revenue results and outlook; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will discuss our cost performance and cash flows. Several other members of our management team are also on hand to help answer your questions. Earlier this morning, Alaska Air Group reported second quarter GAAP net income of $193 million. Excluding merger related costs and mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $206 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.66 ahead of the First Call consensus. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release. And now, I will turn the call over to Brad.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. We're halfway through 2018 and 19 months have passed since our merger closed. We're very pleased with the operational and customer service performance of the company and we're very happy to have the vast majority of our systems and processes and facilities integrated and have this work done at a pace that is equal to or more rapid than virtually every other merger in the industry. But we're not satisfied with our financial performance and we're working hard to lean out our cost structure and to achieve revenues in the marketplace that the \u2013 that recover the much higher fuel prices that every airline is experiencing. Fuel prices have been steadily increasing for 10 quarters now and they are about $1 per gallon higher than they were in the first quarter of 2016. At our volumes, that means we have about $850 million of cost increases. It may be that the early 2016 prices were unusually low, but it's clear that we have higher costs and we need to be focused on taking actions that help us recover these higher costs. Mergers are complicated as anyone who's been involved in one can attest. Ours has required significant focus and has brought our front line employees through a period of considerable change, transition and growth. At the same time we've been managing rising fuel prices, significant network expansion and elevated competition. Our team has been resilient and has secured a number of important accomplishments that have laid the foundation for our long-term growth and success. As we sit here today, we believe we've now passed through the inflection point of the merger and while we have a lot of work ahead of us to lean out our cost structure and drive revenues higher, we feel very good about the plan we're putting in place and I'm optimistic about our future. Before we talk about the work that lies ahead, I'd like to highlight a few of our employees' key accomplishments during the second quarter. First, on April 24, we transitioned to a single passenger service system with zero disruption to our operation. One of our most basic goals at the outset of the merger was to avoid any negative impact to our customers during the process. And unless you are at one of our 31 Virgin America airports on the night of April 24, you most likely would not have noticed that the PSS conversion occurred. This is a great accomplishment for our team. Next in June, we reached an agreement in principle with our dispatchers' union which was ratified earlier this month. We now have all but one of our labor groups or 93% of our unionized payroll under single collective bargaining agreements. This is extremely important for any airline, but especially at Alaska where we have such a unique culture that drives our success. Third, our operation has been running very well. Our team delivered on-time performance of 84.1% in the second quarter, up four points year-over-year. We see operational strength today across our mainline and regional fleets. At Horizon, our on-time performance is the best in the regional industry and our pilot staffing pipeline is full. Finally, we were very happy to see our employees win the J.D. Power award for the 11th year in a row during the mergers toughest period. This continued recognition by our guest is fantastic and we want to congratulate all of our employees for delivering the differentiated service that makes Alaska what it is. With 85% of the integration work now behind us, the focus of the leadership has fully returned to the basics of running the airline. We are pleased to be getting back to our roots, working together with our people to deliver operational improvements, growing our cost advantage and earning our guest loyalty every day through our fantastic route network, our low fares and our genuine and caring service. This is a group of leaders that have been together for a long time now and we operate the business today with the same philosophy and mentality that we always have. At the same time, we've been fortunate to add a number of new, highly skilled leaders to key post in recent years who are complementing our core strengths and making us stronger. Today, we're dedicated to realizing the value of our significantly larger platform. This means we're focused on delivering meaningful unit revenue improvements while tightly managing productivity and overhead. After a period of margin declines which have come due to higher fuel prices but also due to the integration, investments in our network and a step function increase in labor costs, margin improvement is our primary focus today. We believe we're on a path to deliver significant improvement in margins in both 2019 and 2020. And we see four specific opportunities in the near term that will help us do so. These are: first, network optimization; second, increasing upsell and other ancillary revenues; third, improving productivity; and fourth, investing in our culture. Let me address each one of these briefly. On the network, we are actively managing the ROIC targets at the market level to make adjustments to total capacity and how we allocate it. We're just beginning to capture synergies from cross-scheduling Boeing and Airbus aircraft, which will ramp up between now and early next year. We've made several accretive network adjustments that take affect this quarter and next and are slowing our 2019 growth rate to 2%. More on this ladder change in a moment. Next, on revenues, we're further segmenting our product to compete more directly with the basic economy fares that have been prevalent in our markets for several quarters now. As we introduce additional choice for our guests, we believe some will prefer the lowest fare while benefiting from an assigned seat and a carryon bag not offered by our competitors, while others will be willing to pay a bit more for the greater ticket flexibility and changeability. We're making changes to other ancillary revenues as well. On productivity, we're targeting improvements within each operating division to get us back to or better than pre-merger levels, while also aggressively managing overheads. Andrew and Brandon will talk more about these three focus areas in a moment. They're all designed to get us back to our long-term margins and ROIC targets. Our fourth and final focus area is culture, which is the critical intangible asset that has always enabled Alaska to be different, and that we believe will help us do so in the future. With most of the integration behind us, we're spending more time with our employees, addressing their issues, helping them to be and feel empowered, and to foster the sense of teamwork and camaraderie that results in the genuine and caring service that put Alaska on the map, and that has enabled us to compete effectively with airlines that have far greater scale. Finally, a note on 2019 capacity. Given the very substantial increase in fuel prices over the last couple of years and a capacity environment that has not adequately adjusted to them, we have reduced our 2019 capacity growth to 2%. As we've said on prior calls, we want to be good stewards of capital, and in this environment, we're just not seeing the returns that justify higher levels of growth. However, given the competitive advantages that we maintain, we think there will be a time in the intermediate term when higher growth will once again make sense for us and our owners. As we move forward with our initiatives, I'm encouraged by the strong foundation we've laid since the merger closed in late 2016. We're very happy that the integration proceeded at such a rapid clip. We're very happy with our new and expanded route map and the geographies we serve. And we're very encouraged by the loyalty growth that we've seen. From here on, we'll be pulling levers within our control to materially improve the company's financial performance. We have a good plan and I'm confident that this leadership team, and in fact, the entire Air Group team will deliver. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Total revenues for the second quarter rose 3% to $2.2 billion on capacity growth of 7.8%. As we shared on our last call, the second quarter reflected our highest capacity growth of the year, the highest competitive capacity growth of the year and a difficult comp with Easter. In addition, we had a significant increase in award travel following our conversion to a single reservation system in April. As you know, the conversion went flawlessly from an operational perspective, but it did release pent-up demand for award redemptions on our broader network. In fact, redemptions grew by 22%. Our goal is to make award travel easy for our guests, but we need to balance that with the revenue dilution it creates. We've already made the adjustments necessary to award seats and redemption prices so that the impact of higher award redemptions will moderate by the fourth quarter. So while we are not happy with our unit revenues, we believe they represent the low point of our march towards stronger revenues and margins during the second half of the year and into 2019. Before turning to the future, I'd like to provide more color on our results, roughly 3 points of our 5 point RASM decline was driven by same-store markets and the remaining 2 points resulted from new markets, and I'll address each of these separately. First, same-store markets or markets in operation longer than 12 months, 1 point of the decline came from the shift in the timing of Easter, while another 1.5 points came from the increase in award redemption activity I just mentioned. And while we had budgeted for 50 basis points of dilution from award travel, the rapid acceleration in redemptions in May and June led to an additional 100 basis points of impact. Based on the redemption demand we see in our bookings for the remainder of the summer, we expect this 150 basis point headwind to continue into the third quarter, but then moderate after that. From a loyalty and brand perspective, higher redemptions are very encouraging and our go-forward objective is to strike the right balance between paid tickets and offering great value to our loyalty members. Setting these 2.5 points of headwinds aside, same-store unit revenues would have been close to flat for the quarter. Overall, demand and pricing continue to be strong in our core Pacific Northwest markets and uptake on our Premium Class product continues to exceed our expectations. While competitive capacity remained elevated and pricing was still generally soft in the state of California, we have seen improvement in pricing over the past 30 days that sets us up for positive momentum in Q3 and Q4. Turning to new markets or markets in operation less than 12 months, these accounted for the remaining 2 points of decline. New market capacity remained high at 9% of ASMs this quarter, though this will decline over the next two quarters, with new markets set to represent 6% of ASMs for Q3 and just 3% by Q4. We are encouraged by recent performance of these markets, especially in the volume builds, and we expect them to contribute to stronger unit revenues later this year as many of them begin to annualize in September. Looking ahead, our own growth slows to 5.9% in Q3, 3.1% in Q4, and competitive capacity based on today's schedules goes from 7.4% growth in Q2 to approximately 5% in the third and fourth quarter, again, setting us up for sequential unit revenue improvement over the next two quarters. This upward trajectory in unit revenues actually began during the second quarter as we look by month. April was down 7%, May was down 5% and June was down 3%. In that light, our third quarter RASM guidance range established this morning of down 3% to flat continues the upward trend. Of note, this guidance assumes 150 basis points of continuing headwinds from higher award redemptions and 25 basis points of demand softness in Hawaii from ongoing volcanic activity. After two years of substantial capital deployment and execution of a complex integration, the commercial team is committed to improving returns on invested capital. A number of the initiatives currently underway will enable us to deliver on this. First, we are capturing merger synergies as we fully integrate and optimize the deployment of our fleets, network, schedules and crews. We will improve the revenue generation of the Airbus fleet starting this fall by modifying the cabin configuration and adding more seats. We are enhancing our competitive position in transcon markets. These markets represent 31% of our network as we swap in larger Boeing aircraft with better product segmentation and additional opportunity to reward out elite guests with upgrades. We are optimizing our network and schedule and we believe we have opportunity to more profitably assign our regional fleets across our West Coast short haul network. We will launch our Saver Fare product in December, which will create significant revenue upsell opportunities in the order of $100 million plus annually. We are increasing ancillary revenues through the adjustments to change fee policies, offering exit rows for sale and adding dynamic pricing to our premium class. And as we mentioned last quarter, these adjustments represent another $50 million run rate opportunity, $20 million of which we expect in the second half of 2018 with these initiatives now in market. And finally, we expect to reap the benefit of the new markets we launched in 2017 and 2018 as they mature, and expect to add only a handful of new markets in 2019. And to that point, with our team fully focused on delivering higher margins and returns going forward, our decision to reduce capacity growth to 2% in 2019 will be favorable both unit revenue and for profits. We still expect 2020 capacity growth to be 4% and as Brad mentioned we believe our durable competitive advantages will permit us to grow faster than both GDP and the industry over the medium to long term. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. As you've seen Air Group posted a second quarter adjusted net profit of $206 million or $1.66 a share. Our pre-tax margin was about 13%, an 11 point decline from last year. These results reflect the revenue pressures we faced, markedly higher fuel prices and a step function increase in payroll costs. I'm going to echo the theme that you heard already, that these results are not the \"new normal\" for Alaska. We're working hard to improve the returns that this business can generate. I too want to offer a bit more color on our decision to scale back 2019 growth. We believe the slower growth rate makes sense because with fuel and industry capacity at current levels we just don't see the same opportunity to produce the returns we're seeking. We're solidly in returns improvement mode and 2% growth helps us get there because it will improve our ability to manage fares in a way that will help cover the cost increases we've seen. Like our 4% plan before it, the 2% plan lets us leverage the considerable growth that we've had over the last five years, but demonstrates once again that Alaska is willing to right-size capacity when needed. You've heard about the important initiatives that the commercial team is working on, on the cost side of the house we're demonstrating better cost control than we've seen in about two years. We're having a good year in almost all divisions as people embrace the hard work of cost management. There are new processes that occur daily to manage productivity in our operation. Our marketing team gets a shout-out for beating what I would say was an aggressive plan through 6 months and our call center team is not just under plan, but 4% under last year at the halfway mark. This is a prime example of the \"cost friction\" that I referred to last year that would go away as we got farther along in the merger integration. We also have new tools and processes to manage overhead, which, by the way, are tracking $12 million better than plan so far this year. For example, one of our folks developed a dashboard to ensure that contractors are leaving the property on schedule and we're on track to meet our non-union head count reduction goals by July 31. And with that as the backdrop, let me provide some color on our Q2 cost performance. Q2 CASMex fuel rose 2% which was well below our initial guidance for the quarter. As we saw in Q1, we did benefit from the timing of certain maintenance and marketing expenses shifting to later in the year. Timing accounted for roughly half of our CASM improvement versus initial guide, which means the other half came from true outperformance. Fuel was a significant driver of our margin performance this quarter. Per gallon costs were up 34% and total economic fuel expense rose 45% or $155 million. Though fuel costs are high, our WTI call options did reduce our economic fuel expense by approximately $9 million and based on the current forward curve, we expect these hedges to save us a similar amount in the third quarter. We currently have hedges in place covering 50% of our planned consumption for the remainder of the year at an average strike price of $67 a barrel. On the integration front, as Brad mentioned, we reached a merger transition agreement with our dispatchers union bringing all, but our maintenance technicians under a single CBA. This gives us great cost visibility, but more importantly the ability to bring our Boeing and Airbus teams together and focus on culture and consistency of service. We now expect Q3 non-fuel cost to be up about 5% on 6% capacity growth which is a bit higher than our most recent guidance in April due to the timing shifts and the fact that capacity growth is lower. We also now expect full-year unit cost to be up 3.2% or 30 bps better than our previous guidance on 30 bps lower capacity growth. This updated outlook reflects the benefit of the favorable unit cost trajectory that we've experienced so far this year. Turning to the balance sheet, I might start by just underscoring that our revenue and cost initiatives are designed to improve both earnings per share and cash flow. We're trying to be smart allocators of the capital we're generating, balancing prudent investment where we can earn adequate returns, reducing our leverage to protect our long-term shareholders from the cyclicality of the industry and returning capital to our owners. Total cash flow from operations for the first six months of the year were $800 million excluding merger related costs and the $1,000 employee tax bonus paid in January. Net CapEx was $425 million over the same period resulting in approximately $375 million of adjusted free cash flow. The free cash flow we're generating has allowed us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet. Total on balance sheet debt declined by $258 million during the first half of the year. By year-end we'll have paid down $800 million of debt since our acquisition. With leases, our quarter end adjusted debt to cap stands at 52%, net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA stands at 1.4%, or 20% below the industry average, and we have 83 unencumbered airplanes in our fleet. We remain committed to improving our conservative investment grade balance sheet, which has served this company well for many years. And rounding out our capital allocation plan during the first six months, we've returned more than $100 million to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases, and expect that number to exceed $200 million by year end. We've increased our dividend every year since we initiated it in 2013 and our dividend is currently yielding about 2%. I want to close by reiterating what we've tried to convey in the last 25 minutes that there \u2013 that we're through the biggest part of the integration and financially speaking we're now working hard on revenue and cost initiatives with the goal of making sure this franchise that we're building can produce much higher returns than it is today. And with that, let's go to your questions.\nOperator: Your first question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, gentlemen.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Good morning.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Good morning, Rajeev.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Brandon, a question for you. You're obviously pulling in your capacity growth quite a bit going into next year. Is that going \u2013 creating sort of a CASM problem, do you think you could do a lot to down or I don't know if that's guidance, but I think your target was to sort of do that. And then just relating to that, I don't think your CapEx numbers change despite pulling in capacity, so just some color on both of those would be great?\nBenito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Hey, Rajeev, this is Ben Minicucci. Normally, Brandon would take that CASM question, but I think I'm going to start and have Brandon chime in. Simply because on the operations side we drive mainly the execution part of the cost side and what I want to say is from me, I am totally committed and my leadership team is totally committed and accountable to achieving our CASM targets, maybe just a few points just to reiterate from the script. First, we are past the biggest part of the integration. And so, we are now squarely focused on running this operation well, and while I say as a well-run operation has lower costs and on top of that we don't buy our performance. So that is something that after this integration, we are fully focused on that. Second is this network schedule, we are working hand-in-hand with Andrew in getting this network schedule right, optimizing it for revenue and profit as well as cost and productivity is critical for us as we calibrate our growth to 2%. Third, and I am going to put another exclamation point on this, is getting back to this high productivity. As we have always had high productivity in our history and we are going back to our peak levels that we've had pre-integration. My team's every division has clear goals on productivity. For this year, you've seen good cost performance this year on productivity. And as we're developing the 2019 budget, our productivity goals are clear and we're managing this at the daily and weekly level so that we can make adjustments as we go. We're not waiting till the end of the month. And lastly, we're going to attack overhead. We got initiatives on healthcare, crew hotel costs and management headcounts. So with all of that, we're feeling confident on how we're going to attack CASM with our 2% growth that we're putting in place.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Hey, Rajeev, it's Brandon, good morning, I'll take the second part of the question. Your question was, did CapEx come down, given the lower growth rate? The answer is no. Although we were looking at that just yesterday, I will remind you that we brought our 2019 CapEx guide down to $750 million from like $1.2 billion or something like that. That was a big move. At this point, I think we're through with our aircraft delivery stream restructuring. What we're going to do to accommodate the lower capacity is just try to get the mods done and the paints done more quickly, which I think is ultimately great for the guest experience and great for our ability to get through the integration fully and on to better things.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Just a brief follow-up. Ben, I appreciate your thoughts and your color, but what does it actually means for unit cost going forward? I mean, can we do sort of flattish, down, just some color? Brandon, that's for you as well, obviously?\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah, I might jump in. Ben did a good job listing all of the things that we're working on the cost side. What I would say is we had a very aggressive planning mindset around costs coming out of the integration to get those to be flat to down on 4% growth. What I can tell you is things are different around here in terms of our mindset about costs following the integration, as I said. We have no less vigor in the aggressiveness with which we're working in the cost planned, we just have fewer ASMs now to spread those costs over. So we're going to get into the budget process and we'll see where that ultimately takes us.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: And Brandon, this Investor Day, is that your...\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: ...target for 2019 cost guidance.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah, exactly.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Rajeev.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Rajeev.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hey. Two kind of network questions here. Andrew, maybe you can help, and Brad, you can chime in as well. When I look at some of the capacity changes that you've made, it's good you're trying to do the right thing and it looks like markets that maybe aren't as relative accretive or even maybe they're relative diluted that you are backing off of. And when I look at a market like Chicago to the West Coast and you scale back maybe to one or two flights a day, on one hand, it may become a more profitable market on one hand and yet, you run the risk of becoming less relevant. And I mean you look at the competition in that market and some of your competitors may have half a dozen or even a dozen flights a day with some bigger airplanes. So can you talk about your thought there? Maybe you just want to cater to that loyal Alaska passenger who \u2013 rather than it's the Chicago passenger or you've got less connecting passengers, I mean does that become a potential concern? How does that weigh on your thinking on some of these cutbacks because some of them are pretty deep?\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think big picture number one, the network is a very complicated and evolving puzzle piece. And again, without getting too deep into the weeds, but what you are and what you will continue to see, a deeper off-peak demand cuts, especially on the seasonal flying. You're going to see less redeyes at these fuel prices. And you're going to see us, especially with the Dallas Love Field, for instance, going to the East, getting out of Havana. And as I shared on the prior call, we, for the first time, over the last little bit, have started taking down the legacy Virgin Network where we felt like the capacity and the markets we were flying weren't the right ones. We though \u2013 all the adjustments we're making, we believe strategically are still strong. We're going to pick and choose as we go along here where we're going to cut and grow. But I think in answer to your question, we will be focusing on our strength on the West Coast, we'll be focusing on our growing loyalty base and we're going to be focusing on increasing our unit revenues and profitability.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: And Andrew, I know you and your team have \u2013 you do think a lot about utility. We want to have a schedule that works for people. Mike, to your specific question, we're probably do thinking more about the West Coast origin customer as opposed to Mid Continent or East Coast. So we probably don't need the same schedule coverage as somebody who's really focusing hard on both ends. But, yeah, you just try to balance \u2013 utility does matter, but you're trying to balance utility, returns on capital and so forth.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And this brings up sort of my second question, and I would say that a lot of the things that you just said probably answer this second question. But when I look at Alaska pre-merger, you were spending \u2013 the incremental effort beyond Seattle, Portland, et cetera, was growing California secondary cities, and you were building up a nice presence there. You then have the merger with Virgin and now, all of a sudden, you have big presence in California primary cities, notably San Fran, LAX airports. As I see today, on one hand, you've got Southwest breathing down your neck in the secondary markets and you have the legacies in the primary markets, and I've been watching your schedule changes and you're sort of shifting back and forth. I mean, can Alaska maintain a strong presence and relevance in both primary and secondary California markets and still achieve its return objectives? And I sort of premise this with the fact that you have answered some of that in your prior question, but I do look at that as there are some areas there where I suspect you may be struggling.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Mike, it's Brad. I think you're watching the schedule adjustments we make. What I would go back to is Alaska has real competitive advantage that we believe in. We've got a great balance sheet, a great fleet, our people offer fantastic service, we've been able to run this thing in a way where we do have materially lower cost than the big guys and we translate that into lower fares. So we are big believers in the competitive advantage that Alaska has. You're right, we do fly into both secondary cities in California and with the Virgin acquisition more into SFO and LAX. I don't think we're going to say on this call what our plans are going to be in the future, but our idea in the future is going to be to grow the network consistent with our sense of where the opportunity are \u2013 is, where the opportunities are consistent with our own sense of what our competitive advantage is. So maybe that's what we can share today.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great, and I appreciate it. Thank you.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Hey, thanks.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Hey, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Can you talk a little bit more or expand on the underlying improvement you referred to in the last 30 days. Was that a State of California specific comment? And to what extent did you bake in that improvement into your 3Q revenue outlook?\nShane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah, hi, Duane, it's Shane Tackett. Thanks for the question. Yeah, it's primarily been California that we've seen improvement in. That's primarily, and I think, you've probably heard this from others on the close-in fares that are sort of within 21 days of travel, those have lapped some pretty low levels from last year and they're inching up in fact in a number of cases. Demand is super strong, there's lots of people flying still, so it's primarily been driven down in California, yes. And I think we're optimistic just about as we move through Q3 and Q4 not only what we're seeing in sort of the pricing environment is stabilizing a little bit, but all of the revenue initiatives and synergy capture that start to turn on that Andrew alluded to in the script.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Thanks. And then just for my follow-up, the Saver Fare $100 million estimate, can you just remind us when that starts to turn on and how you get to that estimate? And then maybe just more broadly what are you seeing in terms of the basic economy fares in the marketplace? Is that where you've seen some of the improvement? Are you still seeing sort of dilutive walk-ups out there? Thank you.\nShane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Duane. I'll take the Saver question as well. I want to just remind folks as Andrew mentioned on the script and we talked about last time, we actually had a 5 or 6 different revenue initiatives that totaled $150 million. Saver is the biggest at a $100 million. We're fully in development mode and build mode now. We expect this to be in market by Christmas of this year if not sooner. The way we got there is there's been sort of publicly discussed upsell rates out of what other folks, these products are basic economy into normal or standard, I mean, cabin tickets. Our expectation is to be a little less than that because we have a slightly more generous product and are slightly less reliant on business revenue network, but we're sort of basing it on what we know other take rates are. In terms of the basic upsell fares, they haven't really changed a lot in the past 6 to 12 months. There is sort of market specific dynamics that they may move around a little bit, but they're pretty much in a range of $15 to $50 throughout the U.S. at this point.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Thank you.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Duane.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. You mentioned this a little bit and I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on the transcon and what you're doing there? One, you know what you're seeing today and then how quickly can we start to see that kind of the benefits of a network optimization as you move some of the Boeing aircraft onto that route \u2013 on those routes?\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Hi, Savi. We've actually already started that process and as we do that \u2013 it's just simply put, the Boeing equipment has a lot more seats, a lot more premium class seats and a lot more first class seats into these frequencies. So and as Shane mentioned too on these longer haul flights, these revenue initiatives that we're putting in place and that have already started and especially to strengthen premium class. All of these initiatives really lend themselves strongly to these transcon flights. And so we expect good healthy improvement and to Shane's earlier point we are seeing strengthening in the close-in fair environment for these flights as well.\nBenito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: And Andrew, I'm just going by memory, I think, there is 200 flights transcon in Hawaii and about 70% of them by the fall, will be on Boeing, correct?\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Sounds about right, Ben, yeah.\nBenito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah, and then that's only increases.\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. I think, Savi, just \u2013 by January, we will be basically fully cross-weeded and beginning that sort of full run rate value from that synergy.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right, great. And then if I might just follow-up on, I know you mentioned kind of the softness in Hawaii, I know, Cancun has been brought up a little bit more and is there any kind of exposure on the some of the international flying that you're doing or is it just too small to really show up?\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Savi. I don't know that we mentioned softness in Hawaii, but Mexico is...\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Volcano, okay.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Sorry.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Oh, volcanoes, sorry, sorry, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's -- we \u2013 I think that sort of stabilized itself. There was a bit of immediate \u2013 you know when it was sort of on national news every single day, there was some buck away, but it pretty much stabilized at this point. Mexico is good. It's a pretty small amount of our network today, so it doesn't have a major impact on results. There is some softness in Mexico beach cities. I think, you've heard other folks talk about that, but nothing like materially concerning.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: It makes sense. All right. Thanks.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning, everybody. I kind of hate to ask a modeling question, but you mentioned sequential RASM improvement in Q3 and Q4, or you know tracking towards that outcome in \u2013 you know, indeed the midpoint of the succinct third quarter guide that you gave today does imply a sequential improvement from the $0.1281 that you achieved in the second quarter. So are you actually guiding to fourth quarter RASM in cents per mile being above that of the third quarter because if that is the actual guide I mean, that's quite healthy and nicely ahead of the usual seasonal change that one expects from Q3 to Q4?\nShane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Hi. Hey, Jamie, this is Shane. I don't think we're prepared to give Q4 guidance today. I do think if you just arith \u2013 sort of do the arithmetic of the revenue initiatives and if you look at a stabilized pricing environment as we lap all of the new market activity we had in Q3 and Q4 of last year, it does set us up nicely for the fourth quarter.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Well, could I \u2013 could I just? I just want to make sure that I understood your prepared \u2013 I think, it was in the prepared remarks that you mentioned sequential RASM improvement in Q3 and Q4, is that correct? I'm not trying to pin you down, I'm saying it's a guide. I'm just trying to understand if I perhaps misunderstood your commentary as to sequential improvement?\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah, I think it's possible that you've misunderstood our succinct commentary.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Our guide was more in the context of year-over-year improvement which is what Andrew talked about in his prepared remarks not the absolute value of TRASM from Q3 to Q4.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Got it. Okay. That's hugely helpful and just as it relates to California, quick follow-up. And you've already given us some really good granularity here, but we're seeing a lot more time channel pricing at your primary well at one of your primary competitors on the West Coast you certainly won't hurt my feelings if you think that that observation is irrelevant, but could you at least opine on whether you do think that it matters? And if it's something that you're seeing as well?\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Jim, I just want to make sure I fully understand the question. West Coast time-based pricing?\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yes.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Time channel pricing, we're seeing a lot more \u2013 well, and I mean, it's no state secret we're seeing a lot more South West fares with very specific time channel rules as part of the fare basis, only available before...\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: ...you know 7:30 in the morning or only available on connections, not non-stops after 10:00 PM, that kind of stuff. And I'm just \u2013 I'm not smart enough to say whether or not that matters. I think that it does. I'm just we're \u2013 I'm just curious what the experts feel.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. So I just wanted to get the semantics right and make sure I knew what you're talking about.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Sure.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: We've used time banded prices for a long time here. I think they are very, very normal revenue management tool in the industry, and I think that in general they make a lot of sense and it's not surprising to me that others would adopts those at this point.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: And when they do it.\nShane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Shane, our basic deal would be to match in that time slot, not \u2013 try not to grow the impact.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. We generally are very competitive on fares. And yeah, we use time banded to be competitive for a long time.\nShane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Okay. Helpful. Thanks, gentlemen.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen Securities.\nHelane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. I just have two unrelated questions. The first is, do you guys focus on net promoter score? And have you \u2013 if so, have you seen an improvement year-over-year and since the merger? And my second question completely unrelated to that. You guys were a big part of cargo in the State of Alaska, especially the postal service. And obviously, there's some talk and we should hear in a week or two what the service levels of the USPS may be going forward. Is that something that you would see an opportunity in, if postal service levels declined from six days a week to three or four?\nBenito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Hey, Helane. It's Ben. Your first question on net promoter score, yes. The answer is yes, we do track net promoter score. We've got a great customer analytics team and we have something called Alaska Listens where we do ask the net promoter score. And what I'll say is we've seen just improved performance on our net promoter score as we're getting through this integration. It's very, very promising. We're actually making some refinements to the question to make sure that it is as pure as a net promoter score question as we can. So, we're seeing \u2013 and then other customer metrics, we're seeing those improve as well so very, very \u2013 we feel very good about that. Maybe on the second question, some other folks can help me. What I can say is we've got three freight airplanes that we just converted. There are three 700s that are converted and we're seeing a huge increase in revenues on our cargo airplanes as we're deploying them. I think we have some opportunity this U.S. Postal Service recent events I'm not too up to speed on that, unless anybody else is, that our \u2013 I can tell you our current team is extremely motivated and will jump on any opportunity to make sure that we capture as much revenue as possible.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: One thing I might just point out, Helane, in the State of Alaska, mail does work a little bit different. We actually carry USPS mail on a bypass basis. I won't get into the technical vagaries of it, but we carry it on a daily basis on their behalf. And it is a little different setup up there.\nHelane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Thanks very much.\nBenito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thank you.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Helane.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, everybody.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Good morning, Hunter.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, Brandon, I just want to make this totally clear. Does your 2% ASM growth precludes you from keeping CASMex flat to down? It sounds like there's a lot of moving parts, and I respect, there's a budgeting process. But if you could just say yes or no, is that still in play for 2019?\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Good morning, Hunter. It's really \u2013 we tried to address this in our prepared remarks. We have an extremely aggressive focus on cost. I will say that. It is difficult with 2% ASM growth to see a path to flat to down CASM, but that does not mean that we're not going to work on it.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. That's fair. You got it. Thank you for that. And then, I don't know, this is for maybe Shane, what do you know about these people redeeming points, Shane? Are these people with small point balances that are just like flushing 20,000 points, like their last 20,000 points away and they're not going to come back? Or are these Alaska loyalists that are just taking advantage of like a dislocation in some of the offerings and just taking advantage of some maybe temporarily low price points? I just want to make sure that we're not \u2013 you didn't buy a bunch of Virgin customers that are just going to abandon the new airline because their beloved Virgin is now gone and they're just like flushing away their points. You know what I mean?\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. Hunter, this is Andrew. I might take this on. I've been expecting this question and take it up to the 50,000-foot level here. At the end of the day, what happened here is that, as you know, we have a very generous loyalty program. The problem was we were just way too generous post PSS. There's a couple of key drivers to that. Firstly, we just weren't set up correctly with our inventory. We were way too open just to say it. Our lowest fare award redemptions were up 40% year-over-year. So we're all about generosity, but we had the inventory misaligned with the demand. The PSS transition happened right in the peak summer booking window. And then, we bought on all of these Airbus that we underestimated how that was going to be. And then, of course, our good partner, American Airlines had full access to our network as well. So when you combine all of those things together that was the huge spike in demand. It was by our regular loyal members, business as usual, even saw some of it up in the Pacific Northwest because of our inventory challenges. So this was a one-time thing. There's about 150 basis points of drag this quarter, it will be the same next quarter. And we've just made adjustments to bring the generosity back to our standard levels. This was a miss on our part, but it's behind us now and we feel good going forward. So that's what happened with loyalty.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thanks, Hunter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Well, hey, thanks for the time here guys. So non-fuel costs are likely up somewhat next year, but you were pretty clear you're expecting margin expansion, so revenue up even more, I guess. To what extent has inter-California impacted RASM at the system level? Is this 5% of the business impacting RASM by, say, 100 basis points, 200 basis points? And I guess I'm just trying to get a little better handle on the source of sequential improvement as we head into the back half of the year and into next.\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah. I'll take that. I mean we obviously don't comment on specific market performance. Inter-Cal is only 2.5% of our total capacity just to put that into perspective. I think really, to your question, what we are seeing is sequential improvement in these new markets on a couple of levels across the system is volumes and the volume is getting much stronger. And many of these markets too are on regional aircraft and Shane and the team are getting much better and more sophisticated about how we sell both Premium Class and First Class in these areas. So I think bigger picture, really, the story here is the pricing in general in California across the board. And as Shane and we had mentioned in our remarks, we're seeing good positive changes, especially in the close-in booking windows in those fares. So that's really what's going on.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I see. Okay.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Hey, Dan.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah, go ahead.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: It's Brandon. Just one other thought. In your lead-in, you had a couple of important points. One is we have margin improvement plan for 2019. That's absolutely correct. The second is as you almost threw up the white flag on costs being up a couple of points or whatever you said, and I don't know that that's fair. We haven't given any guidance yet for 2019 costs and I don't want to just accept that as a given.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you for that clarification. That's helpful. Another question here just, Hawaii becoming a bigger competitive dynamic, that's likely to persist into next year. So as we think about margin expansion, it seems to me there must be some confidence that you can execute on that even with some competitive challenges that are likely to persist. Is that a fair characterization?\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: I think specifically, Dan, in relation to Hawaii, what we feel really good about that, and you've seen us made adjustments in the fourth quarter across the Pacific Northwest and California and our frequencies. But more importantly, the changes that we've been talking about, the premium class, the Saver Fares, the change fees and all of these revenue enhancements, Hawaii will be a very strong recipient of these increase in yields and improvement in profitability. So we feel really good about our Hawaii network, the strength of it, and the revenue initiatives we're putting in place as well as the cost reductions, will go directly to the Hawaii franchise.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: And competition is what makes this country and this industry great. But we're \u2013 we have seat assignments in Hawaii, we have premium class, first class, as Andrew mentioned we have fantastic onboard food and beverage service. We think that's going to \u2013 we have about \u2013 our fares are candidly are as low as anybody else's. So we actually think we're nicely set up for Hawaii in 2019 and 2020.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks for that color, and I'm just trying to squeeze one last housecleaning, this is quick here. Ben, the \u2013 what's the primary metrics behind the productivity targets and I guess if you're using full-time equivalents, pardon me, for aircraft, where are you at today, what does it look like in 2019?\nBenito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: So great question. First, every division has a specific metric, so it depends, I would say for pilots and flight attendants it's we track hard time, so we will set a target for example like 69% hard time for pilots and 74% hard time for flight attendants; for mechanics, it's mechanics to airplane; for customer service agents, it's the number of agents per departures and then it all rolls up as you see it a number that we publish that is the number of equivalent FTEs per...\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Passengers per FTE.\nBenito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Passengers per FTE.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay.\nBenito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: So what we have is what we do we just get granular with every vision to make sure that productivity is at peak level and then it rolls up to an overall number that you see.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: And Dan, the number \u2013 this is Brandon, the number we really manage to is at the division level like Ben said and it obviously gets way more granular than that on hard time and soft time and that's what we focus on, on daily basis to drive the business.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah, and then it could be like training and what how many people are on company business and union business all those sorts of things.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Thanks so much you guys.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thank you.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel Nicolaus.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Just to follow-up on Hunter's question, he's slowly becoming the loyalty program expert here. Andrew, is it fair to say that kind of in a standard environment that you're indifferent from a PRASM standpoint whether you sell a seat with miles or dollars?\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: I don't \u2013 where I would say in short, no, we're not indifferent, I think we're trying to balance two very important economic drivers of our business. One is obviously selling revenue tickets and the other one is to continue to grow the loyalty program which is also generating significant economics through both the card and buying passengers. I think the industry right now is basically indifferent. I would say we are not at that place although we are continuing to work on how indifferent we do plan to be as it relates to loyalty going forward. So we think we have the best of both worlds right now.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then when you think about going from 4% to 2% I think you've talked a little bit about this but maybe a little bit more detail would be helpful like where do those two points come out of and is a market like Hawaii where there is clearly going to be a decent amount of capacity next year is that somewhere where you could reduce and fund capacity elsewhere, just how should we think about that? Thank you.\nAndrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thank you. The easiest way to think about 2019 capacity at 2% it's essentially everything we've announced and started this year continues on to next year. So to the extent we announce any new markets or changes that just means to your point we'll be pulling down other areas of our network and reallocating it. But essentially this is just this year's run rate going forward.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So Brad I mean I guess if we can do the postmortem here and I guess this kind of coming off of Hunter's question too, but maybe in a different way. You know is it just proving to be more difficult in some of these bigger California markets to be a number two or number three player and you're just not getting the returns or the let's say revenue or recognition you thought you would get from customer base there as you've increased your presence?\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: No, thanks, Brandon, a good question. I don't think that's the case. We \u2013 I'll say having been here a long time now, some of these markets we've worked a long, long time to develop a loyalty position and a market share that we \u2013 that we've developed. And then when you have that position, it's an incredible loyalty and economic driver for your business. So I don't think it would have been right for any of us to sort of expect overnight material shifts in market share where you're holding industry standard RASM or anything like that and that wasn't our expectation. I do think what's happened is, as we bought \u2013 moved into a lot of these markets there has been elevated competition, some of that we brought on new flying ourselves. And we did it at a time with \u2013 when fuel prices were rising a lot and that's one of things we're trying to talk about now. And so I think the combination of us putting new flying in, our competitors putting new flying in, fuel prices coming up, and we're trying to recover higher fares in that environment, it's been tough, and it doesn't \u2013 tough is what we do, you know, as that \u2013 this is the airline business. So I think as we look at this now, we are \u2013 you've seen over the last couple of calls, we've made downward adjustments to our own capacity and we're just continuing to make the most intelligent network decisions that we can make. But I think, California is a great market place, great business, great economy is there. It's very natural. We've been in California for 40 years. It's very natural for us to have a bigger presence there. We're very optimistic about how we're going to do there over the mid-term. But this is what we're working through right now.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And to the extent that you're willing to share, I mean nothing internally is suggesting that there was a niche brand following the Virgin and you know that's eroding or did erode, that doesn't seem to be the issue?\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: I don't think so.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thank you.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah.\nBrandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Thank you.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Okay. Is that the last?\nMatt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Yeah.\nBradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.: Okay, everybody. Thank you very much for tuning in today. We really appreciate your interest in Alaska and we look forward to talking with you all again in three months' time. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

My name is Jesse, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group\u2019s First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Matt Grady.\nMatt Grady: Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call today are CEO, Brad Tilden, who will provide an overview of the business, Andrew Harrison, our Chief Commercial Officer, who'll share an update on a revenue results and outlook, and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will discuss our cost performance and cash flow. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions. Earlier this morning, Alaska Air Group reported first quarter GAAP net income of $4 million. Excluding merger related costs, mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, and a special items Air Group reported adjusted net income of $18 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.14 ahead of the first call consensus. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release. And now, I will turn the call over to Brad.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. This is a very important time for Alaska's. We're getting through the most intense part of the merger and looking forward, in the near-term, to shifting our focus from executing the merger to realizing the value of it. I think it's well known to most of you that the integration is reaching a crescendo tomorrow night when we transition to a single passenger service system, or PSS. As we sit here today, we're encouraged by what we see. We're just 16 months into the merger. And while there is always something for us to learn and improve upon, we see a tremendous amount of strength and momentum. We have a single operating certificate and a single loyalty plan. We've integrated operational control of the Boeing and Airbus fleets in Seattle, and we have new market-based agreements in place for 80% of our collectively bargained payroll. We've also put in place new engine services agreements and other long-term contracts, that we will leverage across our flying as we move forward. We have an incredible team that's executing our cutover to a single PSS. And when that is done, the majority of our system's integration work will be behind us, enabling us to realize the benefits of this new and expanded platform. We are encouraged by the strength we see in our core markets. Same-store RASM, including legacy Airbus markets, is positive, versus being negative last quarter. And we see positive signs in the vast majority of our new markets. When we look at new store RASM, as a percentage of same-store RASM, we see sequential improvement. In those markets where we don't see adequate improvement, our team is tuning and refining the network, adjusting frequencies, departure times, block times and day, week patterns. Mileage Plan revenues exceeded plan by a substantial amount this quarter. The higher network relevance we now offer has made our loyalty program more attractive. And we were pleased to see the rapid growth of this program become a tailwind to our first quarter results. Guest loyalty is a key driver of synergies and, you we believe we're still in the early stages of harvesting the full potential of our combined loyalty program. As we complete our most important integration milestones during the first half the year, our future is bright. Our platform, which is 33% bigger than it was just 16 months ago and 100% bigger than it was five years ago, maintains the same competitive advantages it always has. We maintain an 18% cost advantage against the legacy airlines. And if you look at the data, our fares are now, and historically have been, on par with the majority of LCC seats in the market. We offer our first class product with the industry's best pitch, a great premium cabin experience and a loyalty program that our customers love and that was recently ranked Number 01 in the industry by U.S. News & World Report. Our people have been impacted by this merger, but they are resilient and they care about the company and our future. They're running a great operation and providing outstanding service to our guests, as evidenced by them recently winning that Number 01, position in the Airline Quality Ratings. As you know, this rating is based on on-time performance, completion rate, baggage handling and customer compliance. At Horizon, our operation is fully stabilized. The new leadership team, led by Gary Beck, hit the ground running and they have not had a single pilot staffing related cancellation in the last six months. Air Group's leadership team is simply the best in the business. They've been working their tails off and I want to publicly thank them now for the amazing things they have accomplished in 16 months. As we optimize our combined operation and realize the natural synergies that exist, we will continue to leverage our advantages to ensure we deliver strong returns to shareholders for the new Alaska, regardless of the economic or competitive environment. As I mentioned, our integration \u2013 our entire organization has been preparing for months to ensure that our transition to a single PSS goes smoothly tomorrow night. This event will mark our shift to a single brand and customer experience everywhere our guests interact with us. In addition, all Virgin America stations will transition to Alaskan branding, procedures and process. Many of you have asked how we're preparing for this event and what the risks are. One example of our preparation is the unique approach we designed for the cutover. Beginning last October, we required all reservations for travel after April 25 to be booked in the Alaska Reservation System. This allowed us to bleed down the reservations in the Virgin America system, and this simple step results in us having no actual conversion of customer reservations tomorrow night. Our cutover is really more focused on training our employees and operating the Alaska system throughout our expanded network. Shane Tackett and others who are leading this effort are hear this morning and happy to address your questions during the Q&A. PSS is the most critical milestone in our integration and it will be a key achievement for our team. I want to thank the hundreds of employees throughout our operation who are working tirelessly to get this done, especially Sandy Stelling, Rosalie Hollenbeck, Toni Freeberg and Jill Chin. With respect to revenue, Andrew will discuss a host of new initiatives that we're working on that we'll be rolling out over the remainder of the year. In addition to the network and schedule changes I mentioned earlier, we also plan to roll out a fair segmentation platform in the late fall, which is essentially Alaska's response to the industry's basic economy fares, which are now prevalent. We're also working on a number of other initiatives which Andrew will cover. With regard to costs, as we get through the merger, we're reenergizing our focus on productivity and proven overhead management. To ensure that the higher revenues we expect from new revenue initiatives and deal synergies flow to the bottom line. Brandon will provide more details on the cost front in a moment. In summary, our team is executing well against the plan we laid out on last quarter's call. Our capacity will grow just 4% in 2019 to 2020, as we continue to leverage our substantial growth of the last five years. In addition, we expect that our new revenue initiatives and deal synergies combined will produce an incremental $280 million of revenue for 2019. We are absorbing substantially all of the merger-related costs increases this year. With these profitability initiatives and with our new capital spending budget of $750 million for 2019 and 2020, we expect to produce substantial free cash flow in the next couple of years. As I close, I'd like to again thank our employees and our leaders for doing a great job in the midst of a complex merger and for moving our integration along in record time. I could not be more excited about our future. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrew.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Brad and good morning, everyone. Total revenues for the first quarter rose 5.3% to $1.8 billion on a capacity growth of 7.5%. Though, our RASM declined to 2.1%, this result was two points better than our fourth quarter performance and nearly two points better than the midpoint of our Q1 guidance. Despite significant competitive capacity in our markets, our business showed resilience. Our outperformance, relative to guidance, was primarily driven by three things; network adjustments, growth in loyalty revenues and long hours by our talented revenue management teams. None of our outperformance came from any external industry dynamic or overly conservative estimates. Rather, it was solid execution and good old-fashioned hard work. I also want to acknowledge our frontline teams who took care of our record 10.5 million guests this quarter. Our overall first quarter RASM performance can be categorized as follows. First same store RASM. That's RASM for all markets in operation greater than 12 months. This was up 0.5% year-over-year. This compares to same-store RASM in the fourth quarter of 2017, that was down 1.5 points. The sequential improvement came from solid demand, which was supported by a more aggressive approach to seasonal cuts, particularly in the weaker January and February period, and further fueled by growth in our loyalty program. Mileage Plan membership and Affinity Credit Card sign-ups are tracking ahead of robust internal targets and credit card commission revenues in particular, outperformed plan. The second category, new markets or markets in operation less than one year. These markets did create a headwind, as we expected, especially during the tough winter season. New markets, which accounted for approximately 9% of our capacity in Q1, fully accounted for our two point RASM decline. We expect these markets to perform better as we enter the seasonally stronger demand periods of Q2 and Q3 and as they continue to mature. Since we started only a handful of new markets this year, the percentage of our capacity represented by new markets is set to decline to just 3% of ASMs by Q4. We estimate that these steps benefited Q1 results by about one point of RASM, and we effected that into our Q1 guidance, and that Q2 will be impacted by a similar amount. Given this, and the fact that both Alaskas and industry capacity growth will peak this quarter, we are guiding to a second quarter RASM range of down 2.75% to 3.75%. As we committed at the time of our last earnings call, we've undertaken significant steps to optimize our business model to ensure we generate strong returns on invested capital, irrespective of the economic and/or competitive environment. In fact, the current competitive landscape has only fueled a deep conviction to make the necessary changes that are within our control to generate higher unit revenues. So let's start with the network, as the capacity planning team has been hard at work to optimize our combined platform. Starting with Q1. We became more proactive in dealing with the increase in seasonality in our network since acquiring Virgin America through day of week adjustments and fringing on lower demand days. We also repurposed capacity that had been allocated to slot-controlled markets, namely Havana and Mexico City. We've exited Havana and returned two of our four Mexico City slots, freeing up aircraft for more productive uses. And we've also made several adjustments to the legacy Virgin America network. First, we're announcing this morning that we've received approval from the Department of Justice and have executed an agreement with Southwest, under which Southwest will lease out 12 within perimeter slots at LaGuardia and our eight within perimeter slots at DCA. The lease, which commences this October, enables us to monetize these valuable slots, while reallocating our flying from DCA and LaGuardia into Love Field, to more strategic and profitable opportunities of the West Coast. The lease runs through 2028, at which point we have the right to reassume flying using these slots, should we choose to do so. Second, we relocated two of our JFK slots, one each to Seattle and Santa Hose, while continuing to main robust JFK schedules from LA and San Francisco. And finally, we discontinued a couple of long haul, low yield markets, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco to Cancun, and Los Angeles to Orlando. The point, we are making leverage network adjustment that ensure we maintain our West Coast utility while driving improvement in both our unit revenues and pretax margins. As we move into the second half of 2018 our capacity growth moderates. We now expect to grow 6.5% this a year. That's a point lower than our previous guidance. Looking ahead to 2019, our growth rate should settle in at about 4% and become more consistent quarter-to-quarter. We also look forward to the opening of the expanded and modernized north satellite terminal, here at Sea-Tac airport, a terminal, which will be exclusive to Alaska and will house our new 15,000 square-foot rooftop lounge. We are the only domestic airline that provides paid, first-class guests complimentary access to our lounges. So, this will be a very well received by our premium travelers.  We also expect to open our new lounge at JFK in Terminal 7 at the end of the month. We discussed last quarter how our transition to a single passenger service system will unlock our ability to begin capturing merger synergies. With the PSS transition happening tomorrow night, we now find ourselves on the threshold of this major inflection point in our integration, and one that will support meaningful improvements to our revenues. So speaking of revenue improvements, and the ones that Brad alluded to, we've been evaluating changes to our revenue model, and I'm excited to give you more definition around these. This fall, we will introduce a new option for our guests called the Saver Fare. This low priced product will be limited to seats assigned at the rear of the aircraft and guests will board last.  Upgrades for Elites will not be permitted and the ticket will not be changeable or cancelable. We believe this new offering will generate $100 million in annual revenues for 2019 and is incremental to merger synergies. In addition, we are implementing a series of revenue product and policy changes, effective now through June that collectively, we expect to drive another $50 million in annual revenues for the full year of 2019. These include offering exit rows for sale, introducing dynamite pricing for our six million Premium Class seats per year, leveraging new technology to better manage revenue post sale and eliminating fee waivers for changes made outside of 60 days. We believe these changes provide guests with more options and reflects the significant increase in the value of our expanded network and product. While these initiatives will not hit their full run rate until next year, we do expect them to contribute approximately $20 million in revenue over the back half of this year. Our entire commercial organization is lined up to deliver on these initiatives as well as unlocking the substantial synergies from the combination of Alaska and Virgin. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.\nBrandon Pedersen: Thanks Andrew and good morning, everyone. Mentioned earlier, Air Group posted a first quarter adjusted net profit of $18 million or $0.14 a share. Our near breakeven results came during a time of merger integration activities, significant new market development, rising fuel prices, new labor agreements and continuing the areas of competitive pressure in our network. I want to underscore the very important message you heard in Brad's and Andrew's remarks. That is, we're not happy with our results and we're taking a number of meaningful steps to improve the profitability of our business. Q1 CASM, ex-fuel, rose 5%, near the low end of our initial guidance. Our initial guidance, however, did not include the $9 million impact of the new agreement with our flight attendants, though we did see some costs that we initially expected in Q1 shift into future quarters that basically offset it. The impact to the flight attendant contract and the pilot contract that took effect in Q4, accounted for two-thirds of the 5% increase. Our flight attendant merger agreement/contract is extension is another important step toward completing the full integration of our work groups. The contract aligns compensation for all of our fabulous flight attendants and gives us clean line of sight to achieving an integrated seniority list later this year. It also sharpens our labor cost visibility. As Brad mentioned, we now have 80% of our payroll that is represented by a CBA, under contract through April of 2020. We now expect our full year unit cost to be up about 3.5%. The increase versus prior guidance is largely explained by the roughly $30 million impact of the new flight attendant deal. The 1% reduction in capacity growth announced today does put upward pressure on costs, but our FP&A team has done a good job of identifying volume-related cost and pulling those out of divisional budgets. And we should be able to absorb a portion of the fixed cost by creating favorable variances elsewhere. For example, we accelerated planned post PSS headcount reductions from the end of this year to July 31. As a result, we only have two-tenth of a point of additional CASM pressure on a full percentage point of capacity reduction. In general, I'm seeing examples of great back to basics cost management across much of the company. The credit not \u2013 goes not only to our leaders, but also to our frontline employees from raising the need for productivity gains. Our airports and maintenance teams both get a shout out, both are tracking very well on productivity metrics year-to-date. We expect Q2 non-fuel cost to be up 4.5% on 8.5% growth. The new market-based contracts with pilots and flight attendants and higher maintenance cost arising from the power by the hour deal we signed last fall are large drivers of the increase. Touching on fuel, per gallon cost were up 20% and total economic fuel expense rose 29% or $93 million representing a significant margin headwind. Our fuel efficient fleet is saving us money. Our mainline fuel efficiency defined as ASMs per gallon, increased 1.5% this quarter over Q1 of last year. If we add last year's fuel efficiency producing current ASMs, our Q1 mainline fuel costs would have been $5 million higher. In addition, our WTI call options reduced our economic fuel cost by another $5 million this quarter. With WTI crude now at $68 a barrel, we're fortunate to have hedges in place covering 47% of planned consumption for the remainder of the year, with an average strike price of $64 a barrel. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.5 million of cash. Total cash flow from operations was $315 million, ex merger-related costs, which are actually pretty modest at this point. Andrew mentioned the strength of our loyalty program and affinity card and we're seeing it in cash flows as well. Our Q1 affinity card cash inflows nicely beat both Q1 of last year and our budget. Meanwhile, net CapEx for the quarter was $230 million, resulting in about $75 million of free cash flow, again, ex integration costs. Improving our free cash flow generation was a major reason we reduced planned CapEx to $1 billion this year and $750 million in each, 2019 and 2020. To accomplish our CapEx objectives, our fleet team restructured our three-year delivery skyline during the quarter. Kudos to them, and a big thanks to Boeing and our other partners for working with us. Our balance sheet continues to get stronger, with total on balance sheet debt declining another $120 million since year-end. With leases, our quarter end adjusted debt-to-cap stands at 53%, flat with year-end after adjusting for the book equity impact of adopting the new revenue accounting standard. We still expect to reduce on-balance sheet debt further over the course of the year and for debt-to-cap to improve to 50% by year-end. We remain committed to further improving our conservative investment-grade balance sheet. During Q1, we returned $51 million to shareholders via $39 million in dividends and $12 million in share repurchases. We still expect to repurchase $50 million of our stock this year, which, when combined with the dividend, will result in about $200 million return to shareholders. We have a lot of work to do to improve our profitability. Today you've heard about important revenue initiatives that should boost our top line. The eminent PSS cutover will unlock revenue synergies. We're refining the network and have a multiyear capacity plan that makes sense for our larger platform. We're going to aggressively control costs and we've lowered capital spending. This won't be easy. Few things in this industry are. But if we deliver on these plans, we'll generate much higher free cash flow in 2019 and 2020 and should have the ability to return cash to shareholders in the amounts that approach levels not seen since 2015. And with that, let's go to your questions, and then on to PSS cutover.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Jamie, from everyone at Alaska Airlines, happy 50th birthday this week. Please go ahead.\nBrad Tilden: Is Jamie there?\nJamie Baker: We are having a lot of troubles with our phones here. Can you hear me?\nBrad Tilden: Yes, Jamie, happy birthday.\nJamie Baker: Okay, yes. Thank you. What do you think is driving the momentum in loyalty? I mean, you mentioned that it came in ahead of expectations. I'm curious if that speaks merely to having a conservative forecast or, I don't know, do you have an estimate as to how many Virgin frequent flyer members have signed up for Alaska cards? I\u2019m just trying to gauge whether we're closer to the start or the finish in terms of current loyalty momentum. Anymore color on that?\nAndrew Harrison: Jamie, hi, it\u2019s Andrew. I think the best way to answer that question really without going into too much detail is, what we're seeing and what we're sensing is that what we believed from day one is that the new combined network, our product, our fare structure, our people, everything about us that makes us so strong in the Pacific Northwest, we're seeing that the same people in California are very much sensing that and seeing that. And this is something different, something new for them. And it's very exciting. My personal belief is that this is just going to continue to get stronger and stronger as we continue to roll out our product.\nJamie Baker: Okay, appreciate that. And second, on saver fares, and I guess, this is a small point. But it sounds like basic economy to me. And I think consumers increasingly know what basic economy means. I'm just curious about the logic behind not calling it what most people are used to. Is there a trademark issue or something?\nAndrew Harrison: I don't know. I mean basic economy \u2013 I mean, I will tell you one thing that is very significantly different, which is really in the core of our brand, as when you book on Alaska Airlines, you get a seat assignment. And while that is not always the case today, if our flights are full but when you book the saver fare, you will get a seat assignment. I think that's extremely important to people. It's very important to our guests. And if you look across the structure of basic, Jamie, people have different rules and policies around it. And I think our structure here is one that I think meets the middle ground.\nJamie Baker: Okay, fair enough. Thanks so much.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nBrandon Pedersen: Good morning.\nSavi Syth: Just on the \u2013 obviously, a lot going on yet even after kind of the PSS cutover. Could you remind me again about the, kind of the integration synergy, the timing of the rollout of those synergies, and when we will start to kind of see them as you go through this year and next year?\nShane Tackett: Hi, Savi. This is Shane Tackett. Yes, just as by the numbers, we had \u2013 in 2017, I think we quoted $35 million of synergies. In 2018, we've got $69 million. By 2019, we go to $195 million. And then ramp from there is to $300 million at the end of 2021. And we're basically on track for all of those, most of these are actually trackable. They are either cost or things that have to do with props leading or the interior configuration of the Airbus cabins, loyalty growth, cargo revenues. We can track all of those pretty closely. And we're feeling good about where all of that at right now and sort of unlocking this stuff now that PSS is almost behind us.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And then just with the new, if I might follow up kind of \u2013 bit of Jamie's question. On the new product, is that coming out in fall? Just any color around like the rollout if there is \u2013 just how the rollout might happen. I'm guessing if it comes out in the fall, it starts showing up two months later in the fare environment is that\u2026\nBrandon Pedersen: Yes, that\u2019s correct, Savi. Essentially, we'll start roll out in the fall. We'll be smart about it and then sort of really beginning, January. And Shane and the team are working right now on the whole distribution and e-commerce side, which I'm actually really excited about. I think the industry has been working on this for a few years. And the beauty is we have hindsight here and looking at how everyone has done it and deciding on how we want to do it.\nSavi Syth: Make sense. All right, thank you.\nBrandon Pedersen: Thanks, Savi.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, everybody. Just couple of questions here, Andrew, back, you were talking about the leasing of the gates to Southwest, that LaGuardia, and DCA and you through Love Field into that. Now you just I guess, what \u2013 is it just from those two airports today, you fly only nonstop to Love Field, is that what that is? Is that what you were referencing?\nAndrew Harrison: That\u2019s right, Mike. Both of those sort of within-perimeter slots, if you will. So we can only really fly as far as sort of Love Field or that part of the geography. So that's where we fly that today. And of course, we'll be discontinuing that come October.\nMike Linenberg: The money that you'll get from Southwest \u2013 the lease of the, I guess, the gates and the slots. Is that, I mean, is that more of a rounding error or is that something like $5 million, $10 million per year? I'm not \u2013 how should we think?\nAndrew Harrison: You know, obviously, I can't comment on the magnitude. That's all privy to Southwest and Alaska. But what I will tell you is that being able to monetize important slots and move flying around and maintain our asset base for the future is really important for us.\nBrad Tilden: And Mike, probably more important than the lease payments is just getting our network configured the way we want to have it configured. Our whole idea was to \u2013 is to build pockets of strength. You hear us talk about loyalty all the time and we have fantastic loyalty in the Northwest and we want to push this into California. And then fly, as folks out of those cities. Flying from Dallas Love Field to both LaGuardia and Reagan National, at this point in the company's history, was not strategic. And so we're happy to do this transaction, so that we can line up our aircraft and our assets with our strategies.\nMike Linenberg: And then just Brad on that line about getting the network right, I mean, you did mention earlier in the call that with Horizon the pilot situation is now under control. And yet when I look at some of the route cancellations over the last, like call three to six months, there have been a lot of E175, longer-haul routes out of Seattle and Portland that have been cut. Is that \u2013 when I saw that, I thought that, that was either a combination of pilots and under-performance? But it sounds like it\u2019s not pilots at all. It\u2019s more about performance in getting the network right. Is that the right interpretation of those cuts?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, Mike. This is Andrew. That\u2019s exactly right. And I think we\u2019ve had a lot of mid cuts of rounds stuff out of Portland just we\u2019ve looked at that. And with rising fuel, we\u2019ve decided to make changes.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Darryl Genovesi from UBS. Your line is open.\nDarryl Genovesi: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Andrew, you gave us some color on evolution, the revenue model. I guess, I was wondering more about this year. I think back at year-end Investor Day, the last one that you had referred to, I think, incremental of $35 million or so. That was supposed to come through from the new premium product. Are you currently realizing that? Is that something that ramps up more in the second half? I think the process is fully available. Just wondering how the revenue generation is going.\nAndrew Harrison: That\u2019s correct. In fact Shane the mastermind here, I\u2019ll let him give some color on that.\nShane Tackett: Yes, Darryl. I think you\u2019re referring to Premium Class, which we\u2019ve finally got fully rolled out with all of our Boeing fleet reconfigured earlier this year. It\u2019s been phenomenal. We started with kind of a three \u2013 an easy sort of price strategy, just three or four price for the entire country. We\u2019re now moving price around based on demand and we\u2019re well ahead of all of our internal sort of expectations announcement. It\u2019s been a phenomenal product for us.\nDarryl Genovesi: So you\u2019re ahead relative to the $35 million number?\nShane Tackett: Yes.\nDarryl Genovesi: Well, and then, Brandon, on the non-op. I don\u2019t think you guided it for the full year. But you\u2019re about $40 million in the first half. Should we think about the second half as being a similar number?\nBrad Tilden: I think of it as being slightly less than that. We\u2019re probably tracking to be, if I have to guess, at this point, probably $16 million a quarter in Q3, Q4.\nDarryl Genovesi: Well, thanks very much guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Andrew, I believe the statistic is that 20% of the revenue is tied to business travel spend. And so first, what does an average business fare look like on Alaska? And how much has it deteriorated following the introduction of basic economy by the big three? I\u2019m just trying to get some perspective on how this is going to reconcile with the $100 million estimate that you\u2019ve given for saver fares and the premium economy?\nAndrew Harrison: Dan, I might \u2013 if Shane has any commentary on closing. Here\u2019s what I would say and I\u2019m going to probably provide more color. As you may have heard, we have a new Vice President of Sales, David Oppenheim. And it\u2019s just been amazing working with him and looking at our sales structure, where it\u2019s all coming from, our contracts and of course, of the new network. What I will basically says is that, I am very optimistic about where we can go with sales. Specifically to your question, I\u2019ll let Shane comment on some of the closing stuff. But I just see upside on the sales side.\nShane Tackett: Yes. On closing fares, I think, we\u2019ve been watching these for the last several quarters. It is \u2013 there are some that they\u2019re sort of oddly low, just relative to what you would expect. We\u2019ve had really good demand generally across the network. I think everybody\u2019s kind of seen that. We\u2019ve had really good demand across all APs. There\u2019s been no fallout on the business side. So we would anticipate some of the fares on the low to data get to more normalized levels over time. But the real focus we\u2019ve had is on things that we can control. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s more important to us to really focus on these new revenue initiatives that sort of don\u2019t depend on the economic or competitive backdrop.\nDan McKenzie: Got it. And then the down 25% to 30% in inter-California and transcon, how is that trending? Just relative to the question.\nShane Tackett: Sorry, Dan. Just what\u2019s the \u2013 the 25% to 30% is from?\nDan McKenzie: Yes. You had mentioned in the last earnings call that inter-California and transcon, walk up fares were down 25% to 30%. I\u2019m just trying to get some perspective on how those have inflected.\nBrad Tilden: Yes. That\u2019s good. Some of they\u2019re still \u2013 it\u2019s moving around quite a bit honestly market by market. And I don\u2019t recall the specific markets we were quoting before. But there are some that are still depressed California and transcon and others that have sort of rebounded and come back. So it\u2019s pretty dynamic on the West Coast, just from a pricing standpoint today.\nAndrew Harrison: But I would say that, it\u2019s basically not any worse. But if anything, it\u2019s actually better than when we spoke in the last quarter. And again, as we move into the second and third quarter, I mean the stronger demand periods, I think we\u2019ll continue to see the dynamic evolve one way or the other.\nDan McKenzie: Got it. And then just a quick second housecleaning question here. Where we in terms of reconfiguring the Airbus fleet? How many planes do expect to have done in the second quarter and the third quarter? What\u2019s the pace of that rollout?\nShane Tackett: Dan, this is Shane again. We start in September of 2018, we\u2019ll get our first aircraft reconfigured. And we\u2019re going to produce at something like five a month. Although, some are three, some are seven. So we\u2019ll have about half of the fleet done by the summer of 2019. We\u2019ll have the whole fleet done by the end of year 2019. It\u2019s pretty ratable how we get through them. There is 70 aircraft to go through. So once we get going, it\u2019s about five a month.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. Thanks guys.\nShane Tackett: Thank you.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks Dan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRajeev Lalwani: Hi, Good morning, gentleman.\nBrad Tilden: Good morning, Rajeev.\nRajeev Lalwani: Brad actually a question for you. On the last call and this call too, you talked about just responding to the challenges associated with the Virgin deal and operations for [indiscernible]. Do you feel like you\u2019ve made significant progress? And have line of sight that some of the stuff is behind you? And that you can maybe start beating some of the targets that you\u2019ve laid out ahead of you here?\nBrad Tilden: Thanks for the question, Rajeev. I certainly do. I will say that mergers are big deals. And it\u2019s \u2013 you bite up a lot. And I think anyone that\u2019s been through a merger would tell you that. But if you look at us today, we\u2019re 16 months into it. The labor, the cultural side of it is very, very important. And we\u2019ve got more work to do. But we do have 85% of our collectively bargained payroll. That\u2019s got new market-based agreements. And that\u2019s a great accomplishment. It sets us up to get integrated seniority list which sets up to sort of get the cultural stuff settled and moving forward. Systems, tomorrow night is a huge night. As you know, many, many systems cut over at the beginning of the year. But with PSS behind us, that\u2019s a huge accomplishment. The loyalty stuff, all of the decisions with outside deliveries of airplane, receiving brand, onboard service all of that t stuff is done. And we\u2019re now really in a position to begin to leverage it. So I think the fares we\u2019ve shared are the \u2013 as of this moment, we think we\u2019re 65% or 70% of the way through the merger. By the end of this quarter, by June 30, we think we\u2019ll be 85% of our way through the merger. And last, just to really focus on taking advantage of this incredible network and incredible product that we do have. So, yes, I think we are in a really good position today. I appreciate the question.\nRajeev Lalwani: Yes. Got it. Andrew or Shane a question for you. Just on the competitive headwinds that you\u2019ve been seeing on capacity or pricing, what are you embedding in your 2Q RASM as far as the \u2013 associated with it? Obviously I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what the tailwind could be as we move forward. And then just on the tailwind in some of the development markets you were talking about, as far as how that\u2019s improving. What\u2019s the opportunity there from a RASM perspective? If you can hopefully provide it.\nBrad Tilden: Yes, Rajeev. I\u2019ll take a crack at this. Just, as Andrew noted on the script, and I\u2019ll get to the pricing question. But the entire reduction in unit revenues for Q1 really was from new market. So I think the same stores have been very strong and resilient [indiscernible]. I think the real question, and I don\u2019t know that \u2013 we do have a view on how much sort of the net total of competition and growth and pricing is impacting us. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll break all of that down. But the real question for Q2 for us will be closing pricing. I think that\u2019s what makes \u2013 sometimes these quotes are hard to call because we don\u2019t know until we get there. But right now, as we look at Q2, we see fares are sort of what we would expect them to be. And especially, as we get into June and higher demand months, they look to be holding up right now.\nAndrew Harrison: The other thing I will add is, as I shared in my prepared remarks is that the second quarter looks to be the high watermark obviously of out growth but also industry capacity growth. And I think as we move into three and four unless the world changes dramatically, you\u2019re going to see a declining or a tailwind, if you will, as it relates to those two key factors.\nRajeev Lalwani: Excellent. Sorry, on the development markets, can you guys provide a number as to what the hit was in 1Q or which you are expecting in 2Q?\nBrad Tilden: Andrew, had mentioned this in the script. He quoted the entire 2.1% revenue reduction in Q1 was really the new market impact.\nRajeev Lalwani: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you guys.\nBrad Tilden: Thanks, Rajeev.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Hey, everybody, how you\u2019re doing?\nBrad Tilden: Hey, Hunter.\nHunter Keay: I\u2019m sorry. Can you just tell us the Southwest deal again? Just lay it out for me one more time, I want to make sure I get it right. And then does it require regulatory approval particularly given what the DOJ said about Love Field when they approved your merger?\nBrad Tilden: So, Hunter, it does require regulatory approval and we have that. We did have to take this to the justice department and we did have that approval. It is a done deal. It\u2019s 20 slots from Dallas, Love Field, to both LaGuardia and Reagan National Airport. And their 10-year lease is 2018. They go through 2020, at which point they come back to Alaska. There is a provision with a couple of the payers, that if they were to become outside the parameter slots during this 10-year period, they could come back \u2013 Alaska could get those slots back. So those are the basic provisions.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Cool. And then as you consider \u2013 Andrew, I think you are the one that mention your work around \u2013 with Shane and some distribution stuff and e-commerce, but as you consider the new products segment here with Sabre \u2013 Sabre. Well actually this is a Sabre question with Sabre. Are you going to be in a position to where you might be able to push for a partial content agreement the next time your GDS contract is up to really drive home some customization and some ability to keep some of your content into the channels that you think is best for Alaska going forward?\nShane Tackett: That\u2019s an excellent question. Honestly one we\u2019ve really spent a lot of amount just with everything else going on. Content, obviously, is a big, big deal to us into the GDS, I imagine, it will be front and center and sort of future negotiations with them. Just so you know, we got a pretty long-term agreement with most of our GDS providers as we sit here today. So this would be, outside of a couple of years in the future if we were able to that.\nHunter Keay: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks Shane.\nShane Tackett: Thanks, Hunter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Helane Becker of Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi and thank you very much for the time. So my first question is as you think about the capacity adjustments that you made this year, when you go forward into fourth quarter and first quarter of next year, can we expect that there would be more seasonality in the route network and therefore, more seasonality or more adjustments and capacity or are you happy with kind of the changes you made this year.\nAndrew Harrison: Hi, it\u2019s Andrew. I think we\u2019re still working through the seasonality. We\u2019re currently working on the fall schedule and were making additional adjustments there. And probably some final requirements so I think sort of over the back half into early 2019 the other thing I will share with you is, Ben Minicucci our President and myself and our teams are working extremely closely together to align our capacity adjustments with their staffing and how their work with us to make sure that this is very efficient and highly productive adjusting to our network.\nBrad Tilden: But Helane, I do think we\u2019re in a world where getting that capacity exactly right this is important than it\u2019s ever been. So the stuff that we\u2019ve mentioned about the day week adjustments the last light on Wednesday night or the last night on a Saturday night making those requirements is as important today in this revenue environment as it\u2019s ever been and it\u2019s we\u2019ll be spending a lot of energy on going forward.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then just my follow-up question, last time you talk a little bit about construction and at SeaTac and the limitations at the airport there because congestion. Can you just update us on how that\u2019s going? And if capacity has been kind of adjusted, so that you don\u2019t have the delays that you had in the past and what\u2019s going on with cost associated with that airport. Thank you.\nBen Minicucci: Good morning, Helane it\u2019s Ben. Yes, Seattle, I will say Seattle is full, we have got gate constraints, we have got air space constraints. I will tell you it\u2019s not uncommon to see 20 airplanes lined up for takeoff at peak times of the day. So taxi times have gone up. So cost at SeaTac to operate have gone up. SeaTac is full; there is construction to create hard stand positions to help during the situation. But there\u2019s no doubt costs are going to up in SeaTac to operate at this airport.\nHelane Becker: Right. But what are you doing to mitigate that, I guess that\u2019s really my question?\nBen Minicucci: In terms of cost or operations?\nHelane Becker: Well, maybe both of them.\nBen Minicucci: Well on operation side, so the taxi times are showing up 60% to 70%, the costs go up, because there are now part of block time so you\u2019ve got to add that time at the block time so as you increase block times the cost to operate that market goes up. So, what you see is, the adjustments of block times and ground times actually go up. And of course the investments that you make in the airport get translated in rates and charges so.\nAndrew Harrison: Helane, this is Andrew, one thing I will, since the last quarter I believe is that we now have at least, the SeaTac which was a big deal five-year term, in that lease, it\u2019s very clear on how many companies gets the ports will be taking back over each of the next five years which didn\u2019t exist before, so we have a real sort of line of sight to the infrastructure and where it is all going and then again to Ben\u2019s comments it gives us better ability to manage our operation going forward to be increasingly efficient over the time.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks gentlemen, thank you for the time.\nBen Minicucci: Thanks Helane\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks Helane\nOperator: Your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning.\nAndrew Harrison: Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Andrew, as you\u2019ve had more time to study the Virgin network from an optimization perspective what were some of the things they did from a planning perspective specifically with respect to seasonality that you see room to continue to improve from here?\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, I mean you\u2019ve got to give Virgin America a lot of credit, just given their size and the markets, and I really didn\u2019t have a lot of opportunity to sort of do any seasonality quite frankly. I mean they rent six flights a day JFK, Los Angeles, a lot of the year. And so I think with the permutations and combinations of our network in connecting and our new markets, and even connections beyond part and half. I think there is a real opportunity to reduce the seasonality, going forward and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, you see that with moving slots around, and we might be doing that directly.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And just to stay with you with respect to the series of revenue initiatives that you talked about, exit rows, dynamic pricing, fee waivers, et cetera. I think you threw out $20 million number for the back half but obviously not all of those things get switched on day one. So how would you think about those combined on an annual basis? And thanks for taking the questions.\nAndrew Harrison: Again, on an annual run rate, 2019 the saver fare was about $100 million and the ones you just mentioned, we\u2019ve put out about $50 million run rate at 2019.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes. Thank you. Brandon or Andrew you guys made a change to the revenue side of your income statement. I\u2019m wondering if you could just spend a minute or two just talking about what is in Mileage Plan and other revenue, what it represents. And then what \u2013 why you chose to break that? Why do you think it\u2019s important? Thank you.\nBrandon Pedersen: Yes, good morning it\u2019s Brandon, I\u2019ll take that one. So the Mileage Plan in other line has two things basically, one is the commission revenue that we earn when we sell miles to the banks, some might call it the marketing element, which is actually most of them in that line. And then the other is the net benefit if you will, having our members earn and excuse me \u2013 redeem for travel on other airlines minus the settlement costs that we pay to those other airlines that\u2019s what that. In terms of the presentation, I would love to take more credit than work, but probably don\u2019t actually deserve that much. We had always talked about that number in the footnotes and what we did Chris and his team decided to move that to the base of balance sheet and I think it makes sense. As you\u2019ve been pointing out it\u2019s a very important part of the business and we wanted to give it a little more visibility given its magnitude.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then Brandon just another one for you on CASMex next year, can you just remind us what the goal is, with the 4% capacity growth is it down, is it flat and kind of how realistic are those targets at this point?\nBrandon Pedersen: Yes, I think if you go back to last quarter\u2019s call, we said we had a planning mindset of costs having to come or be flat to slightly down. It wasn't guidance but it was directionally where we thought we needed to go. I think if you look at our cost over the last couple of years, there's been some step changes in the cost structure. As we look at it, we have I think a lot of opportunities to do things with the cost structure. We are actively working, 2018 also we haven't even gotten to the point of thinking about the 2019 budget but what I will tell you is that there's been a fair amount of energy already thinking about initiatives that we are going to undertake this year so that we can really make sure to keep cost and focus going into next. And perhaps, we are mindful of the fact, costs have been a really big part of this company\u2019s success, we are focused not only on the year-over-year change but on the absolute advantage we continue to maintain against our legacy competitors.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Crissey with Citi. Your line is open.\nKevin Crissey: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the time. Maybe for Andrew, I wanted to talk about the $100 saver fare contribution, and maybe what assumptions go in there. I know you probably have limitations as to how you can describe it, but working in a general sense then maybe what assumptions get you to the 100 million percent of markets that's rolled out, how competition responds to it. Generally, I think the numbers that have been thrown out by other airlines haven't remotely been achieved at least in my opinion. So I want to understand what assumptions you've made in your $100 million? Thank you.\nShane Tackett: Yes, thanks Kevin. It\u2019s Shane. I might not get into all of the specifics but I think you've got the variables right, we're sort of assuming a large percentage of the network and a good number of the fair classes would have this product attached to it. We probably wouldn't \u2013 I just if \u2013 I don't know what other people are seeing in terms of actual sellout rates, we know the numbers that are quoted, we're probably less than that, because we don't have as much business exposure. So we haven't assumed a level that we've sort of heard others quote.\nKevin Crissey: Okay. Thank you.\nBrad Tilden: It is fair to say competitively, this is in the marketplace today. So I don't think we expect a lot of incremental reaction to this. This is actually we are in the market place today and we are coming up with a product that is competitive with what other were offered already.\nAndrew Harrison: Yes, that\u2019s entirely correct, yes.\nKevin Crissey: Okay, thank you. And what was your capacity growth in those same-store markets, if your RASM was up 0.5%, what capacity growth was in those same-store markets?\nAndrew Harrison: I think same-store was, I think, down.\nBrandon Pedersen: Slightly, we are basically flat, most of our growth is entirely in new markets\u2026\nKevin Crissey: Okay. Yes, I'm just trying to reconcile flat capacity and 0.5% RASM has strong demand that's kind of where that comes from?\nAndrew Harrison: Can you repeat that?\nKevin Crissey: You've indicated that you have strong demand in your core \u2013 kind of same-store and that the weakness comes from the growth markets, but if you've got flat capacity in just 0.5% RASM in those markets that doesn't reconcile terribly well.\nBrandon Pedersen: Kevin, I mean, the number is \u2013 the flat is really the Alaska capacity growth, we did have as you know significant competitive capacity in many other same-store markets, and that peaks in Q2 and then it starts to abate as we get to the second half of the year.\nKevin Crissey: Ok, thanks for that. I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Susan Donofrio with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.\nSusan Donofrio: Yes, good morning gentlemen.\nBrandon Pedersen: Good morning.\nSusan Donofrio: Question on sales by channels, looks like there's been a nice ramp-up, if you look at direct to customer, 55% to 62% year-end 2017, I'm assuming given this strength of loyalty program, you could increase that even more and I'm just wondering if you're seeing that still and is there kind of a target that you're thinking of?\nShane Tackett: Susan, this is Shane. Yes, we've actually been very happy with the direct sales that we've had through mostly alaskaair.com and certainly our mobile app as well. It's I think also just given that we were starting to migrate reservations off of the virginamerica.com website on to ours, we didn't know exactly, how we would do getting all of those over but we basically increased our direct sales down in California as well. So we're feeling super good about it 60% to 65% we see our number through \u2013 in that range pretty typically, it\u2019s a little hard to \u2013 just because of how business folks by their fares through agencies. But we continue to see some opportunity as Meda's coming and most of the Meda booking has ultimately ended up as direct bookings on air.com. So it certainly could go up from here and end up, we're ultimately focused on driving it if we can.\nSusan Donofrio: Great, thank you.\nBenito Minicucci: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey good afternoon and good morning everyone thank you for getting me on the call. So Brad, if I could just ask, in prior quarters I think the perception was that the core Virgin network was maybe facing some commercial challenges. And now that you're saying that same store sales are seeing positive inflection on unit revenue. Can you just talk about what has maybe changed since a quarter or two ago is it demand competition or internal merger related activities that you guys are managing better?\nBrad Tilden: Brandon, I just think markets are dynamic. The stuff is moving around. I think when Alaska bought Virgin America and then followed up with 44 new routes or something like that and in 2017 a lots of others added a lot of capacity as well. I do think the capacity is getting to a more appropriate level given the amount of demand that's in the market, I also think as Andrew has talked about, I think that was the reaction to what Alaska brings has been extraordinary, we bring a fantastic loyalty program, amazing operation performance, great folks and we bring low fares. We've got a differentiated experience with fares that did match \u2013 basically they matched the majority of the LCC seats in the market. So I think as market places move around a little bit and I personally think things are settling down and I also think that customers are recognizing and appreciating the difference that Alaska brings.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, appreciate that. And then quickly and a follow-up for Andrew, with your 2Q RASM guide down about 3% at the midpoint, I think you said that you can attribute the full 2 point decline in 1Q to new markets. Is there something else impacting the comp there? Is that Easter holiday placement or should we be thinking that new markets could actually have a bigger drag on 2Q, than they did in the first quarter?\nAndrew Harrison : I mean \u2013 there was you know an extra point of strength in the first quarter, so that comes out in the second quarter, so second quarter we have headwind of about a point. If anything new markets, if you just look at the nature of what we are serving, and they're pretty much all started basically in the third quarter. We started 20 new markets in one quarter these are all now coming into the demand strength period and the reality is that our RM team, our network, our marketing, all the levers and all the systems that we've been building together are starting to really take up steam. So, I personally just see continued maturity and strength as we continue to go forward with these new markets.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thanks for the clarification.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Adam Hackel with Imperial. Your line is open.\nAdam Hackel: Hey guys thanks for squeezing me in here. Couple of quick questions, Just wondering sort of the Silicon Valley crowd, how have they taken to you guys? And, is that what is driving the strength on sort of sign-ups on the credit card side of things on the loyalty side?\nAndrew Harrison: I think given that getting into details, we're seeing I mean Silicon Valley we've been there a long, long time but we have been very much a big part of that community, but I will tell you that the loyalty and other aspects are across all aspects, not just saying one particular area.\nAdam Hackel: Okay, great and then just last one from, just wondering and I'm kind of off peak period a little bit. One of your peers talked about actually adding some capacity on the off-peak, towards the back of the year, I presume that's probably the kind of post loyalty period. We were also talking about Southwest, talk about some weakness they saw in the first quarter in the off-peak side. I was wondering as to how that came in for you guys in the first quarter and how should we be thinking about that going forward Thank you?\nAndrew Harrison: I think if I understand your question it's really coming back for us to seasonality, the peaks are stronger and shoulders are a little softer, and we were very proactive late in the fourth quarter making significant adjustments. So, I think in general, with the industry capacity as it sits today, the shoulder over the top period even more difficult than the historically.\nAdam Hackel: Great, thank you guys.\nAndrew Harrison: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: That's all the time that we have for questions today with that I'll turn the call back to Brad Tilden\nBrad Tilden: All right, thanks operator, thanks everybody for choosing in today, we look forward to talking to you at the end of the second quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. This call will be available for future playback at www.alaskaair.com, you may now disconnect."}]
