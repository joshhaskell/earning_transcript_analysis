[{"symbol": "JETMF", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-08-11 15:28:04", "content": "Grant Howard: Well, good morning or afternoon, depending upon where you are. My name is Grant Howard, and welcome to the Second Quarter Financial Report and Webinar with CEO, Ed Wegel, Global Crossing Airlines; and Ryan Goepel, the Chief Financial Officer. Exceedingly good results compared to Q2 of last year. So gentlemen, with that, would you please start the webinar.\nEd Wegel: Sure. Thanks, Grant, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today so that we can discuss our second quarter results. Our second quarter was a success, both in terms of the number of block hours flown as well as the preparatory work we completed to get ready for the summer flying through the rest of this year, through the rest of 2023. During the quarter, also, we negotiated our $35 million financing over the course of May and June, which we closed in July. So a combination of all of those things, a very good quarter for us setting us up for success in the future. Like every other airline in the world today, we have been impacted by the supply chain and staffing issues at the MROs, where we do our heavy maintenance checks as well as from the MROs who are converting our A321s to freighter. For instance, just to give you an example, our second freighter, originally scheduled for delivery in October of last year, 2022, then January this year, then March, then June was finally delivered and we were able to place it on our certificate to start revenue flying on June 21. While we had built in 90 days of flying for that airplane in 90 days of revenue, for the quarter, we only got 10 days, again, because of staffing issues and supply chain issues at the MROs. The other side of that coin is that the delay in new aircraft deliveries from the OEMs, and they face the same supply chain and staffing issues that we faced, resulted in us flying longer-term ACMI charter contracts for several airlines, and we see that business to continue for us over the next few years until those issues have resolved themselves. As well during the quarter, we lost the equivalent of two aircraft months because of delays in getting two of our aircraft out of their scheduled heavy maintenance checks. So they went through their normal cycle of about a month that we had scheduled for these. And because of supply chain and against staffing issues, both of these airplanes were delayed getting out of their maintenance checks. An airplane that\u2019s not available to us cannot generate revenue, and that slightly impacted our revenue in the quarter, which we\u2019ll discuss in a moment. We fought through those issues, and we flew 3,500 block hours in Q2, a testament to the 520 team members at GlobalX who make sure we flew every charter and maximize the efficiency in scheduling our fleet. My hats are off to them for having pulled this off in a tough environment. We\u2019ve seen these supply chain issues easing over the next year to 18 months, but we are working now to ensure we can cover all of our flying contract on aircraft delivered late to us, and we expect to make some announcements soon about partnerships with European ACMI airlines to accomplish this as well as expanding our summer European flying. Our objective to recruit, hire and train enough pilots to fly our summer schedule into the winter was very successful during the quarter, and we\u2019re pleased to state that we have a little over four crews per aircraft right where we should be. And we have a robust pipeline of pilots who have signed letters to start classes in September and October, and we\u2019re starting to fill the November class now. Our August class, for instance, has five captains. And our September class has eight captains already hired. The August class has started, September class will start right after Labor Day, and we continue to fill our pipeline of very qualified captains and first officers to man our aircraft and fly our schedule. As a subsequent event to the second quarter, we closed the financing with Axar Capital Management, which we will walk you through in a moment. We have finalized the financing and lease of our new maintenance facility at Ft. Lauderdale International Airport, and we expect to break ground on that finally within the next 60 to 90 days. And we signed leases for two more A320 aircraft, ex-Alaska A320s, which are very, very good airplanes for us, which will be delivered later this year. We will also make some announcements soon about some additional freighters that we have signed for during the rest of this year as well as for delivery in 2024. So we have a robust pipeline of pilots, a robust pipeline of aircraft to be delivered to us to put on our certificate and most importantly, a very robust list of clients and charter contracts that we are signing to utilize those pilots and those aircraft very well. So with that, we\u2019d like to get into a short presentation that we have about the quarter. And then after that, we\u2019ll answer some questions. So we\u2019ll go through the Axar financing, we\u2019ll comment on the quarter and our results, give you an update on 2023 fleet update, some updates on cargo and then an investor update in terms of our exchange listings. So I\u2019ll ask Ryan Goepel, who was our main negotiator on the Axar financing, to walk us through the terms of that agreement.\nRyan Goepel: Great, thank you, Ed. With an August 2, we closed our financing with Axar Capital. Axar is a $2.3 billion fund that has experienced in aviation, and we believe is going to be a great partner for us going forward. One of the key aspects of this and one of the things we are looking to secure is we\u2019re looking to secure not only our partner, but the capital required to execute on our growth plan. And I recognize in this current interest rate environment, some of these numbers might seem high, but recognize this is the lowest cost of capital we\u2019ve raised since we started as an airline. Prior to this, we were doing all equity raises. When you factor in deal fees, warrants offered, all were at significantly higher cost of capital than the cost of this capital that we\u2019ve raised. With this capital, however, we can\u2019t \u2013 we believe we have enough cash to operate our business plan to grow our fleet and to execute what we\u2019ve been basically forecasting for the last six to twelve months. The deal terms are $35 million loan repayable over six years, with the ability to repay after two years, 15% interest rate, a 1.75% OID and ten million warrants priced at the $1, with semiannual interest payments. With the proceeds of this, we refinanced $8.5 million worth of debt, which is coming due in the next 12 months, which were at higher rates. And so again, we\u2019re very excited to have Axar part of the team. We\u2019re excited to be working with them, and we\u2019re incredibly excited to have this as this financing in place, which is going to allow us to execute on our plan.\nEd Wegel: Yes, let me just comment. I\u2019ll make a few colored comments on this. We\u2019re very pleased with Axar. They understand our business. They have invested in airlines before. They have invested in charter airlines before. So, we have a partner who speaks our language and knows what we are doing. They are also very good people to work with. And I think that \u2013 and I know that, going forward, they\u2019ll be very, very good partners with us and for us, especially if other opportunities get presented to us as we grow and other airlines may want to try to work with us. So, very pleased with this. We were able to reduce our cost of the interest rate on our current debt significantly by about 25% to 30% lower interest cost on that portion of the debt. The terms are very, very good. And in this market, given where we are in our life cycle as a company as we grow, we believe that these terms are excellent for us and shows that Axar is very, very willing to work with us to ensure that we\u2019ve got the financing that we need. Both Jefferies and ROTH Capital advised us on this financing. They both agreed that we\u2019ve got very good terms, and they both agreed that we had a very, very good financing partner in Axar to move forward with us as we execute our business plan. Some of the highlights from Q2 which you\u2019ve seen some of these in some of our press releases as we\u2019ve gone through. But just to summarize, we signed LOIs for two more A320 passenger aircraft and two more A321 freighters. That was just in that quarter. In Q3, we\u2019re signing more LOIs, which we\u2019ll be making announcements about over the next few weeks. We accrued and hired and trained 35 pilots, with an additional 22 in training, as of the end of the quarter and 36 flight attendants. Those 35 pilots, with the additional 22, are what we needed to fly the summer schedule, which is very, very intense. We\u2019ll talk about that, but we\u2019re over 250 hours per aircraft per month in Q3. And so we needed to ramp up very quickly our cockpit and cabin crews to be able to fly that schedule. And we were successful in doing that. And now with the financing that\u2019s in place, we look very, very strong to the outside world. More and more highlights are coming to us saying, this is where they want to come and work. So we feel very, very good about that. We received our United Kingdom third country operator authorization, which is a complement to the EASA TCO third country operator authorization that we received a few months ago. We are getting a request now to fly into the UK and from the United Kingdom into Europe, and we will be using this TCO very soon. We\u2019re very, very pleased that we\u2019re able to put that in place. During the quarter, also, we flew for Wizz, one of the leading ULCCs in Europe. We flew 250 hours in about a three-week period. They asked for a longer term on the contract. But because we\u2019re so busy here this summer, as well as two airplanes flying for Toei who were unable to do that, but we believe that we\u2019ll be getting more and more flying from Wizz and other airlines like them in Europe over the next few months. And we also started flying a wet lease contract for Lynx in Canada. We\u2019ve just concluded that flying in August. We started it in the second quarter, we ended August 7. Almost flawless performance for us, 100% completion, about a 98% on time \u2013 controllable on-time performance on that. And those are two examples of airlines that have had their deliveries delayed from the factory. Their new Wizz \u2013 at Wizz, their new A320neos and at Lynx, their 737 MAX aircraft. So they needed to turn to an airline like us to fill and ply for them, which they had published and sold tickets on. They needed someone to quickly step in and assist them, and we were there with the airplanes and the crews and all of the certifications needed to be able to do that. And in a lot of ways, this is what this airline was built to do, was to provide supplemental lift, additional lift to other airlines that need it. And we proved in this quarter that we can do just that, and we can react very quickly and provide them what they need. Just to give you a sense of the breadth and depth of our operation. So this is over the last year since August of 2022. We\u2019ve had 2,500 flights. We visited 51 countries and 116 cities in Europe, Latin America, North America and Canada. So we feel very good about that. It certainly underlines the word global in our name. And we expect to do more and more of this. We\u2019ve been asked to put airplanes operating out of the Middle East. We\u2019ve been asked to operate airplanes out of Eastern Europe. And we\u2019ve been asked to operate airplanes with crews out of the United Kingdom for two of the major airlines that are located there. So worried about our abilities to perform, the state of our equipment, which is excellent, the performance of our crews, which is excellent. That word is spreading. And we received calls every day from airlines around the world that would like us to fly for them. And I believe, at this point, we\u2019re quoting about $2 million worth of business every day. And so that gives you a sense of the size of the market as well as our ability to gain market share within that market. So to talk about Q2 a little bit, Ryan, why don\u2019t you take this?\nRyan Goepel: Sure. For Q2 2023, we had revenue of $31.5 million; actual EBITDA, negative $6.3 million; adjusted EBITDA, negative $1.5 million. The adjustments we made were effectively for share-based comp and for pilot training and excess pilots of the current requirements. Basically, this is the investment we\u2019ve made in crews. As Ed talked about the number we\u2019ve hired, the number we\u2019ve trained and the number required in order to operate, we continually talk \u2013 discuss how Global is made up of three assets. Our first assets are certification, which we continue to add to. It\u2019s our aircraft, which we continue to lease and add more aircraft and ultimately, our cruise. And you need all three assets in order to operate and execute on this business plan. And we made a big investment in that in Q1 and in Q2, which is starting to pay off in Q3. Our actual EBITDAR of $498,000 and adjusted EBITDAR of $5.2 million. Some ultimate impacts to the quarter had they not occurred, would have actually increased our EBITDA, 5.1 aircraft month loss of maintenance and delivery delays impacted us on a $1.3 million basis. Freighter delivery days, obviously, the plane not being available on the first of the quarter versus the end of the quarter had a large impact. We accelerated crew training required for the summer. That was the 4.2%. There has been zero ice work for us during this quarter with Title 42 wrapping up. There was kind of a freeze on all of that work. That being said, that\u2019s picking up significantly in August and September. And then a gain on sales is a small parts program, we had estimated what happened. That\u2019s been pushed to Q3. So had all of those things not happened or happened, we would have increased our EBITDA, actual EBITDA by a significant amount. So there\u2019s an opportunity there for us going forward to improve the results. We understand that some people might be disappointed with the loss, but we\u2019re \u2013 we made an investment in our future, which, I think, as we\u2019ll discuss 2023, you\u2019re going to see the impact.\nEd Wegel: And in certain of those line items, we\u2019re putting in place programs and procedures so that these do not impact us as much going forward. We\u2019re working with the MROs and doing a lot of maintenance planning now before our airplanes go into heavy maintenance and we believe we will reduce those delays going forward. The freighter delivery delays are starting to ease up as more A321 freighters get converted and the conversion shops are able to become more efficient in doing those conversions. And two of the freighters that we\u2019ll be getting over the next several months have already been converted to freighter, which means that we\u2019ve eliminated those potential built-in delays. So we\u2019re learning to adjust to this environment where we\u2019ve got difficulties getting aircraft out of maintenance for our freighters out of conversion. And we\u2019ll see these delays become significantly reduced with future deliveries of aircraft as well as conversions of our freighters. We took a lot of pain in the quarter. As Ryan stated, we get enough crews on board in order to be able to fly the summer schedule. Just to give you a sense, we flew 3,500 hours in Q2. In July alone, we flew 2,500 hours. We\u2019re only able to do that because we ramped up the number of cockpit and cabin crew members that we had. That\u2019s an impact in terms of our profitability, but it is an asset that we now have, which is very, very valuable. The ice work, as Ryan said, was shut down for a period of time. It is now full force again. And we have been asked in the next few months to provide as many as four full-time airplanes to that program. We\u2019re looking to see how we can do that. We can eventually provide those airplanes, but we have so much other work that we\u2019ve got to work all of this in, but it\u2019s a good problem to have. So with that, we believe that the financial results for Q2 are in line with what we wanted in terms of the adjustments. And when we look at the impacts, which were largely out of our control, we feel very, very good with what we accomplished in Q2, which sets us up for the future. And clearly, as we briefed our new financial investor, they understood all of the dynamics of this, but they look forward as we do, and they say that we\u2019ve built the platform and spent the money to do that, which now allows us to fully leverage that platform for revenue and profitability.\nRyan Goepel: And speaking of leverage, one of the things in the finance side and us as a company are looking at is how are we performing as it relates to growth as it relates to cost. And one of the things we need to kind of point out is each quarter, it\u2019s difficult to compare quarter \u2013 sequential quarters because Q1 is a very different market for us as Q2, and Q3 is very different from Q2, and Q4 is very different from Q3. So, the most accurate adjustment and to look at is to look year-over-year. So, how do we do versus Q2 of last year, which is a similar customer base, similar revenue stream, similar kind of pricing? What we managed to do is we grew our revenue by 80%, but we only grew our cost by 59%. We grew our available aircraft by 33%, but we grew our block hours by 70%. So, what this means is, is we are operating with more aircraft, but we\u2019re using the aircraft we have more, which is getting us much better utilization. We\u2019re also adding revenue to our bottom line without increasing our cost at a lower rate. So this is a key focus for us. And one of the things we\u2019re going to point out, and we\u2019ll be much more detailed about this when we talked about our Q3 results, as I need to remind everyone, we have two types of revenue. We have ACMI revenue and full charter revenue. ACMI revenue is around between $3,000 and $5,000 an hour. Full charter revenue, which includes fuel and basically an all-in price, tends to be 2.5 to 3 times higher. So the mix of ACMI to charter revenue will impact the ultimate revenue number, but not necessarily the margin. So again, we\u2019ll talk about this significantly more in Q3 results, and we\u2019ll have that disclosure broken out in our 10-Q. But again, revenue isn\u2019t the only metric. It\u2019s one of a couple of metrics. Block hours is another one.\nEd Wegel: So what we\u2019re seeing here is a couple of dynamics going on, which we had talked about in the previous quarters, why we wanted to get to the number of airplanes that we have as quickly as we got to them. You are seeing that the variable costs are increasing as we increase revenue, fixed costs, not increasing as much. So, we\u2019ve got the foundation in place to operate more airplanes than what we currently have. And so as we add airplanes, our costs are increasing on the variable cost side, not as much on the fixed cost side. So, we can grow revenue 80%, but our costs are much lower than that. As well, we\u2019re seeing the power of the network. So, the more aircraft that you have, the more likely it is that you can get shorter contracts because it means that you\u2019ve got more airplanes that are positioned around the country and it\u2019s easier to fit all of the puzzle pieces together so that you can pick up additional flying and have aircraft standing by nearby where that charter will originate. So, what we\u2019re seeing, as we add airplanes, we\u2019re increasing the block hours. We\u2019re getting better utilization out of the airplanes because they\u2019re spread a bit more across the country or across the Caribbean. And we have more airplanes. So, we can have one airplane take a client to a city, and then a second airplane swoop and the next day to take them back to where they need to go. So again, it\u2019s the power of the network. Additional aircraft allow us better utilization of all aircraft and allow us the opportunity to bid on more contracts beyond just the incremental increase in the number of airplanes.\nRyan Goepel: So, looking forward, these are our key, what we call, nonfinancial KPI metrics, which we released in the past. We have added July just to kind of reinforce the point. So, when you look at our average \u2013 so what we\u2019re adding \u2013 if you look at the bottom right, the number of aircraft days per month has grown around 135%, but our total block hours per month has grown at 246%. What that means is we\u2019re flying \u2013 we\u2019re growing our fleet, but we\u2019re also flying our fleet that we\u2019ve grown more often. And that\u2019s reflected in the average block hour per aircraft. Now one of the big drivers of that is the pilot pool, which we talked in the bottom left. Now one thing I\u2019m going to make a point out for Q3 is kind of a leading kind of indicator. In Q1 and Q2, the percentage of flights that were flown on an ACMI basis, which is the lower revenue number per hour, is in the 30s. For Q3, that number is going to be in the 70s. So, what that means is you\u2019re not going to see a dollar-for-dollar increase in revenue for the block hours, but you will see \u2013 it will have an impact on the profitability. So, I just \u2013 again, we\u2019ll make \u2013 when we have the numbers for Q3 to show, we will demonstrate that, but we just want to make sure people understand that dynamic. And every quarter is pretty unique on the percentage of ACMI and charter, and then the rates for ACMI and charter. So again, there is multiple dynamics. We\u2019re going to do a much better job. And I think a more detailed job explaining it going forward, so people can understand what\u2019s going on. But we are growing. We\u2019re growing quickly, and we\u2019re getting better utilization of our assets, which is the key goal of the company. So how does that translate into our outlook for 2023? We\u2019re looking to increase our revenue forecast of over $150 million, with 75% of currently contracted. We have over 50 million in identified targets outstanding [indiscernible] for the period of August through December, which translates into 13,000 hours contracted for 2023 to date, with a potential to add up to another 7,000 hours. This compares to 10,000 hours 615 total hours contracted in 2022, all significant growth numbers. The leading indicators for this is our pilot count and our fleet count. And so we\u2019re executing on this plan. We\u2019re very optimistic with this plan. And as Ed pointed out, we\u2019re quoting over $2 million a day to help fill this for this year and next year. Our target fleet size at the end of the year is 12-passenger aircraft and six cargo aircraft, and we\u2019ll go into delivery specifically in a few slides. Ed, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything?\nEd Wegel: Yes. So, we\u2019re currently at about $112 million to $115 million revenue contracted, which means signed with the deposit. Probably another $10 million or so where that is out for contract, and then another $50 million that we\u2019ve identified targets, and we\u2019ve got quotes out there. We closed about 80% of our quotes at this point. So, we\u2019re comfortable now in raising our revenue target to $150 million, up from $140 million. It\u2019s also dependent on getting aircraft delivered, but we are comfortable with the new aircraft delivery dates that we\u2019ve built into our schedule based on the delays that we have seen with other aircraft. So, we\u2019re comfortable with $150 million. We will probably beat that, but $150 million is what we are comfortable with providing as guidance at this point. This is our next airplane that will be delivered. This is another example. This airplane should have been delivered about 6 months ago. Its continuous delays is because of various supply chain issues, but it\u2019s an A319. It\u2019s a great airplane. Once we get it on to our certificate, it will be converted for a period of time this winter into a VIP configuration with 68 seats. And this airplane is already almost fully booked up on its \u2013 well it\u2019s in VIP configuration. That it will make an excellent airplane in a 2-class or a 1-class configuration for many of the support teams that we fly, the NCAA and some of the other teams. So, this airplane should be here and on the certificate by the third week in August. And again, it\u2019s pretty solidly booked, because of its economics and the way that we\u2019re going to configure this airplane into the fall and winter. Here is our delivery plan. Our current \u2013 our target plan is now our current plan. Our target plan was contingent largely on the financing, which is now in place. And so this is our current plan. Our ninth A320 passenger aircraft was delivered as well as our second freighter that was delivered during the quarter. That brings us to nine passenger aircraft and two freighters. Now in the current plan, we\u2019ll take the A319. We\u2019ve just showed you the picture of that. That will be in August. This month \u2013 by the third week of this month, we should have that airplane on the certificate. And we are taking another freighter late in Q3 and then a mix of passenger aircraft and freighters through the end of the year. The A320 number 7 is actually a passenger aircraft not a freighter. So, we expect to be a 12-passenger airplane and six freighter aircraft by the end of this year. And we have all of the capital that\u2019s required to bring those airplanes on. Many of the deposits have already been made, even in advance of the financing that we just put in place. So we\u2019re in great shape in terms of bringing these airplanes into the fleet, we paid the deposits. We have the pilots and the crew standing by to fly these airplanes and we have a pipeline of pilots to make sure that we\u2019ve got enough as we get to 18 airplanes to fly the entire fleet. Our cargo side continues to ramp up. Two freighters, as I said, are currently in operation. Those are fully sold. We\u2019re getting an average of 200 hours per month, per aircraft. And as freight forwarders and others see the operating performance and the economics of this airplane, we are competing against 757 freighters and in many cases, 737, 800 freighters. And this airplane pencils out both an operating and financial performance better than those two aircraft. Our fuel burn is much less than a 757. And we carry 50% more than a 737-800. We had about the same fuel burn. So, we feel very confident as we present this airplane and pinch it to freight forwarders, other airlines, cargo units that we pitched very well because of those performance characteristics of the airplane. But we\u2019ve got seven aircraft that we, at this point, have allocated. We don\u2019t have seven. We\u2019ve got obviously two, with another four coming this year. But we think that within the U.S. government, post office and other agencies, we tend to sign two airplanes. Our Miami to Caribbean business is taking off. Literally, we\u2019ve got one airplane assigned to that, and we\u2019re flying regularly now to taking cargo to Cuba, cargo to Jamaica, cargo to Dominican Republic, cargo to Haiti as well as to the Eastern Caribbean. We\u2019ve got a full slate of flights to Port of Spain, Barbados, St. Lucia and Guyana. So, this business will continue to increase for us. I see the number that we have assigned to the Caribbean will increase next year. I would project that we will have three freighters operating almost full time in the Caribbean by this time next year. Central America is also a focus for us. This is the right-sized airplane to come out of the U.S. into Central America. One of our next airplanes will be assigned out of Miami to fly four freight forwarders into Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, et cetera. So we feel good about that business. Our partners at Ascent will keep one airplane busy, because we only have two; it\u2019s been difficult to schedule some of those flights. The third airplane will be assigned to Ascent, and we\u2019ll move that airplane to be based in Texas to start flying for them. And we anticipate that we\u2019ll get our monthly revenue targets met with that airplane, flying in the automotive market. Latin America, we are progressing with our Colombian AOC. We're now in Phase 3. We expect to get that AOC finalized and issued to us by late September or October, and we'll effectively assign one aircraft to that AOC. That aircraft will fly from Latin America into the U.S., with Latin pilots, which will ease some of the pressure our pilot foresee here in the U.S. But we see that business growing. Number of airlines in Latin America have approached us about flying that airplane for them. And I think that that number will increase from one to three airplanes over the next 12 to 18 months. But we also will want a spare \u2013 an aircraft that can provide additional capacity for any of those business lines to be assigned at some point. So effectively, we've got the allocation for the first seven airplanes, and we are starting to formulate our plans for the next five airplanes after that. So cargo demand we're seeing is increasing. While the volumes are down for the wide-body freighters coming from Asia, the intra-regional cargo demands into the Caribbean and into Latin America remains strong. And this airplane outperforms any of its competitors, and so we will win more than our fair share of the market because of that. Ryan, could you take this?\nRyan Goepel: Sure. So the question we get on every Q&A relates to uplisting, I'd probably get it pretty much daily. With the Axar financing, there is no pressing need to raise capital. And generally, the reason you go through the expense of an uplisting is to raise capital. That being said, it's clear with the way our stock has performed, we're not on the right exchange and that needs to be addressed. But what we do have is because of the capital raise, we have the option to determine when is the best time to uplist based on market conditions, share price and financial performance. There are two real kind of hurdles that we have to cover. We need a share price over $2 and we need positive shareholder equity. The positive shareholder equity is generally addressed through a raise, which we feel very comfortable we could accomplish at the time and be more comfortable doing if we're a $3 or $4 a share. All that being said is we are monitoring it. Ed and I are spending a significant amount of time talking to investors, talking institutional investors, getting our story out. So when the time is right to uplist, will be well received. For people who are existing shareholders, who are wanting to uplist so they could sell their shares becomes that you don't want \u2013 you need buyers on the other side of that or you don't or it doesn't work. And so we are thinking through that on the long-term. We're working towards it, and we understand the value in getting to the different exchange. On the right, we have our updated cap table or post the financial close, which breaks out the common Class A, Class B and the warrant structure that exists. So we have total outstanding shares of $57 million and fully diluted shares of $85 million. And with that, I think that's finish.\nEd Wegel: Yes. I think it's important to understand that with the Axar financing does a number of things for us, most importantly puts cash on the balance sheet, which is important. But that cash and that financial strength allows Ryan and his finance team to put better credit lines in place for us for fuel, for ground handling, for use of FBOs, for maintenance. So it frees up a lot of our capital to invest in the business. And it shows our competitors, our alliance partners and everyone that we have got the capital to stay and grow. And I think that's very, very important, especially when we're talking to clients about providing airplanes over in Europe or airplanes for instance, supplied to Hawaii after we get our ETAP certification and so forth. So this financing gives us room to breathe. It allows us to execute our plan. It allows us to increase our credit lines with our key vendors, and it gives everyone the confidence that we are here to stay, and we will continue to grow to become the preeminent narrow-body charter operator in the U.S. So again, just to wrap up we feel this is a very, very successful quarter for us in terms of setting us up for the future, making sure that we've got the aircraft under LOI to be delivered later this year to get our maintenance facility built, to get the pilots that we needed on the payroll, trained and ready to fly. So this has set us up for a great future along with the Axar financing. So again, a successful quarter. We are seeing the benefits of all that we've done over the past six months here in July and August and moving forward. So we are in a very, very good shape, and we are very, very confident about our future and our projections and what we will do to become the best charter airline in the U.S. So with that, Grant, we'll turn it back to you and happy to answer any questions.\nGrant Howard: Thank you, Ed and Ryan. We have some questions in already. And just as a reminder to the participants, there's a Q&A feature at the bottom of your screen, so please use that to submit your questions. And we'll get to them in a moment. A lot of discussion understandably about Axar and the flexibility it builds into your future plans. Ryan, when you and I spoke in the recorded interview that was released after the Axar announcement, one thing you addressed, which I thought was important and it's a little further to what has already been stated. You talked about the certainty that this introduces going into 2024 and the commitments you can make so that there's much more management comfort around the objectives that have been stated for 2024?\nRyan Goepel: Yes. And ultimately, you do need capital in order to execute as you need capital to execute on a day-to-day basis. And so our growth brands are significant. And we effectively were doing this with little to no capital prior to this and so having that fuel and that fallback is pretty critical for us.\nGrant Howard: All right. Let's get to the questions. There's a couple here from Chris Roth, and they're effectively the same question, where he was asking about, when do you anticipate you'll turn the corner and when you'll report a profitable quarter?\nRyan Goepel: Q3.\nGrant Howard: That was direct. Jason Zambanini, how long do you expect the crew hiring and training to continue as a drag as it continues to be a significant cost quarter-over-quarter?\nEd Wegel: So as we move forward, the percentage of our total costs that are represented by pilot hiring and training will be reduced. But we're going from two to four airplanes, that's there's a significant drag or when you're going from seven airplanes to 12, there's a significant drag in the future as you go from, say, 20 airplanes to 21 airplanes, that's a much less significant drag on cash and our profitability. So as we move forward, with a steady increase in the number of airplanes, the percentage that that represents of our overall cost or overall revenues will get significantly less.\nGrant Howard: For Karl Brewer with your new plan almost fully booked already, I believe he's talking about the freighter, or it may be the executive class, I guess, an 80% acceptance of quotes. Do you think you have room to price more aggressively?\nEd Wegel: Yes. And we are.\nGrant Howard: Jeff Lee. Your press release mentioned the LOIs, letters of intent for two A321 freighters in both Q2 and Q3. Can you confirm that those are different and refer to four freighters in total?\nEd Wegel: Yes, I can. So we'll announce \u2013 we signed LOIs for two freighters that will be delivered this year on top of the other two. And the Other LOI is for aircraft that will be delivered in Q1 and Q2 of 2024.\nGrant Howard: Randy Hill [indiscernible] was asking, what is ICE? That's immigration and customs in the U.S.; I believe I'm correct from now on?\nEd Wegel: Right. So ICE which is our customs and integration enforcement agency has as many as a minimum of 12, as many as 20 airplanes operating at any one time to move people across the U.S. and also from the U.S. back to their home countries in Central America and South America. So those programs are ramping up, and we're seeing a great increase in the number of airplanes that they need in that program. And we've been asked to provide, as I said before, as many as four airplanes later this year into that program. As well, we're flying right now. We're flying five to six trips a week into Central America under that program.\nGrant Howard: Question here. And I think it pertains to some degree you mentioned that there have been a lot of discussions with institutional investors as you look down the road to a NASDAQ listing. When the timing is right, perhaps you can provide a little more clarity around the nature of those discussions and the type of reception that you are receiving?\nRyan Goepel: So over the last \u2013 through the fundraise process we probably talked to 70 to 80 different institutional investors. Many of them, if you can say why they did or did not participate, a lot of it is they are credit funds, and we don't have a lot of assets or their equity fund that are deals, too small. It's kind of a Goldilocks problem, but we're on all the radars. I think in the last quarter, I participated in four different investor conferences. Earlier conducted between Ed and I we conducted 70 one-on-ones and we're going to continue that volume. And a lot of what institutional will do is they'll put you on the radar, and they'll watch your results for two or three quarters, and then they'll decide if they're going to invest. They have a much longer buy cycle and much more diligent buy cycle than you would expect from maybe some of the other investors out there. And so we work through it, and we try to be transparent. We try to hit the targets we said we're going to hit, and as I think our track record of execution is going to ultimately pay off. Ultimately, the biggest value of an uplisting is actually the roadshow that goes with it, that gives you the exposure to these institutional investors, which I like to think we've planned to pump when we are ready to do that, we'll hopefully have a receptive audience.\nGrant Howard: Thank you from Chris Roth for the direct answer on the profitability, and you stated it was Q3. Now we've got three questions from Helane Becker. And just as a reminder to folks who are listening in that Helane is currently airline and transportation analyst with Colin out of New York and is an adviser to GlobalX. So I'll start with your first question. Do you fly the aircraft in and out of Haiti with the same crews? If not, how do you ensure the safety of the crews and Haiti and elsewhere in risky markets?\nEd Wegel: So we've done a total safety and security assessment of Haiti, and we're going to start flying there. We're flying there now with the freighter. And next month, we anticipate starting to fly once a day to Port-au-Prince and once a day to Cap-Haitien. Spirit, JetBlue, American all fly into Haiti. There are protocols there on the ground at the airport to ensure the safety and security of all of the crews and the aircraft. Their protocols in the event that we have to stay overnight there for any reason, we won't plan to do that. But on the off chance that we have to, we have worked with Spirit and JetBlue, and we're going to piggyback off of their programs and all three of us will support each other when \u2013 if a situation occurs that requires us to stay overnight. So we've done a full security assessment. We've got consultants come in and do that for us as well as put in place programs for us to get our people to a hotel and back to the airport the next morning if that situation arises. So we're very comfortable with the programs that are in place. Again, American flights share out of Miami several times a day. Spirit and JetBlue as well, so there's international traffic in and out of there all day long. It will just be part of that international community of airlines that support each other in difficult situations like that.\nGrant Howard: Helane's second question. How do you think the bankruptcy of Western Global will affect you? Are there opportunities to pick up either equipment or business?\nEd Wegel: So Western Global is \u2013 operates 747s and MD-11 freighters, which obviously a wide-body aircraft very dissimilar to the A321 freighters that we fly. So their business has been severely impacted with the package business coming from Asia to the U.S. and Europe to the U S. And so they've seen the number of block hours that they fly significantly reduced because of that. We don't operate in those markets and so we have not seen that level of reduction of volume of cargo volumes in the narrowbody market, particularly in the markets that we operate in, the automotive, the Express business into the Caribbean. And a lot of what we fly into Cuba and into Kingston and into Haiti is a DHL business that has been contracted to us. So we're not really interested in any Western Global's equipment. It looks like they got essentially a prepackaged bankruptcy that they will put Western Global through, and they'll come out the other side. I would assume to be a much leaner, lower cost operation that will allow them to survive until their cargo volumes from Asia pick up again. So we don't really see any impact to us. It's not like we can pick up flights that they're not flying because they're bankrupt, they're just a different equipment size, and so it doesn't really impact what we do in any way.\nGrant Howard: And our third question relates to ICE and the transportation of Stifel and in short, she's asking how or what or can GlobalX ensure the best humane treatment for those people that you're flying?\nEd Wegel: So we have a lot of protocols that we have in place with both \u2013 and we fly for a number of agencies. So we fly for customs and border patrol. We fly for ICE, and we fly for HHS, health and human services. So we essentially don't do much on the airplane. Our flight attendants are there in case of an emergency. The passengers are monitored by guards that are placed on board the airplane by one of those agencies. And we have not seen in the time that we've been flying, we've not seen any inhumane treatment of any of the passengers. There have been threats made to our crew members, and they're especially trained to deal with those. But we haven't seen any mistreatment at all. We do run some flight that contain or including passengers who are being deported because of criminal activity in the U.S. And so there may be more guards or work security involved around that, but we have never had a problem or an incident in any of those flights.\nGrant Howard: Question here about a recession and how global would deal with it. There's a variety of opinions, whether or not there will be a recession, a mild recession, the soft landing or any recession whatsoever. But should there be a severe recession, do you have any contingency plans in place? Or how will you handle that?\nEd Wegel: So a couple of things, and then I'll let Ryan also provide some color. We've built this airline to be as recession improved as possible. When you look at the list of clients that we fly in Slide 4, U.S. government agencies, NCAA Division 1 teams at FLY, whether there's a recession or not because of the size of their programs. The charter operations where we're moving the VFR traffic visiting friends and relatives to the Cuba, San Domingo and Haiti, those flights will continue in a recession as normal. And so we calculate that as much as 85% of our current business is effectively recession proof. And that those clients will continue to come to us, and we'll continue to need airlift for their requirements. So severe recession is not really forecast some as you say, Grant, some analysts are saying it will be a very soft landing. Some are saying we may be able to avoid it completely. What we're seeing in Europe right now, where we could have \u2013 if we had the capability to do so, we could have moved our entire fleet over to Europe to fly for airlines over there this summer. And Europe is arguably in worse economic shape than the U.S. We're not seeing any degradation in the number of charter flights that are being requested or the number of people who are traveling on charters particularly this summer. So if that's a leading indicator, we think that the traffic will hold, but again the vast majority of our business is recession proof.\nGrant Howard: And the final one we have here so far, asking for an update on the A330 freighter plans, but in the presentation, I believe I'm correct so that right now, you could use seven freighters. So obviously, there's a lot of growing demand there, more demand than you currently have capacity to handle. So I don't know if you want to provide any additional comments on that?\nEd Wegel: Yes. So again, the narrow-body and the wide-body freighter markets are two different markets. So we're seeing good demand for our airplane because it competes well against its competitor set of aircraft. And because there is a need for additional lift into the Caribbean Central America and out of the U.S. into Latin America, but not with wide-bodies. The A330s something that we very much want to add to our certificate, we would start with the passenger aircraft because we can't get an A330 freighter now. And frankly, even if we could get an A330 freighter, I think we would want to wait until the volumes come back up on the long-haul cargo markets before we added the A330 freighter. We have already gotten a lot of interest and demand for an A330 passenger aircraft. And with some of our clients \u2013 we've received Board approval to start the certification process, which is a very low-risk project or exercise to start because we can do that with internal resources. It's modifying a number of our manuals, putting together some training programs and getting the FAA to side off and improve those. And we can do all of that before we spend any money on a full certification process with the 330. So a lot of the prep work is being done now to add the 330 to the certificate, again we begin with a green light by our Board to move forward in certification. We'll have to come back to them before we start spending any real money on that, but I think that that's something that we will execute on sometime next year, with a hope to have A330 flying for next summer. Again, the freighters, it's impossible to get an A330 freighter. And even if we could get one, I think that we want to push that off until we're a little bit more comfortable in the long-haul cargo markets and their rebound back to \u2013 well, I mean, just to give you a sense, the cargo levels are back to 2019 levels. They're not back to 2021 levels when they were flying wide-bodies in mass between Asia and the U.S. with all sorts of packages and also PPE. So both the 330 passenger and freighter on the radar will do passenger first. We've got demand for that airline; it's easier for us to do that and once we have full Board approval we'll move forward into those programs as quickly as we can.\nGrant Howard: A couple of questions just came in, both related to the stock market; Kaiser asked, Have the institutional investors indicated what global needs to do from a profitability standpoint before they would consider adding global to their portfolio?\nRyan Goepel: Not specifically, institutional investors don't tell you that. They'll express interest. I guess I'll know we've done it when they start buying.\nGrant Howard: And the second part was, do you agree that the only way to get the share price to $2 is to attract institutional investors.\nRyan Goepel: No, no, I don't think so. I think retail investors play a very important role. We have a heavily heavy retail following. Retail investors' money is as good as institutional investor money. And so I think it would be a disservice to the retail investor, we didn't focus on them as well and so that's why we do webinars like this. This is why we try to be as transparent as possible. We send out \u2013 we have 17,000, I think is on our news letter. Grant, you kind of make sure all our \u2013 issue a lot of press releases and that's to keep the retail investor informed in so much. And so no, I don't think the only path is through institutional. It's somewhat easier because you need to get 10 institutional's and 1,000 retail to kind of do the same volume, but I think we need to be looking at both and we are.\nEd Wegel: And I think \u2013 so a little bit more color on that. So as Ryan alluded OR mentioned, right, through the process of raising our \u2013 what became a $35 million financing from Axar, we talked to probably, I think it was 96 different institutional investors, private equity funds, other institutional investors to do this deal. Their focus was do you have a scalable platform where you can add airplanes and become a major force in the charter airline world. Now looking at \u2013 did you make a couple of dollars this quarter by not hiring pilots and not adding airplanes and skinning down your operations so that you could have got a profit at these levels. It's not what they're focused on. What institutional investors focus on is do you have a platform that can scale and that can grow at reasonable rates so that you can leverage the power of your network, the power of your fleet, the power of your employee base to become sustainably profitable over the long-term, that's what they focus on. And in terms of the retail investors who can move our stock, $0.10 by selling 100 shares, we need to get away from those investors. They don't understand our business. They don't want to understand our business. They believe that we could have gotten to 50 airplanes with $10 million of capital. They're \u2013 in many ways they're unrealistic because they're not experienced in our business, and I understand that. So yes, we do need institutional investors. We do need retail investors who understand what institutional investors look for because do you have a platform that can scale and will be sustainably profitable? And can we get in at a level where we can drive that up as you scale and are sustainably profitable. So in the second quarter, but we have cut off all pilot hiring, but we have delayed every delivery of every airplane, but we have hunker down and native profit, yes. And we would have not been able to fly the July through the end of the December schedule. We will not have been able to get the clients that we now have under contract. And at some point, we would still have to hire and train those pilots to grow from seven airplanes up to where we need to grow to. So do you take the pain now and do you take the pain later? Institutional investors wants you to do and execute your plan now so that the future is sustainably profitable; that is what we have done.\nGrant Howard: And just as an additional note on that, if people go look at global stock charts January, February, March of this year, and then they also look at the volumes, through the first quarter of this year, there was a pretty aggressive online push directed at retail investors that was coordinated with GlobalX and a lot of that came out of this office and with their assistance and you look at the volumes, and there was tremendous retail support. It was almost all retail. So it is out there. I'm just going to take a liberty here. I was reading a report from [indiscernible] out of Toronto, and they run more than $1 billion in assets, but they do have a microcap fund. So just read a couple of lines, just conditions in the microcap world is evidenced by the continuing lackluster performance of the TSX Venture are as bad as we've ever witnessed. We are not simply saying that we can't imagine a lot more downside, but we are saying that as a group, they are being priced so low now, but there isn't just much more that they can draw and it goes on and on and on but other newsletter writers. So we're seeing, what I can say in our almost 35 years, the conditions in the junior markets right now are absolutely horrific and I think GlobalX has done a hell of a job in context of everything that you've had to face here. So with that gentlemen, congratulations. Any closing comments?\nEd Wegel: No, I think that's right, Grant. Moving to, our uplisting to a mature exchange is something that we need to do. Ryan and I are two of the largest shareholders of the company. I believe our interests are aligned with every shareholder, right. We're putting in 12-hour days, six days a week to make this work. And we're not \u2013 we follow our stock price obviously, very closely. It's frustrating to see Surf Air Mobility with seven planes \u2013 seven single engine planes. They haven't made a profit since day-one. They merged with another airline, and they have a market count that's twice ours. And they have losses predicted for the long-term, but their market cap is twice ours, seven single-engine planes that have \u2013 that can carry eight passengers. Let me say that again, seven single engine planes that can carry eight passengers; and their market cap is double ours. So it's frustrating. We talk to institutional investors as much as we can. But if someone wants to sit and sell 150 shares and drop us $0.05, we see that happen all the time. So we want to get the support from institutions. Hopefully, retail investors will talk to each other [indiscernible] why do we keep knocking the stock price down, right, for no apparent reason, other than because we can do it. So we need to get to a mature exchange. We need to change the mix of our investors, and we need people to understand that we are growing this business to be sustainably profitable, and we are well along the curve to making that happen.\nGrant Howard: Again, thank you, and thank you to our participants, and we look forward to all of the announcements that will lead into what we anticipate are going to be quite wonderful Q3 results. Thank you.\nEd Wegel: Great. Thanks, Grant. Thanks, everyone.\nQ - :\nOperator: Good bye."}, {"symbol": "JETMF", "quarter": 1, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-05-13 21:41:06", "content": "Grant Howard: Okay. We are going to start. Thank you to everybody who\u2019s attending today. There\u2019s still more being admitted into the room. There\u2019s a lot to talk about, and we always get a lot of Q&A on this. So I\u2019m going to dive right into \u2013 or let \u2013 sorry, let the Chairman and CEO, Ed Wegel dive right into it and Ryan Goepel, CFO, to talk about the first quarter results and an outlook for 2023. With that, Ed and Ryan.\nEd Wegel: Great. Thank you, Grant, and thanks to everyone who is joining our call today. We appreciate your interest and your support, and I hope that we\u2019ll be able to give you a good presentation. Today, as you know, we reported our first quarter earnings. And first, I would like to say thank you to our 436 team members for their great work in this quarter, during which we received our cargo certification and started cargo operations, while battling some uncontrollable events in January and February. And as we battle through those, we delivered a record revenue result in March of this quarter. We will get into the events, the uncontrollable events and how we dealt with those later in our presentation. But I will say this, given the progress we made in the first quarter in building the platform and setting up the company for a huge second half of this year, Q1 was a very, very good quarter for us. And in the process, we are building a very resilient and resourceful workforce that can ensure our airline operates safely and efficiently every day. I want to talk first, before we get into the presentation, about our approach to this business. It is important for investors to understand how we think about our airline and our short- and long-term planning. We have gotten to where we are. Today, 9 passenger aircraft soon to be 10 and 1 A321 freighter aircraft soon to be 2 with full 121 flag certification with every other certification available to us except ETOPS, which we are on track to receive in November this year. We can operate this airline now worldwide. We have done this with $28 million of capital, with $7 million of that $28 million in cash deposits on our balance sheet. We have minimized shareholder dilution, we have been extremely careful how we raise money, and we have used the money we do have to continually invest in this business. In my view, this Board and this management team have done an exceptional job building this platform for minimal dollars and minimal dilution. And we have done this in a very uncertain economic and geopolitical environment. We went through the end stages of COVID and Omicron. This is after certifying this airline through the very bad days of COVID. Rising interest rates, inflation, rising oil prices, war in Eastern Europe, falling cargo demand, combined with an intense work with talent, particularly with pilots. We are constantly juggling a number of forces, which impact our business and impacts the pace of aircraft deliveries. Having said that since certification, we have taken delivery of an aircraft once every 2.5 months, once every 2.5 months, that\u2019s pretty darn good. To take delivery of an aircraft requires months of planning. It also requires having trained crews, cockpit crews, cabin crews, cash for deposits and for the conformity of the aircraft. It is an intensive choreographed effort to put an aircraft on a US 121 certificate. And for us to be at 10 and soon 12 aircraft on our certificate, including freighters, is a remarkable achievement. And we have been planning ongoing for the rest of our aircraft deliveries this year, subject, of course, to the DOT and FAA approvals. So what is our approach to this business? It\u2019s important for you to understand how we view this. So let\u2019s get to the first slide. This is our approach to the business. We take a long-term view of this business. Many charter airlines want to get to 5 or 6 airplanes and think that they can just make money for the next 30 years. That is a not sustainable approach, and we have seen many charter airlines go out of business because of that. We take a long-term view. We are going to build a durable, sustainable and long-term profitable U.S. charter airline. We continually reinvest in the business. We are undercapitalized, for sure. But we take the dollars that we have and every dollar goes back into the business. We\u2019re adding aircraft, both passenger and private aircraft. We\u2019re hiring and training pilots, and we\u2019ll get into the number of pilots that we\u2019ve been able to hire and train over the last few quarters, it\u2019s quite remarkable. And we use information technology to its full capabilities to move towards total paperless airline. We integrate ground handling and fueling to better control our products. We invest in our ground handling operations, and we see diversified revenue streams to reduce our overall risk. Again, let me stress, we take a long-term view of this business. We are in this for the long haul. We are building a platform. We are investing in our business. We are making sure that we\u2019ve got a platform that\u2019s scalable and can take additional aircraft, both passenger and cargo aircraft that we can ramp up our people and our infrastructure in a way that is sustainable, and we can do within our budget requirements. That\u2019s our view of the business. And I think if anyone believes that we should take a different approach, then this investment may not be for you. So Q1 is a reflection of our approach. Cargo, after 2 years of planning, and we started cargo planning pretty soon after we started the certification process on the passenger side, but we knew because of the long planning time that\u2019s required to operate cargo airplanes as well as get those cargo airplanes under LOI and under lease that we have to start early. So we tied up 15 A321 freighters even before we were certified as a US 121 airline. Certification happened in the first quarter of this year, and we received our first airplane, and that airplane is now operating and operated for 21 days in Q1. Tremendous amount of effort, sweat, tears and cash to do that, but we invested in this business, and this now is going to be one of the main drivers of our growth in the years to come. Cuba. Big important part of our strategy is to be the dominant charter operator to Cuba. We are now in that position. We\u2019ve laid a strong foundation. We brought the three largest tour operators to Cuba. We dominate that sector, and it\u2019s a good foundation of revenue for us each one. Pilots. We invest in pay and benefits to reduce attrition, along with intense focus on recruitment and training. We did a tremendous amount of that, and we\u2019ll get to a slide where we show how many pilots we have been able to recruit and train and retain which is the most important of those 3 words as we move forward. Infrastructure. We\u2019re building our IT systems, but as well, we\u2019re building a great team of dispatchers, crew schedulers, flight attendance, finance, other team members within this organization. It\u2019s important to have each one of those teams operating. And as we like to say, we are a team of teams, and we\u2019ve built the infrastructure for a sustainable platform that we can grow and scale and be sustainably profitable and our certifications in the first quarter, culminating 18 to 24 months of work. We received our DoD, Department of Defense approvals. We received our IOSA certification for \u2013 which allows us to operate for other airlines, and we received our EASA certification, which allows us to operate within and within Europe, which is very critical as part of our business plan as we move forward. We have started ETOPS certification in Q1, and we expect to receive our certification sometime in Q4 of this year, that will allow us to fly the North Atlantic as well as to Hawaii and other destinations in the Pacific once we have that certification. So commentary on Q1. Traditionally, the slowest quarter in commercial aviation, every major airline and most of the ULCCs lost money in the first quarter. We are different than the scheduled airline, and there are some different elements of our first quarter that impacted our profitability, which we\u2019ll talk about. But we had some significant scheduled maintenance during Q1 as a result of the leases that we put in place. We\u2019ve got tremendous lease benefits because of the scheduled maintenance that was scheduled as part of our acquisition of those aircraft, but we had to endure that during the first quarter. We got through that, but it effectively reduced our fleet by 2 aircraft. We knew that going in and we had planned for, but that allows us now to be relatively heavy maintenance-free for the balance of the year. We accelerated hiring and training of pilots and flight attendants to allow us to execute what is a robust sold out summer schedule, and we\u2019ll talk about that in a moment. As mentioned, we added two major tour operators to our Cuba operation effective of March 1. This gives us a stable long-term cash flow, $3 million from those two major tour operators with the third operator, we\u2019re up well over $4 million per month, which is a great foundation of revenue for us as we move forward. As I said, we finalized and received our key certifications DoD, IOSA and our TCO for the EASA. We signed LOIs for 2 additional A320 passenger aircraft, and we had a deferral of the major U.S. government contract that we had planned for, which we have started to fly in December of last year. And because of some issues within the U.S. government about how they were treating transborder issues on the Southern border, this contract had to be deferred. Now, we are starting to pick up that work here in May, and that will continue for the balance of the year. We will eventually pick up all of that revenue again, but it impacted Q1 outside of our control, we work with our major clients, the U.S. government to mitigate that. We were able to get some other contracts in place quickly to sort of mitigate that, but we didn\u2019t go as far as possible in order to get to a breakeven in Q1. Had we had that major contract and had we had a few less issues on getting our aircraft out of scheduled maintenance, our Q1 would have been breakeven or slightly positive. Let me say that again. After 2 issues outside of our control, both of which now, we believe, will be to our benefit as we move forward, we would have been breakeven in Q1 as we had predicted as well we had invested in the business in terms of cargo and aircraft and systems and people. And so in my view, again, Q1 was a huge success for us. I\u2019ll ask Ryan to go \u2013 start going through some of our metrics.\nRyan Goepel: So one of the key elements that we talk about is we\u2019re more than just an airline \u2013 many people categorize this as an airline. We\u2019re trying to position ourselves more as a service company and as a service company we sell block hours. Now our metric, our key metric is how many block hours and a block hour for those who don\u2019t know, is when an aircraft pushes back in the date, the blocks come off and then the aircraft gets pushed back the date, the blocks go on. It\u2019s right time for taxes. But the number of block hours per month is a key metric to track. The other key metric we track is how many block hours we fly per aircraft per month. Both of these, as you can see, have had double- if not triple-digit growth since March of last year, and we\u2019re continuing to see that trend going into the summer. Our key element in order to fly this aircraft performing the block hours is our pilot pool. As you can see, our pilot pool has grown from 65 to 85 \u2013 or 60 to 85 over the course of the quarter, a 41% increase. We also allude to I guess a minute later slide, we\u2019ve continued that hiring into Q2, and we\u2019ll give you an update on that and again, the net aircraft days per month. As you can see, despite our block hours growing at 110%, our net aircraft days have only grown by 35%, which means we\u2019re utilizing the existing assets more effectively and more efficiently and bodes well for what we consider our growth plan going forward. Looking at the Q1 \u201822 results. $32.2 million of revenue, which is our best revenue month \u2013 our best revenue quarter, sorry, adjusted EBITDAR of $2.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of $2.9 million. The key adjustments we put in to factor in is $500,000 per share-based comp and $1.4 million for private training and $240,000 worth in cash lease accounting adjustment. What I think this reflects is our ability to start delivering profit and how close we are to becoming a profitable airline, but while reflecting the investment we\u2019re making in our crews and infrastructures that are needed too.\nEd Wegel: The important issues here now, this is a loss of $2.9 million on the EBITDA line. Had we had the revenue from the contract that was deferred, we would have been closer to $40 million in revenue and that would have been just a blowout quarter for us, sometimes things happen in this business, sometimes they happen in sequence. And that\u2019s what occurred in Q1, but we don\u2019t see this as any indication of the sustainability and the profitability of this platform. Again, we built a platform through this whole quarter and set us up for what should be a very robust second half of this year. And again, have we not deferred that revenue from Q1 into later in the year, we would have been breakeven or profitable for this quarter, even with all of the investment that we took into this business. And we need to emphasize that, when we invest in this business in training and recruiting, hiring and all the other things that we do here in the company, we expense them immediately. There is very, very little that gets capitalized. So while we are creating assets for the company, we are expensing them as we go. And so this leaves us clean as we move forward so that we\u2019ve got good comparisons month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter as we move forward. Our outlook for 2023 is we\u2019re reaffirming our forecast of $140-plus million in revenue, positive EBITDA, 75% of the $140 million is under contract. The balance will be under contract here very soon. We expect not officially to do much better than $140 million, but right now, our guidance is between $140 million and $145 million, frankly, for this year. A little over 12,000 hours contracted for 2023 to date. We have the potential to contract up to an additional 10,000 hours depending upon aircraft delivery dates, which is a fluid element of our business, and we\u2019ll discuss that in a few moments. This compares to about little over 10,000 hours that we contracted in 2022. Fleet size target at the year end again passenger between 9 to 12 aircraft and cargo, 2 to 6 aircraft. This all depends on the final DOT approvals and our ability to get these aircraft out of heavy maintenance and deliver to us on time, which is an industry-wide problem at this point, both on new aircraft deliveries coming from the OEM as well as used aircraft going through maintenance to be delivered to another lessee. In addition to this, later this year, we will start Department of Defense contracts. We\u2019re already bidding on some. We will complete our ETOPS, which allows us to operate over water 180 minutes. We will finalize our Colombian AOC applications. We are actually entering phase 3 of our AOC process in Colombia, which is the Colombian CAA air version of the FAA reviewing our manuals and moving us on to the last phase, which are booking flights. We are focused like a laser on expanding both passenger and cargo charter businesses in 2023. We are well on track. Our revenue is there. Our systems are there. Our people are there. All of the infrastructure that we need to deliver in the second half of this year has been developed between the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. We have set the stage for great growth, profitable growth and long-term sustainability of this platform. This gives you a sense of the breadth and depth of our operations that we\u2019ll conduct this summer. This just shows the scheduled operations. And when I say schedule, we\u2019re a charter airline, but we provide essential scheduled operations every day to Cuba, scheduled operations every day to the Dominican Republic and scheduled operations to Cancun and then as well, we will be operating out of Calgary for a Canadian airline called Lynx into LA, Las Vegas and Phoenix. We will be operating for Red Way out of Lincoln, Nebraska, to Las Vegas and Orlando, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Austin and Dallas, and we have some other scheduled operations for other airlines that are shown here. This gives you an idea of the breadth of our North American operation this summer. And you can see on the bottom as well, we\u2019ve blown out the Cuba operation. You see that we fly to 4 cities there as well as Cancun. We will start operations into Haiti at the end of this month and operations into Santo Domingo and La Romana, a year-round and this summer will peak with as many as 8 or 9 flights a week into the resort towns in the Dominican Republic. We are the only charter operator into the Dominican Republic this year from North America. We have gained 100% market share, U.S. charter markets in the Dominican Republic. Next is our operations in Europe. We will fly two airplanes, two in Netherlands out of Amsterdam. This is the initial schedule that we\u2019ve been given. We will fly 400 hours per aircraft per month over 2 months and then 1 aircraft in September, they\u2019ve already asked us to extend the operation through the month of September with 1 aircraft. So this is a great operation for us. We\u2019ll be operating all over Europe, the Mediterranean, North Africa, Turkey and Greece. And we are really looking forward to this. As you know, our operations last year were impacted by regulatory approvals. All of that has been solved. We\u2019ve received all the approvals that we need. We have a great relationship with TUI. We now have a 3-year deal with them, and we\u2019re now talking to them about operations in the U.S. where we can combine our strengths and our synergy and operate for TUI operators here in the U.S. with some of their aircraft and our infrastructure and back office operations. So we are looking forward to a great summer all over Europe, all over North America, all over the Caribbean, and as well on top of this, we have all of our ad hoc operations. So we\u2019ll be flying to Greenland this summer for cruise lines. We\u2019ll be flying all over South America and Central America, and we\u2019ll be expanding our cargo operations starting this summer so that we\u2019ll pick up another post office route as well as routes out of Mexico and Texas into some of the industrial cities in the Northeast on behalf of some automakers and some others. So our cargo operations on top of our scheduled passenger operations lead us to a very, very robust summer. And we\u2019ll talk about the block hours that we project for this summer and into the fall. These are two aircraft that we recently added to the fleet. On the left is another airplane that we took from Alaska Airlines. We got a very good lessor airborne capital that we have been working with, and we chose to think this in what we would consider a retro delivery. It\u2019s got a lot of interest and a lot of kudos for this particular delivery that we put on this airplane. And as well, we took our first cargo aircraft N410GX. We received that in February, finalized all of our cargo certifications and that airplane started flying on March 10. It\u2019s had 100% dispatch reliability. Lower fuel brand than what we had been projecting and greater reliability and the customers that we have flown this airplane for love the aircraft, love the lower belly loading system, and love the fact that it\u2019s 50% more volume than its main competitor. And it\u2019s just a great airplane, and we\u2019ve got 15 more of these coming over the next 24 months. Again, when we have shown this slide previously that we are moving towards 30 aircraft by the end of 2024 moving more towards a mix an equal mix between passenger and cargo aircraft, now we\u2019ll eventually get there probably in 2025, but we still see this as our evolution of aircraft over the next 2 years. This is all impacted by a number of things, as we\u2019ve discussed, heavy maintenance prior to delivery. We\u2019ve experienced delays in every aircraft that\u2019s come out of heavy maintenance, just like every other airline around the world has been experiencing. It\u2019s subject to having crew availability, we have to recruit, hire and train pilots and flight of things. So that\u2019s a constant process, and it impacts our ability to take aircraft on a certain schedule and as well as other factors, including the \u2013 our ability to put these aircraft to work to ensure ourselves that we\u2019ve got contracts that we can fly for these aircraft as soon as they are on the certificate. But we feel very comfortable with these numbers over the next 2 years. This is our delivery plan. The A320 was delivered and N411GX, which is our next freighter aircraft, which brings us to 2 freighters now should be delivered the last week in May. We will need to do some conformity and some regulatory work on that airplane, but we expect that airplane to be flying in revenue service in early June. And let me stress and all of you know this because we have talked about it. Our first freighter aircraft was delayed about 6.5 months coming out of conversion. And the second airplane, the second freighter is going to be delayed about 8 months. If we had had both of these aircraft as we had projected in December of last year, our profit \u2013 we would have had an additional $6 million of revenue in Q1. But we were impacted by their ability to get these aircraft out of the MRO, get the components and parts that they needed, get the manpower that they needed to get these aircraft converted and get them to us. So significantly negatively impacted by the inability of the MROs to get the aircraft to us and that will continue for some time. But we are making the best of it. These aircraft are coming in as soon as we can get them, and we are putting it out to work as soon as we can get them. Our target plan for the rest of the year is several additional A320 passenger aircraft as well as several additional freighter aircraft. Again, we are impacted by their ability to deliver the aircraft out of heavy maintenance. And so some of these dates will slip, but that\u2019s okay. We will deal with that, and we will adjust, we will get these airplanes in and we will get them to work as soon as we can, which is another way of saying that we need to take a longer-term view of this business. There are lots of factors outside of our control that impact our ability to operate. We have a team that knows how to adjust to that. We have a team that knows how to accommodate those issues. We just have to work through it like every other airline is working through it as we speak. So entirely confident in our team to be able to adapt to delays in aircraft and delays in deliveries and the impact that has on our customers and our operations. But we know how to deal with that. We\u2019ve dealt with it over the last year, and we will continue to do so. Again, take a longer-term view of this business. Where are we going to be a year from now? Where are we going to be 2 years from now? Short-term issues and invest that affect us do not impact our longer-term vision for this airline and what we will accomplish. Ryan, why don\u2019t you take us through passenger sales?\nRyan Goepel: Sure. Passenger sales. We\u2019ve discussed many of these elements, but this is sort of a way of summarizing it to two major tour operators generating about $3 million a month over 600 hours of Lynx Air, 240 hours a month with of Red Way Air out of Lincoln, Nebraska. That\u2019s starting as a 3-month program. We expect that to be year around. 150 hours per month for 4 months with the Caribbean Airline, which we expect to be extended as well. In addition to the 2,000 hours per year with TUI for the next 3 years. We\u2019ve executed on our March Madness strategy. We talked about our servicing the NCAA. We operated over 70 flights over 30 weeks, over 3 weeks, almost 50% of all flights from our standards. Focusing on securing for the fall when we look at contracts to be secured, we\u2019re focusing on securing NCAA Fall Football, Department of Defense and hopefully basketball another government business, which is \u2013 with a sold-out summer that\u2019s where our sales focus is really starting to write down. Moving to cargo, as Ed alluded to, we operated 21 days in Q1. The second aircraft will start on June 1. First aircraft, 100% dispatch reliability. Operating costs and fuel burn less than forecast. Really proving out the economics of this aircraft. With the lower belly system now installed, it is a huge \u2013 it\u2019s a big differentiator versus the competition, which is really 737, 800 and 757. We\u2019re very excited about this product, we\u2019re excited having 15 more of these coming online. And we\u2019re even more excited about what our customers are reacting to, and we truly understand the economics of this aircraft and this really does business comes down to economics.\nEd Wegel: So we have projected and expected six aircraft months of greater operations in Q1, and we ended up with 21 days. Now we\u2019re going to operate this airplane for the next 15 years. So a blip in Q1 where we had some delays in aircraft that we work through and instead of six aircraft months, we ended up with a little less than one. It\u2019s frustrating. And it impacted us short term. But again, let me say, we\u2019re going to be operating all of these airplanes, some of them for as long as 15 years, some for 10 years, but many of them are for as many as 15 years. This is a great airplane. So the market is a great airplane for us, and we take a long-term view of this business. We are going to build a very, very robust, very sustainable cargo business around this aircraft and then a sister ship, which will be the A330 cargo aircraft in the next year to 2 years. So had we have six aircraft months available to us of cargo aircraft in Q1, that\u2019s almost $7 million in revenue. And we ended up with a little less than $1 million of revenue. But again, it\u2019s one quarter in 1 year, we\u2019re going to be operating this airplane for 15 years.  Pilot recruitment is something that we focus on at an 8 a.m. meeting every morning here in this conference room. And in Q1, we grew our pilot headcount by a little over 40%, in Q2 to date, another 30%. We\u2019re utilizing the agreements that we have in place now to increase our pipeline, and we\u2019ve talked about this before, OSM, CAE, L3 and our use of the Colombian AOC once we get through that certification process will allow us to attract pilots there that will fly on the Colombian certificate until we can get them up into the U.S., but we will also use those pilots to fly intra-Latin America as well as from Latin America to the U.S., which takes some pressure off of our need for U.S.-based pilots. We are getting much better at this for a number of reasons. One, we are seen as a stable, sustainable airline now that we\u2019ve reached 10 airplanes. And given the progress that we\u2019ve made in cargo and our certifications. Some pilots who have left us for major airlines are \u2013 we\u2019ve got two calls from pilots this week asking that they could come back to GlobalX. The grass is not as green at some of these major airlines as many of them think. And some of them, the rest have come back to us. We think that\u2019s a pretty good sign. So we\u2019ve been successful in our recruiting and hiring upgrade for pilots, both direct entry captains as well as first officers. As we grow, as we get stronger, as we show that we have the quality of life here that is better than other places where they can fly and that word gets out through the pilot ranks throughout the industry, we think that we will do better than our fair share of pilots and good pilots as we move forward.\nRyan Goepel: Yes. One thing that I wanted to touch on is on the Investor Relations side. We did have an issue \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say an issue, there was a concern, I think, on the last call as it related to warrants that were expiring. On April 26, 4.6 million warrants did expire, which reduced our fully diluted share count by a little under 8%. If you look on the right, an updated cap table of our common Class A and Class B. We also show our existing warrants that are outstanding. It should be noted of those 11 million warrants, 9 million of those warrants are restricted in the sense they can\u2019t convert into more than 4.9% of common equity. So from that perspective, it\u2019s likely those will go to expiry if they do get converted. If you look at the fully diluted number, again, one of the elements of recruitment is on RSUs. We really do encourage employee ownership and employee RSUs for retention. Those \u2013 most of those vest over 3 years. But again, I think our capital structure as it is right now is pretty tight considering where it was from the beginning and to where we are now. If you look at some of the initiatives we did in Q1, we have a digital program that has increased our mailing list by 14,000 names, many of you are on it. Attended two major microcap conference, Planet Micro Cap and Sequire in Puerto Rico. Registered to present at the Gravitas conference, June 5, in Los Angeles, and we are still planning an uplift in conjunction with growth and capital raise in 2023. It will not be a Q2 event. It will be later in \u201823 as we \u2013 is our ambition, as we\u2019ve alluded to on the previous call.\nEd Wegel: As we said in the press release that we put out today, we\u2019re in active and, I would say, advanced discussions with a number of equity funds and other credit funds. We are financing our business going forward. We\u2019ve got a tremendous amount of interest. I need to be careful about what I say, but I think that we are in a good position. And let me stress something that I said in my preamble to this presentation. This management team has been very, very diligent and very, very careful in how we raise money and how much money we raise and the dilution that results from them. I think that we have done between us and the Board of Directors who\u2019ve done a great job in managing that. Again, we have gotten to this point in our life cycle with $28 million of cash, $28 million, $7 million of which we still have, it\u2019s on our balance sheet for deposits for airplanes and airports and other deposits that we have to make. Given the progress that we\u2019ve made, 121 flag carrier with all of the certifications that we have plus cargo, plus the ability to tie up 15 A321 freighters, all of those things combined for the price tag that we have brought this in for and the dilution or the minimal dilution that we believe we have endured I think is a tremendous statement about this management team and this Board of Directors in delivering value to its shareholders. Are we frustrated with the share price? We see a lot on social media, and I get a lot of messages meaning the up over it. And all I can say is I have more shares than anybody out there. And so if anybody is as frustrated about the share price, it\u2019s got to be me. What I do is I come in here every morning at 7:00 a.m., and I don\u2019t leave until 7 p.m. and we work hard every day, every day, including Saturdays and Sundays to build this company to create shareholder value, and we will continue to do that. We have a tremendous platform that we have created, and we\u2019re about to reap the benefits of that as we get into the second half of this year. We will do what we can in outreach. Ryan has done an incredible job. He must talk to 30 or 40 investment groups every week about who we are and what we\u2019re doing. He attends the conferences. We have Zoom calls. We are getting the word out there. A lot of this is restricted because of our \u2013 where we are listed and many institutions will not be able to invest in us until we get to NASDAQ. We think about NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange just about every day and how we can get there. And I will assure you that we are focused on that and doing everything that we can to get it. No one is as interested in the stock price as I am, but I\u2019m more interested right now where we are in our life cycle as a company. I am more interested in ensuring that we have built a sustainable, profitable platform that can continue to grow and continue to compete effectively against our competitors. We have put all of the building blocks in place, certifications, aircraft, people infrastructure to do that. That\u2019s the most important thing at this point because we take a long-term view of this business, and we\u2019re creating long-term value for our shareholders. Finally, just something that we wanted to ensure everyone knew and we\u2019re quite proud of this. We worked very, very hard here to create a culture with the right set of values the way we work with and we treat our team members. We went through a pretty rigorous certification process with surveys and interviews with our team members by an outside group called Great Place to Work. They have certified companies like American Express and Delta Airlines and others. So we went through that process, and we received our certification for this coming year. We\u2019re quite proud of that. We\u2019re putting that in all of our recruiting materials, especially to pilots and flight attendance. And we think that this indicates that we\u2019re on the right track in terms of building a culture with a set of values that will allow us to maintain this airline and grow it profitably in the years to come. So with that, Grant, I\u2019ll turn it back to you for questions. And again, we appreciate everyone for your interest and support on this call. Grant, fire away.\nA - Grant Howard: Ed, Ryan, great job as always. And as I say, every quarter on these webinars, Ryan find me another company listed on a junior exchange in North America, that\u2019s a complex as much or so little as you spoke out. So congratulations. Number of questions already, and I\u2019ll get right into it. 400 plus employees, can you please tell us what your monthly payroll is including taxes and benefits?\nRyan Goepel: I think I would hate to quote a number, I\u2019d be wrong. It will be in our Q under salaries, wages and benefits, divide that by 3.\nEd Wegel: So that includes \u2013 so let\u2019s talk about the various categories within them. That includes all of our ground handling and fueling operations here at MIA which is approximately 60 to 70 people, right? That is in place because it effectively reduces our overall cost. By adding those people in place, it reduces our ground handling costs on a turn of our aircraft here in Miami as well. The market rate, which is about $2,900 a turn down to about $1,500 a turn. So that\u2019s a very, very effective use of capital and a very effective use of team members because it reduces our overall cost. On the fueling side, we are now at breakeven even with all of the fuels and the fuel trucks and so forth that we use. The important thing about our fueling operation is it ensures that our aircraft depart on time. The other fuelers here at MIA, at Miami International, are not very good. And we were experiencing delays every day, sometimes 2 or 3 hours because they focus on American Airlines here at MIA, and we were always an afterthought. So we went and got our own certificates to fuel our own airplanes. And now we\u2019re on time, and we\u2019re breaking even and now we are approaching other airlines to fuel their airplanes. And we expect this to be a profit center for us in the next quarter to two quarters. On the other categories, we\u2019ve got obviously pilots, a little over 100 pilots, which we need to fly the summer schedule. Flight attendants, again to fly the summer schedule about 150 flight attendants at this point, over three bases, Las Vegas, San Antonio and Miami. And then we\u2019ve got maintenance. We do a lot of our own maintenance in-house. So we have aircraft maintenance technicians who operate on our aircraft. And so we\u2019ve got a large contingent of them that actually drives our costs down. So we have built here in Miami, the ability to handle our own airplanes to fuel our own airplanes and to maintain our own airplanes, which is almost unheard of for an airline of this size. And overall, it reduces our costs, increases our operational efficiency and makes us a much better airline because of the vendors out there who shall I say, don\u2019t really perform up to our standard. Beyond that, we are growing our finance team. We have a very, very complicated operation over Europe and the U.S., and we operate for lots of different clients. And we\u2019re a public company. So we need a fairly robust finance team on the dispatch side, as we grow our operation, which is now a 24/7 operation. We have dispatchers on through the night because we operate 24 hours a day. And that also includes crew schedulers and others who help us to operate on a 24-hour schedule. So it may seem like a lot, but we have built the infrastructure now so that we can take all of the airplanes that we expect to take this year in advance of when those aircraft come which is a requirement of the DOT and the FAA.\nRyan Goepel: To answer the question about $3.7 million.\nGrant Howard: Topic of money. Question here about the bad debt write-off. So we asked for paying in advance. And I\u2019m going from memory, weren\u2019t the bad debt something under $20,000 that were written off?\nRyan Goepel: Yes, we do ask for money, cash in advance. We do have elements of reconciliations when we incur costs after the fact they tend to be pretty minor in the big scheme of things. And so yes, I think the numbers are small, but there are true-ups. So we have a base fuel price. So we invoice the customer for fuel after the fact \u2013 we did actually have some bad debt recovery. I think it was a recovery this year. So we have written some off and then collected it after the tax.\nEd Wegel: So it\u2019s certainly less than 1 quarter of 1%, and probably much less than that. We focus on that a lot, as Ryan said. We do a fuel reconciliation. And \u2013 because it\u2019s after the tax, sometimes we get into a healthy discussion with the client. 99% of the time, we collect the money because they need us supply again for them. But it\u2019s like any business. There are some things that are collected after the event and sometimes, we have to negotiate a deal. But it\u2019s a de minimis amount of money that we write-off.\nGrant Howard: And you\u2019ve addressed this in part, and I understand you have to be cautious, but a little bit of a two-parter, so how active are discussions on raising capital and in this great credit environment, is it the case of getting a good deal versus any deal?\nEd Wegel: The financing \u2013 and Ryan will provide some color to this. For every business out there right now, the financing environment is tough. Last year, every private equity fund pooled in their \u2013 pooled their stock and wanted to see what happened, right? And as I said in my preamble, right, we\u2019re dealing with a lot of different events right now. We\u2019ve got inflation. We\u2019ve got rising interest rates. We\u2019ve got a war in Europe. We\u2019ve got issues with the southern border. Lingering effects of COVID and on and on that we have dealt with. Having said that, through the course of the last 18 months, we get approached almost continually by people who want to take a look at it and see if it makes sense for them to invest in us. As you know, we\u2019ve done almost none of that. We financed ourselves internally with some of our investors because we don\u2019t want to suffer the dilution that would come from that. We\u2019ve lived on our own resources, we\u2019ve lived on our own cash. We are thinly capitalized in terms of working capital. We\u2019re talking to a lot of different groups. And as we\u2019ve said in the press release, we\u2019re in what we think are advanced discussions with a number of parties. Nothing is said. Nothing is \u2013 nothing has been signed. We look at a range of different ways to invest in this company. Because of our stock price, most of those ways are involved a debt or a credit facility with warrants. We\u2019re negotiating very hard with each one of those. We\u2019ve negotiated with a number of groups who have walked away because perhaps we\u2019ve been a bit too tough on them. Because we\u2019re really bullish about this business. And we want them to pay for what we think we have created here and what the potential opportunity here is for an investor. But we\u2019re \u2013 in order for us to take additional aircraft and grow the way we want to grow and to put some cash on the balance sheet, which is important. As we move forward, and there may be other external shocks to the entire ecosystem around the world, we need more cash on the balance sheet. So we\u2019re talking with a number of parties, we\u2019ve got two great investment banks that are working with us and advising us. And I \u2013 again, I need to be very careful, but I am optimistic. And I don\u2019t know, Ryan, if you want to add some color?\nRyan Goepel: No. I think \u2013 we believe we have a great platform, and we\u2019re very encouraged going forward, and there is a lot of interest in what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re doing.\nEd Wegel: I think universally, the reaction that we get as we do our initial talks and then groups may get into a data room that we have put together is that they are amazed at how far we have gotten on such little cash and the platform that we have built. And so they see the opportunity. And again, we\u2019re \u2013 because of our stock price, we\u2019ve got to be very careful about how we structure this. They understand that, and they are all working with us, and we\u2019re looking at facilities or credit facility, and even in some cases, facilities to be able to acquire our own aircraft instead of lease moving forward, not using operating leases but being able to acquire aircraft to put on our balance sheet. So again, Ryan and I are optimistic. We\u2019ve talked to a lot of groups. We\u2019ve got a number of groups that are very, very interested. It\u2019s getting the right deal that\u2019s in the best interest of all of our shareholders. And we keep in mind the interest of all of our shareholders in every one of those discussions.\nGrant Howard: Comment here about your candidness and holding quarterly webinars. I will paraphrase this next question, but effectively asking the secure contract, you\u2019re bidding a lower rate than perhaps the competition and again, I have to paraphrase this point?\nEd Wegel: So the question is what to get to where we are with discounting. Is that the...\nGrant Howard: Yes. Effectively, yes.\nEd Wegel: No. So we\u2019ve done an analysis, which Ryan has run. He and his team have sliced and diced our data now, and we\u2019re starting to get enough data from enough months of operation that we can actually start to look at trends and how we\u2019re doing. So our unit economics, and I\u2019ll let Ryan talk about this. But essentially, we\u2019ve been improving every month and our unit economics. So our need to discount to sharp elbows to get into the business that\u2019s waning very quickly because of our reputation now for providing a great product in terms of our aircraft and how they look and how our crews look and act and the professionalism of the entire organization. We believe that we\u2019re in a position where we can increase \u2013 continue to increase our block hour rates. Of course, it all depends on time of the year. There are certain months that are not as robust in terms of activity as other months, July and August, very, very solid, December, very, very solid, March very, very solid. Other months, the shoulder months and the low points of the year, we have to do some discounting, but I think you should talk a little bit about our unit economics.\nRyan Goepel: Yes. So we make the statement that every flight we fly, we make money. And what that means is, we don\u2019t fly empty aircraft. One of the risks on the scheduled carriers you fly an aircraft don\u2019t sell in a seat, you don\u2019t sell the seat at the right price if fuel goes up and you end up burning money on a flight. Every flight we fly generate contribution to overhead. As we\u2019ve been growing the business and getting utilization, so there is really two metrics. There is how much did you make per hour and how many hours did you fly. So we see a considerable improvement in our unit economics and how much we\u2019re making per hour especially over the last 9 months. And as we add aircraft utilization, which is the number of dollars we fly, we get much closer to the unit economics we talked about. And we have talked about over the last 18 months of targeting $200,000 to $250,000 a month. And contribution margin for passenger aircraft, $400,000 to $500,000 a month per cargo. We\u2019re working towards that goal. We\u2019re getting close to that goal every day. And I think you see considerable improvement, especially over the last 9 months as we get towards that. As we add aircraft that becomes easier to accomplish because you are \u2013 you can be more efficient in the way you deploy the aircraft, and that trend is held true over the last 9 months.\nEd Wegel: So \u2013 and just sort of add to that. One of the revenue streams that we have developed stems from the fact that as I mentioned before, we\u2019re impacted by our ability to get our aircraft out of maintenance. The major airlines out there, including the LCCs are having difficulty getting delivery of new aircraft from the manufacturers. In some cases, delayed as much as 2 to 2.5 years to get those airplanes. We\u2019re getting calls every day from airlines asking if we can provide airplanes to them to fill in until they get their new aircraft manufactured. And in those cases, they don\u2019t ask too much how much we\u2019re going to charge them, they just say how many months can you give us the airplane? So we\u2019re seeing that there is an actual shortage of aircraft out there and that\u2019s the result of the net maintenance delays, inability of the manufacturers to get the airplanes through their factories because of supply chain issues. And we think that this condition will exist for the next few years. That will have upward pressure on block hour rates that we charge and will make us more selective. So we can provide more differentiated revenue streams that are focused on that line of activity as opposed to some of the other charters where we don\u2019t get a very good block hour rate. So we can be more selective as we move forward with the clients who we fly for to maximize our revenue.\nGrant Howard: Ryan, you\u2019ve already spoken about NASDAQ uplift this year. Question here is, are you on track to uplift this year? I don\u2019t know if you want to say anything else further to what you\u2019ve already said?\nRyan Goepel: I think we\u2019ve said enough.\nEd Wegel: There is really not too much that we can say there about that. Everyone knows what our objective is. And we would have to add assets to our balance sheet to be able to do that. And we are working actively to do that.\nGrant Howard: Speaking of long-term, which has been the theme of this webinar question is, I understand the long-term goal. You need a critical number of aircraft, pay, amortize fixed costs across the operation. Nevertheless, when do you expect profitability?\nRyan Goepel: Yes. I think we\u2019re \u2013 we expect profitability this year. We said we will be profitable in 2023. I think, what I don\u2019t want to do is a mistake. So a mistake this quarter would have been not to hire 40 pilots to fly this summer because we\u2019re worried about being profitable this quarter. I think as we look at the forward-looking numbers, as we look at how much work we have, we need to make sure we can do it. I think ultimately, when we get to 10 passenger two to four freighters, I\u2019ll be very comfortable with our profit numbers going forward on a monthly basis, and we will be able to absorb that kind of growth because as a percentage, it won\u2019t be doubling your pilot count. It won\u2019t be doubling your fleet in a span of 4 to 6 months. So we would say with 2023 will be profitable, and we\u2019re really excited about this one.\nEd Wegel: Important thing to remember, the charter airlines, scheduled airlines that got to seven or eight airplanes and said, this is great, we will now reduce our burn, we will just operate seven airplanes, and we will make money every quarter. Every one of those went out of business, why, because for a couple of quarters, they made money. And then they didn\u2019t grow. When they didn\u2019t grow, the amount that they pay pilots and the amount they pay flight attendants and the amount that they pay everybody else has increased and with a small number of airplanes, they are very vulnerable to outside shocks. So, we can manage this business to get to seven or eight airplanes and produce profits, and we would have been happy and we would not have survived very long. I have been doing this for 40 years. The airlines that make money and survive, airlines that make money and survive are the ones that have reasonable and sustainable growth. They invest in their business and understand that they need to continually increase the number of aircraft units that we operate, bring in lower priced, lower salaried employees at the bottom of the scale continually to reduce you\u2019re their overall funding costs and that shows that there is a career growth for the employees and team members who are there. Every airline that went to six or seven airplanes and said, hey, this is great, we can make money for the next 30 years. Is out of business within 2 years, cannot do that. The history in the last 40 years indicates that that\u2019s the mistake that we were not going to make. We are not going to manage the short-term results. We are going to manage this company on behalf of our shareholders for long-term growth, long-term sustainable profitability. We are developing assets every day. A lot of those don\u2019t show up on the balance sheet, but they are there. 15 A321 freighters are not on our balance sheet, but I get calls every day from airlines wanting to know if they can have our airplanes. That doesn\u2019t show up anywhere on any balance sheet. It\u2019s no asset. But what we have got is 15 A321 freighters coming up that will drive tremendous growth in this company, will drive tremendous profitability. If we wanted an airline that went to seven airplanes and stopped, we would have done that months ago and we would be hurting right now. Because pilots would not want to come and fly here, flight attendants would not come to work here, great finance people would not want to come and work for an airline that\u2019s only got seven airplanes and has no intent to grow. And so all of those factors go into the fact that we need to take a longer term view of this business, people don\u2019t like the fact that in the short-term, our profits are impacted by the fact that we are investing in our business. I have to manage this airline in a fiduciarily responsible way. That is the best way to be responsible as a fiduciary just to continue to grow this airline and invest in this business.\nRyan Goepel: And I think we demonstrated that in Q3 of last year. We had \u2013 if you looked at our flight, our aircraft, we have been at six for a couple of months. We hadn\u2019t really grown or we had stabilized at six. We took our seventh aircraft in August \u2013 at the beginning of August, and we generated a profit in Q3. Looking forward, the idea was we didn\u2019t want to stay at seven aircraft, we wanted to add cargo. We want to add three passenger aircraft. We are looking to add two to six cargo aircraft and that investment really started in Q4. And I think we are seeing that in the numbers, but that will pay dividends, and that will take off as we get into the summer months.\nEd Wegel: The other benefit of having a growing an airline is when you do get a minor shop like the deferral of a government contract for a few months, it becomes less and less materially significant to the company, the larger the company is. And the smaller the company, the more material that shock is to our system. So therefore, we need to diversify our revenue streams. We need to have a larger base of aircraft operating for a diverse set of clients so that any one issue doesn\u2019t become a black swan issue for us. It\u2019s just a minor irritant along the way. And we are building this airline so that there are no external shocks to the system that will take us out of business.\nGrant Howard: So, the brand is in question, can you take the picture of what GlobalX will look like post 50 planes in the air, targets, goals over the next 3 years to 5 years? What is your long-term big picture growth plan, such as drone next-gen technology, acquisition growth? There is a lot of moving parts on that question.\nRyan Goepel: Yes, there is \u2013 go ahead.\nEd Wegel: Yes. The first thing is to get 250 \u2013 through the 50 aircraft number, right. And each aircraft that we take on, as I mentioned in my preamble, should take some tremendous amount of effort, especially these days, given the issues with maintenance facilities and new regulations, aging aircraft regulations, all of that impacts, the timing and our ability to take aircraft on a schedule that we want to take them on. So, a lot of our day is consumed with planning for the delays and other issues around getting the airplanes here and on the certificate. Having said that, this team does an incredible job doing just that, taking these airplanes, getting them informed, getting them into our configuration and getting them on our certificate. So, immediate goals are to get to 25 passenger 320 family, 25 A321s. We are also looking at the A330. We are in deep discussions about that, and we wanted to get through these two quarters and make sure that we are prepared for this summer and fall, which will be very, very big quarters for us. And we also just got through a process of getting certified in a number of ways, and now we need to get ETOPS certification. So, bringing an A330 on is another layer of complexity. We need to be a bit bigger before we can do that, but we have the capability in-house to do exactly that. And we want to get 330s on the certificate as soon as we can in a way that makes sense without negatively impacting the rest of the operation. So, longer term, we will operate A320s, A321s, A330s. Eventually, as the new generation A320s get a little older, and we can afford them as a charter airline, we want to take 12-year-old A320neos, which is a 20% savings in fuel burn, newer technology aircraft, lower operating costs and all that. We are not quite there yet. We have got to wait for a few more years, so the prices of those to come down so that we can effectively employ them within our budget. But beyond that, we see M&A opportunities for us in the years to come. We see opportunities to take this brand and scale it and is a very, very good reason why we call it GlobalX. We are looking at putting an AOC in Europe. We have got the AOC that we will have in Latin America. And we believe that there is a big and growing market and a demand for this type of airline in Asia. And so we have done very, very preliminary work. We don\u2019t think much about it at this point because we have got other more important things to do. But I think that eventually in the next few years, we can put a GlobalX in Southeast Asia. We can put a GlobalX maybe in Australia. GlobalX in other parts of the world, perhaps on some sort of franchise basis, where we provide aircraft and crews and support systems and infrastructure. We haven\u2019t thought through all of that, but we think pretty broadly about this business. We think the ACMI business is a growing business, a good business for us to be in, and we are looking at ways where we can scale this around the world and other parts and other continents where this sort of service is new.\nGrant Howard: You are talking about the summer and the question here after the big push to hire pilots and flight attendants, do you anticipate you will be fully staffed the demand for summer and the second half of this year?\nEd Wegel: Yes. The short answer is yes. So, big push Q4 and Q1 of this year to bring pilots on and the cost profile to have them in training for three months, going up hotels for DMs, simulator time, instructor time, getting them out on OE is\u2026\nRyan Goepel: $28,000 a month over three months.\nEd Wegel: So, $28,000 per month, per pilot over three months to get them ready to fly the line, right. So, it\u2019s almost short of $90,000 to bring a pilot on and to get them ready to fly. And we have got to do that in advance of that airplane being delivered to us so that those pilots are in place. So, you can see what the cost is just by doing a simple math, but us have 110 pilots on our certificate able to fly our airplanes. It\u2019s a significant investment that we have made in pilots. We made a significant investment in quality of life for them and benefits so that we don\u2019t lose them. No point in doing that, spending $90,000 and then being a little cheap on benefits or some other life \u2013 quality of life issues and then having them move off to a Spirit or an Allegiant six months after we train them. Not a very, very good effective use of our cash. But it\u2019s a tremendous investment that we have to make in human resources to be able to operate this airline. We have made that investment. And we are in a position to fly a very, very busy and robust summer schedule, as you have seen in the two maps that we put up on the current presentation.\nGrant Howard: Ryan said about Flugy as \u2013 can you provide an update, please, and perhaps remindful what Flugy is?\nRyan Goepel: So, Flugy is an on-demand charter tool that would basically allow you to crowd source charters. It\u2019s been developed. The technology is valid and available. I think over the last two quarters. We have really been focusing on growing our passenger charter business, and we will be revisiting that in the summer and looking to monetize that going into the end of 2023.\nEd Wegel: Yes. Our strategy there is to attract some outside investors so that we can spin this off, investors who understand technology and some of the areas that we are not as versed in. What we want to do is provide aircraft for the charters that Flugy creates. Our goal is to maintain a minority stake, but have well-heeled investors who understand technology and some of the other aspects of that business so that we can run at their hotels, but most importantly, would be a great source of charter business for us as that platform grows. We have got a very, very nominal amount of investment in that business. We believe that we can get it capitalized with some very savvy, well-heeled outside investors. But we are quite ready, been so busy getting ready for the summer that we haven\u2019t spent a lot of effort on it. We are talking to an individual who we think we can bring in, who can take that whole company and platform to the next level, so very much on our minds to do something there. It\u2019s a little bit lower on our list of priorities right now. We need to make sure that the mainline company is performing well and prepared for the second half of this year.\nGrant Howard: A couple of people have asked about progress and status on the Fort Lauderdale facility.\nEd Wegel: So, we have received final approval from the FAA, who is the developers and builders have received final approval from the FAA. We have got two financing sources now that have come in and committed to building the facility. We are hoping to break ground here within the next 60 days, and we are still aiming for Q4 of 2024, to occupy that facility.\nGrant Howard: Can you please explain why adjusted EBITDA excludes pilot training costs? Aren\u2019t these regular ongoing expenses?\nRyan Goepel: So, those are regular ongoing expenses for existing pilots. These are pilot training costs, pilots in excess of those needed to operate the revenue generated. So, if you need 30 pilots to generate $30 million of revenue, and you have 60 pilots on your payroll, 30 of which are not flying for revenue but are training so we can do $50 million in revenue, that\u2019s what the adjustments for. So, this is not recurring training. This is not for existing pilots that are flying for revenue. These are non-revenue generating pilots for future revenue growth.\nEd Wegel: It\u2019s really an investment in growth. So, we separate that out.\nGrant Howard: Just a question here, do you have further plans or what are your plans for A330?\nEd Wegel: A330 is on our list. We will, at some point, sign operating leases for A330s. We have actually started pulling together the manuals that we would need to submit to the FAA to do that. We have not pulled the trigger on signing any LOIs at this point. What we want to do again is ensure that we get the airplanes on to our certificate, the A320s and the freighter aircraft to ensure that we lock in our 2023 plan. But we have a planning team that has put together our plan to put the A330 on the certificate. We have got a timeline. We have got a basic set of manuals put together. We are talking to every lessor about out there about the A330. And in particular, talking about A330 passenger aircraft that could eventually be converted to A330 freighter aircraft. That would be one offer a mix of passenger and freighter aircraft to complement these narrow-body fleet that we have.\nGrant Howard: Does any future financing include taking out the $6 million, 15% instrument that comes due in March, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right?\nRyan Goepel: So, what\u2019s the question?\nGrant Howard: Well, if your \u2013 I guess the question that the person is trying to ask here is you \u2013 and I am going from memory, you had a $5 million note and you have drawn down against that and I believe it was a six-month note, so what are plans in and around that?\nEd Wegel: So, yes. So, the first part of the question is in our new financing would we take that out. Yes. Our plan would be to take out the $6 million as well as we drew $2.5 million of the $5 million. So, it\u2019s $8.5 million. So, in any financing structure, as we have talked to potential investors, we make it clear that, that money has to be \u2013 or that those facilities need to be taken out. And of course, anyone coming in would want to do that because they would look to have a senior position on the company. So, that\u2019s \u2013 we had always intended to finance those out. It was a very good way for us to raise money with minimal dilution, and so we will take those out as part of any larger financing that we do.\nGrant Howard: A question about the growth, hope I pronounced that properly based on an insider report, you sold 376,000 shares in early February to early March, I believe, still hold 2.5 million shares. So, the question is you used to be on your Board, do you have any background on that? And I have already asked the question, yes, he is a major shareholder.\nEd Wegel: Yes. Look, people sell shares for lots of different reasons. One of them is to pay taxes. I don\u2019t know if Joe\u2019s personal situation and certainly wouldn\u2019t ask him. He was one of the first dollars in back in 2019. And he runs a private equity fund, and he has got lots of funding requirements for lots of his other transactions. So, I don\u2019t see anything untoward in what \u2013 in his selling. Again, it\u2019s a fraction of what he owns. He continues to be a big supporter of ours, he has opened many doors for us. We keep him \u2013 to the extent we can, because he is not an insider. We keep him appraised of what we are doing. So, I don\u2019t see anything\u2026\nRyan Goepel: I don\u2019t think \u2013 there is no conclusion to draw from his selling other than he has had the stock for over 5 years and he sold some.\nEd Wegel: Yes. He has investments in his fund and he has to show some liquidity and some progress in those investments. By the way, I bought shares during the first quarter, which everyone should have seen those reports.\nGrant Howard: Somebody wanted GlobalX to manage several aircraft, would you have that ability?\nEd Wegel: We need a little more detail. It depends on the aircraft and some other things. But we have been approached to manage other people\u2019s A320s, not a business that we want to get into right now. We certainly would look at it money is money, revenue is revenue. But given the complexity of our operation now, I think that we need to focus on what we are doing, focus on A320 passenger and cargo airplanes. Certainly, if the right deal came along, we would take a look at it, but that\u2019s not our focus right now.\nGrant Howard: Interesting question of why are you providing a plane or planes to Lynx Air, which is a competitor to Canada Jetlines?\nEd Wegel: Lynx doesn\u2019t compete with Canada Jetlines. They operate out of Calgary. Canada Jetlines operates out of Toronto. And if you look at what they are doing now, well, what Canada Jetlines is doing is exactly what GlobalX does. So, they are flying sport teams. I think they have signed some deals with some soccer teams up in Canada. They are flying for Sunwing. They are buying for Flair. They are very much our business model, and they have seen what we have been doing. We talk to them. We give them advice on what we did right, what we did wrong. They are doing some scheduled service I saw, I guess Toronto, Vancouver at some point and some other things. But when it comes to customers and clients, we are separate from Canada Jetlines. We are agnostic in who we provide our aircraft to. As long as it\u2019s a viable real organization, they have money, okay, and they pass all of the KYC tests and everything else that we put them through. We are agnostic. We will fly our airplanes to them. That\u2019s where our responsibility is to our shareholders. We are not limited in who we can fly for or how we can fly vis-\u00e0-vis any other airline. We work for our shareholders, just as Canada Jetlines works for their shareholders.\nGrant Howard: And what are the future plans for Capital Air?\nEd Wegel: Capital is just a shell company. It\u2019s a name that we have trademarked. Our thoughts may be in the future that a lot of our government business moves to that, but that would not be a separate certificate. It would not be separate pilots and flight attendants or a separate organization. They would just be a DDA name from GlobalX, so that we can better align that subsidiaries\u2019 operations with the client and separate that from our other core businesses, which are \u2013 fly for other airlines for teams and so forth.\nGrant Howard: We have some other questions here about the Oaktree financing, which you have already talked about, maintenance facility. So, all of that has been covered. There are a number of questions there. Thank you for a very detailed answers and gentlemen, with that, any closing comments?\nEd Wegel: Well, Grant, again, I appreciate Grant Howard for saying this together. We appreciate everyone\u2019s participation with everybody, a little over 40 people, which is about what we have done in the past. We will just say that this management team and Board are working very, very hard for our shareholders. We made significant progress in Q1 in developing our infrastructure, our corporate development so that we can take advantage of the opportunities in front of us this summer and this fall and going on into 2024. We are set up to be able to take the freighters. We are set up to be able to take the passenger aircraft. We are set up to bring on more clients and increase the flying that we do for our current clients as well as add new clients to our roster. So, we are very bullish about this company. We are very bullish about our prospects and the opportunities in front of us. Again, we take a longer term view of this business and I believe that, that view has paid dividends because we are now in a position over the next 12 months to double the size of this company. So with that, Grant, we appreciate your efforts and appreciate everyone\u2019s time. And Ryan, do you have anything to add?\nRyan Goepel: No. As Ed alluded to, I think there is a lot of positives coming out of this quarter. We believe we are really well set up for the future.\nEd Wegel: It\u2019s important for investors to look at the progress that we made this quarter in developing our infrastructure to take advantage of the opportunities that are in front of us. Tremendous amount of effort, assets that we have created that don\u2019t go on the balance sheet, but are there for us now to monetize in terms of increased line for more clients on more routes and more parts of the world. So, with that Grant, thank you very much. I look forward to talking to everyone again next quarter.\nGrant Howard: Thank you, gentlemen and thank you those who attended."}, {"symbol": "JETMF", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2023-03-10 01:36:04", "content": "Grant Howard: First gentlemen, spectacular first full year of operations, results were terrific. You exceeded forecast and the detailed information that just hit the wire. So with that, CEO and Chairman, Ed Wegel, Chief Financial Officer, Ryan Goepel. There's a lot of detail in this year-end and Q4 presentation. So with that, gentlemen, I'm going to turn it over to you.\nEd Wegel : Great. Thank you, Grant, and good afternoon to everyone. We greatly appreciate your participation in today's Earnings Release and our Update Call for GlobalX. As Grant mentioned, 2022 was the critical first full year of operations for our airline. We needed to get to a critical number of aircraft so that we will be operating financially at breakeven. We needed to recruit and train pilots to accrue those aircraft during the current pilot shortage. We needed the systems and processes and infrastructure in place to satisfy the U.S. Department of Transportation, the DOT and the FAA that we could operate those aircraft. And we needed to show that we had enough capital on our balance sheet to satisfy the DOT. And while we were doing all of that, we needed to operate an on-time and reliable airline so that we could build customer confidence in our product. We needed to market our airline to every possible charter customer in the U.S. from the U.S. government to the NCAA to Cuba tour [ph] operators to incentive groups and many, many others. And we needed to build a culture at GlobalX that was inclusive, forward thinking and customer centric, where every one of our team members felt they are part of a much greater hold and their contribution to that was needed and important. And finally, we needed to do all of that fast to fill the big hole that we saw in the U.S. air charter market. So despite the obstacles put in front of us, including the lingering effects of COVID and Omicron early in 2022 and inflation and rising interest rates, I am happy to report we were successful in accomplishing all of that and then some. The state of our airline is strong, growing and able to withstand anything that 2023 can throw at us, economically, politically or financially. We have built an outstanding Airbus-centric platform, and we have options in front of us and the ability to grow our airline and take advantage of the opportunities that we see in the near future. We operate all narrow-bodied aircraft the A320 family, but we have plans to operate the A330 wide-body aircraft with certification starting later this year. We are building a hangar in Fort Lauderdale for our maintenance needs, 80,000 square feet, $30 million development, all fully financed. We are taking delivery length this year of a new full flag simulator from CAE, the world's largest simulator manufacturer for our pilot training needs with no cash required from us upfront. We have started the certification process for our ETOPS approval, so we can operate long routes over water. Like I said, we are moving fast. And the airline you have invested in is getting ready for the future. We have placed orders for the eVTOL aircraft called Eve made by Embraer, and we will be the launch customer for all of Florida for the Eve aircraft starting in 2026. We can ignore the future of aviation or we can embrace it and be a first mover. We decided to embrace it. United Airlines ordered this aircraft after we did. So we must know something about what we are doing. We have also ordered the Alice all-electric 9 passenger aircraft. Air New Zealand ordered this aircraft after we did. So again, we are happy to see major airlines follow our lead. And both of these aircraft are part of our overall ESG strategy and in the future to reduce our carbon emissions. So let's get it back to today and where we are and what we need to do in 2023, and we'll get into some specifics. Just a quick run through our agenda for today. We'll talk about our accomplishments in this past year, including block hours and revenues. We'll take a look at our 2022 and Q4 financial results, which are now in the press release which everyone should have, an outlook on '23, and I'll look at our fleet and our fleet plans, look at passenger sales and our cargo operations, talk about pilot recruitment, our recent certifications and then we'll finish with discussion of our capital markets activities. Our accomplishments for 2022, I've highlighted some of those in my opening remarks. But we hit $97 million in revenue for the year. We beat our forecast by 8%, and it was - and that $90 million included cargo revenues, which we did not get in 2022 because of the late delivery of our cargo aircraft. So this was a spectacular result for us considering that the cargo revenues did not start until 2023. At year-end, we had 8 passenger aircraft, and we operated revenue flex during the year to 266 different airports on behalf of 105 different customers. We developed our strong operational reliability and that enabled us to establish our businesses with the NCAA in the Dominican Republic charter market, where we now dominate that market. We now have established as the leading charter airline to Cuba, and we have established ourselves with U.S. government contracts, and that's a growing revenue stream for us as we move into 2023. In addition, as I mentioned, we received approval for the new hangar facility at FLL, which should break ground late Q2 of this year. And we'll talk in a moment about our certifications, but we completed during 2022, all of the underlying work for four major certifications, EASA, which is our European certification, Department of Defense, IOSA, which is the IATA Safety Standard certification and as well our cargo certification. And we began 2023 having recruited and trained 405 highly motivated, well-trained team members who are now executing our plan. In terms of quarterly revenue and block hours, we had an increase of approximately 50% from Q1 of 2022 to Q4, and our quarterly revenue increased almost 98% from Q1 to Q4. That's mainly a result of course, of adding aircraft to the fleet, but also a consistent focus on sales and expanding the number of revenue streams that we develop and providing great service to our customers. I'll ask Ryan to talk us through our results for the year and the quarter.\nRyan Goepel: For 2022, we ended with an adjusted EBITDAR and EBITDARs earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent. This is a key metric in aviation used to properly compare airlines who purchase aircraft versus lease. In our situation we lease all of our aircraft. So we deploy significantly less capital, but to compare results, you need to compare it on an EBITDAR basis. EBITDAR for the year \u2013 sorry, EBITDA for the year was negative $6.6 million. And I think more importantly, when you look at Q4, our EBITDAR was positive 5.3% and adjusted EBITDA was $846,000. The adjustments made were for share-based compensation and for money spent on pilot training and launching of cargo operations in Q4, which we don't believe will continue or be a cost going forward.\nEd Wegel : Thanks, Ryan. As we look at 2023, we have forecasted our base case for revenue of a little over $140 million with the current fleet and positive EBITDAR and positive EBITDA. I'll say again, positive EBITDAR, positive EBITDA. Our base case, our budget revenue is, at this point, about 60% contracted. That means that we have developed the clients. We have signed the contracts and those contracts and that flying is now in our schedule through the balance of the year. An additional 40% or so, about $60 million is currently being actively quoted and negotiated, and we are highly confident that we will contract that revenue over the next 30 to 60 days. This assumes the current fleet of our current 9 passenger and 2 cargo aircraft. Our target for the end of the year 2023 is to increase our passenger aircraft from 9 aircraft to 12 in our cargo aircraft from the current 2 aircraft to 6, and we have plans in place to make that happen. In addition, through 2023, we will develop our Department of Defense revenue stream. We'll talk about our certification with DoD in a moment, but we're quite proud of that, and we are already in the DoD system bidding and quoting on various DoD missions for the Department of Defense. We will expand our CAE partnership, and we will have 1 Level 6 full flight simulator delivered to us by the end of this year, housed in Miami for our exclusive use, which will be a tremendous benefit for us as we move forward in our pilot training. And we'll talk about pilot training and recruitment in a moment. We expect to break ground on our new hangar complex late in Q2 at Fort Lauderdale Airport. Again, this is a great asset for the company that's fully financed, and it will help us reduce our maintenance costs and allow us to do our own C checks and be a place for us to have a center of excellence for maintenance within the company. We will plan to begin A330 certification in early Q3. We've identified aircraft that we think would be suitable and we're in discussions and negotiations with lessors and we're starting the process to certify that airplane onto our certificate. We have also started and will complete our ETOPS certification. ETOPS allows us to operate on one engine or up to 180 minutes. This is required for us to be able to fly to locations such as Hawaii or to Asia and even allows us a more efficient routing to apply to Europe from the U.S. We also plan to expand our ground team operation, our ground handling operation here at MIA, which has become very successful for us for our internal needs. It's helped us to reduce our costs tremendously. And we have added recently our own fueling operation here at MIA, which allows us again to reduce costs, has eliminated all of the delays that we experienced in fueling our aircraft from third-party vendors, and we think can be a very important growing part of our business across the U.S. in years to come. And we will soon become within the next week or so, a member of IATA, the International Air Transport Association. This is an outgrowth of our IOSA certification, which we'll talk about in a moment. So these are the key metrics for us for 2023. Our base case budget, our revenue is essentially locked in for the year. We're now building on that revenue base as we add aircraft. So we are comfortable in our - in confirming our revenue assumptions for the year as well as our positive outlook in terms of our EBITDAR and EBITDA. A quick look at our 2022 fleet. This is how we ended the year. Very proud of the fleet that we have put together. It's a great fleet of aircraft. It's served us well and will continue to serve us well. We're adding aircraft, obviously, to this so that we get to 11 aircraft within the next 60 days, where we're adding 2 more passenger aircraft and an additional freighter aircraft, which brings us to 11. So this is the fleet that we ended 2022, all on great lease terms that we were able to negotiate during the pandemic. We see an extension of those favorable lease terms on the aircraft that we are bringing into the fleet in 2023. And we believe that we still have a window of about 12 to 15 months where we can lock up aircraft, midlife aircraft, which are the type of aircraft that we need at very, very favorable lease rates and conditions for us to bring into the fleet. So we're very bullish on our fleet. We're very bullish on our ability to grow that fleet on terms very similar to the terms that we got during the pandemic. Let's talk about our fleet evolution by aircraft over the next 2 years. This is subject to a number of things, access to additional capital to satisfy our DOT requirements, being able to access, recruit, higher trained pilots and as well ability to get aircraft out of heavy maintenance pre-delivered. So we're seeing some delays because of supply chain issues. Those issues are starting to improve, and so we're confident that we'll be able to take aircraft on a better delivery schedule than we have seen over the past year. Just to give you a sense, as you know, we were expected to start cargo operations in the fourth quarter of 2022. Both of our first 2 cargo aircraft were delayed because of supply chain issues and other issues up to as much as 6 months. So the aircraft that we would take delivery of in late August, we took delivery of in February and the aircraft we were taking delivery of in September, we're taking delivery up within the next 30 days. We think that situation will ease as more A321s get converted, but it did impact us in 2022. We expect by the end of 2023, if all goes well, that will be a 12 passenger aircraft, 6 cargo aircraft and by the end of 2024, 18 passenger and 12 cargo aircraft. This is, for us, rational and sustainable growth and this also does not include any A330 wide-body aircraft that we may add to the fleet. But again, this is good growth for us. It's a contingent on certain things happening. We are in the process of making those things happen. We're very confident we will get this number of aircraft by year-end of 2023 and 2024. And as we look at the delivery plan on the next slide. Our base plan currently 8 passenger aircraft and 1 A321 freighter in our fleet. That's 9, we will add another A321 freighter, the second freighter and as well an A320 passenger aircraft within the next 30 days or so. Our target plan then is to add an additional 5 aircraft and potentially 2 more A320 passenger aircraft on top of that. So 4 of those would be freighters to bring us to 6 and 3 of those would be passenger to bring us 12, that gets us to our 18 aircraft. So again, our base plan, which includes the current 9 aircraft, plus 2 listed here, get us to the $140 million plus of revenue, which, again, we have essentially locked in with contracts, long-term contracts and short-term contracts and ad hoc contracts that we already have on the books. So this is our plan for 2023. How do we get all of these aircraft out to work? It's in the - in our sales team, which is a very, very strong, very cohesive unit that works well together, has been creating some new revenue streams and opportunities for us. And we're very confident as they continue to explore new avenues for revenue streams that will continue to add to the number of customers that we fly for and the number of contracts that we signed. But we have significant repeat business. We mentioned a few of these already, the NCAA, which is the colleges and universities, football, basketball, baseball, track and field has become a very, very important source of business for us. In 2022, we flew 2 airplanes for the NCAA March Madness. This year, we will fly 6 airplanes dedicated to the 2 to 3 weeks of March Madness basketball that will start very soon. As well, we have started our life as an airline with 1 Cuba tour [ph] operator. We now have a second Cuba tour operator that we fly for. And next month, we will add a third Cuba tour operator. So we will become the largest tour airline serving the tour operator market, to Havana, to Cuba to the other 5 cities in Cuba that safe charter operations. And as well, we have developed our business with the U.S. government flying for the Homeland Security line for customs and border control and also some contracts with the State Department and others. We have shown the government that we can rely - that we can fly reliably and on time and that they can count on us to serve their missions. We also have new multi-month contracts that we've put into place. I mentioned Havana and Cuba. The Dominican Republic is now becoming a very, very large focus for us, particularly with our summer tour operators. We are the only airline flying with summer operations to the Dominican Republic. On some days, this summer, we'll have as many as 6 flights from Manhattan [ph] into Punta Cana to Santo Domingo. We've expanded our market opportunity due to our new certifications, our EASA TCO, which allows us to fly within Europe. And so we'll be flying 2 airplanes in Europe this summer for TUI. Our IOSA certification opens up a whole world of opportunities for us to fly for other airlines around the world, but primarily here in the U.S., we started to fly for one of the largest and most successful low-cost carriers here in the U.S. providing them incremental lift as they are delayed on their deliveries of new airplanes and as well to allow them to expand into new markets before they take delivery. And our DoD certification opens up to us a $6 billion market for narrow-bodied aircraft flying within the Department of Defense system and within their programs. We've also developed our VIP tour business. So we've created the ability to put change in one of our aircraft to 68 VIP seats, and over the past few months, we flew everyone from bad money. And you see the airplane there, Rap10 and his logo. Lady Gaga, Harry Styles and even the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who are shown here getting on the airplane as we got them out of Harm's Way [ph] from the last hurricane. Our ad hoc business remains strong with over 90% of our ad hoc charters projected to return to fly with us in 2023. So passenger sales are very strong. We've developed a reputation in the market for on-time reliable service, clean aircraft and fantastic outstanding crew members, and we get accolades every day from the people that we fly for the crew members, for the service that they provided and for the overall flight experience. So we're very confident in our ability to hit our revenue numbers because of the team that we have in our passenger sales and the reputation that we have developed over the past 18 months. Complementing our passenger business is our new cargo division, which now operates on freighter soon to operate 2 freighters. And as I mentioned, projected to grow to 6 freighters by the end of 2023. The A321 freighter is a game changer. We have talked with many, many potential customers showing how this aircraft stacks up against the 737-800 freighter and even the 757. And we are generating tremendous interest in this aircraft. We're working on 20 or 30 new projects, new quotes, new proposals every week. We have just recently signed a big contract for April that will probably be expanded through November or even through the end of the year for a major package customer, that's 260 hours a month at a very, very good block hour rate. We have other revenue streams that we have developed for our A321 freighters, other airlines, particularly Latin American airlines that need incremental lift that don't have narrow-body freighters are talking with us every day about our aircraft that are being delivered this year. As you know, we announced last year a transaction deal with Avianca Cargo. And we expect that deal to materialize, and we will start flying for them in April or May of this year. The delay in delivery of the freighters caused us to have to move our start date with Avianca, but they are a good partner of ours, and we look forward to flying with them and for them and hopefully more than one airplane for them for many years. We've also started to fly within the automotive market from Mexico and Texas to the major cities that have auto plants. So we've flown into Indianapolis, we've flown into Detroit and Flint and other centers where autos are assembled. And quite frankly, we could probably put 5 or 6 airplanes into the automotive market over a period of time and keep them fully occupied. We don't want to do that. We want to have a diverse revenue stream, a diverse streams of revenue from various customers. But this is a great customer for us. We've flown for Honda. We've flown for GM, and we've flown for Ford already with our first freighter. We're also talking to and working with the U.S. Postal Service. We're bidding on new routes that they are having put out to bid for this year. And we hope and expect that we will get some of that business. I mentioned Department of Defense, we will be able to start bidding our cargo freighters with the defense department here within the next few months. And of course, the package carriers, we're talking to all of them. There are 2 in particular that understand now the value of the A321 freighter versus how they operate with the 737-800, and I'm very confident that we will get a number of airplanes in with them over the course of the next year. We have 10 A321 freighter aircraft now under lease or LOI with deposits with the MSN identified. And in my view, this is the single greatest asset of the company outside of our U.S. 121 flag carrier certificate. This is going to provide tremendous growth for us. It provides diversity of revenue for us, so that if we do get into another COVID-type situation, we know that the airlines that did well or at least got the pandemic did so because of their ability to move cargo. And so we identified early on that we wanted to be in this business. We went out even before we were certified and tied up a number of these A321 freighters before anyone else woke up to the concept that this was going to be just a tremendous airplane for the cargo business. So we have a number of major airlines that have followed us to see if they can get our freighters. Their first question is, how did you get so many of these before we got them, and we just simply say, we knew what we were doing. But it's a great asset for us, great growth for our company, gives us a diversity of revenue and allows us optionality as we move forward. We have an additional 5 aircraft that are under LOI with lessors, subject to identification of the right A321 feedstock for us. So right now, we're comfortable in projecting that we will have 15 aircraft, 15 A321 freighters flying for us between now and 24 months from now, and we're constant working on additional feedstock to increase the number of freighters that we have under lease. We talk a little bit about pilot recruitment. The question we hear most often and often from some of you who are on this call, given the news about our pilot shortage is how we are dealing with this. The short answer to that question is we are dealing with it very effectively. In 2022, we recruited and trained 55 pilots on top of the 20 pilots that we started with. We had 20 pilots that we hired, recruited, trained to get ready for our certification and to start flying in August of 2021. Through 2022, we recruited 55 more pilots. And now in 2023, we have already held 3 pilot classes, and we're adding 24 more pilots to our total list of pilots on the payroll. We think this is very good given the experience that we see with other airlines of our size, I think it's a function of many things that we can talk about. But it's the culture that we have created here, the quality of life situation that we have created for our pilots. And I think just the atmosphere and the type of flying that we do has been a big draw for us as we go out and recruit pilots. But we've also saw some major agreements to increase the available pool of pilots to us, particularly with first officers. We signed 3 agreements. You know about the OSM Aviation Academy agreement. That's already produced - first officers for us, and we expect another 5 first officers to come to us over the next 30 days as they finish up their program there at OSM and get their 1,500 hours as a flight instructor. We also signed a deal with CAE with their pilot program, and we have already produced 3 FOs from that in the last month. CAE is the big simulator manufacturer. They also run major simulator centers and training centers, and we're starting to get some of their training pilots with an A320 type rating being referred to us. And as I said, we've already taken on board 3 first officers from that program. We've just signed with L3Harris, which is the second largest manufacturer of simulators and one of the major companies involved in pilot training, but we've signed with them on their pilot pathway program and some resumes and CVs and referrals have already started to come in from that program. We also, as you know, have launched GlobalX Colombia. This is a Bogata based air operating certificate. Currently, we're almost through Phase II, which is the submission of our manuals, and we will enter Phase III with the CAA in Colombia within the next 60 days. That's their review of the manuals and then their clearance for us to bring an aircraft to Colombia and start recruiting. We did this for a number of reasons. One of the reasons was that some of our Latin American potential customers asked us if we could fly within Latin America, and we can do that with an AOC based in Colombia. But secondly and probably more importantly, this allows us to hire Colombian pilots who are already tight on the A320 family of aircraft. And there are a surplus of pilots in Latin America. They can fly this airplane the A321 freighter from Latin America into the U.S. on that certificate. And while they're doing that, we can go through the process of getting them approved to fly in the U.S. with work permits. So there's a twofold reason for this. We think that we can create a steady stream of pilots out of Latin America by running them through our Colombian subsidiary and it also expands the number of clients that we can have within Latin America because of that AOC. So it's a dual benefit for us to create this new airline subsidiary in Colombia. And we've had discussions, and we're starting to work through some agreements with major airlines as well as low-cost carriers to develop what are called flow-through agreements. So that our first officers, many of them are young and many of them [ph] want to eventually fly for United or Delta or Allegiant Tours [ph] or Geoff Liu [ph] We'll have the opportunity to do that with us. They come with us for a year or 2 years, in some cases, as many as 3 years. They'll have a guaranteed interview and almost a guaranteed job with any of those airlines by coming through our program and having our agreements in place with each of those airlines. So it's a recruitment tool for us to say to potential pilots working for us that we will provide them the opportunity if they want to move to a major airline or to one of the large LCCs. When talking about our certifications. We've mentioned this a few times. And as you know, one of our taglines that we use is global presence and local focus. Our certifications allow us to implement that very tagline. We execute on this by expanding our areas where we can operate our aircraft. First one is EASA, third country operator authorization. This gives us the authority to operate within Europe. So we can fly the airplane to Europe. Until we receive this authorization, we could not fly for any of the airlines in Europe to fly, say, from Amsterdam to Athens or from Frankfurt to Egypt. This now allows us to do that. And we have a tremendous number of requests of European airlines to bring our airplanes to Europe to fly for them, particularly during the summer. We have an agreement with TUI for this summer for 2 aircraft, and we hope to grow that program as we grow the number of aircraft in our fleet so that we fly as many as 4 or 5 airplanes in Europe during the summer. I also mentioned IOSA earlier, that's the safety standards that have been developed by IATA, the International Air Transport Association. This allows us with this certification now to be able to fly for any other airline without having to go through the typical and normal audit that, that airline is required to do and perform on us before we're allowed to fly for them. This opens up a whole new world for us of airlines that we can fly for immediately particularly here out of our Miami hub, where we have many international airlines that fly. So we're talking to a number of them about providing the backup agreements now to fly in the event that they have an AOG or a maintenance issue or to expand or increase the number of flights that they have from the U.S. This is a tremendous authorization for us. There are many airlines in the U.S. that do not have this. And some of the airlines, low-cost carriers that we're talking to are amazed that we got it that fast, they, in fact, do not have this IOSA authorization. This allows us also, as I mentioned, to join IATA and now that we're IOSA approved, and we're in the final stages of doing that. We expect to become a full member of IATA in the next week or so. And as I mentioned, the Department of Defense. With our approval now from the Defense Department to fly A320s and A321s as well as our freighters for DoD, we can now bid on the missions that they have within the U.S. or also from the U.S. to Europe. And as I mentioned earlier, this is a $6 billion market. We hope and expect to get our fair share of that, and that would be a tremendous boost to our revenues and a tremendous boost to our credibility around the world line for DoD. So these certifications, which we laid the groundwork for all of these in 2022. We have to spend money on each of these to get them in terms of bringing in advisers and consultants to ensure that we did all of the right certification work on our manuals and our systems and our processes. But it's money well spent because it now opens up many, many opportunities for us to fly, not only within the U.S. and Latin America but around the world. And it frankly makes us a stronger and safer airline having gone through these audits and these examinations from these well-known, recognized international aviation bodies. I'll ask Ryan to discuss our capital markets activity.\nRyan Goepel: Yes. Thank you. So as a public company, there's a lot of awareness as to our capital structure. There's a lot of effort being put into a digital program to raise awareness about the company and the stock and the progress we're making. And we're starting to see dividends from that investment. Our mailing list, which is - which many of you on this call are on has grown -- has almost doubled in the last 3 to 4 months. When you combine that with the good news, we're able to share, we think that's had a positive effect on the stock. As you noticed, many people have noticed, we've had a fairly good run over the last 30 to 60 days. One of the questions I get asked often, there's two, really, one is about warrants and one is about up-listing. Currently, there are a series of warrants that are expiring in April of 2023, of the warrants that were outstanding or soon to be expiring, 2.1 million have been exercised, generating $1 million of cash received. I'm happy to state the warrants were exercised by an institutional investor looking to acquire a substantial position in the company, which we're really excited to have the Board. And as we look towards the additional warrants, there's 4.7 million warrants still outstanding priced at $1, if all our exercise that should bring in 4.7 of the treasury. I'm in conversations with multiple institutional investors who are looking to acquire larger stakes, trying to match with people warrants and also talking to people with warrants to see to explore their exercise offset [ph] warrants The other question we get pretty much daily is when are we up-listing? We have said probably for the last four quarters, we wanted to show four quarters of growth. We wanted to show cargo in the certification. We wanted to show a healthy growth plan because we wanted to be a company that institutional investors will be interested in investing. We do plan to uplift in conjunction with the growth capital or debt raise in 2023. We will maintain our discipline as it relates to equity raise. We do not believe - we will not raise money at these current rates, and that's - and we've demonstrated that with the last two capital injections being a form of debt. But we are open-minded as we look forward to 2023 as we have an incredibly aggressive growth plan. We want to get the aircraft on board as quickly as possible. We want to get the pilots on board as quickly as possible because we have the customers to go platform. So looking forward to 2023, we will maintain our discipline as it relates to raising money, but we are absolutely planning to do an uplift and then look forward to getting that done in 2023 responsible. Going to the next slide. Sure. So this is kind of a fun slide. This is just a sample of the teams we have flown, we've flown over 70 in the last 12 months. Over the next week, we will probably - we will fly with our 6 aircraft effectively almost every single team in the final four tuck in the NCAA tournament. This is a core business for us. We have demonstrated a capability to fly for these teams. This is a fun flying for us. We love seeing the players, we love seeing the fans, and it's a very robust market. And I think we've established an excellent position in the market, and we're going to continue to grow this as it is a very large market going forward. I think finally, going to the last slide....\nEd Wegel: This is a sample of the things that we're doing to grow our brand and bring brand awareness to GlobalX. We've registered a number of trademarks. Some of you have seen them in some of our press releases and our social media. You can't beat the experience, global presence, local focus, commercial air charter for professionals and so forth. You can see the list there. Each of these we use in certain situations. Our client connects and cargo connects trademarks relate to apps and software that we have developed to keep - stay in touch with both our passenger charter clients so that they have every piece of paper that's involved with their particular charter as well we've got cargo connect, which we have trademark, which provides to our cargo customers on an iPad or on their computer, all of the documents and everything that they need to be able to operate with us on their charter. As an aside, we are now almost 100% paperless in the company. We're stopping out the last bits of paper that we still use within the company. But by the end of 2023, this airline will be run completely on iPads. So this is a list of some of the things that we're doing. We're using some of these out in the market and testing some of them. We're using them with some specific revenue streams and clients. But we want to be very much - while we're a charter airline, we very much want to be seen as a global brand that is very focused on its business. And these trademarks in many ways, allow us to do that. So Grant, with that, that's the end of our presentation. We're happy to take questions and continue the dialogue. So...\nA - Grant Howard: Thank you, Ryan. One thing I've always enjoyed about the GlobalX webinars. There's a lot of detail, but you filled several pockets with details and the outstanding job, the outlook was great, what's been achieved. So two thumbs up, terrific job to you and your team. We'll probably go ahead, 17 questions folks who are attending you do want to submit a question, there's the Q&A at the bottom and submit your questions through that. I expect there's going to be questions on warrants and everything else, but they've already been answered. The first one was about warrants, we'll buy as [ph] that, from Bill Deegan asking about your current CAC balance?\nRyan Goepel: I think cash balance at the end of the year was a little over $6 million, and that has grown since the end of the year.\nGrant Howard: Several question from Maria Paul. I'll go through them in order. I'd like to confirm that your 2023 guidance for $140 million in sales assumes only the 9,000 during Q3 are perhaps in service. The answer is yes. Any additional aircraft in service could add to the current 2023 EBITDA guidance and he has a question mark around that. So he is just informing the base case.\nRyan Goepel: Yes. So I would also indicate we didn't say zero EBITDA was a $140 million, we said positive. So I'd be a little more optimistic than that. And yes, any additional aircraft in service would add to the current 2023 revenue and EBITDA guidance?\nGrant Howard: On what dollar amount are you seeking to pay for midlife Airbus aircraft such as the A321 and A321?\nRyan Goepel: We seek the minimum dollar amount. But I mentioned before that we're still seeing some deals for aircraft, very close to what we saw in - during the pandemic. The next A320 passenger aircraft that we're taking is just slightly above what we paid for a similar type aircraft last year, but not a real material difference. So we're in the low 100 still for A320s, and we think that we will be able to continue with those sorts of deals for at least the next year. I just came back from the big ISTAT Air leasing conference in California and met with about 20 different lessors, all of them want to do business with us, all of whom are offering us a A320 aircraft. And so it's still a -- it's still a buyer's market for those airplanes, especially mid-life airplanes. And so we see a constant steady stream of those over the next few years. We're also talking to one of the big low-cost carriers about taking on their older aircraft as they get their new A320s. And I think that will also be able to develop a steady stream of good aircraft for us by working with the low-cost carriers that operate the 320s.\nGrant Howard: [indiscernible] people who don't know he's been around a lot of years, call him a news letter writer but much more than that. There's a large subscription base by noise as a shareholder and very recently chose GlobalX as one of his top picks for 2023. But what Keith asked is a key hearing an airline industry is the capacity, i.e., they need jet contingent overflow. That doesn't seem to jive with the idea that we will continue to get deep leases help me understand.\nRyan Goepel: Okay. That's a good question, and I can get you to understand the situation. So what the major airlines and the low-cost carriers, the major low-cost carriers in the U.S. are experiencing right now is delay in delivery of new aircraft. The new neo on the day 320neo, the 737 MAX. In some cases, those aircraft are delayed as much as 2 years. There's OEM supply issues, similar to what we experienced trying to get our mid-life aircraft or our freighters out of conversion, they're seeing because of the supply chain issues, the new airplanes are being delayed. So those airlines won't go and get a mid life aircraft to substitute for 2 years until they get their new aircraft. They'll turn to us and say, can you provide us some lift while we're waiting for our new aircraft. And in fact, we are flying right now for one of the low-cost carriers. It's a month-long contract, which I think will get extended for several more months, and we have a second LCC that has asked us to fly for them. And we have a major international airline based in the Americas that flies into the U.S. that has also asked us for capacity to fly for them. Their deals are delayed. They've already announced routes. They've sold tickets and they don't have an airplane. So we suddenly become very, very attractive to them. And frankly, if we had - we discussed this every day, if we had the pilots and the airplanes, we could probably fly 15 airplanes right now in our fleet. We obviously don't have the pilots. We have to develop the infrastructure and we're growing at a pace that's reasonable and rational. But we see this as a growing piece of our business over the next few years. And I think we'll continue even after the supply chain issues are resolved because we can provide additional complementary lift for these airlines that want to open new routes or add capacity until some of their order positions are filled. So we're very bullish on this. We can drive very, very good rates and it's good flying for us. We're working with professional airlines who know what they're doing, and it's a great opportunity for us to show what we can do. So the disconnect here is that the airline needs the new airplane, they won't go and get a midlife airplanes just to fill the gap until they get the new airplane. They fill that gap by coming to us.\nGrant Howard: I don't want to compete [ph] when you launch a new plane, you have training expenses, start-up costs, et cetera, what's the payback on that? How many hours of flight or how many months for payback?\nRyan Goepel: It's about 3 to 4 months. And that's - the biggest chunk of that cost is deposit, which sits on our balance sheet. So that's a deposit that we ultimately get back at the end of the lease. But when you factor that in, you're looking at 3 to 4 months.\nEd Wegel: So we've - recently, we've been negotiating with lessors to not put up 3 months deposit. In some cases, we're putting up only 2 months deposits. And that's a positive for us, obviously. And as Ryan said, that money goes on the balance sheet. So it's on the deposit line. But in general, the cash requirements to bring an A320 passenger airplane onto the certificate or about $500,000, the cash requirements to bring the freighter onto the certificate is close to $1 million because of the deposits, primarily.\nGrant Howard: Somewhat along the same theme from every call, several parts to this. What are your fixed and variable cost per hour for block hour flying time. Two, how many block hours a year, does an aircraft need to fly to cover all costs. And three, that is equivalent to what utilization rate?\nRyan Goepel: So when we talk about how we operate, we are an ACMI operator and that stands for aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, those are our costs. There are other costs that cost to fly such as fuel, ground handling, overflight fees, those are other charged through at a market to the customer or paid for by the customer. So what really needs to look at is the ACMI. So aircraft is fixed. The lease rate is fixed. The insurance is fixed per month. When you look at the crews, you need a certain number of crews per month in order to operate. So that's -- it's variable, but sort of fixed when you look at fleeting is fixed in the short term. And then maintenance is a per hour cost. So that's variable based on number of hours flying. So when we think about how many hours you need to fly, it really depends on - there's two kinds of customers. There'll be ad hoc, which is short trips that tends to be at a much higher rate, $5,000 to $6,000 an hour or you do programs where you fly 200 to 300 hours in a month, and you might charge between 3,500 and 4,500 an hour. I think probably as a rule of thumb, if I was off the top of my head, probably 70 to 80 hours, and you're breaking even for a month, and we target around 140 to 150 hours of tail on an average -- and that's an average upon an average, right? So in some months, for example, in Europe, we'll fly 400 hours a month at a lower rate [indiscernible] playing sports teams will fly 110 hours a month but at a much higher rate. I'm not sure if that's helpful, but that's - it's really - the goal is to get - get over 100 hours on the aircraft every month, and then we kind of play with price and hours after that. That makes sense.\nGrant Howard: Keith was back. He was asking about are we flying at 100% capacity, I guess you'd have to first define capacity and what percent capacity were we in Q4 '22?\nEd Wegel: All depends on how you define capacity. Those who are not defining capacity is how many people are in the airplane because we sell the whole airplane to the customer. In some cases, we sell at a higher block hour rate for a customer who wants it for a period of 3 or 4 weeks. They pay a higher block hour rate, but the number of hours that they fly is less. What we're really looking for is the revenue that we generate per airplane. And so we play with the number of block hours they need and the rate that they're willing to pay. So we have started to track the capacity in terms of the number of hours per airplane on our schedule. And for instance, for this past for March, we're projecting 93%, 94% utilization, which doesn't mean we're flying in 24 hours a day for 31 days for each airplane. It's a little hard to describe in a sort of sound bite here on this call. But as Ryan said, our basic metric is to get to 150 hours per airplane per month, we'll play with that if a customer needs an airplane for a few weeks or for multiple flights, the utilization could be reduced, but our block hour rate goes up. So we play with utilization and block hour rate to get to the amount of revenue that we need.\nGrant Howard: You had suggested 11 planes would be breakeven. Is there any update on that? I actually thought it 7, 8 and it depends on the cargo passenger mix?\nEd Wegel: So I think we should look at the last two quarters, right? So and if you look at Q3, where we were a positive EPS, we had effectively 7 aircraft for only August. When you look at Q4 and when you factor in maintenance events, we actually had fewer aircraft in Q4 than we did in Q3, and we're still pretty close to breakeven on an adjusted basis at our EUR. I think - and kind of our model is if that's effectively breakeven, each tail that's fully utilized beyond that. So 8, 9, 10, 11 generates profit. So no, I don't think it's 11 aircraft, I think it's less. But then you have to factor in at downtime for maintenance events planes will go in for what we call 2 and 6-year checks for 10 or 20 days. So you lose that tail. So you need a little bit of a buffer in there, but 7 aircraft will be utilized should be breakeven, yeah, which is pretty close to what we had., year.\nGrant Howard: Brian Randall, very impressed with your 2022 performance, well done. The size you are now, are you large enough to seriously compete on the narrow body, charter arena. Is your focus new business line or taking business from the competition?\nEd Wegel: I would say our focus is both of those. We've been very successful in taking business from our - from some of our competitors. In 2023, with our additional Cuba flying and some other flying that we are doing, we've effectively taken about $30 million of revenue from our other major competitors. So that's a continued focus for us, but we're actually looking for new business lines. Over in Europe, we're looking for business lines. We're talking to every airline in Latin America, now about providing lift for them. We're talking to every LCC in the U.S. about providing lift for them as well. So we don't focus on any one thing. Our focus is to be cast as broad and net as possible for new customers to bring into our business.\nGrant Howard: Operating pilot recruitment item, how are you doing \u2013 excuse me, how are you doing with mechanics, which is arguably more difficult right now?\nEd Wegel: We just hired 5 new what we call AMTs, aircraft maintenance technicians and mechanics. We've not had an issue hiring here in Miami. We've not had an issue hiring mechanics or AMTs for our maintenance base in San Antonio. We're swapped with resumes from AMTs here in the Miami, Fort Lauderdale area who want to come work with us. They see our fleets growing. They see us adding freighters. They see us adding A321s. They hear that we might add A330s. And so they want to be where there is growth in the airline where they can move up the regs from being an AMT to being a line supervisor to being a manager of maintenance. So we're going to provide those opportunities, particularly as we open up our new hangar facility in Fort Lauderdale, where we're going to be doing their own C-checks. That will be a great attraction for a lot of the AMTs here in South Florida. We want to come with a growing airline, where they can be - where they can get promoted rapidly and move up the chain. So, so far, everything is good. We've got a great team of AMTs. We've got a great team of supervisors and managers and our 19s in our maintenance department are just top notch. And we're just - we are really creating a very reliable on-time airline in terms of our dispatch reliability because of our maintenance capabilities.\nGrant Howard: There's a lot of questions coming in. Hopefully, we can get through most of them. When can we expect significant profit within the next 2 to 3 years?\nRyan Goepel: The plan is to generate a profit. That's why we're here. I think the answer with the guidance we would give is 7 to 8 aircraft is breaking even, and we're targeting 18 to 30 aircraft we believe that will generate a profit. We will get better. We're not in a position of forecasting profit at this stage. We will get more finite when it comes to guidance on that side. But at this stage, with the amount of variabilities of delivery and the day-to-day, we basically will guide on unit economics as we have in the past in our filings and indicate as we add aircraft to the fleet, that generates incremental profit. And if we're breakeven at 7 or 8 claims, I'll let the rest - everyone else do the math.\nEd Wegel: We're also investing very heavily in the business, right? So pilot recruitment and training, developing all of the infrastructure that we need to continue to take aircraft and show the FAA that we have the capability to manage and fly those airplanes. Our IT systems, we're constantly upgrading and improving. We're bringing in two new software systems this year. to help us with our document management systems with our manuals and as well to fully automate all of our documents across the company. So we're going to continue to invest to create the best possible Airbus-centric platform in the U.S. and that takes money. We noted in our financial statements, you see how much we spend. We're going to continue to do that as we grow. So...\nGrant Howard: Acted on the uplift, more likely Q3 or Q4? Or is there anything more definitive in your mind at this point, Ryan?\nRyan Goepel: 2023.\nGrant Howard: Any updates on Bouge [ph]\nRyan Goepel: Yes. There are a couple of things going on with Bouge. We sort of put it to the back burner as we went through all of the other certifications and added airplanes very rapidly to our fleet. But we're talking to a number of OTAs, online travel agencies, as well as some luxury brands about investing in Bouge and becoming a partner with us in that business. So I think that we'll have some movement on that over the next 60 days or so. It's an important part of our business. Again, we put it to the back burner so that we could focus on getting the airplanes on the certificate and getting the certifications. But we have some very, very definite plans for Bouge and we're bringing in some strategic partners to help us execute on those plans.\nGrant Howard: Question on Canada deadlines as to how is your investment in Canada, debt line doing and for those people who may not recall, Global Crossing is the biggest if not one of the biggest shareholders can the outlines and it was the spin-off back in July of 2021. So any further comment on that, gentlemen?\nRyan Goepel: Look, so we - as you said, we own is a significant stake in Canada Jetlines as well as all of the shareholders in GlobalX at the time that, that was spun off. We talked to Canada Jetlines on a weekly basis. We've referred business up to them they referred business to us. We back up their operations. As you know, they've started to fly Las Vegas and Melbourne. And we can provide backup for them. They have a small fleet at this point, but we're ready and willing to fly for them if and when they need that. They've been so focused on getting certified and getting through the CTA and then getting some airplanes in the air that we've sort of left them alone to get that done. I think over the coming months, we will have some very substantive discussions about how the two airlines can work together. So we're very bullish on their prospects. We think they have a good management team, a good Board. We're cheering them on from the sidelines because as a U.S. airline or U.S. investor, there's only so much we can do with them. The Canadians are very strict about all of that. But we think it's a great opportunity. Everyone sees where the stock price is or how new shares. We own somewhere around $10 million or $12 million or so. So we're cheering them on. We think that this could be a very good strategic investment for us, and we're very happy and pleased with the way that they've executed, and we hope that we can monetize our investment stake sometime in the future.\nGrant Howard: John Gamberini. First off, congratulations on an outstanding first year, great teamwork and management of fluctuating markets. Can you please touch on the current status of the secondary basis, such as Las Vegas, Atlantic City, et cetera. Also Canada Jetlines seems to be pretty active. Is there any update to your partnership when you've addressed that part?\nRyan Goepel: So on the basis, Las Vegas is still in operation. And in fact, we're going to start another flight attendant class for flood attention would be based in Las Vegas. Atlantic City, we maintained a maintenance base there in Atlantic City with support from Spirit Airlines, which has a lot of flight activity in and out of Atlantic City. At least once a week, we operate a charter into the Northeast and we bring the airplane back into Atlantic City to have to sit there overnight waiting for its next operation. We brought out Atlantic City flight attendants into our Miami flight attendant base for the time being. As we grow our business in the Northeast again, we will reactivate Atlantic City and put flight attendants there again. So we're adjusting based on where we see our demand, where we see our charters how efficiently we can move flight attendants from bases to other bases or to their flying wherever the airplane may be where they have to pick it up. So it's a -- we constantly look at all of this. We also have a base in San Antonio with a number of flight attendants. So as we grow the airline, we're constantly looking at where we can put bases where it makes sense to put bases and where we can effectively and efficiently move the crew members in those bases to the charter flying.\nGrant Howard: At River Walk in San Antonio, Mike Harrison, I'm truly impressed with the progress that has been made over the last year and the foundational work that has been completed is very exciting. The number of planes projected by end of 2025 appears to be left than presented over the last year. It was projected that you would have 25 cargo planes by the end of '25, and the current plan appears to be 15% by mid-'25. Can you comment on what is constraining the growth in the number of planes in anticipated time frame?\nRyan Goepel: Sure. So if you go back to the slide that we presented a few minutes ago, 18 aircraft by the end of 2023, 30 aircraft by the end of 2024. Assuming that we take another 12 to 15 airplanes in 2025, that gets us up into the mid-40s. Could we accelerate that, that's dependent upon a few things. And as we've learned over the last 18 months, it's the availability of pilots, availability of aircraft the ability to put those airplanes on the certificate, get those airplanes from their former operator onto our certificate after they go through maintenance. So there are a number of moving pieces to that. Do I want to get to 50 aircraft by the end of 2025? Yes. Do I think we can get there? Yes. Can I affirm for you right now, but I can get there, the answer is no. So what we're showing you is growth that we know we can do based on pilots, based on aircraft based on the length of time it takes to put aircraft on to the certificate. So I think we're not too far off from 50. That's certainly our goal, but we will do it in a reasonable fashion, in a practical fashion and in a way that does not let us outrun our cash or our capabilities or the number of people that we have to do this work.\nGrant Howard: Etikaylor. He's asking about the fact that you added Ryan lead for our principles out and he's asking about whether or not that can be leveraged in any way?\nEd Wegel: No. As we -- this question was asked during the Annual General Meeting back in December. And I made it clear at that point that we -- first off, that stack was not formed with any intent or a notion that we would do something with it and GlobalX. Secondly, it's very, very difficult, if not impossible, for us to do something with that because of the conflicts of interest, I'm the Chairman and CEO of the airline, Chairman and CEO of the SPAC. So there is absolutely no intent or reason or ability for us to do anything with that spec, and those discussions have never been contemplated.\nEd Wegel: Andrew Young. If NASDAQ up-listing is completed this year, then will the current Neo stock be changed to NASDAQ stock with a new ticker code?\nRyan Goepel: I don't think there's necessarily a need to do that. We want to ensure our Canadian investors have easy access to trade the stock. So it makes sense to maintain both.\nEd Wegel: Yeah. The Neo has been a very, very good partner of ours, very, very supportive in terms of getting the word out about our company. And as Ryan said, it's a convenient way for our Canadian shareholders to be able to sell their shares. Having said that, Ryan, you may want to talk about the Jet B stock. And what I think might happen there. That's always a question that would...\nRyan Goepel: If - when we up with NASDAQ, we will collapse to be into the comment because we'll be able to meet the U.S. We have made a conscious effort to bringing US shareholders and we're consistently addressing the ratio, which created the problem that caused us the go from common to be to create the Jet B. If you're a Jet B holder, there was nothing to be concerned about. When we do collapse your stock, we'll just get converted or exchanged for a stock in the comment. So our goal is to get rid of the beat, it's not really necessary as we update our shareholder base, and that's one of the benefits of up-listing.\nEd Wegel: We're getting some redundancy in the questions here from Ken Fleming. What is your position on any dilution of the stock concerned from an investor since the beginning of the question mark. This is especially true after listing on the NASDAQ?\nRyan Goepel: Well, I guess -- I think we've demonstrated over the last 12 to 18 months, we're concerned about it as well. We're not out there actively trying to dilute the share price. But we also have to keep in mind, we're growing the company in triple-digit numbers. And so there is a point at which you want to bring in new capital, and it's capital at the right price. And so I think if my company or this company is any company I invest in is 5 times larger, and I own a smaller percentage of it. My stake is 5 times larger. I'm not concerned with it. So I think dilution for the stake of dilution is something we're very wary of, and I think you've seen the way we behave. I get a little -- I don't know if it's frustrated is the right word, where people think dilution has been dilution growth capital growth is important. And I think as long as we're outgrowing any sort of dilution, and that's definitely our plan, I think that should be less of a concern.\nEd Wegel: Yes. And I just remember that Ryan and I are both major shareholders of this company. I think between us, we probably have almost 8 million shares. So you should take comfort in that. We're not going to just dilute everyone for the sake of dilution, right? We have a measured reasonable growth plan, we require capital to meet that growth plan. We can't stay where we are right now with the number of aircraft we have. We need to add aircraft. We need to add pilots. We need to add assets. We need to add maintenance capabilities so that we can grow into a 50 aircraft airline. And that's going to take additional capital. We're going to be very judicious in how we do that because our 8 million shares between Ryan and I will get diluted like everyone else is, okay? And so you need to have trust and confidence in us that we've done pretty good so far to get us to where we are at, okay? Where we are at is a tremendous Airbus-centric platform 15 A321 freighters coming 12 passenger aircraft to soon beyond the certificate, the ability to operate worldwide, okay? And we have done that with USD 28 million. USD 6 million of those USD 28 million are deposits on the balance sheet. This management team has been about the most frugal management team in getting this airline to where it is in the history of U.S. commercial aviation. You need to trust us and you need to have confidence in us, okay, that we will continue to be very, very frugal in growing this company. But don't be afraid of dilution. Don't be afraid of us doing what we need to do to get this airline to 50 aircraft and a $2 billion valuation. We can't do that with what we have now. But we've done what we have done now with $28 million.\nEd Wegel: The people who are attending, please do the research and find another company that's made this much progress with a little more than $20 million in equity and $6 million in debt in a short-term loan and good luck if you can come up with one. From Jim Wall, not a question, just passing on a congratulations for a great job from Andre Ruble, what is the status of the Fort Lauderdale hangar construction?\nEd Wegel: We expect to -- as I said in the main body of our presentation today that we will break down within the next 90 days. It's fully financed by Oaktree Capital. They're going through some final soil testing and some other approvals, but the main approvals are in place. The ground lease has been signed our agreement with Oaktree has been completed, and it's just now a question of getting the final approvals to stick to shovel in the ground.\nGrant Howard: In the queen [ph] it appears that the deals of the A321 conversion is betting on for the IDI [ph] guess, getting on with other airlines, how many conversions do you have contracted at the moment? And are you working on acquiring more conversion slots?\nEd Wegel: The first part of that question is very true. Lufthansa, after we started our process of acquiring A321 freighters suddenly woke up and said they want 25 of these Quantas a few weeks ago said that they need 12 of them as soon as they can get them. Both airlines have called us to see what they could do with us. That was a very short conversation. In terms of the slots that we have, we've got 10 aircraft that are now slated for conversion that we have under lease or strong LOI with deposit with MSN identified. We have another 5 airplanes that we have agreements with lessors to provide to us. They're buying A321s now to marry up with the conversion slot to provide to us. My goal is to get to 25% as I've mentioned. So yes, we are out looking at more slots -- we expect to sign an LOI for another aircraft that will be converted in China and Chinese conversions go faster. I won't get into the politics of that, but they go faster. And that's an airplane that we could probably add to the 4 that we are expected to take this year. So I spent a good part of my day out looking for more or less or more aircraft, more conversion slots because I believe that this is the growth engine for this company.\nGrant Howard: Third are you still evaluating 8 aircraft or maybe means valuing each aircraft a $30 million to $40 million market cap question mark, leasing instead of owning the aircraft isn't a big difference when comparing to, I believe, in Sun Country or other?\nRyan Goepel: So it's not my valuation, it's the market valuation of aircraft, and I'll leave that to the market to determine how they value it. And really, what -- when you talk about lease testing owning, which is why you see airlines are valued on an EBITDAR basis, which we mentioned, because an airline that owns all of its aircraft, its EBITDAR is equal to its EBITDA. An airline that leases all its aircraft, its EBITDAR will be significantly higher than its EBITDA, but the amount of capital employed to generate that money is significantly less. If you look at our EBITDA margins, even our margins and our return on capital employed, they're best in the industry. And that's what we're forecasting to get to. So when we look at comparing airlines, yes, it would be ideal. There is a benefit to owning some aircraft, but there's also a benefit of getting a really good lease rate. And so I think as we've operated, we came into this business with opportunities to acquire aircraft at significantly below market lease rates, which is that's the way we've gone. As we go forward, as capital becomes available, would we consider acquiring aircraft if it makes sense, yes, it's the lease versus buy. And there's benefits to both. I think, Ed, you said that ideally, when you get a very mature fleet, you get to like 40, you get to 50-50, but that's over a longer term, we were in a situation where lease rates made a ton of sense, and so we're going to continue to do that.\nEd Wegel: And plus we had the equity to put into acquiring an aircraft.\nRyan Goepel: I didn't have 100...\nEd Wegel: And lease rates were significantly depressed well under the cost of capital of the lessors. So to go buy that airplane with all the cash that's required made no sense. And as Ryan said, we've talked to a number of aviation leasing experts. And over time, we want to get to 50% leased, 50% owned. That seems to be the formula that works best for airlines of our size. And we're looking at that. Some of our lessors have asked us about selling us their aircraft. Right now, we're focused on putting our dollars into the growth of the operation. All of the systems, getting additional leased aircraft and growing our revenue base. We'll get to this question probably later this year when we have more capital, hopefully available to us. But right now, it's not a focus. We much rather get cheap leases on our aircraft right now and going through the pain of trying to acquire an aircraft and put it on the balance sheet.\nGrant Howard: Loan, can you please speak to your sales strategy...\nEd Wegel: Cargo or passenger Yes. I think we -- well, perhaps we can refer you back to the presentation that we just made -- that's a very detailed -- and that question requires a lot of detail and a lot of explanation and not really gone to a good sound bite. Happy to talk with you off-line about that if you want, but I refer you back to our presentation.\nGrant Howard: Next questions on funding other than the warrants expiring in April. And Ryan, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe that's April 26. Is that correct?\nRyan Goepel: Correct.\nGrant Howard: Do you have any sources of funding available to you, CAC 31 December is less than short-term securities working cap is approximately $16 million. We're starting to really get the leasing...\nRyan Goepel: Yes. Well, the first question I'd ask Garo [ph] is how do you feel about the lot don't want dilution, and it is what it is. If you like dilution, then we can make your day.\nEd Wegel: But the other way we'd address it is, we did announce the debt facility, the $5 million we announced in January. That was from one of our larger investors. They've made a commitment to increase that if we need it. Again, we only take the money when we need it. One of the aspects of our working capital because we lease all our aircraft and under IFRS 16, you have put the current value of all the years lease payments on your balance sheet as a current liability. And so the aspect is we are going to be generating revenue to cover off a big chunk of that working capital. But it's just the byproduct of a highly leased fleet and you'll see negative working capital. But the quick answer is we have existing investors who have committed to us who provided capital as they did in January. We do have the warrants, which many people have started to exercise, and we expect to be profitable. So the need for cash is significantly decreased.\nRyan Goepel: So for instance, we took the -- we put in place the $5 million facility. We've only drawn half of it. The other half is sitting there if we need it. As of right now, we don't need it.\nGrant Howard: To some of these questions. Again, we're getting redundancy in and around financing, which has been answered. There's questions here that have been answered in the presentation more questions about kind of the deadline, if there's any contribution from Canada Jetlines to your balance sheet I don't believe, though.\nRyan Goepel: No, we account for them on the equity method. So until they -- they will start generating equity to the earnings equity earnings, but when they start earning profit. But until they're profitable, there's no impact on our balance sheet or income standing.\nGrant Howard: Congratulations, which we're always pleased to hear, and thank you for spending those along more questions about coupon and debt rate and how do you expect to raise millions of dollars that are split between aircraft because, we are getting really deep into the weeds on some of these questions. So don't if you offer -- or let me have a little discretion here. We're going to go to the last bit of this pretty quick because we're coming up to 1.5 hours now. Can you tell me how you structure the leases, what the average rates are for your current aircraft. I get back to earlier questions about even very you've been able to secure in a craft a very attractive rate?\nEd Wegel: Well, I think it's a supply and demand issue and really it comes down to getting the right aircraft at the right price from the right lessor or buying it. So it's -- when we say we're looking at a number of aircraft, we're probably actively looking at 20 to 30 aircraft kind of continually. And a lot of it has to be where is it? Is it the right condition, -- how old are the engines, so good are the engines, who is a previous operator. So all of those factor into price, and I think we've demonstrated we've managed to get very good deals on the aircraft we've gotten today, and we will continue to do so.\nGrant Howard: I just wanted to get my respect to Ed and Ryan for their discipline with capital. Great work from Dick Lawson it goes on and on. Frank Survey was asking about warrants. That has been answered in the presentation. So gentlemen, there is one more question. How do you feel regarding the competition in the Aero and World Atlantic, but also potentially Omnimnational as you move into the widebody category?\nEd Wegel: We compete against Aero and World Atlantic. In some cases, there are contracts where some of our airplanes are married up with airplanes for World Atlantic and I Aero, so we work with them. There's plenty of work out there. But we don't really look at our competition. We know that we put out there a great product. And what I define as a great product is an on-time, reliable product with a clean aircraft and a great crew. We will get more of our fair share of the market. They can do what they do. They're both good airlines. We compete against them. Sometimes we lose business against them. But I would think, overall, looking at all of the competitors in our marketplace, we have shown over the last year that we can get more than our fair share of the market. And the market is responding to us. We want to be the first call they make and not the second or third call they make to see if they can get an airplane. That's what we're striving for. We're beginning to make inroads in that. We're becoming the first call. Like we said, we've got 6 airplanes going into the NCAA March badness over the next few weeks. So we feel very good about that.\nGrant Howard: Ryan. Thank you for taking a lot of time to answer the question. Terrific presentation. Any closing comments?\nRyan Goepel: So again, thanks, everyone. This is a long presentation. For those of you who stuck in, we appreciate it. We appreciate your interest in GlobalX and your investment. And all these are good questions, questions that we -- Brian and I would be asking if we were in your shoes. So we're always available to answer questions. You can send them to Howard Group, and they can get them to us to the extent we can answer because unless we let every investor know the information we're providing, in some cases, we can't provide an answer to just one investor. But we're happy to talk with you ever come to Miami. We're happy to host you hear for a cup of coffee and in discussion. And I'd like to thank Howard Group for all of their efforts, especially the last presentation they put together with the cartoon guys and -- why buy stock in GlobalX. We all got a chuckle out of that, but it was all very, very effective. And I think...\nGrant Howard: What I said - I appreciate those comments that, but I said why we own...\nRyan Goepel: Global...\nGrant Howard: Why we own it. If I say buy, I'm in big trouble. But we'll be exercising our warrants. So we will be buying more global crafting. Thank you for those comments and super, super job, guys.\nRyan Goepel: Great. Thanks, everyone. Thank you. Have a great evening.\nEd Wegel: Thank you.+"}, {"symbol": "JETMF", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-11-02 03:37:05", "content": "Grant Howard: Well, good afternoon gentlemen. First, I wanted to congratulate you and the team on an exceptional quarter and you are going to get into all the details, but it\u2019s quite monumental, where you look \u2013 where you look at where you were just a year ago in the quarter, you just completed September 30. It\u2019s exceptional growth. And with that, I am going to introduce Ed Wegel, who is the CEO of Global Crossing Airlines and Ryan Goepel, CFO and Executive Vice President of Global with this third quarter update. And with that, gentlemen, I am going to turn it over to you.\nEd Wegel: Great. Thanks, Grant and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us for this Q3 third quarter update on our earnings and a look at preliminary look at our fourth quarter and some of the other events that we have got coming up. As Grant said, we had a good quarter. We had projected forecast a year ago that we would be profitable by our fourth full quarter of operations. The third quarter of 2022 is in fact our fourth quarter of full operations. Our first \u2013 very first quarter was a short quarter, only about 6 weeks. So we have reached profitability in our fourth quarter of operations, third quarter of 2022. We had projected \u2013 you can go to the next slide, we had projected at the very beginning of the year before Omicron and some other issues that hit the entire world hit us as well, but we had projected $90 million of revenue for 2022. We are reaffirming that base case of revenues of $90 million plus. We are at $64.6 million through the 9 months. We expect revenues at least equaling what we achieved in the third quarter, which was $30 million. So, we feel very confident that we will reach $90 million, probably closer to $93 or $94 million for the year. So, we feel very good about that. That validates the business case in our business model that we can put A320s and A321s to work in this U.S. charter market and gain our fair share of that market. Our revenue for the quarter was $30.1 million. Our EBITDA, which is earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization was about $1 million. Our EBITDAR, which is also taking out the rent expense for our aircraft, which levels the playing field, as we look at airlines across the U.S., some airlines own all of their airplanes, some airlines lease all of their airplanes like us and some have a mix. So to compare us to other airlines, we use an EBITDAR ratio and that\u2019s $5 million for the quarter. So, that\u2019s a very strong number for us. EBITDA again was $1million, operating income about $800,000, and then we had interest expense and amortization and depreciation, which brought our net income down to about 163,000, but the number that we really didn\u2019t know is we are really focused on our EBITDAR at $5 million and EBITDA at $1 million. So this was a good quarter for us in terms of getting the 7 aircraft online on this certificate fully crewed and operating, which is the metric that is so important for us to get to profitability. We reached profitability in this quarter. So moving forward, we again, we anticipate, project revenue, at least equal to quarter three \u2013 in quarter four. In fact, we will probably beat that number, but for now, we are reaffirming our case of $90 million plus for the year. So with that, let\u2019s go into some of the specifics on Q3. And I will turn that over to Ryan.\nRyan Goepel: So, one of the things I wanted to compare or kind of highlight is the difference between Q2 and Q3. One of the reasons we are really excited about the results that we achieved is this demonstrates pretty clearly how our model works and how it validates the returns. What you will notice is we had a significant increase in revenue. This was the first quarter in which we had 7 aircraft fully functional, fully crewed, which we\u2019ve always said was a key benchmark for us to get to profitability. But as you see the increase in revenue from quarter-to-quarter, you will see certain items go up with it and certain items do not. Fuel will go up as we fly more. Ground handling will go up as we land in more places. But when you look at salaries, when you look at maintenance, when you look at travel or insurance and aircraft rent, they stay flat. And that\u2019s really the drive \u2013 the point we want to drive home as we continue to add aircraft as we continue to add revenue, this dynamic will continue to be built and will continue to drive the results that we expect to see in Q4 in 2023. Next slide. This is just a graphic representation of what we have done. I know sometimes it\u2019s hard to conceptualize even for myself, where we were in Q3 of last year when we did this call and how fast we have grown. This is an 885% increase quarter-over-quarter. As Ed said, Q3 last year was a stub quarter, but it does demonstrate the volume and our ability to drive customer growth. I think as we look forward to the fleets in which Ed will cover in the next slide, it\u2019s important to note our average revenue per aircraft on the passenger side has grown from a low around $800,000 in Q4 last year to almost $1.5 million per aircraft in Q3 of this year and we expect that trend to continue as we continue to add aircraft to the fleet, which kind of as you try and think through the future and where we are going with this entity, that\u2019s a key metric for you to look at is how much revenue we are generating per aircraft we put to work. Looking at the fleet growth, I will pass it on to Ed really quick.\nEd Wegel: So, we will continue our growth through the fourth quarter and then into 2023. We will take two freighter aircraft A321 freighters this quarter. The first one should be online on our certificate by the third week of November. The second freighter should be online on our certificate and generating revenue sometime in the mid part of December. These are little later than we had projected delays coming out of the MRO conversion shops as we have talked about before, but we are now at the point where these airplanes will start generating revenue for us. We are finishing up our certification efforts with the FAA and finalizing DoT and FAA approvals. The first aircraft should be here in mid-November out of paint for conformity and then into service. So we are very excited about bringing these airplanes on, they are going to drive a large portion of our growth into 2023 because of the number of hours that we can put on our cargo aircraft and the contracts that we are putting in place. Again, the 321 freighters will drive a big portion of our growth into 2023. We had always talked about being a 50 aircraft airline at the end of 2025. So, that\u2019s 25 passenger aircraft, 25 freighter aircraft. And as you can see here, we have built up for you how we anticipate getting there. So, at the end of 2022, we will have 9 passenger aircraft, we have 7 now. We are taking an A321 passenger aircraft on a pure power by the hour basis, which is an exceptional deal for us. And then we are taking an A319 with 150 seats at a very exceptional lease rate and economics for us and that airplane has already been almost fully booked, because of the economics of that aircraft. So at the end of this year, 9 passenger aircraft and 2 cargo aircraft for a total of 11, in the first quarter of next year, we will take another freighter aircraft, another A321 freighter, a second A319 and we agreed on terms today for another A320 coming out of Alaska with full Wi-Fi and that aircraft has already been booked with a VIP customer for the balance of the year. So at the end of 2023, we anticipate to project 14 passenger aircraft, 9 cargo, 24 that grows by another 5 passenger aircraft to 19 and another 6 cargo aircraft to 15. And then by the end of 2025, we will have 25 passenger and 25 cargo aircraft. So we are on track to meet these goals. Certainly, we will meet them for 2022. 2023, the airplanes have been lined up on the cargo side. We are still looking for 2 A320s for the second half of 2023. We don\u2019t anticipate any problem in identifying those aircraft and getting them on our certificate. So we have got good growth. We have got good growth in our client base. We have got good growth in the number of clients that we service, good growth within each of the client categories of the number of block hours that we fly for them. We are developing a reputation for being an on-time and reliable charter airline, with modern aircraft, A320s, some of them with Wi-Fi, all of them are well equipped. The interiors are in great shape and we are getting more than our fair share of the business. So we are very, very pleased to where we are in our fleet growth and our ability to sell the hours on those aircraft. So, let\u2019s talk about some of our key achievements. Profitability within 1 full year of operations, first quarter was a stub so that in quarter three of 2021 as we look at the last four quarters, we have reached profitability. We have $6 million in debt. So when you look at the amount of capital that we have raised, equity plus debt, to get to where we are today, I think that proves that we are very prudent and very frugal in how we spend our money to get to profitability with 7 aircraft, 2 more freighter aircraft coming as well as another A321. What we are trying to do as we look at 2023 and the uncertainty in the economic environment that we are in, we know we will enter a recession. Every expert has told us that we are focused on charter clients who are largely recession proof in their flying. And those are sports teams, colleges and universities, especially division one that we fly, will fly whether there is a recession or not, we do a lot of U.S. government flying and we anticipate being certified to fly Department of Defense or military flights within about 60 to 75 days from now. Obviously, those flights are recession proof as well, but a lot of what we do and we estimate about 90% of our current charter base is recession proof. We fly to Cuba, those flights will continue. We fly to Santa Domingo and other points in the Caribbean based on the parameters of that clientele, we know that those flights are needed and will continue in a recession. So, we feel very good about our business base going into 2023. Given what we have been through COVID Omicron pilots, other issues, all of which we have weathered through our first year and gotten to profitability. We look forward to 2023 with a great sense of optimism about our business and what we can achieve. Our first cargo aircraft as I said and I will be here in Miami by mid-November, we are working very hard to put that into revenue service by the fourth week of November, so we will start flying revenue this month. Second and third aircraft, the second aircraft will be as I said here in Miami about mid-December, depending upon some last minute adjustments in the conversion, but that will be operating certainly by Christmas. That aircraft has been contracted. And our third aircraft freighter 321 will be here sometime late February and that aircraft as well has a contract ready to sign on it. So, first three aircraft are fully booked, the next five aircraft in 2023, we are working very diligently on contracts. And we anticipate being able to place all of those aircraft in service with long-term contracts by the end of January beginning of February of next year. So, we are very optimistic about our cargo business that drives our growth along with our passenger business and also diversifies our revenue streams into both cargo and passenger. So, those are our achievements. We had a good quarter. We look forward through the balance of the fourth quarter and this year. And we look forward to reporting those results sometime in early February. So with that, Grant, I will turn it back to you and we are ready for questions.\nA - Grant Howard: [Operator Instructions] And just to put something in perspective, while the questions are loading, just going back and having a look at when this company started trading in late June of \u201820 compared to where you are now and again in late June of \u201820 that was a year plus before you even had certification and your market capitalization when you started trading close to its high point is what it was about 4x what your market cap is today, which shows you how much of a disconnect, there has been psychology in the market and as things have been pretty topsy-turvy in the world and in the market over the past 8 months in particular. But you have done a hell of a job and was pretty good day for global on our market based on volume and about 180% increase or so on the press. So we are going to start taking questions with that. Well, the other thing is that, based on what you have laid out what you have achieved, I think it\u2019s becoming easier and easier for people to track the future of this company, because you keep delivering, so you are getting many more checkmarks. So we will leave it up to people to draw their own conclusions as to what \u201823 could look like here?\nEd Wegel: Okay. Do you want to read the questions, Grant and\u2026\nGrant Howard: Yes, I am getting into them now.\nEd Wegel: Okay.\nGrant Howard: First, from John Chamberlain, given the current administration\u2019s approach to reestablishing relations with Venezuela, how does that affect your opportunities for South American operations?\nEd Wegel: Well, that\u2019s a good question. If the current administration opens up non-stop flights, again by U.S. airlines to Venezuela and Venezuela continues in Category 2 with the FAA that would bode very, very well for GlobalX, I would anticipate we would almost immediately start for some of our clients, a daily nonstop Miami Caracas and perhaps one other city in Venezuela. So we probably would have two daily flights. And that would increase I would guess to 3 daily flights, very quickly after that\u2019s established. So all in all it will be very good for us.\nGrant Howard: Next from Neil Wilson, what\u2019s the status of the Fort Lauderdale facility?\nEd Wegel: We are \u2013 or our designer developer builder, which is a subsidiary of Oaktree Capital, has finalized their lease agreement with the Broward County Aviation Department. They are completing their environmental studies to see what mitigation might be needed in the soil. And we anticipate breaking ground on that facility within the next 60 days. We still hope to be in that facility by the end of 2023. We have already been approached by some airlines to rent out some of the hangar space for their own needs at the airport. Some very major airlines have already approached us. So this facility will be one of the hottest investments at Fort Lauderdale airport. It will be the largest hangar there. You can take an A330 or 3 A320s. And we have parking on the ramp for up to 6 airplanes. So this will be a great facility for us, will be part of the South Florida aviation community and being able to offer that facility to all of the airlines that operate down here, which will help us with our strategic alliances and our relationships. But again, the short answer to your question is we will be in that facility as soon as we possibly can and we think that\u2019s 13 to 14 months from now.\nGrant Howard: From Axel Braun, congratulations on the quarter and I don\u2019t know how far you want to grow, but do you expect profitability again in Q4? And the second part of that was what is the status of the NASDAQ uplist, we talk about Q4?\nEd Wegel: We anticipate a profit in quarter in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s about as much as I probably allowed to say maybe too much from what I am allowed to say. But Q4 should be a good quarter for us status of the uplisting to NASDAQ will require us to have more assets on the balance sheet. Given our now profitability and as we see in the share price, today, the movement up we think that our ability to get additional financing, which would give us the assets which we need to uplist will be forthcoming here very shortly.\nRyan Goepel: And we have always said and I think we have said it multiple times. We wanted to demonstrate four quarters of revenue growth. We want to demonstrate profitability and we wanted to demonstrate freight, our cargo operations up and running before we anticipated any sort of uplist opportunity. So with November, we will have ticked all three boxes.\nGrant Howard: Sorry, that question just disappeared on me. Please walk us through the individual components of the $3.3 million working capital inflow experience during Q3?\nEd Wegel: I don\u2019t necessarily think I could do that off the top of my head, but by and large, that was driven by as we grow our business keep in mind we get paid in advance, we get paid deposits, which is a big contributor to generating cash. We also generated a profit, which also allowed us to generate more cash for the company. And also as we get bigger with as we relate to end the quarter with revenue you do have some payables that have grown a bit, but that\u2019s in proportion of revenue.\nGrant Howard: Another question here, looking forward, I don\u2019t expect your answer to be any different, but could you please comment on your expectations for future growth and profitability and cash flow and thank you and great quarter?\nEd Wegel: The increase in, look at the question come in for future growth, well, we have outlined how we get to 50 aircraft by the end of 2025, 2023 we had \u2013 we basically double in size, the size of this company and along with that goes the cash flow. So basic rule of thumb in this business is you need 6 to 7 airplanes to get to at least breakeven so that you cover your fixed costs. And we have fixed costs in terms of our operations control and staffing, finance all of the various departments that are needed as part of the infrastructure of this airline. Once we have covered that fixed costs, which you do with 7 airplanes, then everything that after that increases the percentage that goes to the bottom line. So, our plan is to increase our cash flow, our plan is to increase our share price, our plan is to increase the size of the company are all driven by adding additional aircraft units both passenger and cargo to our certificate that drives our growth, that drives our profitability and that should drive our share price.\nGrant Howard: Will deferred costs related to aircraft deposits be returned once the aircrafts are delivered to GlobalX?\nEd Wegel: Yes, that\u2019s not exactly how our financials are setup. So, airplane deposits paid lessors as an asset, which we would have to returning the aircraft would be part of the reconciliation on the return. When we look at customer deposits that are paid to us for the flights that we fly, they are factored into either they are used as part of to pay for their flights or their return once we settle up with the customer that they have covered all their costs, that\u2019s sort of how it works on the balance sheet.\nGrant Howard: The potential addition of the B-717 aircraft, the various media sources reported potential addition of 10 of the B-717.\nEd Wegel: We are looking at that aircraft. The 717 is probably \u2013 no, I will say it is the best regional aircraft ever built. It is based off of the MD-80 series aircraft eventually became the MD-95 and then the 717 Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas. Delta operates 90 of them. Hawaiian operates 20 of the airplanes. The 717 and Qantas operates 20 of them. And that has proven to be a very good aircraft for both Delta and Hawaiian as well as Qantas. And so we have looked at that aircraft, because what we have seen in this charter market is that about half of the clients that we talk to work with need an aircraft that can fly for 3 hours and carry 60 to 80 passengers. The 717 fits perfectly within those parameters and it is for us would be a very cheap aircraft to operate. There are also a lot of MD-80 qualified pilots, which would ease the strain on our acquisition of A320 pilots. And the airplane, as we have looked at the various deals proposed to us would be a very, very cheap aircraft for us to operate. We haven\u2019t made any decisions on that. We analyze a lot of things all at the same time. So we are analyzing this airplane. We are analyzing this versus more A319s and we are analyzing this versus perhaps going immediately to A330s. But if we had this airplane in our fleet right now, it would be an exceptional performer for us. We balance that against the complexity of operating two aircraft types within a small airline like GlobalX. So, we\u2019re weighing the pros and cons, we\u2019re very, very interested in the aircraft, we are probably the only U.S. airline that could take these airplanes that are starting to come out of the fleets of volunteers gotten out of the fleet, because they couldn\u2019t get more of them. So, short answer is we\u2019re very interested in the airplane, we\u2019re doing a lot of analysis. We\u2019ve briefed our board and they\u2019ve given us a mandate in terms of the questions that need to be asked, and more analysis that needs to be done. So we will have more on this in the future. It\u2019s a very real possibility, but no decisions have been made.\nGrant Howard: Next one\u2019s about Canada Jetlines and just for the people, who are attending who may not remember or have forgotten, in July of \u201821, GlobalX spun out Canada Jetlines will be on two shares of global you got one share of Canada Jetlines and dividend and Canada Jetlines started commercial operations this past September. The question is, today Canada Jetlines receive approvals to operate flights to the U.S. can GlobalX leverage that and start connecting Canadian cities with the U.S.\nEd Wegel: But I\u2019m going to ask Ryan to answer that question. Ryan is our representative on the board of Canada Jetlines, let me just first say that we\u2019re very proud of Canada Jetlines and what they did to get certified from Transport Canada, they went through probably more hoops than they were should have been required to go through just because of the economic environment that we\u2019re in. We\u2019re very proud that they have their first airplane and now signed for their second airplane and have started some scheduled service. So we have constant dialogue with Jetlines to the extent that we can since as U.S. investor, we can only have so much influence about what they do. But Ryan, again, is on the board of Jetlines and is up to speed on our discussions with them. So why don\u2019t you start highlights.\nRyan Goepel: So, as you know, Canada Jetlines has announced flights to Calgary and \u2013 Toronto, Calgary and Toronto, Vancouver with they are going to use with their initial metal, we\u2019re looking at destinations once they get their ability to sell in the United States. And today\u2019s announcements are a big part of that the ability to sell in the U.S. would dictate flying through the U.S. Global Crossing has made our aircraft available to fly for them. So basically, Jetlines can be bigger, faster, which is really in the game of scale. That\u2019s a key component. So we are working with a commercial team to identify which areas make sense what the economics make sense. And so for yes, so the idea always has been for Jetlines to leverage the relationship with GlobalX to get bigger, faster, because really [indiscernible] it is about airlines. And we will \u2013 they will be working on announcements this [indiscernible] again, what they\u2019ve been focused on is getting permission to do it. And then secondly, getting the key to that given there, they\u2019re more of a charter model, a kind of a mixed risk is their ability to sell tickets, and get the distribution the relationships in place. We want to make sure all of that is in place and effective before we commit to the cost of flying to this \u2013 flying south.\nGrant Howard: The European summer flights ran into complications due to permitting this year and it says your Q3 results suggest that you were compensated due to contractual obligations. Can you provide any further detail? Do you expect to be flying in Europe during summer 2023?\nEd Wegel: I\u2019ll take the first part of that. And then Ryan will talk about flying in the future. He\u2019s just worked out some deals in Europe that are very, very favorable to the company. Let me just talk about the issues in Europe this summer. So as you know, we had a contract with TUI, which is one of the major tour operators in Europe. They advised us that the approvals that they had received from the Dutch authorities and the Dutch CAA for us to operate we are sufficient for the operations that we would conduct for them. We thought otherwise, but they assured us that the Dutch authorities had cleared all protocols within EASA and that we were cleared to fly. That wasn\u2019t the case and the EASA required us to stop flying and to meet the requirements for what\u2019s called a TCO or Third Country Operator authorization within Europe. TUI very, very stand-up organization, well run and very ethical continue to pay us through about the mid part of August. At that point, we felt it prudent to bring our airplanes home while we went through the final phases of the TCO process with EASA, the European Aviation Safety Agency. The amounts that they paid us wasn\u2019t a windfall, because they were paying us for ACMI, so, Aircraft Crew Maintenance of Insurance and so about 90% to 95% of what they paid us we had to pay out in lease costs, in crew costs, daily maintenance costs on our airplanes, and the insurance for the aircraft. So the any of the flying that we would have done in Europe, all of the other expenses would have been paid directly by TUI, so we never would have received those revenues. So in effect, we received and paid out as much as we would have paid out had we flown the flights, we have established an excellent relationship with TUI, primarily because of Ryan\u2019s discussions and negotiations with them. They saw how we operated with them getting our crews and our airplanes to Europe. To start the operation. They saw how well we maintained our operation while we were waiting to get our TCO and worked with them. And so they came to us quickly after the end of the summer. And said we would like to establish a long-term relationship with GlobalX. We\u2019ve seen your airplanes, we\u2019ve trained some of our flight attendants to fly with you, we\u2019ve seen your flight attendants and cockpit crews, and how they conducted themselves in Europe for about 6 weeks. And so we want you to be our partner for the years to come. And so I\u2019ll let my Ryan talk about the negotiations, discussions really with TUI, and what we project to do with them over the next 3 to 5 years.\nRyan Goepel: Yes, as Ed alluded to, we basically have \u2013 we would like to think we have a great working relationship with them. They see the need for our aircraft and our services for a significant number of years, we\u2019ve come to terms on a 3-year agreement with rates, we\u2019re working through the details of the contract, before anything formal can be announced and booked. There\u2019s a strong demand for our services over there are, we\u2019re well positioned to support them in their operations, they have a need for it pretty much every summer. And we\u2019re looking forward to an incredibly long relationship with TUI, and other charter operators, airline operators in Europe, in the summer, with our TCO in place, with the aircraft type we have, and with our ability to execute on the work, we believe there\u2019s significant opportunities in Europe, not only in \u201823, but \u201824, \u201825 and \u201826.\nEd Wegel: We\u2019ve actually discussed with them at their suggestion that we established our own AOC in Europe, probably a multi AOC, which would allow us to increase the number of aircraft, we could operate for them in the summers, from two aircraft to up to as many as four or five aircraft. So we\u2019re analyzing that, and discussing that with them, see if that makes sense. We\u2019re looking at the expense of that, but there is an opportunity to greatly expand our relationship with TUI in terms of the number of aircraft that we operate for them and obviously the revenue base.\nGrant Howard: I want to comment here, someone would love to see you on BNN and CNBC we all would, and it\u2019s not a question you can answer at this point, but we want to see you there someday. From Neil Wilson, what are your primary house?\nEd Wegel: Well, we don\u2019t operate as a scheduled airline, as we\u2019re a charter operator. So our hubs are somewhat fluid. It depends on where our charter clients are based. It depends on time of year, but we\u2019re starting to settle down into a couple of areas, a couple of cities. I should say that in geographical areas where we know we will have a high concentration of charters that originate. So obviously, Miami is our home base, our main base. We do a lot of flying out of Miami to into the Caribbean, into Latin America, into Cuba and into Mexico. So Miami is our primary base. It\u2019s where our current maintenance base is. It\u2019s where our operations control center is and of course, our senior management staff. We\u2019ve established a base in San Antonio with both maintenance and flight attendants. We do a lot of government flying, that are originates in Texas in San Antonio is a great place to position a hub. It\u2019s also a great place to recruit staff that we need both in maintenance and in cabin crew. And we will probably establish a cockpit crew or pilot base there in San Antonio. Cost of living in Texas in San Antonio is lower than it is here in Miami. And so we\u2019re actually looking at perhaps, we\u2019re still studying this moving some functions of the airline to Texas. And we\u2019re analyzing some other locations in the country, we have base \u2013 flight attendant base in Las Vegas, we\u2019re going to be doing more and more west coast, flying into Las Vegas, flying into Phoenix, flying onto the West Coast. And so we\u2019ve established a beachhead there in Las Vegas, we have flight attendants. As we get more aircraft, we anticipate basing one or two aircraft permanently in Las Vegas. And as we grow our business in the West, we maintain a base in Atlantic City with our relationship with spirit there for maintenance, it is a place where we often ferry airplanes after they complete their charter flights in the Northeast as they\u2019re waiting for their next assignment. So we want to continue to build the Atlantic City base. So that would give us Atlantic City, Miami, San Antonio and Las Vegas. So that covers the country for us. As we grow larger and get more aircraft, and we can more specialized in certain areas of the country, we may look to put something up in the northwest. But we certainly want to stay as much as we can below the snow or freezing line in the U.S. where we keep our aircraft.\nGrant Howard: [indiscernible] financing, and how do you envision financing in this environment?\nEd Wegel: I\u2019ll let Ryan speak about some specifics. But given our growth, given one of the primary assets of this company, which is the deals that we have put in place for a fleet of A321 freighter aircraft. And given what we\u2019ve done so far, on a very, very small budget, in terms of our financing to-date, you can imagine that we have had many inquiries about being able to invest in this company. So we\u2019ve got options, none of which we have decided on. We are continuing to grow our aircraft fleet. We want to grow our profitability, and we hopefully will see a concurrent rise in our share price, which makes the potential for selling equity bit more attractive for us right now, it\u2019s not attractive that even at even at today\u2019s stock price, even with 20% gain. So we will need additional cash as we take on additional aircraft to get to 50 aircraft. We certainly could not do it on the equity base that we have today. But we hope and expect that we will be able to raise equity at higher share prices in the future. I don\u2019t know if you want to\u2026\nRyan Goepel: Yes, I think, I would reiterate \u2013 I think, if anything we\u2019ve demonstrated over the last 2.5 years is a reticence to give equity away. And we really haven\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019ve been really disciplined about when we raise money, how much we\u2019ve raised. As indicative in the last raise in March, when we raised $6 million in debt with some warrants. I think our inclination at this stage is not to raise in the form of equity, given the price point. A convertible or something with a warrant is much more palatable, makes a lot more sense. But again, we see a pretty big disconnect between the level of activity, our projections, and are ensuing share price. And I think this is a fluid situation that changes every day. So what we focus on is executing, we focus on growing the revenue, growing profitably, we have the ability to grow with our existing resources. But again, as if we want to get to 50 aircraft in 2.5 years, there is \u2013 there will be a need to bring in extra cash to accelerate it, but it\u2019s not required. It\u2019s not a survival issue. It\u2019s a speed of growth issue. So we\u2019re going to continue to execute on our plan. And just as we have been \u2013 every other decision we\u2019ve made be incredibly optimistic, right? When we see aircraft for really cheap, we go get it. When we see a great asset that makes sense we go get it, we see routes, we can go fly, we fly, when we see customers who need help we go help them. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s our approach has been pretty disciplined over the last 2.5 years and I don\u2019t see that changing.\nGrant Howard: Speaking of assets from longtime shareholder Mike Harrison, you mentioned that you are anticipating putting capital assets on the books. Those \u2013 this suggested your strategy of acquiring aircraft may be different than on the first seven planes.\nEd Wegel: But I think what you are driving in your question there is when we buy aircraft as opposed to leasing them. We still see incredible deals, leasing aircraft in this market, the aircraft leasing market is starting to firm up. And aircraft lease rates are not as soft as they were, say a year ago, although we are still driving some very, very good deals. As we look ahead, we think Europe will have a difficult time over the next year. We think that the airline growth in Europe will slow down. And there may be some airlines that cease operating. So, we will be particularly opportunistic for additional A320s over the next year, as Europe and perhaps certain parts of Asia will continue to have some issues. So, we look to drive very, very good deals on leased aircraft. That also means that there will be aircraft for sale. We certainly don\u2019t have the equity on our balance sheet to go buy aircraft. We have talked to certain financing sources about creating an aircraft acquisition facility for us, where we could put in a very, very sliver piece of equity. And they would finance the bulk of the aircraft, so that we either put the aircraft on a finance lease, or some way that we could acquire the aircraft. We would love to put some aircraft assets on our balance sheet. We obviously don\u2019t have the capability currently to do that, but we are constantly looking at ways to do that.\nGrant Howard: He questions in and around people, can you give us some insight on your ability to hire pilots and mechanics? And the other one related is I know that you have a new pilot class starting every three weeks, are you having any issues of recruitment or retention at this point in the competitive nature of the airlines today? Great quarter.\nEd Wegel: So, we have been actively recruiting pilots, since over the last 18 months, certainly well, before we received our certificate. We have gotten very good at it. We have got a couple of different sources where we draw pilots from. We obviously go to all of the pilot recruiting conferences. We have signed an agreement with OSM Aviation Academy here in Fort Lauderdale, which is owned by the owner of Norse Atlantic Airways. And we have gotten our first four first officers from that program with another six in training. In terms of captains, which is really the most important of the two positions, we have been very, very successful in recruiting U.S. qualified pilots who are flying overseas or flying in the Middle East or flying in Asia, and they want to come home. But they are at an age, let\u2019s call it mid-50s to 60, where they don\u2019t want to go to United or Delta or American and sit in the right seat for the last part of their career and get the less favorable flying assignments that those airlines. They would rather come to us, where they become a direct entry captain. We are competitive in pay. We are more than competitive in lifestyle in terms of South Florida and the types of flying that we do. So, we have been successful so far in ensuring we have got enough captains to crew our aircraft. Now, we have got enough FOs now that have been with us, over the past year, we can now start upgrading to captain and backfill those FOs from the OSM Academy, and from other sources. So, for now, we feel very, very good where we are with pilots. It is a constant battle out there. We are battling the majors. We are battling Spirit and Frontier and Allegiant, and JetBlue, but we offer certain elements of a lifestyle here that is different from flying for those airlines. And we are attracting very experienced very qualified captains, who see the potential here. They see the growth. They know that their pay will be increased in line with what our competitors and even what Allegiant and some others are paying as we grow in our profitability. So, right now we feel comfortable, we feel confident. We think that the hiring in the U.S. will slow down next year, for various reasons. And we think that we will be able to retain the vast majority of the pilots that we have recruited, hired and trained as we move forward. In terms of maintenance personnel, we have some relationships with some of the maintenance schools here in Miami. We have not had a difficulty in attracting maintenance technicians and maintenance staff, because of the type of fleet that we operate the A320, A321, and we think eventually A330. They want to come here, because they see growth, they can come as maintenance technicians, then they become line ramp supervisors, then they become maintenance controllers and they continue to move up the chain. They can\u2019t get that necessarily with other charter airlines in the U.S. right now, because those airlines are not growing. So, so far no issues, getting pilots, no issues, getting maintenance technicians, and we feel as we grow and grow in profitability, we will continue to be able to attract good talent to the airline.\nGrant Howard: Can you elaborate on the aviation potential? Do you think there are safety issues regarding lithium batteries that might cause passengers to shy away from using e-airplanes?\nRyan Goepel: I think our take on that, let them work that out. I think they are going through their certification process. They are going through their acceptance. We are not going to \u2013 I think it\u2019s up to them to prove that out and when they are ready to fly we will be here to work with them.\nEd Wegel: So, those airplanes won\u2019t deliver to us for another 5 years. We want it to get in line with an order position. That also allows us to talk frequently with the manufacturer of the airplane so that we can help in the design to help shape what we want to see in the airplane for the types of operations that we want to operate with that airplane. And so those discussions are ongoing both on the aviation side with the Alice Aircraft and with Eve which is the eVTOL aircraft. So, for essentially no money down, we now have a place in line for both of those aircraft. And it gives us a seat at the table in terms of being able to shape the aircraft development and what we want to see in those aircraft for our particular operation.\nGrant Howard: Got it. And you have addressed this in part, since you have had some unique circumstances during COVID in acquiring aircraft, how has or what\u2019s the climate now? And can we maintain this competitive advantage going forward?\nEd Wegel: Well, as I have said a moment ago, we are seeing the aircraft operating lease environment, turning a bit back towards the lessor. Although we still have a significant advantage, there are significant numbers of A320s, A321s, A319s that are on the market. And we get probably a dozen calls a day into our aircraft acquisition team, offering us more airplanes. We \u2013 our next A321, which will be here in two weeks is a tremendously favorable deal for us. It\u2019s all power by the hour, and that aircraft will eventually be converted to freighter and all of that has been financed and built into the leases that we signed for that aircraft. We agreed on terms today for as I said another A320 coming out of Alaska, excellent terms, maybe just a little bit more than what we are paying for some of the earlier A320s that we acquired, but not really a material amount of increase in the lease rate. And in fact, this airplane in terms of its age, and where it is in the maintenance cycle is probably better, probably the best A320 we will have in our fleet. We think this situation will continue for at least another 12 months as the excess aircraft either get remain in storage or sent to be disassembled or perhaps absorbed back into some airline systems. But we don\u2019t see any new airlines starting here in the U.S. Europe will have difficulties next year. I doubt many airplanes will be taken out of storage to go into European airlines. Next year, I think the reverse is going to happen. So, I think we are still in a good part of the cycle. And we are going to take advantage of that and tie up as many airplanes as we can over the next 12 months to fuel our growth.\nGrant Howard: Raise the next question, but what it comes down to is whether or not you have sufficient number of pilots to staff the current seven aircraft?\nEd Wegel: Yes. We do. And that\u2019s why we are seeing the increases in block hours, and the increase in revenues. We have classes as was earlier stated, starting about every three weeks. We have just started one. We have just recruited for our December class that\u2019s already got five captains in it. And we hope to get to six or seven before we close that out. So, right now we have sufficient number of crews per aircraft, and we have a sufficient number of crews in training, or a first officer is being upgraded to captain to be able to crew the first two freighters as well as the next two passenger aircraft. So, we are keeping up with the demand for our services both on the aircraft side as well as on the cockpit crews.\nGrant Howard: Questions related to the JET.B shares. Part of it is why is there such a disparity between the JET and the JET.B and causing confusion among new retail investors. You have discussed this before, when can you get rid of the JET.B shares.\nRyan Goepel: So, just a bit of history for those who are new to the story, the JET.B shares were created in order for us to be compliant with the Department of Transportation\u2019s ownership regulations, which stipulates 75% of our voting shareholders, 75% of our voting shares need to be held by U.S. citizens. So, as a byproduct of our initial formation or merger with Canada Jetlines, we had a significant foreign shareholder base, which is primarily Canadian, which forced us to push to create JET and JET.B. The features of the JET.B is it has the exact same economic rights as the JET shares. And they are convertible to JET shares on one for one basis at any time. As far as getting rid of the JET.B, we would have to be able to prove to the Department of Transportation that 75% of the JET shares are owned by U.S. citizens, which is a little difficult, because we are \u2013 there is no report I can go to find out who owns all my shares. We have 9,000 shareholders, 8,000 shareholders owning less than 1,000 shares, and getting passports for all those shareholders, which is a difficult task. That being said, I think over the course of since we first launched in June of 2020, we have seen a significant uptick in the acquisition of shares by U.S. citizens. I don\u2019t think we are at the point now where we can collapse the B shares into the common, but by no means have a desire to maintain that any longer than we have to.\nGrant Howard: Get to the remainder quickly. Congratulations for not raising equity, this price appreciate discipline. Thanks for all you do. How has the acquisition of Flugy benefited the airline?\nEd Wegel: It\u2019s actually benefited us in a number of ways. We have just signed three more contracts at Flugy with Soho House. And that\u2019s driving some significant material revenue for us. We haven\u2019t focused on it as much as we have focused on driving the airline to profitability. But our media and ad agency has continued to do work on developing the brand. We are talking to more and more similar type companies like Soho House, to develop the product. We are talking to a couple of investors about taking a piece of Flugy and spinning that out, we would maintain a significant stake in it. And all of the charter flights that come out of Flugy would come to us if we could fly them and bringing it outside investors with experience in the travel space, the online travel space, which would accelerate the growth of Flugy and we would want our equity stake to increase in value as well. So, it\u2019s led to five flights so far for us on a relatively nominal investment that we have made. We have positioned it with our social media, a website and also with our outside agency for a significant growth that we can see in the product. And we want to bring in some now experts who understand the online space extremely well and get this product positioned for new investment and an expansion of their capabilities.\nGrant Howard: When group plans of up to 25 cargo aircraft, do you see partnerships with any major freight forwarders?\nEd Wegel: Yes. We talk to all of the package carriers. We are in discussions with them. On a weekly basis, they understand what we are doing. They understand the capabilities of the aircraft. The A321 freighter is the replacement for the 757 freighter, which on average are over 30-years-old. It also competes extremely well against the competing product, which is the 737-800. The A321 freighter carries more than 40% more than what 737-800 freighter will carry. And so all of the freight forwarders and the package carriers like Amazon, DHL, UPS, they understand the economics of that, and what that extra 40% means. So, we are in discussions with all of them. We have got some very, very good contracts being lined up with airlines to fly this airplane for them with a launch operator, the A321 freighter. And w have got 15 of them now under firm LOI or lease, which is a significant size that is very attractive to the larger freight forwarders and the package carriers. I won\u2019t say much more than that, other than to say that we have the best narrowbody aircraft freighter. But we have got more than 15 of them. And we operate the airplane already with the A321 passenger aircraft. And so we are very, very well positioned to take this aircraft, and drive significant growth and profitability operating it in the U.S. and throughout Latin America.\nGrant Howard: In closing, congratulations of well done Ed and Ryan. With that gentlemen, that would be the end of the questions.\nEd Wegel: Thanks very much, Grant. Thanks everyone on the call for your support. I know many of you have been following us, since June of 2020. It\u2019s a great day for us to be able to announce that we are profitable. We appreciate you hanging in there with us. And we promise to continue to do what we are doing, which is to work extremely hard with our shareholders\u2019 money to create a profitable airline. So, thanks again, Grant. Thanks everyone. And everyone have a great day.\nGrant Howard: Thank you."}, {"symbol": "JETMF", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-05-17 19:12:03", "content": "Grant Howard: Good afternoon. Good morning, depending on where you are. Welcome to this Management Update Webinar for Global Crossing Airlines. I'm Grant Howard. I'm joined today, Ed Wegel, CEO and Ryan Goepel, who is the Chief Financial Officer. There's a lot of information on the stack, good information, solid, the growth has been exceptional, contrary to what the stock may be doing in a psychotic market, the company is performing, in fact, firing on all cylinders. And I'm not going to steal any thunder. So, with that, Ed and Ryan, I'm going to turn it over to you.\nEd Wegel: Great. Thanks Grant and good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for being with us on this quarterly update, our second full quarter of operations revenue, service, we're very happy to be here and very glad to be able to present to you some of the highlights of this quarter. And highlights of this quarter, we'll do a comparison of this quarter versus Q4 of 2022. We'll look at some objectives that we have for the second quarter, we'll do a rundown of some of the major contracts that we have signed and updated forecast numbers. We're going to talk a little bit about the A321 freighter which we will introduce into revenue service by the fourth quarter of this year, which is a very important growth element in our story and talk a little bit about the unit economics of both the A320 passenger aircraft, as well as the 321 freighter. So, with the Q1 behind us now, again, this, we had a very good first quarter, despite the negative effects of Omicron, which as you remember, affected everyone late December, January, and into the mid part of February. So, we were not immune to that. We had a number of pilots and flight crew, and even office staff who were affected by that personally. And as well, a number of our clients had to either cancel, defer or delay, some of their trips, because of Omicron. Despite that, our revenue was a little over $16 million for the quarter, which was a good jump over the fourth quarter of 2021. We're now projecting $90 plus million in revenue for the full year 2022 and total contracts and otherwise that we now have in place exceed $200 million and that breaks down over the next three years as follows. So, $70 million in signed contracts now for 2022. So, it's a short jump to get us to over $90 plus million for the full year. For 2023, we have $76 million in signed contracts already and for 2024, we've already booked $52 million in revenue contracts. So, we've got a good base -- a good foundation of revenue for the company as we move forward. We'll talk about some of those contracts in a moment, but the vast majority of those are reps recession proof. And as we look at the possibility of a recession later this year in the U.S. and Canada, maybe all of the Americas, this bodes well for us because we are largely shielded from that economic reality. Our operating hours per quarter will increase 300% in the fourth quarter this year versus the quarter that just ended. So, we're going to have tremendous growth over the balance of this year, which comes from additional passenger aircraft, as well as the introduction of the first freighter aircraft and we'll get into this in a moment, but we'll have three freighter aircraft on the certificate by the end of this year. So, we're forecasting our profitability in Q3. Q2, we're still investing heavily in pilot recruitment, pilot training, IT systems, all of the things that we need to lay further foundation for our growth to take on additional aircraft and to take on the A321 freighters. So, with that, I'll turn it to Ryan to go through the quarter versus Q4 of last year.\nA - Ryan Goepel: And as Ed stated Q4, we saw $11 million in revenue which we grew to $16 million, which is a pretty large increase. One of the benefits you'll notice as we had aircraft is we don't necessarily add one for one in all other costs. So, for example, salaries and wages did not increase the proportion of revenue and as we add more aircraft, we'll see that see that continue. Aircraft fuel is largely impacted by how many contracts we do that are either ACI contract. We flew a lot of March schools in March and so that included fuel and those cost again, that's all cost plus basis. So, that's a pass through cost that we mark up, so we don't take any fuel risks there. Maintenance expense was up as we basically on boarded six aircraft pretty quickly at the end of 2021 and there's some upgrades that need to be put in place. And that wasn't necessarily -- that was a big increase over Q4. When we look at the travel and insurance, those are just a rent, that's just a reflection of adding aircraft. So, we're excited about the cost structure, we are continuing to invest in people, we're continue to invest in systems as Ed alluded to, in order for us to feed the growth that we're projecting through the rest of the year.\nEd Wegel: Some of the expenses that we highlight here, as Ryan said, relate to the three aircraft that we brought on in December of last year. There are certain maintenance expenses involved in bringing those aircraft on, we've expensed them fully in this quarter, we believe some of those will be recaptured from the lessors and some of the other maintenance providers of those aircraft. We also had -- professional fees were up because we got our S-1 finalized and made hey effective at the U.S. SEC. We had a number of charges related to that all of which we took this quarter and expense them so that we don't have any overhang going forward. And as we are building our systems, we are required under the FAA to build and develop our human infrastructure in terms of our maintenance capabilities, our dispatch, our scheduling, and our other systems, with the people and the systems that we need before we take the airplanes on. So, we incur those expenses, the training expenses, the salary expenses before additional aircraft are brought onto the certificate. So, that's an important thing to note is that we have to have the all of the pieces and elements in place before the FAA and DoT will allow us to bring additional aircraft on. We have done all of that hard work. We have spent the money, we have spent a lot of money on people and systems that allow us to effectively double our fleet from now until the end of this year. As we look at some of the key contracts that we have signed over the past three to four months, a couple of things of note. So, we've got over $200 million in contracts for 2022 and beyond, so, 2022, 2023, and 2024. And we are still building on those every day, we signed contracts almost every day. We've got LOIs that are contingent on us, getting airplanes in such as some of our freighters, but we're very secure in those LOIs, we've got deposits -- cash deposits up from the clients for those contracts. Key contracts include our -- the U.S. government, we will do just shy of 5,000 hours by the government this year, 2022. And we've already looked and have booked over 9,000 hours so far for 2023 and 9,000 in 2024. U.S. government is recession proof and that business will continue to grow for us. Our contract to fly from Miami into Havana and from Tampa to Havana has been renewed. This represents a little over 1,700 hours in 2022 and as you may have seen yesterday, the Biden administration opened up all the Cuba province cities now for air service again. So, we're projecting that we will fly to four cities on top of Havana relatively soon and on a full year basis, those additional flights represent about 780 hours per year. Our collegiate fan and incentive travel business continues to grow. We're signing up more and more brokers. We're providing dedicated aircraft to the NCAA and others, providing dedicated aircraft to brokers who specialize in certain conferences and certain Championship Series. For instance, we're putting two airplanes into the NCAA College World Series that starts later this month and because of our performance in March Madness, which was the college basketball championship, where we had two aircraft this year, we have now been asked to provide six dedicated aircraft to that championship next March. So, we're building a reputation, on-time, reliable, clean, great aircraft, clean systems, great crews. And so as a result, we're seeing repeat business and that business is actually growing in terms of the volume. We're also flying later this month and into June for a major U.S. airline, LCC. We're going to do 171 hours for them in what we call sub-service. So, we'll fly certain routes for them. They are growing rapidly, they need additional capacity on some of their routes. So, we're opening up a route for them. This is really one of the one of the reasons that we built this airline the way we did as a U.S. 121 scheduled flight carrier so that we're able to perform missions just like this. And so we mimic that other airline with their onboard service, but with our crews, our aircraft and they came to us because again, our reputation already established for our on-time and our clean aircraft, our great crews and we think this business will continue to expand for us with other airlines in the U.S. We've also signed with a major European tour operator for the summer. We're moving two airplanes to Amsterdam in the end of June. We'll fly 400 hours per month per aircraft in both July and August. And this is the start of a major program with this tour operator that should go on for the next 10 or 20 years, however, long these programs will be in existence, but we've got a great relationship with them. We've got everything in place to move those airplanes over -- what is a relatively quieter time for us here in the U.S. in the summertime, we're able to get almost double utilization out of two aircraft in July and August. On the cargo side, we're making great progress now as we get closer to having the first two airplanes on our certificate. We've got LOIs and actually signed the agreement now with a major Latin American airline to provide them one airplane, minimum of 200 hours a month at a great ACMI rate, we'll be announcing with this airline this deal within the next few days. They're putting out their entire fleet plan. This is part of it, we'll do a separate announcement as well a GlobalX for this contract. We also have a major logistics operator in the Caribbean, that has signed for a number of hours, not fully a dedicated aircraft, but we have other pieces of contracts that will put in place to fill in for this airplane. We -- as we look out over the -- our delivery schedule, which we'll get into in a moment of the A321 freighters. We now foresee that the first five aircraft are essentially fully placed or fully booked going forward due to the demand that we're seeing for this particular aircraft type, the 321 freighter. So, we feel very, very good, very, very confident about our cargo business now going forward. You want to take us through this?\nRyan Goepel: Sure, current status of aircraft, we have obviously the six aircraft on board, our first A320, which -- our next A320, which is adding to a four, we'll show pictures, it's in paint and should be delivered here at the end of the month. Our first 319, which will be delivered in June. These were hoped to be here earlier in the year, they've been going through significant maintenance checks and they've been delayed on that side, but we're excited to get them on board. Our next 321 will be coming in July and the next 319, we hope to have here in August. But then when you look at the cargo aircraft, we have 13 on from lease -- either from leases or LOIs, with deposits, and seven additional lessor commitments. We'll walk through that on a later slide. The first aircraft to be delivered in August to allow us to complete our certification, which is on track and Ed will detail that process. Second aircraft, first week of September and both are going revenue service by October 1st. When you look at our team, I think one of the key elements is getting pilots through our training program. We currently have 30 in training, we're starting classes every two weeks. That pilot group is growing and that's given us the capacity to go do the work that we need to do over the next nine months. But looking at bases, Miami, Atlantic City, Las Vegas are operating and we're opening a San Antonio office for flight attendants and maintenance to support our government work down there. So, all elements are growing, we're still adding the planes, we're adding the people and the systems and this is kind of where the investment is. And if you look at the next slide, it's real, 284, it's been painted. This is the next one to join, it's in our original delivery. We're excited. This is another aircraft that we're getting from Alaska, so our three sisterships all sequential serial numbers, which is great for us from a maintenance and record standpoint. And the two we have now have been performing admirably throughout. Looking in Q2, you want me to--?\nEd Wegel: Yes.\nRyan Goepel: Looking in Q2, our objectives, we're targeting $90 million in revenue. EBITDAR positive. Now, EBITDAR is a metric that is used in aviation and basically its earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and rent. It's commonly used with air analyzing airlines because it allows apple-to-apples comparison by removing a rental cost. The reason this is important is allows you to compare companies with similar operations who choose to acquire their assets differently whether they buy the asset, or they lease the asset, EBITDAR is a metric allows you to compare the two. We're looking to take delivery as you said earlier over next 319 and 320. We'll get to additional passenger aircraft LOIs signed support the government contracts. We'll announce multiple cargo contracts and we are bidding all the Fall football season work. We look to finalize those contracts, there's been a lot of competition and we're trying to see what we can do to optimize the schedule and our utilization of our aircraft for the season. I think now I'll turn over to Ed, who will walk through cargo.\nEd Wegel: So, this is our -- the concept design for our 321 freighter. As we said, the first two aircraft will be delivered first, mid-August, the second, near the end of August. We have our teams up at both conversion facilities, working with the conversion vendor to get these aircraft converted cargo, both are outstanding OEM contractors, one is Precision and the second one is ST Engineering, which is the largest maintenance -- aircraft maintenance engineering MRO in the world. And so we've been up to Lake City, Florida for the -- for one aircraft and the second aircraft at San Antonio, you may have seen some of the pictures of our cutting the door ceremony in San Antonio. And in a few weeks, we'll have a ceremony in Lake City, Florida, for the placement of the cargo door into our second aircraft. 321 versus the competition, we've gone through this a bit, it's on our website. But this this airplane is the next shiny thing in the aviation business. We've seen Lufthansa and Japan Airlines committing a wholesale to this aircraft after we committed to the aircraft, so we feel very good about that. It competes very well against the 757 and beats the pants off the 737-800. In both cases, more volume and less fuel burn in both of those aircraft. 14 pallet positions gives us a tremendous airplane and as we have met with potential clients and walk them through the economics, they have gotten very, very excited about the ability for us to operate this aircraft for them. So, we're talking to some major package carriers here in the U.S., I think we'll have a contract here in the next few months. As I said, the major Latin airline, which we will announce in a few days is actually asked for as many as four of these airplanes from us to operate for them. And we're talking to other major Latin carriers, all of them very, very interested in this airplane. And as I said, we are confident that the first five of our 321 freighters have been placed with minimum monthly hourly guarantees that make this a very, very profitable aircraft and operation for us. This is just a comparison of the A321 versus the 757 and 737, you see that we effectively get 14% more containers than the 757 and I believe it's about 55%, more than the 737-800. So, this airplane is just absolutely the best-in-class narrowbody freighter that's out there. We'll talk in a moment, but we have 13 under firm lease, or LOIs with deposits and commitments for seven more from lessors. So, there are finding the feedstock for us to convert these airplanes, they've committed to us that they will find the airplanes, convert them and put them into our fleet. This is our delivery schedule. Two airplanes again, August, late August, early September for the first two, December for the third. We're working to get to more in the first half of 2023. We're working to move both of those to January, February, working with the conversion shops to do that. And then we have a very good schedule deliveries after that July, September, October, and then on through January. We'll fill in some of that as some more lines open up for the conversion, but this is a great delivery schedule for us. It allows us to absorb the airplanes, get the crews in place, get the contracts in place for us to do this. So, when we are operating 20 A321 freighters, we will be we will be extremely broad for them. Here's pictures of the first aircraft manufacturer serial number 1199 and 1438, both in progress. Doors have been cut. And these are on track to be delivered to us in late August. So, again, we feel very good about the two OEMs conversion shops that we're working with, they are best-in-class. They do this better than just about anybody on the planet. So, one of them is an Airbus affiliate that works with ST Engineering. The second is Precision, which works with ATSG is one of the premier air cargo carriers as well as conversion shops in the world. So, we've got two great names behind us, that will be providing us. Between the two of them, all 20 of our A321 freighters. So, we're in good partnership, we're in good hands with these two conversion shops. So, -- you talk--\nRyan Goepel: Sure. I think one of the things we've been trying to get across is the story and how to understand the story and what's the potential of the story. I know we've been a little bit vague on this, we figured we'd be pretty direct on today's call. When we look at modeling how we want to -- what we believe each passenger aircraft and each cargo aircraft can contribute to the company, these are kind of the targets that we work with and we're comfortable that this is what we'll hit over a 12-month period with each individual aircraft. So, if you're looking at a passenger aircraft, we expect to be $1.5 million and $2.2 million gross profit before overhead per passenger and $4.2 million to $5.5 million gross profit per overhead -- before overhead per cargo. These are impacted by basically utilization rates and obviously, charter rates. But those are the targets we were looking to get and we're starting to see. Obviously, you have to have an overhead to pay for this. By and large that's in place, we think we have enough of an overhead in place for the first 20 aircraft. We are staffed for 24/7 operation, which allows our operation center and our maintenance facilities or maintenance support to work around the clock which is a big step up which we worked through in the first quarter. So, we think with this fleet plan, I think we try to make the math as pretty straightforward as possible is where we see the opportunity being. I think with that I'll turn over to our favorite slide.\nEd Wegel: So, this with all the great news, we went from -- we got certified in the middle of pandemic, sent airplanes to Afghanistan, got several more aircraft on the certificate, got up to six aircraft in January. Now, working very quickly and closely to get to a breakeven and then into positive EBITDAR and fourth quarter profitability. We have tied up 20 of the most valuable aircraft in the world today, which is the A321 freighter. We will have 10 passenger aircraft by the end of this year, most of them signed up in contracts that are mostly recession proof. So, despite what happens in the economy, these aircraft will be flying and will be flying under good contracts, because they are with clients who have to fly no matter what the economic conditions are. So, in the face of all of that, this is what our management team faces is a share price that has effectively been cut in about 70% over this time period. I can tell you that we are working very hard to get the story out. We have tried in many ways with our firms and others to get his story out is the fact that we are on the OTC and institutional investors by and large cannot invest in us yet. It's holding us back. We are a bit frustrated, we put this out on our website, we put it out through all of the social media and we continue to get comments that nobody knows that we're putting this information out. So, we will continue to work in a positive manner to get our story out. We're working with a number of social media sites, we're working with the media companies and others to put this story out. The efforts of Howard Group have been phenomenal in getting the story out, but we do get a lot of criticism over our share price. You have a management team that is performing. You have a management team that has provided all the things that we have said that we would do and then some and I think that we've got some tremendous foundational elements in place now to build this airline to the 50 aircraft fleet that we project by the end of 2025. Just want to leave you with the comments again that we are doing everything we can to get this story out. We have been through probably four or five IR firms in Canada and the U.S., PR agencies, social media, and so forth. And we will continue to do that until we can finally break through and people understand the power of this company and the strength of our story. So, with that Grant, I'll turn it over to you. We'll take any questions that that are appropriate.\nGrant Howard: Thank you, Ryan. [Operator Instructions] And while we're waiting for those questions to come in, just a couple of comments on the presentation, running the numbers on your gross margin where you're doing $1 million, we talking about gross margin of $1.5 million to $2.2 million annualized for the passengers and $4.2 million to $5.5 million on the cargo. If you annualize Q4, the numbers I'm getting is that your gross margin, of course, that's gross margin would be $27.6 million to $38.5 million and for the Canadians, please remember, all the numbers here are U.S. So, if you look at a $90 million base case, the gross margin going profitable this year. Can you please send me information on any other company on a junior Canadian exchange that went from zero to over CAD100 million in just over a year, and it's throwing out these types of numbers and the track to future growth is as clear as it gets? Again, we got to goofy market and people are selling out of fear and they're not looking at the fundamentals. I keep harping on the stock, I keep buying and I will continue to do so because this is as clear as it gets. So, with that, I will stop ranting and we are getting some questions in now. So, the first one is from Ian McQueen says to date your operating margins are negative, which is no surprise given that you are building the business. In Q1 2022, costs were 129% of revenues with the big contributors being salaries, wages, and benefits of 32% of revenue, fuel pass through 20% contracted ground and aviation services at 18%, aircraft rent at 21% and other costs at 14%. If we look to 2023 plus, where do you expect operating margins to be? And what do you expect run rate costs as a percentage of revenue to be for the categories mentioned above?\nRyan Goepel: Thanks. You want me to do that one? I think one of the tough parts about -- I think the best guidance we can give is what we talked about on a per aircraft basis and then amount of overhead to maintain it. One of four example on aircraft fuel, right? If we do a full contract that cost is included, if we do an ACMI contract, it's not. So, as our mix changes of how much is ACMI versus full contract, that as a percentage of revenue will change. So, we have a projected gross margin or put that out yet. I figured we start with unit economics and then we'll build up to a macro model over the subsequent calls.\nGrant Howard: What is your current cash position and the monthly burn rate?\nRyan Goepel: I believe we -- Q1, we ended -- was over $11 million was on the balance sheet and our burn rate is getting -- is shrinking. I think it's below $1 million through the course of -- through the year and then it gets to cashflow positive, Q3, Q4. So, burn rate is becoming something that's not as something we -- it's not a burn anymore. It's going to be accretive.\nGrant Howard: Chris Moffat asks why was in 627 park for a few weeks?\nRyan Goepel: That was actually parked, doing a C check. So, every 18 months, aircrafts have to go through -- or two years they have to go through a two-year check. They take between 14 and 18 days. So, 627 was at an MRO facility being overhauled. Right now 626 is there and then 276 will follow straight after. So, we have three aircraft that are going through what we call C checks or two-year checks. So, that's why it was there.\nGrant Howard: John Chamberlin [ph] quite serious, do we have a dedicated PIO for the company? I don't know if that's Public Information Officer or what, are there any thoughts on having that in place? My experience the PR firms only responded to [indiscernible]?\nEd Wegel: We have -- Ryan and I effectively serve as the Public Information Officers. Our CMO, Mark Salvador primarily is the -- is the primary senior officer overseeing our social media sites, our website, and so forth. So, we maintain a very lean senior management team here. In the face of the fact that we can't -- or we won't be able to move up of the OTC and move up to NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange until we raise some additional capital and get profitable. No matter what we do and I will say -- I will underline that, no matter what we do, no matter what we say, no matter what we do in a press release, the negativity about what we say or what we do is prevalent. I guess, because no one in Canada has seen an actual airline like this, as you say, Grant, operate on a junior exchange and actually do what they say that they're going to do. But we put out on LinkedIn, on Twitter, on Facebook, on our webpages through press releases, we put out all of the information that anyone needs to determine whether they want to invest in this company. We are public, which means they can pull all of our public documents off of the free SEC website. So, there is plenty of opportunity and plenty of ways for anyone to access information about us. A PIO, which -- would just merely put out more press releases, we found them to be of limited value, frankly. So, what we have decided to do is that we are going to outperform every other airline like us in the market and eventually someone will notice. And it won't be because of a press release or a Tweet, or a post on LinkedIn, it will be because someone will wake up and say, My Lord, they have 20 of these freighters coming, My Lord, they have 10 passenger aircraft, look at the contracts that they have, someone will eventually wake up and pass the word on this. We've tried everything, nothing works, we will continue in a positive way to do that. But until someone, some people start to wake up and understand what we have here and not just read our press release, but understand what's in the press release, we're not going to get any movement.\nGrant Howard: They're certainly NASDAQ, do you still believe you'll be able to uplift by the end of the year? And do we still need a minimum bid of $2?\nRyan Goepel: So, I think we've said our line on NASDAQ or NYSE is always have positive earnings and multiple quarters of revenue growth, have cargo on the cargo active and under contract to generating revenue. I think when you when you see that, it's -- we would hope that the share price would reflect it and we can address it there. So, I think, external factors are external factors. And obviously there's some frustration on how that impacts us. But on the same token, we can control what we do here and what we perform. And I think with that performance, it will take care of itself in the sense of eventually the comps and the comparisons and all will sort itself out. So, we just need to keep delivering the revenue, deliver the $90 plus million, deliver three cargo aircraft by the end of the year, 10 passenger, and $200 million in contracts and more. And we believe the share price will reflect it and make the up-listing pretty simple process.\nEd Wegel: Yes, we have said until we're blue in the face that we are not affected by the oil price or largely not affected by it because our clients pay that. And most of our clients have to fly. So, they will pay that. no matter how many times we say that when oil goes up, our stock price goes down because people panic. So, it's an airline and they're affected by oil prices. Despite the fact that we've said it 73 times, they still don't get it. So, if someone has an idea or suggestion for how we can say that the 74th time and get through to anyone, we would love to have that suggestion.\nGrant Howard: [indiscernible] One or two more questions on an up-list. From Chris Moffat, how does GlobalX retain its pilots and staff and keep them from moving to other airlines after training?\nEd Wegel: Well, it's quite simple. We take very good care of them. The pilots that were getting, particularly those in the left seat are coming to us with 10,000 to 12,000 to 15,000 hours of pilot in command time. They're coming out of the Middle East, where they've flown for a number of years. They're coming out of Asia, they're coming out of China, even some coming out of Latin America. They want to live in Miami, they want this kind of lifestyle. They don't -- at their age, they don't want to go to the majors because they'll be in the right seat and they'll be unreserved for the next 10 years. So, they want to come to us. Our wages are comparable. In fact, they're exactly the same as what Allegiant pays. Allegiant has 160 airplanes and we have six, and we pay the same rates as Allegiant does. We take good care of our people. We've got a 401(K). We've got the employee stock purchase plans. We've talked to our people, we take them to lunch, we take them to dinner. We make them feel like they're part of the family here. And we are having a growing number of captains who are bringing some of their former colleagues from overseas to work with us and others. So, we feel very, very good about our pilot group. We've had less attrition on a percentage basis than just about any airline out there that I can -- that I've spoken to. And so we take our people seriously. We take our culture seriously. And we've created a work environment where they want to stay, even though they might make more money at one of the ULCCs or major, they want to be here because of quality of life.\nGrant Howard: Chris Moffat again. When are you planning on breaking ground on the proposed Fort Lauderdale hangars/office?\nEd Wegel: We expect to have we expect to have final approval from the Broward County Aviation Department by late June, early July. We've got to do the final design, which is in process now for the building and determine how much office space and perhaps training space we want to put there. And then depending upon how much preparatory work needs to be done in terms of mitigation of the land, we expect right now to break ground sometime in the third quarter of this year. It's fully finance and just barring the final regulatory approvals and the mitigation of any environmental issues, which we think will be minimal, we'll be ready to go and break ground.\nGrant Howard: Question from anonymous about Flugy, if there are any updates on that idea?\nRyan Goepel: So, Flugy is the platform, the travel platform, we call it's a very direct travel company. We had announced our agreement with Soho House, we've done one trial, we did one event with them, we're working to schedule four or five more. The next steps, the platform has been effectively built out. We're working on putting the resources together to grow the customer base and see what we can do to monetize it. So, we really wanted to get to a proof-of-concept, which we believe we've done, we want to get technology to a platform where it's usable, which we've done, we wanted to do some test flights, which we've done. And now the next part is in Q3, we're looking to expand it to beyond one customer and worked out all their groups and then hopefully get to the point where we're doing 10 to 15 flights a month through Flugy.\nEd Wegel: So, we've got one strategic partner now, as Ryan said, with Soho House, which is a great brand to partner with. We're looking for other strategic partners, we started to talk to some of the OTAs, the online travel agencies, some of the conglomerates that own a number of online travel agencies. And let me say that we were getting some very interesting responses and proposals on working with them along with Flugy. We're primarily -- we are a charter airline, running an OTA or online travel agency which is effectively is not our core business. We do want to maintain a piece of this business. We think that we can monetize a piece of this business and get all the capital we need to grow that particular division of our company into a major player in the online travel space.\nGrant Howard: Kenneth C [ph] is asking about the eVTOLs, that's the vertical take vertical takeoff vehicles, the LOI announcement is exciting. The vehicles look incredible, especially the below normal side, but to what degree does CargoX plan to utilize these? Could you provide a little more insight and then he says incredible work from the team so far?\nEd Wegel: Yes, the eVTOL concept is something that we wanted to be involved in early on. There's a number of players out there, designing and building and manufacturing the eVTOL aircraft. We selected Eve because it is a division of Embraer. Embraer is a major aircraft, original equipment manufacturer or OEM. They've got tremendous experience in building airplanes. They don't build airplanes in their garage, they build them in real facilities. They've got real engineers and they've got real money behind them. They've just gone public. Eve has gone public with a $600 million stack and is got a great valuation. We believe that is the right eVTOL application for Miami-Dade and Broward County. We intend to use that aircraft in a number of ways to move passengers from off of our charter flights to Port Miami where they can get on cruise ships or of Miami Airport or Fort Lauderdale Airport to go down into the Keys, the West style of Arata and so forth, that's a perfect application for this big old aircraft. As well we can move our crews back and forth between the airports in South Florida and we're going to be doing more and more flights out of Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, even over on the Westcoast of Florida, Sarasota and Fort Myers. So, this aircraft by the time it is fully developed and manufactured and certified in 2026, will have the range with its batteries for us to be able to do that. So -- and we're working now with Miami-Dade County on developing a eVTOL plan. We also have partnered now with [indiscernible], which is a worldwide expert in construction of airports and heliports and the sorts of facilities that are needed for this type aircraft. So, we wanted to get in early, make sure we had an order position for these aircraft. The aircraft won't be delivered for another four years. We serve on the advisory board for Eve. We've been giving them our thoughts on how the aircraft to be used here in Miami-Dade, working with Miami-Dade County government as well. Looking where we can build heliports or V-ports as they're called, all the way down to Key West so that we can provide to our clients who want to fly into South Florida and additional service which is to put some of their best customers on these eVTOL aircraft to get to cruise ships, to get to destination spots in the Keys, to get to their hotels on Brickell or on Miami Beach, or all the way up to Fort Lauderdale. So, it is an absolute extension of the service that we currently provide to our clients, absolute extension of what we do at GlobalX.\nGrant Howard: Questions on NASDAQ on the Eve planes which has just been answered and from Axel Braun. Is there a possibility or are you considering participating in conferences such as Wolfe Global Transportation & Industrials Conference this year?\nRyan Goepel: So, we are in conversations about that. I've done two conferences in the last month. So, we are participating in conferences. We are talking to Wolfe and some of the other brokers about participating in that. I think part of that is us getting to the size that we're getting to, we're getting on the radars and so we are going to be active in the conference community.\nEd Wegel: One of the things that we'll be announcing soon to take the thunder away from this release is the senior airline analyst at Cowen & Company who's done a number of broadcasts with us, Helane Becker, who is one of the top ranked airline analysts on Wall Street is going to be joining the Advisory Board of GlobalX here shortly. And we anticipate that she'll join the full Board when she retires fully from Cowen in about the next year. Helane has been a great supporter of ours, has opened a number of doors for us on Wall Street. And now in an official Advisory Board capacity, we believe that she'll be able to help us to get into some of the conferences where we will be punching well above our weight because we're still a small airline and we don't get invited to those kinds of conferences. We believe that she'll open up those doors and we know that we'll be in some of those conferences later this year.\nGrant Howard: Some email questions from Mike Roberts. I think all of them had been addressed except for how was the ground handling business progressing?\nRyan Goepel: Yes, so we currently sell-perform here at Miami, Miami-Dade we're getting -- what we want to do is get good at it. We're getting the processes in place, we had a little bit of a slow start, but we've managed to put the right people in place now. They're performing excellent. I think it's a very efficient operation for us. And then eventually will allow -- we'll be able to use the expertise we've gained to piggyback on some of our work around the country. So, we want to get the processes, people, and procedures down to very efficient operations so we have something to pick going forward.\nEd Wegel: So, just to expand on that a bit. So, here at MIA, Miami International Airport, we have our own ground handling operation in place called Ground Team. The result of that is that we've reduced our ground handling costs here at MIA by about a third, while providing much better service because Ground Team obviously is completely under our control. We're now expanding that, so we're going to be adding fueling capability here, we'll fuel our own aircraft here at MIA, which will save us money even as we pencil out all of the costs of that. Plus it gives us greater flexibility in our fueling. We are often the second or third cousin, when it comes to getting fuel because of the big presence of American Airlines and some of the big ULCC that are here at MIA. So, we're getting our own fueling trucks, which will save us money and reduce our reduce our handling times. And as well, we're looking to expand as Ryan said, Ground Team, to the Westcoast of Florida. We're looking at Tampa, where we operate now to Havana and we'll probably expand that operation. So, it makes sense for us to have our own people there. We've invited -- we've been invited to put a ground handling operation in St. Petersburg, Florida, which is a growing airport and we'll probably put it there. But just in the case of the fueling operations at MIA, the airport here has asked us if we could fuel other airlines now, because of a difficult situation for fuelers and the number of fuelers here at MIA. So, we're going to provide for ourselves, and as well, we're going to fuel other airlines and we expect to make money doing that.\nGrant Howard: Here's just one more. Certainly there's been a lot of controversy in the U.S. It's a very political issue, the problems at your southern border with immigration. And Mike Roberts, again, is asking if Title 42 comes to an end, is that going to impact your government contracts?\nEd Wegel: No, it won't. Personally, I don't think Title 42 will end if it does. And there's still the number of illegals that come across the border are so large and the people that we transport back are being transported back for reasons other than the fact that they've crossed the border. So, that will not end. And the need for these services -- we have been told by the government will increase from -- they'll almost double the number of aircraft that they need in this program over the next several years. So, we feel pretty confident about that business, it will be run under our Capital Airlines subsidiary. We believe that we provide a very, very efficient service for the government, one that is much needed. But we also do things in that contract, such as moving miners to other parts of the U.S., so that they can re-linkup with their families, which we think is a very, very good thing for us to be doing. So, no, we don't see an impact either positively or negatively. We just believe and understand that from our government contacts that this business will continue to grow, particularly in a recession where the recession impacts all of the Americas.\nGrant Howard: With that, gentlemen, I believe that was the last question because nothing else has come in. So, we're going to wrap. Again, congratulations, you're doing a great job. You and the team got a stock that's trading at above current market cap is about half of what you're forecasting is your base case revenues this year. So, we'll let that speak for itself and perhaps the market will have an epiphany and we'll see a reversal on the stock price. Again thank you, Ed. Thank you, Ryan.\nEd Wegel: Thanks Grant. Thanks for the platform. Thanks for allowing us to use it today. Everyone, have a great day.\nGrant Howard: Thanks to everyone."}, {"symbol": "JETMF", "quarter": 4, "year": 2021, "date": "2022-03-31 19:39:06", "content": "Operator: Well, I think we're going to get underway here as participants are still coming in and loading. So welcome, everybody, to this Management Webinar Update from Global Crossing Airlines. I'm Grant Howard. And we have Ed Wegel who's the CEO of GlobalX and Ryan Goepel, the CFO. And I just want to say, gentlemen, to you and your team, results that were released this morning are spectacular, and encouraged me to go buy more stock personally. And we're getting some positive response in the market. So with that, Ed, and Ryan, I'm going to turn it over to you.\nEd Wegel : Thanks, Grant. Good afternoon. Good morning, everyone. Grant, we really appreciate this microphone and this platform to be able to discuss for our 2021 results and our review of first quarter of 2022, and some trends that we see in our airline, for the balance of 2022. We are extremely bullish on our growth prospects and our overall prospects for 2022. We'll get into that, when Ryan talks us through some of our results and the growth that we project for this year. But again, we're very bullish. Let\u2019s go to slide. 2021, a successful launch. And that launch set the stage for the growth that we are seeing in 2022. Some of you may have seen we were featured in Airliner World Magazine, really great article, we can send anyone the link that to it, or you can Google it, great article, it's very picturesque and some good background on our airline and what we're achieving. So encourage everyone to take a look at that. We're very proud of that. And we're getting more and more press and media increase to do interviews with our senior management, take pictures of our airplanes. So we're getting, we're getting attention. And that's all also the good. So we think we know that this is a highly attractive investment opportunity. Quarter four revenue for 2021 was $11.2 million, first quarter 2022, three months of \u201920 or the first quarter will exceed 2021 revenue, will have revenue in quarter one of about $14.3 million. So that's a nice bump. We expect revenue to exceed $90 million in 2022. That's a conservative number based on what we're seeing. But we want to under promise and over deliver. Half of that has already been secured today under long term contracts. And we're confident in the balance of that, based on what we're seeing in the market based on the reaction of our current clients and potential future clients to our service to our aircraft to our people and to our performance. We have $161 million in long-term contracts. And LOIs secured with deposits signed in Q1 for 2022 and beyond. That's a very big number. Yearend cash at the end of 2021 was $8 million. Aircraft deposits on top of that about $2.6 million. Forecast profitability in Q3, we'll have a very solid robust Q2, we will seek to up list the NASDAQ later in 2022. As you know, our S1 was deemed effective by the US SEC in February. That's a good base document for us to potentially modify and amend later this year so that we could do a real public offering in the latter half of this year. Our current market cap unfortunately $53 million. We believe that isn't a very attractive price point for investors to get in to the stock. Let's talk about our current status, I bring you up to speed on the number of aircraft and what we've got going. So currently five A320, one A321 on the certificate, total of six airplanes. We are adding over April, May and early June, three more airplanes, A319 and A320 and A321. The A319 will go into government contract work and it's fully booked 150 hours a month. A320 will be as a sister ship to our 2x Alaska, A320s with full Wi Fi capabilities. We're converting that to a 68 seat, first class, and all first class seat configuration. And that airplane has been solidly booked for the balance of the year. Many-many clients in the US charter market need an airplane like that and there is scarcity of that product. And we're taking an A321 on extremely favorable terms, this airplane will eventually be converted to cargo in about two years, and the lease rates on that for us until then, extremely favorable to us. That airplane, the A321, very popular amongst our clients, our current A321, we've just we'll talk about this in a moment, but we've just signed a deal for that airplane to be converted to cargo in mid-2023. So that that will be added to our list of cargo aircraft. On the cargo side, as we've talked before, we move quickly to tie up a number of A321 freighter aircraft, knowing that this would be the best-in-class narrowbody freighter in the cargo market. Since we started the process of acquiring these aircraft under firm lease or from LOIs with deposits. Lufthansa has committed to the airplane and said, in fact that it is the best-in-class narrowbody freighter in the market. And they are trying to get as many of them as they can as fast as they can. Japan Airlines have said the same thing. And we are seeing more and more interest in our freighters. We'll talk about leases or contracts that have been signed in a moment. But on top of the 18, we now have another five A321 freighters in various stages of LOI negotiation, so we expect to have as many as 23 A321 freighters under firm agreements for delivery over the next 27 months. So it will be a very quick delivery schedule for this airplane. And we are extremely confident that we will place all of these airplanes very quickly in this booming cargo market. Our team itself now consists of 63 pilots, including 20 in training who will finish their training over the course of April. And we've got two more classes starting in April, for a total of another 15 pilots. We've got 120 flight attendants, we are opening bases for flight attendants in Texas. We're adding to our flight attendant padres in Atlantic City, and in Las Vegas because of the demand that we're seeing out of the Northeast and out of the west. And in fact, we have all three bases now operating Miami, Atlantic City and Las Vegas. And we are starting to assign and open up those bases for pilots to be assigned to those bases. So they become fully operational with both flight crews. And eventually as we add more aircraft we will have aircraft permanently stationed in those cities to allow for us to access the charter markets on the West Coast of the US as well as the Northeast. I'll turn to Ryan now to who run us through our revenue and operating numbers.\nRyan Goepel: Yes. As Ed highlighted on the earlier slide, our Q4 revenue was $11.2 million, operating 1,293 block ours, and we reported a loss of $4.5 million in Q4. Keeping in mind about $1.8 million of that was cost associated with training, aircraft acquisition, share compensation and S-1 completion. For the full year, Revenue was $14.3 million, we effectively did $3.1 million in Q3, and so we grew from $3.1 million to $11.2 million. We operate at 1,679 block hours over the course of the year. The loss of $19 million includes $12.9 million for costs associated with getting certified. And it also includes in that number a $2.7 million loss for warrant revaluation. At the end of the year, we had a cash balance of $8 million plus an additional $2.6 million in aircraft deposits, which you'll see on the balance sheet. Going to the outlook. For the outlook, we see something -- we see a strong trajectory continuing to Q3 to Q4 is going to continue so in Q1 over those three months, we will exceed all of 2021 revenue, which was a five month period. We believe we're going to average 30% revenue growth every quarter for 2022. We expect revenue to exceed $90 million in 2022 with half secure today under long-term contracts. And we believe the addition of the 321F in Q4 will help accelerate this growth and revenue, steadily sales growth but revenue growth into 2023 as we onboard more cargo aircrafts. Looking at the contracts we announced $161 million in long-term contracts and LOI secured in Q1 for 2022 and beyond. Of this there's a number we want to highlight, a US government contract for 4,950 hours in 2022 and then 9,360 hours in both 2023 and 9,360 hours in 2024. We renewed our Cuba contract which we applied daily, we're looking to increase that which represents another 960 hours in 2022 on top of the 800 hours already contracted, the collegiate travel and fan travel 170 hours. Well, that might seem like a small number that was effectively March Madness and occurred over 10 days. So that's a great example of where some of our repeat business that happens at certain times of the year. As you'll recall, in Q4, we did a lot of work for the goal for the bowl games. We got March Madness, and I think there's other periods throughout the year, we're college kind of spikes. On the LOI side, we signed a 1,600 hour contract for the summer of the major European tour operator. We signed on the cargo side, an LOI with a major airline operator out of South America, as it relates to 600 minimum hours in 2022, and 2,400 hour minimum, in both 2023 and 2024. And we also signed an LOI with a Caribbean cargo logistics operator for 390 hours of 2022. And expect 2,400 hours in both 2023 and 2024. This is just an indication of how serious and how strong the cargo market is and how excited we are to get pushed into that move into it. Think of that, I'll move on to Ed who will talk about the fleet row.\nEd Wegel : Sure and to fund that growth as you know, you've seen from the press release, we did a $6 million debenture offering you might want to discuss some key points.\nRyan Goepel: Sure. So yes, one of the key points of raising cash liquidity is always concerned with any airline, we did not want to raise equity at these prices, we think were grossly undervalued. And we were able to get investors to agree, we raised $6 million on a term note over two years, it's really meant to be a bridge until we get to an up list. But it provides us the capital to acquire the aircraft we need to acquire and achieve the growth rates we need to achieve and will achieve in 2022.\nEd Wegel: And as part of that you may have seen in the press release that the lead investor was Alterna Capital. This is a tremendous firm, they have a number of aircraft. We're talking to them about leasing arrangements. In fact, the A319 is coming from them. They have been very, very supportive of GlobalX, and would like to do more with us. And we are very happy to attract a fund of their nature and of their character and have their integrity to the airline. And we expect to do more and more with them as time goes on. But as Ryan said, this is effectively a bridge gives us the cash that we need to ensure that we can execute and bring aircraft onto the certificate without having to sell equity at these prices. And we'll readjust to what we hope will be an offering later this year. So very, very pleased with that debenture financing. We've got very friendly investors in that all supportive of us, and gives us a good base for us to execute the 2022 plan. So as we look at our risk profile, and our fleet build out, our eventual, our goal is to eventually get to 50:50 split between passenger and cargo revenue. We'll do that by adding aircraft, of course. We're very bullish on the cargo market. We're very bullish on the airlines and other logistics companies that have already approached us about having us fly for them. But as you see here over the course of 2022 through 2025, we will add both passenger and cargo aircraft with the goal of getting through a 50:50 split between those two over the next three years. As we said before, in previous webinars, we saw that the airlines that had cargo capability survived and actually grew a bit through the pandemic. The cargo capabilities, provided them a good cushion against the loss of passenger revenue. So we saw that we learned from that and we early on targeted the A321 freighter as a major focal point for growth. And we, that is now starting to bear fruit which we'll talk about in a moment. But we've already signed contracts for essentially the first two aircraft. And we have three or four parties who are angling to get the next two aircraft. So we're in very good position with our cargo fleet development. We also wanted to diversify our revenue streams. So as we talked about before, we're signing long term contracts. And currently in the case with the US government and with our tour operator, the largest OFAC tour operator to Cuba. We fly Miami- Havana for them and also Tampa, Havana. We are expanding to Houston, Havana and also eventually New York to Havana as traffic opens up, they also would like us to fly to the provinces, which are the other cities in Cuba, that take commercial aircraft down the way  in Santa Clara and Santiago. And so that will increase another eight flights per week when those provinces open up. So Cuba long term, it's important for us, we have the best partner, who was OFAC approved to fly to Cuba, and we feel very comfortable with our position there. We have performed extremely well for the US government in their contracts. In any number of contracts, we've flown to NASA scientists to Guyana, and we've flown other contracts out of Texas. And as we know, we also flew to Afghanistan early on in our development, the US government is very, very happy with us, we have been told that we are the best operator for them on certain of their contracts, and they are looking to expand that relationship with us. Short term but repeat business, and we get repeat business because we perform well. Our crews looked good, our aircraft looked good, our aircraft are clean. We operate on time and reliably. So we are seeing repeat business come to us. As Ryan mentioned, we perform exceedingly well for the NCAA through March Madness. And so we will be getting more and more business from them. And we did some work for football and basketball this year, or 2021 into 2022. A lot of those clients are already re-upping with us for the September to December timeframe for football, and then into basketball. And that 68 seat, A320 will be very, very popular amongst a number of division one basketball teams, we're already starting to sign some of those, our ad hoc business is important to us. And while those come to us, they're one flight two flight situations, they're very important for us again, we perform very, very well and a number of those that we have performed ad hoc for groups like music, travel, and other groups around the country have already come back to us and said that they want to book us again, again because of our reliability on time performance and the way our aircraft look, and the way we operate, so that they become a smaller percentage of our business over time. But it's important because a lot of that comes sort of at the last minute. And so we are able to drive higher returns higher margins with our assets and that type of flying. And of course cargo, major initiative for us. It really makes us excited about 2022. And we will get certified with the first aircraft, which will be delivered August 19 of this year. We will then finish up some certification requirements with the FAA once that aircraft arrives, and we have targeted that airplane and a second airplane which will be delivered two or three weeks after the first airplane, for October 1 start date for the two contracts that we have put in place. So all-in-all, 40% of our revenue is on long-term contracts. And we think that percentage will grow. That gives us a great base of business, a great foundation, to cover fixed costs and to be able to budget and model our business. And about two thirds of our contracts fall into the first two buckets, long term contracts as well as short term repeat business, business that we know will be there every year. And it is hours we have to perform on time reliably and be on top of our game. And we will get that, we will continue to see that business come to us. So 40% long term, two thirds long term or repeat. This is a great foundation for us as we move forward. So in summary, again, resilience and diverse model, cargo and passenger, we are still seeing assets being offered to us A320s, A321s, and even more so A319 at very, very attractive lease rates and terms under the lease. And we think that condition in the market will continue for at least the next year. And so we are moving to line up airplanes and make sure that we take advantage of that pricing now on track for the October launch of our cargo revenue services with the first two airplanes first two A321 freighters and that fleet we think will grow to 25 airplanes in cargo by certainly by 2025 could be earlier than that. And our major long-term contracts provide a solid revenue foundation for us, which gives us confidence and allows us to then acquire more aircraft that we can put out for ad hoc and other business. So again, we are very bullish on this business. We're very bullish on our growth in 2022. We see strong growth in our passenger business, we are already seeing demand for our A321 freighters, which gives us great confidence as we move through the balance of this year and into next year. So we, again, we're very bullish, we have very attractive investment opportunity. We have good investors behind us now with the $6 million of debenture financing, we are prepared to do more if we require it. And we are positioned to do a major raise and up list for this company later this year. So grant with that, I will turn it to you. And we're happy and ready to take any questions.\nOperator: \nUnidentified Company Representative : And while we're waiting for more of the questions to come in, Ryan, we were chatting a few days ago, and you had an interesting perspective on, I guess, the difference between the US market and the Canadian market. And the fact that you felt that the pickup in travel in the US was probably six to nine months ahead of what we're seeing in Canada. And you related a story about Miami International Airport, which I thought was rather intriguing.\nRyan Goepel: Yes, last Friday, as was the start of spring break, if you had attempted to park your car at Miami Airport, because every parking garage was full, and people had to Uber home to, had to drive home and Uber back. And so Miami Airport is beyond 2019 levels. I think if you look at the domestic travel in the US, it's at levels pre, higher than pre-COVID. And I think especially with the rules coming off in Canada with the required for vaccinations coming before pre departure, you'll start seeing that open up as we saw down here. So while it may feel for the Canadian investors that airlines are still a struggle. I think the perspective from that from the south is significantly different.\nUnidentified Company Representative : That I can appreciate having just returned from California on March 27, the documentation and rigmarole that was required to get across the border.\nRyan Goepel: It was a deterrent.\nUnidentified Company Representative : It definitely was d deterrent. So let's get into some of the question, first from Jerry Kaiser, has inflation affected profitability.\nRyan Goepel: Hey, Jerry, thank you, Jerry. I know Jerry has been involved since the very beginning, our models a cost plus model. So in so much is when you see inflation as it impacted significantly, the fuel prices, all our pricing is on a cost plus, so we recover that difference that's passed through to the customer. So well, inflation is always going to be a matter our biggest asset, our aircraft are at fixed rates. So we have that protection there. And with a cost plus model, we have the ability to pass on or any of those costs to customers, which some of the scheduled carriers won't have or do not have in their pricing. And so its impact on us is less than you would expect.\nUnidentified Company Representative : We have Sam McDevitt and this is directly to Ed. What is the current status of the loaner agreement plane from Smart Link?\nEd Wegel : Smart Link is actually very full in Europe. And so we decided that we bring on additional aircraft to meet our needs. We will probably send an aircraft or have an aircraft brought from Smart Link this winter. And we're talking to them about that. We are sending two airplanes to Europe this summer to operate for TUI, which is the largest tour operator, Smart Link is also providing aircraft to TUI will probably back up each other's operations as needed to in order to fulfill that requirement. But we'll take an airplane from Smart Link this coming winter based on the demand that we're seeing. And we will probably send airplanes to Smart Link this time next year as their business picks up again. And they've already announced that they're going to be at 60 airplanes by the summer. So they're doing extremely well. We have a very great relationship with them. They're helping us with all of our aircraft deliveries in terms of inspections and helping us with looking at engines and other components. So very, very strong relationship with Smart Link. We met with them a few weeks ago with the big aircraft conference and we're talking about doing more and more things together. So it's a great symbiotic relationship we have with them.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Speaking of Europe from Actual Braun, he is wondering if GlobalX is planning on flying to Europe at some point.\nEd Wegel : With the current airplanes, the narrowbodies, it's more difficult. We have had charter requests, and we will be flying charters to Keflavik Iceland and believe it or not to Greenland, we have a number of flights into Greenland for one of the smaller cruise lines. We're working on what's called our North Atlantic operation specifications. We'll be certifying that with the FAA, later in April, which allows us to fly on certain routes, the blue spruce routes over to Europe, it's something that we talk about, we get charter requests often to fly to Europe, we're probably not as efficient for some tour operators as getting a widebody aircraft. But we've been asked by a major studio, movie studio to fly a couple of flights to London for them. We're looking at that. So we're, it's on our radar, it's not on our immediate list of things that we want to get done. And I would guess that we will eventually start to fly there on some regular basis. If we acquire A330s, which is something we are looking at for 2023. A330 is a widebody aircraft, plenty of range, you can fly for 13 hours, and then any point in the US to Europe is available to us. We haven't finished any analysis or presented that to the board. But it is something that we are looking at, and we think is definitely something in our future to add widebody aircraft to this utility.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Ben Accardo of Shark Bend. What happened to JET.B shares when you folks up list to NASDAQ? Additional comment, great job on the success so far proud shareholder.\nRyan Goepel: So again, the JET.B share exists because you can't have more than 25% of your voting stock be in foreign hands, the 75% have to be in US and so much as we've through all of our Investor Relations activities, and a lot of the buying of shares. We've seen a lot of buying from US investors. So we're getting closer to that number. I think with an up list depending on how structure thing could look at collapsing it as long as we're in compliance with TOD, because we don't want to go in violation of that. That defeats the purpose of creating it.\nEd Wegel : But in general, we see those JET.B shares going away over some period of time.\nRyan Goepel: Absolutely. Yes, absolutely.\nEd Wegel : This is year to 18 months, we think that they're gone so.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Okay. On the project of NASDAQ from Daniel Beausoleil. What is the minimum share price to list on NASDAQ? And do you anticipate having to do a share consolidation followed by an IPO for the up list.\nRyan Goepel: So our mindset with a NASDAQ or NYC, as we seek to do it up list is to come to the market with four quarters of revenue growth, show profit and show cargo aircraft on the certificate. If you were to look at that, and you put us against any other value metric of any other operator, our share price today even should be in the $6 to $7 range, which is more than enough for the NASDAQ up list. So the goal is to get the value in the stock today and deal with the up list later.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Fair. And on that I would encourage folks to go look at some of the recent research on cargo jet. And the valuations that cargo jet is getting in Canada. And I think the last target price was 275 and go look at the multiples and then backtrack a bit on global as to where it's going. For Daniel Mar, I expect fuel costs to be significantly elevated for several years. Can you comment on how this is affecting the business and your expectation going forward?\nEd Wegel : Yes, let me talk about that. So we've seen over the last 20 years is several spikes in fuel price and the price of oil. I remember in 2008 when it got to $120 Goldman Sachs said it was going to $250 and it went to $30. So no one knows where the price of oil is going to go. When you get to a certain point, there's demand destruction and the price comes down. So in my view, having lived with oil prices over the last 40 years, we will see the price of oil come down. It does not affect us, as Ryan said previously, because all of our contracts provide a base fuel price and then a surcharge that equals the difference. If we pay more for the fuel at the time of the charter. Over time, I think people will adjust to the higher price of oil I think it settles back in the $70 to $80 range where we can operate comfortably. And so can the scheduled carriers. As the world settles down again, a bit and the Saudis need more money. And maybe there's a Republican administration again in a few years, the price of oil will come down. But again, I remember Goldman Sachs pounding the table in 2008, saying the oil is going to $250 and it went to $30. So the brightest guys in the room got it wrong. Everyone will get it wrong again, this time, they will do lots of things before it settles down. But when it settles down, it will be much lower than where it is today.\nRyan Goepel: I think Rex Tillerson said it best when he was the CEO of Exxon, asked where you think the price of oil will be in three years. He said somewhere between $1 and $200. And that's about as accurate as I think I can be. So it's a part of the business dynamic. Again, we are insulated, largely because we're on a cost plus, or we do not have fuel in our pricing, which is one of the reasons our model I think is should be so attractive for investors is that's a huge risk factor that just really doesn't exist for our business that exists for other scheduled carriers. And I think shows an opportunity on how you can participate in the travel space without taking that risk.\nEd Wegel : And if you look at air fares in the US, which have been risen dramatically, as we came out of COVID, the fact that load factors are exceeding pre-COVID levels when fuel was down in the 50s. And as Ryan says, you can't get a parking space at NIA airport. People are adjusting to that price, they need to travel, they want to travel, and they will pay for it. But having said that, again, the price of oil is going to come down.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Maybe on that point about being pushed in from the rising cost of oil. And when you look at the types of deals you've been able to do to secure aircraft, historically and into the future, I'm not sure that the majority of the investing public yet appreciate the risk mitigation that you've built into the business. And the future impact that will have on your margin.\nRyan Goepel: If you were to look at that $161 million in long-term contracts, none of those contracts are impacted by fuel. When you look at all those contracts, and those flight hours, none of those flight hours are impacted by how many seats we sell. They purchased the entire aircraft. So if you look at those contracts, most of them if not all of them have minimum guarantees for a month utilization. So if you think about the three big risks with an airline distribution risk, fuel risk, and utilization risk, those are all mediated by signing these contracts. So I think one of the things we kind of, I say, when I talk to investors on the phone, at some point the market is going to believe us that this business is real, and that we're doing it. I don't know if Today's a day but at some point they will.\nUnidentified Company Representative : You folks are getting there, you're doing a hell of a job. Mike Harrison, the press release indicated that you anticipate being profitable by Q3. Will you be cash flow positive earlier than that?\nRyan Goepel: Thanks, Mike. Mike, again, another person has been with us since the beginning. We, I think on a quarterly basis we should be, it will be. It'll depend on how much growth and whether aircraft acquisitions come in, I think on operational basis, yes. As we make investments in additional aircraft, obviously, that's a use of cash. So the burn is significantly reduced even now, going forward.\nEd Wegel : So we're doing things like we talked about disassembling the A320 aircraft, which we acquired with GA Telesis. That aircraft is now being disassembled and the parts are starting to be shipped to us. We're harvesting lots of great parts off of there, we have to do a landing gear swap later this year that's coming off of that airplane, and we\u2019re putting a bunch of components on the shelf and a bunch of components and parts that don't fail as often as others that are not as important to us. We're selling those off, reducing the cost of the airframe to us. And so we're reducing the cost of maintenance through activities like that. Our F level 5 FTD training device will be fully operational by midday that will start to help reduce our training costs because we use much less expensive simulator than the full flight simulator. We're doing lots of things like that, to reduce our costs and to ensure that we are as efficient as possible. Now, having said that, we're putting a lot of money back into training and development of the infrastructure here at the airline to support additional aircraft. So our board and our investors have said to us, or our major investors have said to us, we understand that you need to invest in this business, that's what we want you to do, get the revenues up, develop the infrastructure, get the aircraft, and additional capital is required, we will make sure that you have that, so that you can build that infrastructure to attain the growth that you have in 2022, what you're projecting onward, so we have a great investor, major investor groups backing us, we've got a great board that understands what we are doing. And we are driving top line growth, to gain market share, get airplanes out to work, and develop our infrastructure. So that that requires cash. But we're investing long term in this business.\nRyan Goepel: And I think when you think of the scale, and I still keep thinking people fail to see kind of the scale, look at some of our competitors, like our other operators, such as Sun Country, Atlas, ATSG, Cargo Jet, all operating between more than 30, 40, 50 aircraft, which is what we're targeting. They're all valued in the billions, right? And we're $50 million. So we're building a business for five years from now is scalable to that size. And you can't do that with nothing. And I think we've done a pretty good job deploying capital today. I think if you think about the amount of money we've invested less than $20 million, and we've created a company that can generate $100 million in revenue in 2022, and beyond is pretty impressive.\nUnidentified Company Representative : And again, to the aspect of risk mitigation, you're not carrying a bunch of debt.\nRyan Goepel: No.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Marty McConnell. Will your cargo business be ACMI with fuel costs accepted?\nEd Wegel : Yes, full ACMI. So we do not take the risk of selling cargo or trying to move it on the ground or get it to the airport, we don't do any of that. We offer the airplane, the cargo airlines the same way that we offer our passenger airplanes on ACMI. So major airlines that contracts with us long term for that airplane, as we will have a major cargo operation. So they've got all of the infrastructure, they sell the cargo, they do all the airway bills, we show up, we open the door, under our supervision, they load the airplane, we fly it to the destination and they unload it, they're under our supervision. So that's a great business model for us. And, again, they're -- that the fuel surcharges are added to that so that the client pays whatever it costs us for fuel for that's like.\nUnidentified Company Representative : We have Jerry Kaiser. We get a comment that some commentators expect the recession later in \u201822. I presume the rest of that would be that your reaction or pre-planning should there be a recession this year.\nEd Wegel : So again, if you look at our long-term contracts and who they are with, they are not affected by recessions they fly, whether there's a recession or not. And not many of the other clients that we apply the NCAA, football, basketball, Incentive Travel groups, for big corporations and others will continue to do that flying in the face of a recession. The scheduled carriers will see their load factors maybe drop, but we sell whole aircraft to clients who are recession proof in the sense that they have to fly. And if they have to fly, we have the aircraft ready for them to fly them where they need to go.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Garry Milon. Have we effectively been able to meet all the demand for hours? Or are we turning hours down? If we are turning hours down, is it aircraft crew or both based on that situation?\nEd Wegel : Couple of reasons. And the answer is yes. There are times when all six airplanes are flying. As they did during the last two weeks of March Madness. We got many requests for additional flights, we just could not accommodate them because every airplane was fully occupied. The driver is a pilots. We have to have enough pilots to man each aircraft. We do lose some pilots to the majors. We're constantly backfilling those pilots. But as we get more aircraft into the fleet, we get more efficient in the ability to schedule the aircraft. So we have more opportunities where one aircraft may take the plane to where they need to go. And a second aircraft will pick them up two or three days later to bring them back. Right now we don't have, we have limited ability to do that because of the limited fleet size as we get into 10, 12, 15 passenger aircraft. We have more opportunities to do that. And our ability to increase flight hours each month on each aircraft will increase.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Fair. Don Hein also asking about cargo flights and he's asking if you can provide a bit more color on the steps that need to be taken and the timeline which you've already addressed for the cargo flights in the beginning.\nEd Wegel : Yes, I'll just run through that again quickly. So we have already submitted to the FAA. All of the manuals that are required to be reviewed by them and approved. The final manuals will include the exact specifications of the first two cargo aircraft which the two lessors are providing to us. But initially, our manuals have been conditionally approved pending the receipt of the aircraft, the first aircraft will arrive August 19, we will go through a certification in conformity process with the FAA, we will fly probably two or three moving run flights with the aircraft and we can have paying cargo on board those flights. So we can schedule those with one of our clients. And so from the time that we received the aircraft on August 19, we are projecting six weeks or so until we can start flying revenue service, which is why we've selected October 1, as the target launch date for revenue service. So all of the pieces are in motion. Both the first two aircraft are in conversion right now, on April 14, I'll attend to what's called the door cutting ceremony on the first aircraft where they cut the door. And that's a sort of formal ritual for aviation geeks to watch that we'll have that live. And we'll have it on YouTube. But the first two airplanes are in conversion, they're on track on target to be delivered to us. Third airplane will be delivered in December and the fourth airplane, cargo airplane will be delivered in January. So far, everything is on track, FAA and our regulators are happy with our progress. And I don't see anything delaying our entry into service unless something happens with the supply chain. And the aircraft is delayed slightly coming out of conversion. But so far, the two conversion shops have told us that they have all of the equipment, all of the material, all of the parts and components they need to complete the conversion to cargo.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Alright, we're going to speed through some of these questions because they're redundant contingently plan of reduction, we've addressed, finding our own cash flow and EPS we've addressed. Yes, we move to NASDAQ has also been addressed. I am not sure this is a little redundant. Mathai McTavish is asking where we are at today with the cargo FAA certification manuals, et cetera.\nEd Wegel : Well, I addressed that. We're on track, we've submitted all of the manuals so far that we can submit. All of those have been through initial FAA reviews, we made some changes to their comment with, based on their comments and their required revisions. So our manuals are in great shape. We need to wait and balance manuals once the airplanes are wage, those will be done about the time that the airplanes get delivered. And so again, we see ourselves on track for October 1 in service with the first two aircraft.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Let's get to another topic for a moment from Sylvain Islam. On Canada jet lines, I'm not quite sure what this is in relation to that. I would like to know when we will receive the other actions of Canada deadline. I'm wondering if this prefers final Canada transport approval or whatever it may be Ryan, you can just provide a little bit of perspective on C jet at this point.\nRyan Goepel: Yes, so C jet has received their control in fact, which is the first stage of CTA, there's basically to sum it, there's two CTAs and one Transport Canada role. So the first step of CTA is the controlling fact, Canadian basically proof of citizenship that's been achieved, and that was never achieved in the previous iteration. The second part is hitting their financial fitness test, which is demonstrating a balance sheet as required. And then on the Transport Canada side, which is actually flight off. The pilots training has been approved. We actually have two pilots certified under Transport Canada, the flight attendant training has been approved and that training will start in the next couple of weeks. They have to unlike in the US where we had to fly 150 hours of proving runs. They're only required to do two flights, which is quite nice. So once they get their finance their balance sheet proven, it should be within 30 days they'll have their operating certificate and they're targeting selling tickets in June and flying in July.\nUnidentified Company Representative : And it goes off. I think the good point here from John Chamberlain. Great job guys. By the way, exclamation mark, great presentation and plan exclamation mark. Way to execute at all levels. Exclamation mark, I guess John is happy.\nRyan Goepel: Good.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Any closing comments?\nEd Wegel : So again, Grant, thanks for the microphone and the platform. You've been a good supporter of ours. We greatly appreciate that. You've helped us get the message out. We will continue to do that until people start to --\nRyan Goepel: Do the math.\nA - Ed Wegel : Listen a little more closely to us. But our comparables traded about $50 million US per aircraft. So you do the math.\nUnidentified Company Representative : I have. That's why I was buying more stock this morning.\nEd Wegel : Grant, thank you very much. Thank you for your support.\nUnidentified Company Representative : And to all the participants. Thank you. And there will be a recording of this webinar distributed within the next 24 hours or so. Thank you.\nEd Wegel : Thanks everyone. Take care. Have a good day."}, {"symbol": "JETMF", "quarter": 3, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-11-30 21:54:05", "content": "Operator: All right, good afternoon. Good morning, depending on where you are. Thank you for joining us for this Management Update with Ed Wegel, the CEO and Ryan Goepel, the CFO of Global Crossing Airlines. It's been a few months since the last update, and a significant amount has been accomplished. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ed and it'll be very, very clear to everybody, where you've come from, and where you're going in a very short period of time.\nEd Wegel: Thanks, Grant. And thanks for everyone attending this webinar today. Good afternoon. Good morning, as Grant said. As mentioned, we purposely have not held any webinars over the past few months, we wanted to get through third quarter, which saw us go into revenue operations, had some aircraft, and get our operation settled down and get us into a pattern. We've tried to keep everyone as informed as possible through the last few months, as you know, with press releases and social media. That's not as effective though, as these investor webinars. And so we will start doing these on a regular basis again, now that we're deep into our ramp up period, and our operations are ongoing. We thank you for listening in today. And as Grant mentioned, we've made a tremendous amount of progress. Since we completed our 121 Flag Certification in August, which was about four months ago. That seems like a lot longer given everything that's gone on. But it was - it was a mere four months. So we got through quarter three. And we've been through most of the quarter four now. So there's a lot that we need to discuss, and show where we've made progress on our ramp up period. And we're going to take you through that progress today in a number of areas. We're going to go through strategic goals and objectives for this quarter. And next quarter, we're going to walk through our operations in terms of our fleet management and our basis, going to as much as we can talk about revenue, where that's coming from and how we are growing that, some finance initiatives and then a summary. But first I want to talk about where we are today because I think that's quite important and quite impressive, given where we came from and where we have been since certification. So where we are today, in terms of our certifications and permits, we are 121 domestic flag and supplemental carrier for DLT international authority. And over the last few months, we have worked with the governments in Canada, Mexico and Brazil, and now have full operating permits to be able to operate into those countries, which is quite significant for us. For Canada because of our relationship with Canada Jetlines into Mexico and Brazil because those are big markets for charters and other clients who need to get to those locations. Our aircraft fleet as of today, three aircraft on our operating certificate two A320S, one A321. Three aircraft will be added to the certificate in Q4, in fact, one airplane in A320 will be added later today or early tomorrow. The second of the three aircraft will be added to the certificate later this week. And a third aircraft, another A320 should be delivered to us out of paint in a few weeks and will be added to the certificate by mid December. We also have one aircraft slated now for delivery by March 1st of next year. We were originally going to take delivery of that airplane late in December. It was like coming out of the former operator Alaska Airlines and so we push that two months, but that actually works well within our operating plan. We also have three air cargo aircraft now under firm lease agreements that will be delivered out of conversion. All of these A320s next year, August October and December and we are working to try to get at least one more cargo aircraft delivered in 2022. So let's take a look at the fleet. We often talk about, about these aircraft, it is inanimate  objects, they\u2019re actually real. And they're big, they're expensive. And we have a great operating team that can operate these airplanes. And 276 was our first airplane delivered in January of this year 11 months ago. That airplane is doing heavy service now for the US government, and for some of our clients in the southeast, and 277 our 8321 was delivered in March - March of this year. We used it in Afghanistan along with 276. It was placed on the certificate after it returned from Afghanistan. But we went through the certification process and the evacuation demos, that airplane is now doing heavy service into Cuba and into the Caribbean. A lot of calls for it because of its size and number of seats and its cargo capacity. And we are actually looking for another A321 passenger airplane for delivery next year because of the passenger and client demand for this airplane. 278 GX is here in Miami. It is the aircraft that will be placed on the certificate later today. It has been conformed, we're waiting for some final paperwork from the FAA. 279GX was delivered earlier this quarter. It comes from Avalon, the big leasing company. That airplane has got a great interior and it's very popular among some of our clients. And it's out doing a lot of heavy work right now for the government, as well as a number of football teams and other clients in the collegiate sports area. As well we have 281 and 282GX, 282GX is now out of paint. It will be flown to Miami tomorrow. It will take a few days for it to be put on the certificate. But it is already booked for charters starting next week. So we're looking forward to bringing that airplane here tomorrow or no later than Thursday. 281GX has just been delivered to the paint facility, 282 GX was pulled out to anyone pulled out, 281 pulled in and is now being painted. So that will be delivered to us in 10 to 12 days after it goes through the paint process. 280GX will be delivered to us as I said March 1 of 2022, and 283 we're looking at a delivery sometime in April or May of 2022. So that will bring us to eight aircraft 183 21, 783 20s by the summer of 2022. And that is as fast as we can grow. We have to train crews, we have to get authority from the DOT, we have to ensure that our infrastructure in terms of people and assets is in place here at the company for the FAA to approve our expansion. We don't see any issues with that. But that does take time. And it does take some work for us to get ready for these additional aircraft. As well, we have three cargo aircraft as I as mentioned 3A21 freighters coming to us in actually August and September of 2022 and one by November or December of 2022. All depends on the amount of conversion time required to convert those airplanes to freighter. We have a total of nine now under firm lease or LOIs. For the fleet we are about to get two more subject to board approval. We continue to work to tie up A321 freighters which we know will be a very hot commodity in the cargo market in the years to come. Our operating bases, we continue to expand those - Miami now is fully operational. And we have global x ground team, our wholly owned subsidiary ground handling our flights here in Miami for Santa Domingo, Cuba and other flights that we have departing from Miami. ACy, Atlantic City, New Jersey is now fully functioning flight attendant base. Our second flight attendant class for Atlantic City is actually here in Miami doing their final week of training they will graduate early next week. We are already looking at positioning an aircraft there in Atlantic City, given the number of charters and the demand that we see out of the Northeast. The Las Vegas space plan for opening January 1st, or first flight attending class will start in Las Vegas in the next few days. They'll graduate just before Christmas. We'll then have a second class starting in Las Vegas soon thereafter. We've got a base supervisor, we're starting to ramp up for operations there. We've already gotten requests for charters, from some major clients with airplanes operating out of Las Vegas starting in the first quarter. So we're very, very pleased with the development of those bases. And I'll talk about why we have done that in a moment. Our Fort Lauderdale major maintenance complex plan and finance for May 2023 opening. If that continues, we have the financing in place for that. We're working on the designs and the engineering studies for that. And we want to push ahead with that in early 2022. But that will give us a maintenance complex where we can do work up to see checks  and give us a home for our maintenance providers, which is extremely important for us as we move forward and expand the size of our fleet. Team members now in the headquarters 42 members, pilots are 33. We will have - we have two classes starting. So we will be up in the mid to high 40s in the next month, 72 flight attendants amongst the three bases and a maintenance team of 26. This staffing is required for us both with the FAA and DOT to show that we have the infrastructure in place to operate up to eight aircraft. So we have taken the decision to put those team members in place, get them trained, get them acclimated, and get ready for the airplanes as they get delivered.  So we're well along the path in ensuring that we have the infrastructure in place for the airplanes that we have coming. As well as it as you know, we spun off Canada jet lines earlier this year. Global X maintains a minority stake of 25% of jet lines worth today approximately 5 million. We will do cross marketing between Canada jet lines and Global X. And in fact, we will start flying for Canada jet lines in advance of them receiving their certificate to take advantage of the Canadian winter traffic to South Florida starting in February, mid February for a period of six to eight weeks. This will allow Canada jet lines to get their name out into the Canadian market, gets us some extra utilization on some aircraft and starts the complete alliance between the two airlines  As well, and I just mentioned global x ground team 100% owned by Global X. In partnership with global aviation services, which provides our ground support equipment, this will continue to grow over time. With global - with ground team handling other airlines as well as Global X. We now have established operations for ground team handling Global X both Miami and Tampa. And we're looking at expanding ground team now with some external financing to other locations around the US both where Global X will fly. As well as where we will not fly. So we see this as a major revenue opportunity for us to have a ground handling operation that is somewhat independent of Global X that provides all of our ground handling. And we'll handle other airlines. As well, and you may have seen our press release from today. Fluey  has is now up and running. We've just signed a major partnership deal with Soho House major leading global hospitality brand. And we believe that fluvey will be a source for demand for charters that will be flown by Global X both for Soho House which could be as many as 10 to 15 to 30 charters a year, as well as other clients in that space. And as well what fluvey does, which is to create a crowd source demand for charter travel, We will be looking to bring in outside investors now that we have proven the concept. And this will be a major asset for the company, as we move forward. Let me talk a little bit about our goals and objectives. For this quarter, we're in the midst of completing a very extensive budget process for 2022. We set our cost reduction goals now as we are up and running. And we are approaching some scale with up to six aircraft operating. So we are reducing consultants and other outside advisors. We are trimming where we can, we're getting the airline ready to fly. We've also established a quarterly review process and that will be ongoing through the year. Also in the Q4, as I previously stated we will receive conformant place to be a 320s on to our certificate. That will actually be done by December 15. First two airplanes of the three, as I mentioned will be done within the next few days. We're also working to finish the complete IT integration across the company to eliminate all the paper. We're about 90% of the way there we're going to finish this in Q4. Everything in this company is now digitized. We've got a few final tests that we have to automate, but that'll be done by the end of this quarter. We're also redoing every vendor maintenance it crew training all across the company now and we're starting to renegotiate with vendors as they say that we are viable, we have - we have cash in the bank, we have airplanes, and we are a survivor. So now we can go back to each one of those vendors and start to renegotiate, and cut costs where we can. We're continuing to expand our broker outreach, the charter broker community and all of our relationships. We had a very successful IMAX conference in Las Vegas, and I'll talk about brokers in a moment when we get to some of our revenue slides. We're also preparing to receive a smart links aircraft to supplement our winter flying. This is part of our alliance with SmartLynx. As with SmartLynx has been a great partner of ours, they own about 8% of Global X, we need one of their aircraft to supplement our flying. And this is the start of an eight year exchange process with SmartLynx where we will send airplanes to them in the summer. And they will send airplanes to us in the winter. It's very counter cyclical between the two airlines. And it's a very comprehensive, cohesive plan we have with them to exchange aircraft. And we're in the midst of completing our first employee performance review. Many of our managers have never been through this. We're teaching them how to do it, we're mentoring them. And we're putting in place a full performance review for all of our team members. In the first quarter of 2022, we have a number of objectives. One of the primary ones is an uplift to NASDAQ, which Ryan will speak about in a few moments. On the passenger side, we want to make sure we have a seamless operation, with SmartLynx to develop and enhance our eight year deal. We want to fully open our crew bases in Atlantic City in Las Vegas, and have both pilots and flight attendants headquartered or domiciled in those bases. And we will take delivery of another April 20 as I mentioned around March 1 from DAE, a major lessor who provided us our first aircraft. On the cargo side, we will oversee the induction of two of the first A321s for conversion. In January, the first one it will be can start - its conversion at Heiko major engineering firm. And the second one will start in February in San Antonio, Texas with ST Engineering, we're looking we're looking very forward to seeing those two airplanes start the conversion process. \\ We will also start the certification process with the FAA. And we have now targeted with them, and their team that's been assigned to us to do this with our first submission of manuals, honor about the mid part of January. That's our target date to get our first submission. And this is so that we will be ready through the process for the first aircraft, first freighter to be delivered to us in August, folks so we can start the proving runs with that airplane. Let me talk a little bit about why we have three bases and why we put them where we put them. One of the one of the advantages of having several bases is that we can more effectively compete for charter, activity of charter quotes, charter proposals and actual charters. If we can have airplanes spread throughout the US at bases where we can limit the amount of ferry time required to get to a client. So we of course started in Miami with our main base, we have now opened up Atlantic City, where we can quickly and efficiently move aircraft to charters in the Northeast and Midwest. And now we're opening Las Vegas, where we can effectively compete for California West Coast charters, all up through the ski areas and so forth. So if you draw a three hour range, circle from each of those bases, you can see that we cover all of the Americas down to northern part of South America. But we can efficiently move aircraft and have aircraft available for charter clients within a very short ferry time period, which is critical for us as we compete for charters. We've talked about our alliance, both with Canada jet lines, and with SmartLynx\u2019s. We call this our global presence, local focus campaign with the three tails with SmartLynx\u2019s, as I mentioned, we will receive an aircraft from Smart Links early next year that they will operate for us on some routes that we have already determined with clients. They will also provide backup aircraft for us so that - so that we can more tightly schedule our own fleet. We will also provide A320s to SmartLynx starting next summer, and we're cooperating on A321 freighters, so we are exchanging information and data SmartLynx is educating us on their operation of the A321 freighter Today they are currently operating to and they will get to more freighters very soon. So that cooperation is very helpful to us, particularly as we negotiated our deals on the freighters. Their input and their advice was critical for us to get very, very efficient deals done with the lead source. Our jet lines Alliance also very, very important to us, we own a major stake in Canada jet lines, we will start flying a Toronto, Miami Toronto Fort Lauderdale pattern for them, starting in hopefully February, maybe a little later in February. But this will give them eight weeks of exposure with their name and brand in the market and get us additional flying. We're also providing technical assistance to them for their aircraft acquisitions. And we're helping them - they're working with our client have added air to potentially launch Toronto to Cuba flights with their own aircraft. So that both of these alliances are very, very important to us. It broadens our scope in our presence. And we're now talking to several smaller South American Airlines in an effort to expand this alliance to include aircraft that we can access in the South American market. We've also strengthened the management team through the quarter. It's our intent to continue to supplement and augment our management team as our operation gets larger and more complex. Jeff Sunic  has joined us he works for Ryan Goepeland finance shop. Jeff comes to us after many years at Atlas Air, Atlas is one of our comps, an airline that we frankly look up to and we look to see how they operate. They operate wide body aircraft, but they are very much in the operating mode that we are in. And so we've learned a lot through Jeff on our finance systems and how we do accounting for charters and other areas of our business. And so he is leading the current budgeting process and the quarterly review processes. And as well working with our sales and marketing team, as they develop charter contracts to make sure that we are covering everything we should be covering in our contracts as Alistair does. Marcus Schleich has joined us as VP of Maintenance. And one of our one nineteen's, the gentleman who had occupied that position is now retired. He got us very successfully through the certification. We were sorry to see him go but he did a great service for us. We were able to replace him with Marcus who spent tremendous experience with a number of airlines including Atlas, including a number of airlines that operate the A320 comes very highly recommended from the FAA, they are very happy to see him here with us, as well as Kevin Beitzel, who joined us as our chief inspector. Kevin has many years of inspection experience, which is critical in this role, heavy maintenance inspection experience at MROs, both inducting aircraft into a fleet as well as returning aircraft to less oars. Kevin comes to us from Frontier, which operates the A320. He knows the A320 inside and out and is a tremendous asset to our team, as well as we expand our operations in our stations and our ground ops and also in flight we're bringing in Durin de Pastino  She has extensive experience having been on the startup teams at Virgin America, JetBlue and breeze recently where she ran station operations as well as in flight. She's also had a major VP roles at some major airlines and putting Emirates and to Lyon. And so we are very fortunate to have come on board with us to help strengthen our ground ops team and help on the in flight side of our operations. As we look at our fleet plan, we're often asked how many airplanes do you think you can get to as part of our goals and objective, we are looking now at 25 passenger aircraft 25 cargo or freighter aircraft by the year end 2025, so 50 aircraft total. We are on path to do that. We are continuing to see good deals for aircraft. As a result of the pandemic, we're moving fast to line up those aircraft because that situation will eventually change. But we are focused on the 320, the 321. Again COVID has created a unique opportunity for us to line up these aircraft. And we're working very hard to line up the 2022 fleet as well as 2023. 2022, we would like to take as many as five additional passenger aircraft in addition to the three freighter aircraft that we will take. If we can take more aircraft, we will, because the deals are there, the aircraft are there, we have to make sure that we've got the clients to fill those airplanes and that we've got the infrastructure in place here in terms of pilot recruitment, and other infrastructure that we need to support that growth. But this is our goal 50 aircraft by the year end 2025, we bought the 2525 25 plan. And we think it's realistic, and it gives us the opportunistic growth that we need. A couple of other initiatives, these are still in board review, as well as some other initiatives. But these give you an example of the types of things we are looking at now to continue to reduce our costs and increase our margins.  We're looking to purchase our own flight training device, a level five device that we will place in the Airbus facility here in Miami/ It does a number of things for us, it saves us money in terms of crew time, we can operate the level five sim for about 40% of the hours that we now use the full flight simulator for it also gives us and probably more importantly flexibility in scheduling. So this device, obviously we would own it, and the scheduling of that device is completely in our control. Right now. We are a bit at the mercy of the training facilities here in Miami, and their ability to provide a simulator time. We want to move away from that as much as we can and control our own destiny when it comes to training. As Well. We're working with GA Telesis  which is a major MRO facility with worldwide operations. We're very close to their management, they have been very supportive of us. We are now working on a on a plan to buy some airframe, A320 airframes, that can be torn down their parts and components put on the shelf, in some cases, they may need to be repaired. But given the cost of airframes, we think that there's a big arbitrage between what we can buy for and what we can put on the shelf. And what we could eventually sell some of these parts, those parts that we don't need. And so it's an it's really a cash neutral type of situation, particularly since GA Telesis will finance the entire the entire deal from acquisition of the aircraft frame, to stripping it down, repairing components, and doing all the other activities around that. So we're starting now to look at creative ways for us to reduce our costs, increase the control of our operation by having our own parts our own main base kits here at NIA as well as our own flight training devices so that we can control our own destiny when it comes to flight training. Turning over to Ryan now take us through the next slides.\nRyan Goepel: Right in reference to our block hours available for sale, our primary constraints that relates to revenue does relate to how many aircraft we have to sell. As you can see in August, September, we effectively had one aircraft in August and 1.9 aircraft available September, as we disclosed we did around 370 hours of flying, In Q3 with those with those \u2013 with that aircraft, generating about $3.1 million in revenue. We did highlight in the Q3 results a loss of 5 million but over 60% of that can be attributed to before we started flying and also related to the ramp up as we are adding planes in Q3 and Q4. Looking forward to Q4 as we mentioned in our press release, we will see a  approximately total 70% increase in our capacity for flying, which again is been our primary constraint as it relates to revenue growth. And we see that growing not only in Q3 and Q4 but also in Q1. I'll now turn it over to Ed to discuss some of the customers  \nEd Wegel: I\u2019ll talk you through of this , it's important for you to understand the breadth and depth of the clients that we are flying. We have a large portfolio now of collegiate sports clients that we are flying both for football and now into basketball and baseball. And In fact we have one whole aircraft that will be dedicated with Wi-Fi to that market starting in January of this year. On the tour and travel side, we've talked about our Havana operation, our Cuba operation with Havana Air which is the largest OFAC approved tour operator in the US, currently operating 10 flights for them. We started with eight, we're now at 10. By mid December we should be at 12 to 14 flights per week. And in January in February that should ramp up even more so. We're only flying to Havana right now from Miami and Tampa, as the other cities in Cuba open up. Those include Camaguey, Santa Clara, Santiago and so forth. We will fly those for Havana Air and we expect to eventually get to as many as 44 flights per week from Miami and Tampa and perhaps one or two other US gateway cities to Cuba, 44 flights per week to the to Cuba, the main cities in Cuba. We\u2019re also flying in a joint venture with Terpineol airlines  to serve the Venezuelan market over at Santa Domingo. And we started a major program with Agua Caliente Casino operator on the West Coast. As we put more \u2013 put one airplane and then a second airplane into Las Vegas, that particular joint venture will expand. We also are in discussions with all of the casino operators, not only in Las Vegas, but Atlantic City and Mississippi and so forth. And we expect we will get a fairly good amount of business out of all of the casinos. And that portfolio will build - will build over time. The government side,. we have done a number of flights for NASA, going into French Guiana where they are preparing to launch what will be the replacement for the Hubble telescope. We're flying another flight for them in the next week or so. And we see that relationship with NASA expanding over time. They're very good client. And we perform very, very well for them. And as well we work with the Department of Homeland Security, to provide them aircraft and seats that they need for their various activities. I mentioned the broker community which is very, very important to the air charter or charter airline side of the business. We work with all of the major ones now, ACC, their charter service Chapman freeborn, which is a subsidiary or affiliate of SmartLynx and their conglomerate, air charter service, Hunton Palmer  private jet services, which were now in the midst of negotiating a major expanded contract with them, sports and entertainment, travel, and some others. So they've been a source of a great deal of business for us. They provide a lot of potential deal flow for us, we perform well for them. And we will continue to expand our relationship with all of them, as we move forward. Mentioned Havana Air, very, very important customer client of ours. As I said, we operate a 6 AM departure every morning for them to Havana from Miami. And we'll continue to build that relationship with additional flights. And again, we expect to get to as many as many as 44 flights per week with them by summer of 2022. We talked a little bit about  we think that this is a prime example of the marketing creativity we have here at Global X to expand what is the natural charter market so that we bring in more clients and more opportunities for flying. So fluygy  was presented to us as a concept. We grabbed on to it, we expanded it, we put some development hours into their software. We then working with some local marketing experts, were able to get a deal done with Soho House, which is a major, worldwide luxury brand. And so with Soho House, we'll be doing the first flight in January major promotion with Soho House of Global X n and Flugy at our Basel, and for a number of events between now and the first flight. And we see this relationship expanding such that we'll do a number of charters for Soho House through the year to all of their other properties. And as well, this will attract more clients such as Soho House to Fluegy and we're now looking to bring in external capital to now grow and expand Fluegy with his proof of concept. So this is example of how we're looking outside the box to expand the potential market for our charter aircraft into new markets with new partners and Co-branding with well established travel brands that adds to our credibility as we as we move this airline forward.\u2019 Talk a little bit about the cargo business. Again, this is a major piece of our business going forward. It gives us diversity of revenue streams. And because our pilots can operate both types of airplanes and A320 passenger airplane or A321 fighter aircraft, it gives us a great, great amount of flexibility. It allows us to deploy our assets or human assets over all of our fixed assets, which is a major advantage for us as we look to reduce costs. So as I mentioned before, our certification will start in January, we hope and expect to be flying proving runs by late August or September, and then into major contract with some of the one or more of the large package carriers sometime late in 2022. Again, we expect and hope to get to 25 of these aircraft. It is it is a phenomenal aircraft. It stacks up very well against its competition. And we've seen Lufthansa recently decide to go with a free 21 freighter as one of their fleet standards. And so we know we've made the right decision focusing our efforts on this particular cargo aircraft. I\u2019ll ask Ryan to talk about our S1 process.\u2019\nRyan Goepel: So our S1 process which has been going on for the greater part of the year, we filed the public version of the S1 on November 22, including Q3 financial statements and an updated business section. This is our seventh version of the filing. Many people have asked why are we filing an S1` what is this? What is a registration statement? Global Crossing is when we domesticated from BC to Delaware in January this year, became required under SEC regulations to file a registration statement. This registration statement we believe will accelerate any additional escalations we want to do as part of an uplifting in the next year. This also has the impact of registering all the shares issued and offerings in June or January and May of 2021. So in the end is what this S1 we believe does, it brings us greater access to US capital markets. It's required by the SEC, and also was required by Canadian regulators to allow us to file and just GAAP versus having to file financial statements in both GAAP and IFRS. So it's a key step as part of our evolution. And we hope to have that done in the next couple of weeks.\nEd Wegel: And I think the most important point there is this will help us facilitate to an upwards to NASDAQ. It's required by regulations. And we are we are fully reporting company and we should be in full compliance with SEC regulations. This S1 one does that. It's an excellent - excellently drafted statement. And we will get great use of this going forward. And it gives our vendors our aircraft less soars "}]
