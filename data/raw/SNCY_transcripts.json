My name is Crystal Love, and I will be your operator for today's conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Chris Allen, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Allen, you may begin.\nChris Allen: Thank you. I'm joined today by Jude Bricker, Chief Executive Officer; Dave Davis, President and Chief Financial Officer; and a group of others to help answer questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during this call, the company may make certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements. Our remarks today may include forward-looking statements which are based upon management's current beliefs, expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the risk factors and cautionary statements outlined in our earnings release and most recent SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. You can find our third quarter earnings press release under the Investor Relations portion of our website at ir.suncountry.com. With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Jude.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Chris. Thanks for joining us this afternoon, everyone. Our diversified business model is unique in the airline industry. Due to the predictability of our charter and cargo businesses, we are able to deliver the most flexible scheduled service capacity in the industry. The combination of our scheduled flexibility and low fixed cost model allows us to respond to both predictable leisure demand fluctuations and exogenous industry shocks. We believe due to our structural advantages, we will be able to reliably deliver industry-leading profitability throughout all cycles. Today, we're announcing 3Q results, including an adjusted operating margin of over 8% on 18.5% year-on-year departure growth. We know now these results produced the highest trailing 12-month pre-tax margin of any of the 11 public mainline U.S. carriers. The same was true at the end of the second quarter. Demand remained strong across all segments of our business, highlighted by scheduled service TRASM down 5% on 15% ASM growth versus prior year. Since the beginning of the year, every month, scheduled service TRASM has reset to around 35%, higher than pre-COVID comps, with this trend generally continuing into bookings on future travel. Also, our charter block hour production, critical during the fall of scheduled service demand trough, was up over 14% year-on-year. Recall that the third and fourth quarters typically produce margins well below our annual production. We continue to deliver a high-quality product. In the third quarter, our controllable completion factor was 99.4%, while delivering the highest D0 among U.S. mainline carriers. I'm so grateful to all our team members that worked so hard to take care of our customers every day. Unfortunately, the cause of our variance of performance to potential remains crew staffing levels. Due to captain availability, we flew about 3,500 fewer block hours in the third quarter, mostly in July, when the demand environment would have supported with our fleet and the fuel price input. We continue to see staffing levels improve, albeit more slowly than we would like. Looking ahead, we recently extended our schedule through the summer of 2024 and announced 10 new Minneapolis markets. I think this is representative of our growth for the next few years as we continue to expand into our Minneapolis opportunity during peak periods, supported by modest off-peak growth in our charter business. As our growth has moderated based on pilot staffing, we've decided to lease out two additional aircraft that were scheduled to enter our fleet in Q4. This will delay the entry into service of two 737-800s planned for the fourth quarter of 2023 until the first quarter of 2025. Aircraft are generally in high demand as much of the aviation industry deals with production delays on new narrow-bodies and service disruptions from the GTF. So, we'll make good returns on these aircraft until we're able to fully utilize them. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Dave.\nDave Davis: Thanks, Jude. Q3 was another profitable quarter for Sun Country with revenue finishing at the upper-end of our guided range and operating margin finishing in the middle of our guided range, despite incurring a fuel price that was 10% higher than expected. Total revenue increased 12.3% year-over-year to $248.9 million, while adjusted earnings before taxes were $11.1 million versus $9.7 million in Q3 of 2022. Adjusted operating margin was 8.1% for the quarter and 14.7% year-to-date. As Jude mentioned, on a trailing 12-month basis, Sun Country's adjusted pre-tax margin through Q3 was 10.2%. This was the highest of the 11 publicly-traded mainline U.S. carriers. The strength of our diversified business model continues to be demonstrated by our strong results. Revenue for our passenger segment continued to grow in Q3, with combined scheduled service and charter revenue increasing 9.7% year-over-year to $214.4 million. Scheduled service plus ancillary sales generated $166.9 million in revenue, which was 9.5% higher than last year. Scheduled service TRASM was $0.1172, which was 5% lower than last year and a 15.1% growth in scheduled service ASMs. We're still maintaining remarkable scheduled service TRASM strength versus 2019. Q3 2023 was almost 39% higher than Q3 2019. This marks our sixth consecutive quarter of scheduled service TRASM being at least 25% higher versus its comparable quarter in 2019. We do not expect this streak to end in Q4. Our total fare per passenger declined 8.7% to $153.11, while we maintained an 86.6% load factor. Charter revenue in the third quarter grew 10.6% to $47.4 million on block hour growth of 14.1%. A portion of our charter revenue consists of reimbursement from customers for changes in fuel prices as we do not take fuel risk on our charter flying. Q3 fuel prices dropped by over 18.8% year-over-year. And if you exclude the fuel reimbursement revenue from both Q3 '23 and Q3 '22, charter flying revenue grew 14.6% over the period, which is in line with block hour growth, producing flat year-over-year charter revenue per block hour. Third quarter cargo revenue grew 10% to $26 million on a 6.3% increase in block hours. Last year, we had lower levels of flying due to scheduled maintenance events, and the annual increases in our Amazon contract occurred in December of 2022. We're continuing to grow at a profitable and measured pace. We expect total ASM growth in Q4 of this year to be between 8% and 10%. We anticipate a similar growth rate to continue for full year of 2024. Turning now to costs. Total operating expenses increased 11.4% on a 14.4% increase in total block hours in the third quarter. Adjusted CASM was up 2.6% versus Q3 of '22. This year-over-year change is down significantly from the 10%-plus increases we experienced in the first half of 2023. The timing of maintenance events in Q3 was a large contributor to our year-over-year cost increase as airframe check volume doubled from Q3 of '22 and material price increases were almost 9%. Looking into Q4, we expect heavy check volume to remain high relative to Q4 of '22. Shifting focus to 2024 for a minute, we are anticipating adjusted CASM to be roughly flat versus full year 2023. Let me switch to the balance sheet. Our total liquidity at the end of Q3 was $198 million, which was lower than the amount at the end of Q2, primarily due to the seasonality of bookings and the timing of our share repurchases, which finished towards the end of the quarter. As of November 6, our total liquidity was $230 million. Through the end of September, we've spent $210.6 million on CapEx, which has funded a significant amount of our planned aircraft growth into 2025. We anticipate our full-year 2023 CapEx to be approximately $225 million and our year-ending passenger fleet count to be 42 aircraft. Fleet growth in 2024 will be modest, and the majority of our growth will be funded through higher utilization. We expect 2024 capital expenditures to be well under half of the 2023 level and free cash flow generation to be strong. We continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of Q3 was 2.4 times. Since we do not have a significant debt burden, we have flexibility in how we deploy our cash. Since Q4 of 2022, we spent approximately $80 million on share repurchases, which is the total amount that our Board had authorized. Just recently, our Board authorized another $25 million in repurchase authority, which we plan to deploy opportunistically. Turning to guidance. We are anticipating Q4 total revenue to be between $242 million and $252 million, an increase of 7% to 11% versus Q4 of '22 on a block -- and an increase in block hours of 11% to 15%. We're forecasting a $3.20 per gallon fuel price in the fourth quarter, and adjusted op margin for the quarter is forecasted to be between 3% and 5%. The fundamentals of our unique diversified business remain strong, and our model is highly resilient to changes in macroeconomic conditions. Our focus remains on profitable growth. And with that, I'll open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Just a couple for me. On aircraft, can you just remind us kind of what the ideal vintage or age on the 800s that you're targeting? And how much do you think the market for these assets has changed? I understand you're not in the market. There's a bit of a pause here. But to the extent you own them, how much do you think the value of those assets has changed in this backdrop?\nJude Bricker: We vary -- hey, Duane, we vary our price based on age. So there's not really a preference because we put that in the valuation. What we've had the most success in is about a 12-year-old airplane, which is where the value historically for us has equated to the aggregate of the transferred maintenance value and the residual value of the components. Earlier than that, we have to pay a premium for the newness. And later than that, we don't get typically as compensated as we would for the age. So that's kind of the sweet spot in the market. It also happens to align with likely recent large maintenance events having occurred on that aircraft type. So, we look at the valuation just like that, transfer maintenance value. Maintenance value is getting a lot more valuable from OEM escalation predominantly and in the bids. And then we add a premium to that. We -- the last airplane we originated was about six, seven months ago, and that premium was zero. So that's a little bit -- we were getting a little bit discount through COVID. And before COVID, it was $1 million or $2 million. So, I would say it's pretty consistent. I think what's really happening is there's a lot of demand for really short-term leases, engine leases. And people are extending leases on a short-term basis. It's just all having to do with the industrial challenges of the new production.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Great. And then, are you -- I guess, are you booked for 2025? And maybe you just said -- or sorry, are you booked through 2025? And what is your growth number for next year? I don't know if you mentioned it on the call. Sorry if I missed it.\nDave Davis: Yes. So, we are largely booked through 2025. If you recall, we did this deal with the 737-900ERs that are on lease to Oman Air. Those start to come off lease and redelivered to us in November of '24. So that's incremental aircraft in '25. Jude also mentioned a sort of additional lease deal that were near completion on -- for two more aircraft we were going to take, those will now come in the first quarter of '25. So that's seven incremental. And we may or may not be in the market for one or two more. I mean, the good news here is between improved utilization, the aircraft that we already have in the pipeline, the CapEx for those has largely been incurred already. So, we think we're in a great position from a fleet perspective.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Great. And if I could just sneak one last one in. Just your thoughts on when you think we'll be able to kind of fully capture these peak demand periods. Would spring break be a reasonable guest -- or a reasonable guess on that? I thought it was interesting FedEx suggesting that they're overstaffed on pilots by about, I think, 700. Some of the press reports, you have at least one peer which is canceling bids -- canceling higher bids or offers that it made. So, it feels like this pilot shortage is effectively over. Given that, when do you think you're in a position to sort of fully capture peak demand?\nDave Davis: Yeah. So recall, for a year now, at least for us, the issue has not been hiring pilots, and the issue has not been pilot attrition. So that's not a concern. The issue has been on the upgrade front. And there's myriad reasons for that, which we've talked about in the past. We are seeing positive trends based on some of the actions we've taken over the last six months. We're seeing positive trends in the captain upgrade world. I think we're all around the table anticipating a very strong Q1 and a strong ability to capture peak demand in March, which is part of the company's best quarter. But the trends are moving in the right direction. We don't see a shortage of pilot availability at this point. It's an internal issue for us that we are making progress and working through.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thank you, gentlemen. Thanks for the time.\nJude Bricker: Hi, Catherine.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey. Maybe just one follow-up on the captain upgrade issue. I know you said in your prepared remarks, it's getting better but a little slower than hoped. I guess how has your capacity and unit cost outlook changed over the last couple of months, if at all, as we head into 2024? And how sensitive is that guidance to maybe seeing that captain upgrade issue going better than expected next year? Just trying to get a sense of sensitivities there. Thanks.\nDave Davis: Yeah, I'll give you my view on that. I think our planning -- the sort of 2024 growth numbers I gave, let's say, high single, low double-digit numbers are very achievable numbers. And then the roughly flat CASM numbers are essentially a function of that. I think if we continue to see favorability in some of these upgrade trends, we can grow the airline more quickly than that. And we don't need additional aircraft to do it given the utilization opportunity that exists. Any more growth is going to have a positive impact on CASM. So I would say that our view probably hasn't changed that much in the last couple of months, maybe gotten a little bit more conservative on the growth front, but there hasn't been anything sort of drastic.\nJude Bricker: What might surprise everybody is that as we grow utilization and focus that incremental capacity into peak periods, you'd likely see an increase in unit revenue as well, because the foregone flying largely resides in periods of peak demand. Pilot constraints are a monthly block hour metric. And so you think about a really volatile demand environment like what we're designed to deal with and then push down those peaks, that foregone flying tends to be at a higher than average level for unit revenues. And so you'll see a lot of traction as we get into increasing utilization. That's going to happen a little more quickly because we're re-leasing out some airplanes. But -- and it's linear. It's not going to be like one day, we wake up, and everything's sorted out. It's just going to continue to get better, I think, as we move forward into the next couple of months.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. And maybe just a little bit of a follow-up to that. So, as you have the ability to flex up those peaks, is the first -- as utilization increases overall, like, is the first priority to peak the scheduled service? I know you also talk about adding ad hoc charters or maybe the answer is both, just depending on the season. Just any color there would be helpful.\nJude Bricker: Yeah, both is the answer. I mean, keep in mind, the way we integrate charters and sched service is unique in the industry. So we'll build aircraft routing that incorporates both of those lines of business depending on the season. And so the predominance of incremental growth will be in sched service, but we intend to grow charters next year as well.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. If I can sneak one last one in? I just want to make sure I'm not mixing apples and oranges as we think about the go-forward on scheduled service RASM. You both kind of made comments that you'd expect that versus 2019 trend, which has been 30%-plus higher over the last couple of quarters, you weren't expecting any major change. I don't know what your forecast on scheduled service ASM is, so that would be helpful. But I guess like if I just plug in plus up 30% something scheduled service RASM in the fourth quarter, I think that implies up year-over-year, and some admittedly very quick math, is that what you're expecting? Or help me figure out what...\nJude Bricker: No. So, what the point I'm making is that since the beginning of the year, we've seen a kind of a reset into pre-COVID levels. I'm using 2019 as a comp, and it's very stable between 35% and 40% on a scheduled service TRASM basis year over four, month by month. And what is important is that we had a really strong and rapid domestic recovery in the summer of '22. That recovery then moved into the near international like Mexican and Caribbean markets for last winter. And now it's transatlantic. It's probably going to go into the Pacific, I would guess. But the point is it's kind of resetting on a more permanent basis to very similar peak, off-peak trends that we saw pre-COVID, but just at a higher level. The one comp I'd call out is December. December had the best of all calendar setups in December of '19, and it's going to be a little bit of a more difficult comp. It will still be a lot better in 2023, but it won't be at that 35% level. So that -- in the quarter -- the fourth quarter for us kind of goes as December goes.\nDave Davis: Yeah. And just maybe I didn't say it clearly enough, but the number I quoted was six consecutive quarters of 25%-up plus, and we expect that trend to continue.\nCatherine O'Brien: Very clear. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker of TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks, operator. Hi, team. Thank you for the time here. Just two questions. One is the scheduled service revenue in the third quarter looked like a sequential decline that was bigger than what we've seen in prior quarters, notwithstanding Dave's comment about being up 25%. And we saw a smaller increase in ancillaries. I'm just wondering if there's anything going on there.\nJude Bricker: Hey, Helane. Dave is looking at some numbers. But I just want to caution you on sequential for us because we're just really, really seasonal. So, the year-over-year change in the second quarter versus in the third quarter certainly settled down. That was a function of two things. One, we're growing a lot faster. But also, the comps in '22 were really challenging. And they lasted well into the fall season, which is something that's pretty rare for us. And that was focused on big city connectivity into Minneapolis, like I call out Boston, Seattle, big markets like that, that were really strong in the third quarter. And those have since settled down into a more permanent increase versus pre-COVID levels, but flat on the year-over-four basis.\nHelane Becker: Got it. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question is the announcement that you made regarding the ads, and it wasn't today, right, the ads out of Minneapolis for, I guess, next maybe winter and next summer. Have you seen any -- I mean, do you think of yourself as a spill carrier so you wouldn't see much pushback from Delta? Or do you see them saying, \"Hey, if they're doing a good job in this market, maybe we should be there, too?\"\nJude Bricker: Helane, let me give you a couple of thoughts, and I'll call Grant in here to add. So first, we have a strong brand in the Minneapolis market. We're certainly a spill carrier in some of our non-Minneapolis scheduled service flying opportunities. But in Minneapolis, we invest in the brand. We market to the community. We have a vibrant loyalty program. So, I don't view us as -- at all as a spill carrier in the Minneapolis metroplex. And that shows up in the way that we plan that schedule specifically for these reliable demand patterns. We announced 10 new markets. A lot of those markets support our MLS partnership with sched service, and I think this is going to be a theme for us. We're going to continue to connect Minneapolis to domestic and international markets focused on VFR traffic in the summer months between Memorial Day and Labor Day. And then in the winter time, it's going to be a little bit of new markets but mostly same-store sales growth as we continue to expand out into the peak opportunities with fleet growth and pilot work group expansion. So -- and that's in real contrast to what we do, say, to the Mexican and Caribbean markets out of Texas in the summer. In the past, we've flown the Hawaiian markets off the West Coast, and that is certainly being a spill carrier. But we're just very strategic about when we apply capacity so that we can deliver high unit revenues. Do you have anything else?\nGrant Whitney: The only thing I'd add to that, Jude, is, yes, being the leisure carrier of choice up here, we added 15 new markets this year. They all work. They're all coming back. We extended -- or we added these new 10. Delta is a formidable carrier. They have a really strong hub here. We never expect to have uncontested non-stops. But the business is -- we feel very comfortable that we'll be successful, and we have sort of past examples to back up that framework.\nJude Bricker: One more thing on Delta. We want Delta to be successful in the market because it serves business customers, and we want a vibrant business community here in the Twin Cities. So I think we serve completely different segments of the market. And we launched these 10 new -- announced these 10 new markets, and they did change their schedule in a few of the markets to add some non-stop opportunities. Most of it's on regional connectivity. I think that's consistent with everything we've seen with them since the Sun Country transition began in 2018 or so.\nHelane Becker: Got it. Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks, team.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Dave, you had called out...\nDave Davis: Hey, Michael.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey. You had called out fourth quarter. You talked about, I guess, a large number of heavy checks, I guess, on maintenance. What would be the impact of that maybe on a margin basis? And what are some of the other sort of pressure points? If I think about margins down year-over-year, fuel is a good guy. What are some of -- is it labor? Is it maintenance? Any color on that would be great.\nDave Davis: Yeah. So, the number of checks in the fourth quarter are about 3 times what they were in the fourth quarter of 2022. So that is a significant driver, and it's just the timing of checks. It's probably a $4 million to $5 million issue for us in Q4. So it is not small. That's probably the only one that sort of stands out for me there. But that's just -- that's airframe heavy checks. It's on our schedule, and we can't do much about it.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Good. And then just my second question, it was interesting, one of your fellow low-fare competitors was talking about refocusing on different markets and maybe allocating more of their flying to underserved markets versus overserved. And Minneapolis came up at least, I think, twice on that call. And I think you guys know Minneapolis better than anyone, Jude, you and Grant. Your thinking on that? Is it an underserved market? Is there gate availability? Should we be concerned that we're going to see more low-fare competition in that market? I know you've dealt with low-fare competitors in the past. Any thoughts on that comment? Thank you.\nJude Bricker: Yeah. I think what's interesting is how the U.S. market has kind of differentiated itself. And I think largely, the success of U.S. carriers over the last quarter has been about how they deal with off-peak demand. And there's kind of three ways they do it. One is the network carriers, which focus on business customers. They've also largely been able to take advantage of a longer Atlantic season this year. Or the ULCC guys, one of which you're talking about there, they just discount into that environment and try to stimulate some demand. Or there's guys like us and we just cut out those flights. And I think our method is the best, obviously. And what I'd say is like -- and that makes us kind of uniquely capable of serving this, in particular, the Minneapolis, but also, I think it applies to some other markets as we grow demand profile that's really volatile. And there's no -- we have 98 markets out of Minneapolis. Five of them are year round. And so, just -- the Minneapolis consumer wants to go very different places at different times based on the calendar, and we're designed to do that. So I'm not too concerned about it. I think we'll continue to have some overlap, particularly in the kind of traditionally largest leisure markets like Cancun, Orlando and Vegas, for example, and then probably also Detroit and Denver because those two carriers serve those markets a lot. But I don't think that changes my outlook at all. Grant, anything to add?\nGrant Whitney: The other thing I would add to that is we've added a lot of service to a lot of new markets. So we've added new markets that allow customers here, notably leisure customers, to go non-stop. The other thing that I think is a really important component of this, Mike, is that Minneapolis has high point of sale coming out of the market. So all that has been done by this team to build the brand, build our seat share is really powerful because as people go and look for places to go, they really come to -- they'll go to delta.com, but they'll also kind of suncountry.com. So for others to come into the marketplace, it isn't just as easy as saying, \"Hey, I'm going to put planes up here, and they're going to be successful.\" There's a lot of work to get us into what we built and developed over the last few years.\nJude Bricker: And I can't overstate the volatility of our schedule. We'll have days with 150 flights and days with three in the third quarter. And it's just -- that's how we're able to generate these unit revenues reliably.\nMichael Linenberg: Yeah. Great. And just if I could squeeze in one quick last one, Jude. If you had the right amount of pilot time so that you could really lean in during the peaks during the September quarter, how much better -- like how much margin have you left on the table because you're not at the optimal staffing level just yet, knowing that, that additional flying tends to be very high margin? Just trying to...\nJude Bricker: So, our variable contribution in July is about 40%. And that's -- so incremental flying into that period would be a little bit lower than that because when we're capacity constrained on monthly block hours, we'll bunch together the flights on the peakiest of days. So, we'd be expanding into Wednesdays and Saturdays, for example, but it'd still be in the 30%, 25% range. And that demand period would have lasted into the beginning of August. So that 3,500 of foregone block hours probably would produce somewhere in the range of $7 million to $10 million of operating earnings for the quarter.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Very good. Thank you. Thanks everyone for answering my questions.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe. Your line is now open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Afternoon. I know we talked about the fourth quarter RASM assumptions, but maybe just help us with some of the other pieces in the fourth quarter revenue guide, scheduled service capacity and then maybe expectations on charter and cargo revenue.\nJude Bricker: I'll start with the easy one. Cargo is fairly flat, which we would expect every quarter to be from kind of looking forward. Dave, anything else?\nDave Davis: Yeah. I mean, we talked about what our sort of -- what our revenue growth and our block hour growth expectations are for the fourth quarter. I think we're probably going to see unit revenues down moderately in the fourth quarter, and we've got largely these maintenance costs as the biggest driver of CASM in Q4. I think those are sort of the major trends.\nScott Group: Okay. And then maybe -- I get there's a lot of seasonality to your model each quarter, and there's just not a lot of pre-pandemic history. Just so what I'm hoping to get some help on here is, right, if you just look at the operating margins, Q1 was 20%, Q2 was 15%, Q3, 8%, now this quarter is 4%. I mean, what's your -- like what's the margin run rate do you think we're at right now entering 2024? Is this based on what you know today? Is this a mid single digit margin, a high single-digit margin, a double-digit margin? I just -- it's hard to know, right? There's so much seasonality. We just don't have a lot of history.\nJude Bricker: Our pre-tax trailing 12-month margin is 10.2%. And so you were talking about operating margins, so that put operating margin probably in the 14% range. I mean, I think that's something we should be able to continually replicate.\nDave Davis: I think that 14% number is replicatable in the near future, and the potential for the business is greater than that. I mean, Jude mentioned the number. Once we get sort of the full advantage of the peak opportunities, particularly in the summer months, we should be able to do better than that sort of mid-teens operating margin number.\nScott Group: And you feel like you've got visibility to that low-teens op margin next year?\nJude Bricker: Yeah. I mean, we're selling through Labor Day. So we have pretty good visibility into sales. I don't know if you watch our schedule that much, but we're adding January. Other commentary you're seeing around the industry is people cutting back in January as being a trough period. We're seeing the need for more capacity and also responding to improved pilot staffing situation. Yeah, I think it looks kind of pretty good in the first quarter.\nDave Davis: Yeah. So I mean, we're not giving full-year 2024 guidance at this point. But based on where we're at now in terms of getting our plan together for next year, we think we have some very achievable revenue and cost goals, and they put our op margin in that range that we were just talking about.\nScott Group: Okay. And then maybe just lastly, just some of the puts and takes around free cash flow for next year. It sounds like CapEx coming down a bunch. But how do you think about free cash flow next year?\nDave Davis: Yeah. So free cash flow is going to be significantly higher. First of all, again, not to give too much '24 guidance, but we expect a material improvement in results next year and a drastic reduction in CapEx. So I think we're going to be a very strong free cash flow generator, which is one of the reasons we felt comfortable allocating another $25 million to share repurchases. We will continue on this track. Our aircraft are largely purchased. Operating results look strong. Based on what we've seen so far, we'll continue to make the best use of our cash as we generate it.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you for the time guys. Appreciate it.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, this does conclude our question-and-answer session.

My name is Josh, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that Today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Allen, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Allen, you may begin.\nChris Allen : Thank you. I'm joined today by Jude Bricker, our Chief Executive Officer; Dave Davis, President, and Chief Financial Officer and a group of others to help answer questions.  Before we began. I'd like to remind everyone that during this call, the company may make certain statements and constitute forward-looking statements. Our remarks today may include forward-looking statements which are based upon management's current beliefs, expectations, assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, we encourage you to review the risk factors and cautionary statements outlined our earnings release and our most recent SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. You can find our second quarter earnings press release on the Investor Relations portion at ir.suncountry.com.  With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Jude. \nJude Bricker : Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Our diversified business model is unique in the airline industry, due to the predictability of our charter and cargo businesses, we are able to deliver the most flexible schedule service capacity in the industry. The combination of our schedule, flexibility and low fixed cost model allow us to respond to both predictable leisure demand fluctuations, and exogenous industry shocks.  We believe due to our structural advantages we will be able to reliably deliver the industry leading profitability throughout all cycles.  We crossed a few milestones since our last call that I wanted to highlight. First Sun Country surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the 12 months ending in June, first for our 40-year-old company. In 2Q we carried over a million scheduled service passengers for the first time in any quarter. We regained our position as the top margin carrier among the 11 carriers for the 12 months ending in second quarter. Recall that we were the first into this pilot contract cycle.  In July, we executed a record number of flights in a day, being able to deliver quality operations during peak days is a key priority for us as we execute our variable capacity model. This growth and performance is a testament to all our frontline employees that deliver for our customers every day.  Consistent with the theme of the last several calls, we've remained in an environment where demand across all our segments is strong. As it's been a common topic around the industry, I wanted to give some color on the revenue environment for our scheduled business.  Our second quarter scheduled service TRASM was up 10% year on year on ASM growth of 6% certainly very positive results. We expect to be able to accelerate scheduled service ASM growth into the third quarter to mid-teens. And we expect TRASM to be down slightly year on year. However, I want to point out that scheduled service TRASM for 2019 was up 1Q and 2Q by 34% and 43% respectively. We expect 3Q to fall between those bounds. So we're seeing unit revenue stabilized at a substantially higher level verse pre-COVID levels. This reset seems to be persistent based on sales into our selling schedule currently out through April 2024.  Minneapolis by far our largest market has been particularly robust through the COVID recovery. This summer, we launched 15 new markets all are performing well. Since I've been in Sun Country, we haven't had any MSP markets that didn't have a positive contribution. That's pretty amazing.  One thing I'd like to call out is future cash flow. This year will produce about 50% more flights than were performed in 2019. In two years I expect departures to grow versus this year by over 30%. We can produce those growth figures with the addition of only three net aircraft to the fleet at about a $60 million cost along with the redelivery of our 900s currently leased out. All three of the expected deliveries already have committed financing. So this free cash flow gives us the confidence in executing on the share buyback recently approved by our board.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave. \nDave Davis : Thanks, Jude. Q2 was a historically strong quarter for Sun Country, despite it being among the seasonally weaker quarters for our business. Total revenue increased 19.2% year-over-year to $261.1 million, while earnings before taxes were $26.8 million, versus a loss of $4.8 million in Q2 of 2022.  Adjusted op margin was 15.3% for the quarter. Revenue earnings and margin results were historically record highs for the second quarter.  Revenue from our passenger business continued to stay strong and Q2, increasing 16.6% year-over-year to $227.9 million. Scheduled service plus ancillary sales generated $178.2 million in revenue, which was 16.8% higher than last year. This easily exceeded a 5.6% growth in scheduled service ASMs which driven by a 2.7% growth in total fare to $177 and a 2-point increase in load factor to 85.8%.  Scheduled service TRASM grew 10.3% versus Q2 of last year. Since the second quarter of last year, we've seen a significant sustained increase in our scheduled service TRASM versus pre-COVID levels. We believe this is driven by the continued optimization of our network and changes in the public's demand for leisure travel. As Jude mentioned, during Q2 our scheduled service TRASM was a 43% versus 2019, and in Q3 of this year, we expect scheduled service TRASM to be up at least 35% versus Q3 of '19. We don't see any sign of scheduled service TRASM numbers returning to pre-COVID levels, rather they appear to be stabilizing at the higher levels we're now experiencing.  Charter revenue in the second quarter grew by 16.1% to $49.6 million, unblock our growth of 23.9%. A portion of our charter revenue consists of reimbursement from customers for changes in fuel prices as we do not take fewer risks on our charter flying. Q2 fuel prices dropped by over 38% versus last year. If you exclude the fuel reimbursement revenue from both Q2 of '23 and Q2 of '22. Charter revenue grew 33.6% over the period and charter revenue per block hour grew by 8%.  Program charter flying was 87% of total charter block hours versus 92% in Q2 of last year. We'll continue to pursue more ad-hoc businesses as available capacity increases.  Second quarter cargo revenue grew 18.1% to $25 million on a 10.4% increase in block hours. Last year we had lower levels of flying due to scheduled maintenance events, and the annual increases in our Amazon contract occurred in December of 2022.  We expect year-over-year aggregate growth to peak in Q3 and moderate thereafter. We're expecting full year 2023 block hour growth to be in the high-single digit range. As always, our unique model allows us to move cast capacity between lines of businesses conditions,  Now let me turn now to cost. Total operating expenses increased 4.5% on an 11.3% increase in total block hours for the second quarter. Adjusted CASM was up 10.4% versus Q2 of '22. This compares to a 14% increase in the year-over-year comparison for Q1. We expect year-over-year CASM growth to continue to moderate in the quarters ahead.  Daily aircraft utilization was still 9.5% lower year-over-year, which continues to put pressure on unit costs. Total non-fuel operating costs increased by approximately 25% versus Q2 of last year. Significant drivers of this increase include the aircraft ownership costs for the five 737-9 hundreds we currently leased to Oman Air, as well as non-repeating costs for the vesting of management stock options, and a payment to one of our labor groups to settle past grievances. Excluding these expenses non-fuel operating costs would have increased by 19.8% year-over-year. Fuel expense decreased 32% versus last year.  Regarding our balance sheet, our total liquidity at the end of Q2 was $263 million, which was slightly higher than the amount at the end of Q1. Year-to-date, through July we spent $210 million on CapEx, which is funded a majority of our planned aircraft growth into 2025. We expect to be able to achieve our growth objectives over the next two years, with higher aircraft utilization and the addition of only three net aircraft. As a result, we're expecting CapEx to decline considerably in '24 and '25.  Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of Q2 was 2.3. Since we do not have a significant debt burden, we have flexibility and how we deploy our cash. Since Q4 of last year, we spent $47.3 million on share repurchases. Our boards authorized another 30 million in repurchase authority, which brings our current available share repurchase authority to $32.8 million. Turning now to guidance. We're anticipating Q3 total revenue to be between $240 million and $250 million, an increase of 8% to 13% versus Q2 of '22 on a block our increase in 13% to 16%. We're forecasting a $2.90 per gallon fuel price in the quarter. Operating margin for the quarter is forecasted to be between 6% and 11%.  The fundamentals of our unique diversified business remains strong and our model is highly resilient to changes in macro economic conditions. Our focus remains on profitable growth.  And with that, we will open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Hey, good morning. Just on charter, can you talk a little bit and just remind us how fuel change by year-over-year impacts revenue trends in charter and also margins in charter.\nDave Davis : So I think it's important to break out what charter includes. There's several track programs, we have a fleet of 60 aircraft, five of them are dedicated to track programs plus the VIP. So it's basically six aircraft. And those have absolutely passed through in fuel.  We have a significant amount of ad hoc business that is predominantly sports programs. Again, that's 100% pass through. Sometimes however, we need to position aircraft at our costs. So there's a little bit of flying that we do and support those that has fuel at risk. And then there's the military business, which is 100% pass through. So it's effectively over 90% perfect pass through. \nJude Bricker : Yeah, I mean, think of it this way, Duane. So we negotiated charter contract in that charter contract is a reference price. Okay, if fuel is higher or lower than that reference price, we get reimbursed from the charter customer for either more or less based on the fuel price.  When fuel is really high, the reimbursement is higher, so the revenue looks higher. When fuel is really low, the reimbursement is less, so the revenue looks less. \nDuane Pfennigwerth : Got it. And then for some of the seasonal flying that you do, can you just remind us, to what extent Mexico or Cancun is a part of that seasonal set? Obviously, we heard some more cautious comments on Cancun, specifically from Spirit yesterday, but could you just kind of comment on your trends to maybe Mexico and near Caribbean?\nJude Bricker : Yeah. I'll give you some backdrop. Our international network is focused from Minneapolis in the wintertime. And in the summertime, the predominance of our international network is focused on origination in southern large markets. The distinction there is that the southern business is largely a scraping business where we don't support that flying with a lot of marketing. We're not focused on building a brand and some of these origination markets in contrast to what we do out of Minneapolis in the wintertime.  And therefore, we're a little more subject in the summertime to the prevailing airfare in some of these international markets. And I would be -- I agree with Dave's comments about some of the weakness that we're seeing in southern markets, but these are still highly profitable markets for us. And we have the ability to dial capacity to whatever optimal level is supported by the fair environment at that given time.  Most of our international markets in the summertime are now winding down and we'll be out of by the end of August. And then we'll focus on building up are largely Minneapolis but also some Milwaukee and a few others, where we fly winter markets as we approach into the fourth quarter.  Any color, Grant?\nGrant Whitney: Yeah, just echoed Jude's comments that there was a little pressure this year. But the results were on an absolute basis. We're still acceptable for us down for maybe what we've exceeded. And, but we do some unique things down there. There's one market that has been particularly strong for us, which is Harlingen, which did not have sort of the competitive impacts. And that one performed very nicely.  So to Jude's point, our agility will make it work. We've been there for a while. And it's going to be something we continue to do in the summer.\nJude Bricker : My diagnosis is Cancun, because it was a really strong summer in '22. And a lot of carriers chase that demand into this summer. And if you look at capacity levels, year on year, it was -- Cancun was the beneficiary of a lot of capacity growth in that drove down fares. I think there's still strong structural demand. And we can, as I mentioned, fly in any environment and be successful.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Okay, makes sense. I'm going to have to look up that originating market that you talked about, I'm going to go look at my map. But, I appreciate the thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nCatherine O'Brien : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Hey, another topic that's been popular this earnings season is, domestic carriers having to right size day a week, just based on their current view on, on where corporate now sits? Not that's a market use case. But, I know your network has less overlap with some of these carriers. But have you started to see any pickup and competitive capacity into the fall or early winter, as these changes take place in other airline schedules.\nJude Bricker : Generally, our capacity environment is constructive, meaning that a lot of growth. We are seeing some build backs into Minneapolis, based on 2019 levels, stuff that was coming back from non-Delta carriers. And so, but that's perfectly fine.  On the day a week stuff, I mean, this sort of what we do. And I don't think it should be a surprise to anybody that Vegas is a little weaker on Tuesdays than it is on weekend demand patterns. So, we built the business around that it's not a substantial change. Here's a point that I can bring up, which is perhaps out of consensus.  July doesn't have a lot of day week sensitivity. There's a tremendous amount of demand, but it's elastic. As compared to March, which has these fantastic days. So there's really deep demand that's inelastic on a few given days, particularly around spring break travel patterns.  So July, we need to be a lot bigger than we were. And that means adding into off-peak periods. So we have a capacity constraint, that's a block our constraint based on pilot availability. And so we choose to put our flying on the very best of days during that month.  However, if we had more flying, we would expand and flatten the schedule, with a relatively moderate or de minimis even reduction and unit revenues because the off-peak days are so powerful. In contrast, September is completely different. And as it always has been -- there's just not a lot of midweek opportunities in September.  And I agree with the overall sentiment that there is a focus, a renewed focus perhaps, from the Big Three on to leisure demand, which is crowding out somewhat leisure carriers when there is limited demand. But we've already focused on flying around those limited demand periods. And so for us, it's really about adding into off peak periods during peak months.  So it's a more nuanced and complicated matter, I think then the market is making sense of it at this point. Our opportunity is to grow into these 40% variable contribution scheduled service networks that we have during peak months and that's what gets our third quarter margins up into the mid-teens from where they are today at this fuel price.\nCatherine O'Brien : Got it. That's really helpful thanks for the perspective. Maybe just two quick ones on cost for Dave. So you're just coming back to the CASM commentary through your end that eases. Can you just give us some more color on if that's ratable like what's a step down and each quarter or anything you should be aware of an 4Q capacity growth.  And then just on the share base comp, in the press release, you notice it was like a one-off that's been in stock comp, but 1Q wasn't too far below this quarter, both relevant elevate last year. Can you just give us some color on how we should expect that to try and just outside of your commentary on CASM [ph].Thanks so much.\nDave Davis : Yeah, sure. So essentially, I think what, what -- this is consistent with Jude's commentary is, we're a little bit oversized. We mentioned on the aircraft front, we have enough aircraft, we add a two more to really sustain reasonable growth levels through 2025. So we're a little oversized, and as we continue -- and that's negatively impacting CASM. As we sort of roll forward into the quarters ahead.  And you see some of this growth, particularly like some of the third quarter growth, and then some growth going out in the fourth quarter as well. Those year-over-year numbers will begin to -- will continue to, I should say moderate. So we should be single digit kind of stuff in the third quarter and fourth quarter. I'm not giving guidance on yet but we should just think continually improving year-over-year trends here on the CASM front.  Regarding the management options, there was -- there were a number of folks here who had considerable options from Apollo, when we -- when the original acquisition was made. Apollo's ownership which I think is an important point for investors has continued to drop and is now sub-30%, that the company. So the overhang is getting less and less. But that 30% was a sort of a trigger for the vesting of management options that happened last quarter. So when we fell below that number, a significant number of management options vested.  So those original options are now fully vested. So vesting costs will not continue to recur in the quarters ahead, at least for those for those options. So that number will moderate.\nCatherine O'Brien : Okay, great. Thanks so much, Dave.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Helane Becker with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nTom Fitzgerald : Hi, thanks very much. This is Tom Fitzgerald on for Helane. My question is just on what you're seeing in terms of pilot attrition and how you're feeling about getting first officers to upgrade into the captain seat? I appreciate any color you could have. Thanks very much.\nJude Bricker : I'll make some very general comments and then Greg, if you want to jump in. Well, we don't have any problem hiring pilots and our attrition is consistently below where we had expected it would be at this time. The issue boils down really to getting pilots to upgrade to captains. So we're constrained in the left seat and we continue to make strides in improving that figure. And as we will grow as we upgrade captains.\nGreg Mays : Yeah, I mean -- to Jude's point, we don't have a problem hiring pilots right now. We've got really robust applications. We've got a great recruiting team.  On the attrition front, we watch that daily. That stayed within our expectations. We see these other deals that are going on out there now that might affect that attrition. But we believe we can moderate that with additional cost sizes that we can fill. So as Jude said, it really does come down to our ability to grow is at the rate of our captain upgrades.\nJude Bricker : And this is an industry-wide issue as the -- and in the case of the Big Tree they did a bunch of early retirements, and so everybody is trying to get pilots to their training pipeline and rightsize their pilot groups is taking a little time.\nDave Davis : Yeah, I think one of the points as you know we've talked about this point for now in number of quarters. This continues to be a challenge for us, but I think you can look at the growth that we're looking at here in the third quarter as a testament to the fact that we are making progress, but it's not linear, it's bumpy and this is the focus.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nMike Linenberg : Hey, good morning, everyone. I did get on a few minutes late, and I apologize if you may have addressed this. But just going from a 15% operating margin you're guiding 6% to 11%. We're coming off of what was one of -- seasonally one of your weaker quarters. What are sort of the primary drivers there? Is it things like fuel? I know September is a tough month for you guys. Can you just run through some of the puts and takes you're thinking behind that de-sell and profitability? Thanks.\nJude Bricker : I mean, the main thing is segmented capacity allocation. So we have very consistent profitability from our track and cargo programs, track, charter and cargo programs. And it's a good thing that they -- in many ways, it's a good thing that they are flat in capacity. And then we have scheduled service which is variable.  And as I mentioned and Dave alluded to, we're flying our airplanes in July, one of the strongest demand months of the year at about eight hours a day, and that number should be 10 to 11, and those are 40% incremental margin opportunities that we're cutting out because of capacity constraints that don't have anything to do with opportunity or airplanes, it's really about staffing. So that's the biggest thing.  In contrast, the second quarter is relatively flat demand period as compared to the third quarter. So third quarter -- the way the third quarter goes July, in contrast, the second quarter has a really good April, a really good June. May is not great, but it's not that bad. It's not as bad as September. So it's a lot more flat, and that's the difference in the two quarters.\nMike Linenberg : Makes sense. Jude did you mention what your ASMs will be, up scheduled ASMs in the September quarter?\nDave Davis: We didn't mention that. I don't think we have an issue sharing it. I just don't have it in front of me. We can get it to you.\nJude Bricker : I got it, it's about mid-teens.\nMike Linenberg : Okay. Mid-teens, okay. And then just my last question and this is more of a modeling question as we think about the rental revenue, the $6 million is that sort of the right quarterly run-rate? And when does that start to fade out? What is it sometime late '24-'25? Thanks for taking my questions. \nJude Bricker : Yeah, that's right. The fade-out will begin really in November 2024 and then continue through November 2025 as the five aircraft roll off and come to us to operate.\nMike Linenberg : Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Christopher Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna Investment Group. You may proceed. \nChristopher Stathoulopoulos : Good morning, everyone. Just want to get back to the comment you made on, I believe you said that the stock comp should be moderating given the changes in the vesting schedule. So, could you help frame the implied operating income for 3Q? How should we think about stock comp there? I believe this quarter was a little north of 15%, that's a significant step up from recent quarters.  I just want to better understand how we should think about that underlying as we think about the second half of the year? Thank you. \nDave Davis : Yeah. I don't have that precise number in front of me, it will just be a significant step down. I mean in the second quarter there was a significant chunk of options that had not yet vested, they all vested in one quarter. So there'll be a step down number. I just don't have that in front of me.  As it pertains to the 2018 option grant that was associated with Apollo transaction, all those options are either vested or done. So that goes to zero. Yeah, so, exactly. So that number goes to zero and as with any other company, we have an RSU program, which is ongoing, so there'll be some stock comp expense that continues just at a significantly lower level.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos : Okay. The second question. So I think you're backing out the DNA associated with these five dry leases from your CASMx. Could you just walk us through the rationale why, I'm guessing because they don't have associated ASMs. And -- but you're including the revenue side of it. And then also as those come off, I think you said dry lease in 2025.  Could you just kind of walk us through how we should think about the unit cost impact or unit margin? Just want to kind of better understand this relationship here that's sitting in revenue here, but it looks like it's coming out of your CASM. Thanks.\nDave Davis : Yeah. So, I mean it's sitting in revenue and it's sitting in expense in our financials. But since -- as you pointed out, it doesn't generate any ASMs. We take it out of the CASM comp and it's out of the TRASM comp. So it's out of unit costs on the revenue side and on the cost side, in the same way that our cargo revenue wasn't in our cost per ASM or revenue per ASM number that generate ASM.\nJude Bricker : Just strategically, I want to just reiterate from last quarter. We are not being a lessor. We are just acquiring airplanes for future delivery. So when we report, we are doing our best to back out all those results so that you can kind of see the underlying success of the business, which is what we care about.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos : Okay. And then follow on one more -- yeah, I'm sorry. Go ahead.\nDave Davis : No, I just want to follow up quickly, I just pulled the numbers. So stock comp in the second quarter I think is around 4.5% that number will probably drop to $1 million plus or minus.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos : For 3Q, or second half or?\nDave Davis : No, for 3Q.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos : Okay. Great, thanks. And then just if I could get in one more here. So we've heard from U.S. peers talking about how the strong international travel is pulling from a pool of what would be domestic travelers. And are you seeing any of that? And if so, what are your thoughts on when that might slow? Thank you.\nJude Bricker : I mean, my view is that we observe something and then try to make up a reason why it exists. And so, it's true that the transatlantic yields are much higher than they had been. I think it's a stretch to say that those folks that are flying transatlantic would have otherwise flown domestic.  I think more confidently we can say summer of '22 was an outlier in demand recovery with a lot of recapture from the previous years. Instead, we're going down to a fairly consistent year over four unit revenue environment month-by-month where improvements are between 35% and 45%. And that seems consistent going into all the bookings we're seeing through the spring of next year.  So, I think it's a little much to draw that conclusion. But I think what gets me excited is just, it looks like fares have sort of permanently reset into a post-COVID environment for our network anyway. Anything else, Grant?\nGrant Whitney: I would just add to that, that those unit revenues versus '19, I think we're at the high end of that. So that's specific to us and a testament for the good job this team has done. And I also think Jude's comments are spot on. If you look at our network, we grew -- Jude mentioned 15 new markets this summer. They've all met expectations.  Our load factors are up. So we saw strong demand across our network and really happy with the results.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos : Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jude Bricker for any closing remarks.\nJude Bricker : Thanks for joining us. Thanks for your interest in Sun Country, and we'll talk to you again at the end of the next quarter. Good morning, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. You can find our first quarter earnings press release on the Investor Relations portion of our website at ir.suncountry.com. With that said, I'd like to now turn the call over to Jude.\nJude Bricker: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Our diversified business model is unique in the airline industry. Due to the predictability of our charter and cargo businesses, we're able to deliver the most flexible scheduled service capacity in the industry. The combination of our schedule, flexibility, and low fixed-cost model, allows us to respond to both predictable leisure demand fluctuations and exogenous industry shocks. We believe due to our structural advantages, we'll be able to reliably deliver the industry-leading profitability throughout all cycles. Core to our low frequency model is being able to deliver excellent operational results. And again, we've done that and through a difficult winter. We finished the quarter with 99.9% controllable completion factor in our scheduled service. Thank you to all our team members working every day to deliver for our customers. I'm proud to announce our first quarter adjusted operating margin at 20%. I get plenty of questions from the investment community about what Sun Country results would look like in a normalized environment. I thought it'd be helpful to highlight some of the conditions in the first quarter, which are rare historically. First, fuel prices in the quarter were high. I'm not taking a market position on fuel. We manage fuel prices with our variable capacity model. Further, about 40% of our flying has fuel as a pass-through. I want to point out, however, that during peak periods like March, we fly as much as we're able. So, fuel prices during that time are passed through directly to results. Today, we're buying fuel about 60% cheaper than we were in the first quarter average price. Secondly, we had particularly challenging weather this winter in Minneapolis. Challenging weather isn't rare, but our network is focused on Minneapolis this time of year, and the Twin Cities had one of the top snowfall winners on record. That's probably good for demand, but drives a lot of costs in our business. We had two major snowstorms that shut down Minneapolis Airport, which is rare. The resulting cancels from these closures negatively affected results by several million dollars. Some regions of our network posted uncommon results that I don't think we should expect to be recurring. West Florida is a big part of our network this time of year. The region continues to recover from Hurricane Ian. We expect the region to be back next year with higher unit revenues and capacity. Minneapolis International, in contrast, was particularly strong this year. 1Q \u201822 was affected by Omicron, so year-over-year improvement was dramatic. I expect international capacity growth to moderate this region's TRASM in the future. Finally, and most impactful, we remain block hour-constrained due to staffing. In 1Q \u201819, we flew our aircraft 9.7 block hours per aircraft day on average. This quarter, our utilization was 7.3. Increasing flying on the same fleet will have substantial positive impact on results. In sum, I expect future 1Q margins to exceed 1Q \u201923 more often than not.  Looking at the rest of 2023, we continue to see strong leisure demand across our network, which is currently selling through mid-December. Of particular note, we expect the recent increase in ancillary revenue to continue to drive positive TRASM trends even as we lap the COVID recovery, and increased schedule service growth rates going into the back of the year. I also want to call out a fleet deal that we announced about a month ago. We purchased five 737-900 ERs that are currently leased to another operator until their return and induction in our fleet. We're not opening a new line of business. This is just a way for us to guarantee future capacity growth and get scale in a new variant. We expect these aircraft to contribute more to our results in our operation than while we're leasing them out. However, in the meantime, we expect positive impact of about $1 million a month in operating income due to the five leases.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave. \nDave Davis: Thanks, Jude. We're pleased to report very strong Q1 results, which I'll detail in a minute, that were the highest in Sun Country's current history. Total revenue, up income, adjusted pre-tax, and adjusted net income, were the highest they've been since we transitioned Sun Country to the airline that it is today starting in 2017. Despite an increase in fuel prices of nearly 8%, adjusted pre-tax income for the quarter increased 235% versus Q1 of \u201822 to $52.5 million. The adjusted pre-tax margin for the quarter was 18%. I'll start now with a discussion of revenue and capacity.  The revenue environment remains very strong. Q1 \u201823 total operating revenue of $294.1 million, was 30% higher than the year ago quarter. Total block hours grew by nearly 4% year-over-year, and system ASMs were up 1%. Scheduled service business remains particularly strong. The scheduled service TRASM grew 35% versus last year on a 3.5% decline in scheduled service ASMs. Ticket plus ancillary revenue grew 31% year-over-year, as we saw a 21% increase in total fare to $221.47, and a nearly nine percentage point growth in load factor to 88.1%. We see signs of revenue strength in the second quarter, even as we start to lapse on strong gains last year. Charter revenue grew rapidly year-over-year, with a 41% increase in the first quarter versus Q1 of \u201822. Our program charter business, which is flying done under long-term contracts, drove the growth, as program block hours increased 52% versus last year. The bulk of this increase was due to increased flying under our Caesars and MLS contracts. Ad hoc charter flying, which was 14% smaller than Q1 of \u201922, continues to be undersized versus both the potential opportunity and its historic level at Sun Country. Demand in the scheduled service business led us to allocate our limited capacity there versus picking up ad hoc trips. As our capacity continues to increase, we expect ad hoc flying to grow substantially. As a whole, we expect charter block hour growth to continue throughout the year. Cargo revenue grew 11% in the first quarter on a 5% increase in cargo block hours. As a reminder, annual rate escalations for this contract go into effect in mid-December in every year of the agreement. The cargo business remains a steady cash-generative business for Sun Country that serves to smooth the peaks and valleys in our passenger service schedule. Turning now to costs. Our first quarter adjusted CASM increased 14% versus last year. Aircraft utilization decreased by 15% versus Q1 of \u201822, which negatively impacted unit costs. Our average air aircraft count in Q1 of \u201823 was 21% higher than last year, while total block hours grew by 4% over this period. We\u2019re undersized for the fleet we have in place, and future growth should come at very high marginal profitability. An important thing to note is that lower utilization levels are not necessarily a drag on overall profitability. Our schedule is highly peaked and designed to maximize unit revenue. So, having aircraft available during periods when demand is strongest is important, even if the utilization at off-peak times is low. For instance, aircraft utilization in March was 8.2 hours per day, while it averaged 13 hours per day on peak days in the month. Adjusted CASM was also impacted by a 26% increase in pilot costs, as the contractual increase in pay rates took place January 1, and staffing levels have increased to support our future growth. Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the first quarter with $261.6 million in total liquidity, including $236.9 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investments. Our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 2.6 times. During the quarter, we also repurchased 750,000 shares of our stock at a price of $19.75, as part of an Apollo Global Management secondary offering. We still have $10.2 million in board-approved share purchase authority, and will opportunistically execute any future buybacks.  Lastly, I'll switch gears to talk about Q2 \u201823 guidance. We continue to see strong demand booked into the summer. Total Q2 \u201823 revenue is expected to be $255 million to $265 million, which would be 16% to 21% higher than Q2 of \u201822. This includes the revenue that we expect to receive from the aircraft that are on lease to Oman Air. We expect total block hour growth of 11% to 14%. We're expecting an adjusted operating margin of 11% to 16%, assuming a fuel price of $2.85 per gallon. The fundamentals of our unique diversified business remain strong, and our model is highly resilient to changes in macroeconomic conditions. Our focus remains on profitable growth.  With that, we'll open it for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Just on the cadence of capacity growth recovery for the balance of the year, and I guess that's mainly a scheduled service question, but maybe you could talk about it on a block hours basis across your segments, and maybe specifically for the scheduled service business as well. Are you getting kind of the acceleration at the rate that you had previously hoped?\nJude Bricker: Yes, we\u2019re seeing - we are definitely seeing acceleration. So, growth in the second quarter versus the second quarter of \u201822 will be higher than first quarter growth. Third quarter should be a substantial growth quarter. We're expecting a strong summer, and we're gearing up to grow pretty substantially. Fourth quarter growth will taper a little bit, not for any capacity constraint reasons, just because of demand patterns. But we're seeing the increase in capacity that we had planned for 2023. We're not growing as fast as we would like or really as fast as the opportunity presents itself, but growth will be substantial, particularly in Q3, and more so to come in Q2 as well. \nDave Davis: Just a few more comments. A lot of airlines have philosophies about overscheduling and then cutting down when they have a lot of daily frequencies or under-scheduling and then adding, in this case for us, where we see certainty developing in our staffing. So, if you look forward in our selling schedules through the end of the year, we load a smaller schedule than we hope to be able to operate. Additionally, at Sun Country, we have a lot of close-in charter sales, and charters continue to grow as well with about the same pace as what we're seeing in our scheduled service business.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, great. And then just with respect to variability of your scheduling, just by the nature of the model, you kind of have to make a bet on seasonality, and you're shaping your schedule pretty aggressively. Any surprises in seasonal demand patterns? In other words, are the off peaks as off peaky as you're scheduling to, or maybe what do you make of comments from some of the industry competitors that the off peaks are kind of worse?\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Duane. Yes, I mean, from my perspective, the surprise is that it's kind of like it was before COVID, where we had an incredibly strong spring break travel season that begins for us in mid-February and goes through Easter. And was as good as anything we've seen. And then the last half of January and the first half of February were as weak as they had been in the past also. Now, what I'd say, because there's been a lot of discussion about bleisure, and let me just define that term as I would think about it. It's not people going on a business trip to then tack on a couple days of leisure. It's people that can work from anywhere, and therefore can travel a little more frequently, or go to different destinations. So, what I've seen in our network is a really substantial increase in secondary destinations. Leisure, as I kind of grew up in the space, was always about Orlando and Vegas. And now, it's really diverse, with particular expansions in smaller markets like the Northern Rockies, and Tucson, and Hilton Head, Savannah, Charleston, and Asheville, and Destin, our small international destinations like Grand Cayman, and Aruba, Belize. And so, all those markets have really outperformed, and that's what I would attribute to, because I think what you're asking is kind of the post-COVID leisure environment. But the peaks still remain and that kind of, I think, tees up pretty well for our business model.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Appreciate the thoughts.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you. Morning, gentlemen. Maybe just continuing on that line of conversation, but looking far out, I mean, you said that your booking curve extends out to almost December right now. So, what does the forward curve look like? Any signs of cracks in demand, particularly kind maybe post Labor Day and that post summer travel surge?\nJude Bricker: It's really - hey, Ravi, it's Jude. It's just too early to comment on post-Labor Day. I mean, we wouldn't sell that - historically, that time of year anyway, sells close in and there's no difference really. Broadly across the network, we're selling well ahead of 2019 levels. So, in other words, the percentage of our seats that are sold as we sit here today, looking forward into the advances, is higher than we were in the same time in 2019. And fares are substantially higher than they were that period. And they remain higher than they were in the summer peak of last year, which was a pretty strong demand environment. We're growing again really rapidly into that peak period. But I'd say broadly, strength everywhere. I'd call out areas of strength. International continues to remain strong. That's been sort of echoed by other airlines on their earnings calls. We turn our international network to originate out of the south in the summertime, and that's doing really well. The Pac Northwest is looking really, really good with the resurgence of like Alaskan travel. I think that plays into the bleisure thesis. Last summer was really about big city destinations from Minneapolis for us, and that's coming back really nicely. We're trying a lot of new things and on the network and probably I'd like to see, I don't know, 20% of them fail, which is to say that we're trying things that might not work and we have other better opportunities. So, I think that won't be any different from years past where we cycle capacity into 2024 that we tried this year that didn't work out. It looks really, really good. Honestly, there's nothing - I look to try to find weakness and it's difficult right now.\nRavi Shanker: That's a great comment. I might steal that from you. But maybe that's also a good starting point for a follow-up question, which is a little more of a theoretical question. I mean, just given your unique network and the reasons why in a passenger flyer airline, kind of given the MSP connectivity to the rest of country and the world, just how macro sensitive or demand elastic or inelastic are your passengers, do you think?\nJude Bricker: Well, they're elastic for price, that's for sure. But that's no different from other leisure customers. If what you're really asking is kind of how sensitive the Minnesota leisure customer is to the macro environment, then I would rather be in Minnesota anywhere if there was going to be a disruption, because the economy is incredibly stable here, and that's been proved out through many cycles of the past, with really high affluency, high propensity for travel, and very stable economy that has industry dependencies that are food and healthcare and the like. So, and we kind of demonstrated that through COVID a little bit where we outperformed the industry pretty dramatically even on our sched service business. But I don't think the key should be attributed to - solely to the Minneapolis market. Really, the secret sauce is being able to cut an ag capacity without much change to your unit cost so that we can always find these opportunities of positive margin flying.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thank you, sir.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. So, I apologize in advance, this is like a multi-part cost one for my first one. Can you just give us some more color on the cost outlook underlying your second quarter margin guidance? In my math, it implies some slowing in the growth year-over-year, but a step-up in growth on both a CASMx and cost ex-fuel per block hour basis. Was there something about the 2Q \u201819 comp that we should be remembering, or just some lumpiness in timing this year? I guess, I'm just trying to get a better sense of like how we should think about the second half. And then among your peers, your business model has changed the most since \u201819, right? And then we layer on kind of industry wage inflation and other inflation on top of that. So, so like trying to get a sense of kind of maybe anything we should be thinking about in the comps or lumpiness this year, but really ultimately, like what's the goal on either a CASMx or a cost per block hour basis when you get back to that targeted utilization. I appreciate you letting me ramble on a bit here. Thanks.\nJude Bricker: Yes, so I would think of it this way. First of all, if you're looking back to 2019, obviously a lot has happened. It's like you said, we've added a whole new line of business. We signed a new pilot agreement. We've had other wage pressures that everyone else has had. I think the story on CASMs front is a pretty straightforward one for us. I mentioned during the prepared remarks that our aircraft utilization has dropped fairly dramatically. The number of average aircraft in our fleet is up substantially. The number of pilot bodies is up substantially. Essentially, I would think of us right now as a little bit oversized for how much flying we're doing. So, we've been steadily hiring. We've been steadily adding aircraft. There\u2019s an opportunity for us as we add really pilot production capabilities here, and we're making a lot of progress on that front, to sort of grow into the size that we are now sized for. The results should be high marginal profitability going forward, not a need to add a substantial number of aircraft, nor a substantial number of pilots in the near term. That's really the underlying story on the CASMx front for us. What we should see, what our plan is, if you look at sort of on a quarter-by-quarter basis, that year-over-year pressure should ease a bit next quarter, and then begin to ease substantially in the back half of the year as the strong third quarter growth kicks in. I'm a little hesitant to give sort of a long run CASM number at this point, but suffice it to say we expect the number to be trending down as we go forward.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. Thanks so much for all that color. Super helpful. I guess maybe just on the ad hoc charter flying, when do you think you'll have enough slack in the system to pursue that more aggressively? Not to say that having all that contractual long-term charter lockdown is a bad thing by any means, but just trying to get a sense of like when you think you'll have the slack.\nJude Bricker: So, first, that there's ad hoc or not ad hoc is mostly about the certainty of our staffing, less about absolute staffing. So, when we're going into a peak month and there's some - we're dependent on some assumptions around attrition or hiring or training or something like that, then we're going to schedule to the low end of where we think we might end up, and then we'll fill that gap with ad hoc. So, you're still going to see ad hoc flying grow through the year. But kind of what we really want to get to is where we're scheduling to the capability of the fleet and then filling off-peak with additional ad hoc opportunities as they become available. And we're ways off from that. But I would like to have Grant comment a little bit around our revenue. \nGrant Whitney: Yes. Thanks, Jude. Jude, it's exactly right. The team does a really good job of sort of looking out into the future, placing our bets in terms of where we expect the most value and optimizing revenue. And ad hoc, as we've talked about, has been the thing that's sort of been spilled off lately. I will tell you right now, we're more aggressive in the market in April, May, and June, in that space. So, I think it's sort of meeting plan and expectations, and it'll be a developing story. Our charter reputation is really, really good. So, as we get back into that, customers are very willing to talk to us and ready to talk to us because we have a proven track record.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thank you. I might just try to squeeze one more in. just coming back to something you mentioned, Dave, in answering the cost question, you noted that you're a little bit maybe overstaffed and over-fleeted for what you're growing today. Is unlocking the utilization, is that about getting captains upgraded, or what really is like the barrier to kind of getting that utilization back up and running, if it's not necessarily pilot bodies, to steal your phrase?\nDave Davis: Yes, it\u2019s continuing to make progress on our training pipeline. Like I said before, we have a lot more pilots on board from a number of perspective, and we're removing them quickly through the training pipeline. Just a quick statistic, so if I look at January through April of 2023, compared to January of April of 2022, we're producing about 33% more pilots than we did year-over-year. So, we're making slow, steady progress on pilot production here and we expect that production to - those increases to continue through the year. But that continues to be sort of the gating item for us, and we're making a lot of progress on it. I also do want to just reiterate though, this issue that I tried to mention on the call, it's not all about utilization here. It's making sure we have shell count available when the demand is there, because peak time, day of week TRASMs average fares are so high, we need to make sure we have all the aircraft we need to pick up that demand, which - and if we have to suffer a little bit on overall utilization because the aircraft are parked during off-peak times, so be it because the overall profitability trade-off is there and I think it reflects itself in the Q1 profitability numbers that we put up.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks. It's Helane Becker, and it's TD Cowen, but thanks very much, guys, for the time. Quick question. I'm kind of - why is your air traffic liability down fourth quarter to first? I feel like it should have gone up. Obviously, I missed something here.\nJude Bricker: Well, remember, we're burning - we\u2019re doing a whole bunch of flying in the first - a bunch of tickets are purchased in the fourth quarter. We're doing a whole bunch of flying in the first quarter that the people purchase tickets for in the fourth quarter. \nDave Davis: It\u2019s all about days out. \nJude Bricker: Yes. So, our winter capacity is sold earlier than our summer capacity. And that\u2019s historically been consistent.\nHelane Becker: Right. So, that's - and that's all the close-in bookings that you tend to get, right? People tend to book closer on your airline than on the peer group?\nJude Bricker: No, no, it's really - it\u2019s not comparing us to ourselves. So, our summer schedule books closer in because it's shorter haul, just the kind of markets that we serve. But if you think about the kind of vacation that Minnesotans take in March, it's planned months and months in advance, fairly high-fare environment. People - these are just very important trips to people. So, they plan it really in advance. So, when you look at our end of December ATLs, it's reflective of those first quarter bookings, as compared to if you look at the end of March, our ATLs are reflective of bookings going into the summer, which will be sold later.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then my other question has to do with the comment about the price hike every December on the cargo business. Does that fluctuate year-to-year, or is it a fixed amount?\nDave Davis: Yes, so we don't want to get into - yes, we probably don't want to get into too many details, but suffice it to say there's various line items in our agreement that change at different numbers. But it's contractually laid out.\nHelane Becker: Okay. All right. That's really helpful. I have other questions, but I'll follow up later. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Good morning, guys. I want to just go back to, I see that, Jude, you had mentioned about certainty of staffing and how that had been maybe a potential gating issue. What are the pain points there and where are we - and not just pilots, I'm looking at mechanics, flight attendants, ground people, any issues that you're running into, attrition rates, et cetera.\nJude Bricker: Well, the technician staff is tight, but it\u2019s okay. And generally, we're able to respond to all the rest of our staffing to how things are going on the pilot side. So, the dependency remains with our pilots. And as Dave outlined, the challenge is really about the training pipeline now. So, we don't have a problem with attrition or with hiring. It's really about trying to get people through the training pipeline, through the simulator, through the upgrade process, get the instructors into their jobs and build the whole infrastructure out. It's just taken some time. \nDave Davis: I think one of the things, Mike, just quickly to note on that is, if you recall a year or so ago, maybe a year and a half ago, we saw a lot of difficulty in airport staffing. That eased tremendously. I mean, that constraint is gone. There's no constraint on the flight attendant side. We're staffed where we want to be on the mechanic side. So, as Jude points out, it's a little tight. It's hard to get some of those guys, but that's not an issue. Those groups are not gating items.\nMike Linenberg: Do you - with the pilots in the training, do you have a sense that the light at the end of the tunnel is 2023, or does this continue beyond that? I mean, is this going to be a multi-year that you're just going to always be playing catch-up?\nDave Davis: Well, with these margins, we'll add aircraft so that we're always constrained.\nJude Bricker: Yes. I mean, we have substantial growth plans in the next few years in our long-range plan. We're going to be constantly adding training capacity and adding production capacity. So, it's kind of not a caught-up point for us. We're thinking right now, how are we gearing up for Q1 of \u201824? We're going to need staff for that, and then into the summer of \u201824. So, it's kind of a never-ending thing. \nDave Davis: I mean, I think about it like long range, we want to be in kind of the mid-teen range of consistent growth. Maybe a little bit more some years, a little bit less other years, but we want to be able to accomplish that.\nMike Linenberg: When you say mid-teen Jude, is that ASMs or that's block hours?\nJude Bricker: Block hours for us is what counts, just because that's the unit of measure across our segments. So, and we're going to start hitting that towards the back of this year. So, we're kind of to the production levels that we would like to be, and it's going to get - as the airline grows, we're going to need to produce more pilots every month to kind of keep that rate going. So, I think pilots are going to be the story for a while.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Just jumping to the new airplanes, the 737-900 ERs, what's the seat count versus the 800? And what's the difference in the departure cost? Probably pretty similar.\nJude Bricker: Yes. So, we have 186 seats on our 800s, and our expectation, it's still being studied a little bit, is that we go to 200 on the 900. The 900s have almost the same departure cost. There's a little bit more fuel, a little bit higher landing fees, same crew complement. So, it's nearly identical departure costs. And so, those incremental 14 seats are just very, very profitable, as you'd imagine. It\u2019s a great airplane for us.\nMike Linenberg: And I was going to say, that plane has the legs to make Hawaii without penalty off the west coast. \nJude Bricker: Yes, it's a little bit longer range actually than the 800, the 900 ERs. It's about 150 nautical longer. So, we can do everything we do with the 800 and then some. There's no real markets though that we would open up because of that small incremental range. But yes, we can do just about anything. It's got a little bit of field performance. So, there are some challenging airfields that we fly in and out of with the 800 that the 900 can't go into, but it's a good - it effectively does everything we want to do with the 800 on the 900.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. And if I could just sneak in one last one on - it is interesting about your scheduling versus your peers, where there is a schedule out there and we constantly see sort of the reduction or revisions with the downward bias. And you're right, it's interesting your schedules, you seem to be the only carrier where you put a schedule out there, and then as you get closer in, you're adding frequency at the last minute. What - and I'm just thinking, over the last couple quarters, what has been that upward bias? Is it about a half a point of ASM growth, a point of ASM growth in the scheduled business? I just haven't actually done the math, but I have noticed it and I'm just curious. It does seem like there's that upward bias, and it helps obviously on the cost side as well as the revenue side.\nJude Bricker: I mean, 2% to 3%, I would guess. And just keep in mind, there's a lot going on there. So, one thing is, we don't oversell currently any flights and we have low frequency into markets. So, when we put a flight for sale, we need to commit to that flight because there's not a lot of recom opportunities for our passengers. And the airlines, they're adding a lot, tend to cut down multiple daily frequencies to a little bit less frequencies. So, there's recom embedded in their network for those passengers. We just don't have that luxury. So, we bias towards late adds as opposed to late cuts.\nGrant Whitney: Mike, I would just - this is Grant. I would just add that, and you've heard us talk about this quite a bit at conferences and the, like, the schedule integration topic, a shout-out to the team here, we have really capable schedulers. And so, as we put out the charter schedule and the charter schedule adjusts, the team goes in and strategically adds flying. Great example, big partner of ours here is the University of Minnesota. They went to the Frozen Four Hockey Tournament. We chartered them down there, and then we found ways to be strategic with that schedule, or we opened up capacity close in for fans and at really good prices relative to the market, still really good yields, filled up all the airplanes and it was just a win-win for everyone.\nJude Bricker: Yes. So, if you're looking at our schedule, there's a lot of really weird frequencies in there that you might be like, why are they flying Newark twice a month in March? And that's because we're flying the Red Bulls. So, we make a decision when we sell that charter, is it better to ferry in or is it better to just sell and sched? And we may only have a month to try to fill the airplane, but it's still better. And so, that calculus is happening all the time. And that leads to, as Grant mentioned, a lot of other late adds in the sched service business.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. I was just going to say, notwithstanding the few days and many, you just - you guys don't cancel flights. I mean, as far as I can go back, you don't cancel. It\u2019s impressive. I don't think there's anybody who has a record that equals yours at present.\nJude Bricker: Well, thank you. I mean, we\u2019ve got a great team here. I think it\u2019s the number one operating metric that we strive for. And this winter was a tough one for us, but - and some people had to come a lot later, but yes, but we do everything we can not to bring a flight down.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Well, very good. Thanks for answering my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So, two questions. On Amazon, with Amazon looking to improve the, I guess, network delivery efficiencies, if you could just comment how we should think about the puts and takes for Sun Country there. And then a little bit more nuance here, just remind us whether there are minimum block hours with this service. And then two, how much in advance do you get the flight schedule? So, meaning, do you know what you're flying for Amazon in the second half of this year or peak season at this point? Thank you.\nJude Bricker: Yes, I mean, so Amazon's obviously been striving to improve overnight delivery for as long as we've been involved. We have seen kind of no changes, or minimal changes in the scheduling. We haven't seen any significant reductions in block hours or in - if anything, it's been a little bit of pressure in the other way. So, it's been sort of steady eddy from a scheduling perspective from Amazon. So, without going too much into the details of our agreement, there's not really minimum block hours, but the contract is constructed such that there's a fixed component and a variable component. So, you could kind of say that the fixed component is a minimum block hour number, but it\u2019s just a fixed number that we get. So, it's structured that way. From a schedule perspective, we're working on schedules right now through the back of the year. Here's how I think about Amazon. It is a fixed input into the capacity plan. It's almost precisely reliable. We're doing about 38 dailies today. I expect to do about 38 dailies at the end of the year, this time next year, et cetera. What changes though is the markets we fly to. And that's what Sun Country is really, really good at. We're always opening and closing airports for them, and that\u2019s why they hired us. We're really, really flexible.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Second question, if you could comment on what you're seeing with respect to used aircraft prices today and perhaps your thoughts on the market going forward. Thank you.\nJude Bricker: Well, I mean, fortunately, we don't need to buy a lot right now because prices are a little tighter. There's - I'm trying to think of something I can add to the already very common discussion about the delays in the Max and the effect that that's having on the NG market. We have the capacity with this 900 deal kind of laid out for the next couple of years. We remain in the spot market, and when planes pop up to fit our spec and they\u2019re at good prices, we'll still be buying from time to time, but we're talking really small quantities. And that - and then this is still growing 15 whatever, 20%, whatever we get to going into next year. Here's one more comment on the NG prices. So, there's - when we think about a used NG, we kind of attribute value to the maintenance value that we transfer from the prior operator, then the piece parts that we're going to sell when we retire the airplane. And then finally, the difference is an operator premium. And that operator premium has been around zero, so no premium, and now it's like a million or so. And so, it just doesn't really move the needle. The midlife NG is still an incredible investment for us. And we'll be looking for 900 ERs and 800s that are in the eight to 12-year range, I think probably for the next five, 10 years. \nDave Davis: Yes. I mean, one of the reasons that we're a little oversized from an aircraft perspective is because we're opportunistically buying and we're going to grow into it. So, when the deals are there with the economics we want, we buy the aircraft. Ownership cost for these planes is pretty low. So, we're going to continue to buy aircraft when we see great deals and we'll grow into it. \nJude Bricker: Now, financing costs and spreads - base rates have moved up obviously higher than where they were last year, but we have the balance sheet to continue to execute the fleet plan irrespective of financing.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And if I could get in one more. The recent deal, the 737-900 deal with Oman Air. So, is that the - that looks at least until you take, I guess, possession of these, is it late 2024 to 2025? And in the meanwhile, should we think about that as sort of like a dry lease, and is dry leasing perhaps something that you could look to move into opportunistically or kind of more on a sort of go-forward basis? Thank you.\nJude Bricker: I mean, think of us for the Oman aircraft, we\u2019re a lessor. We leased the aircraft to Oman. We stepped into somebody else's shoes. That\u2019s the extent of the relationship. So, we're collecting lease income. We own the aircraft. It's standard lessor lessee relationship for the duration of these leases. I don't see us really beginning very active in the dry leasing world. I mean, back again, sort of to what I was saying on utilization earlier, there's plenty of opportunity to fly all of these aircraft at peak time. So, we can't really have them dry lease to somebody else because we want them when we need them, even if they're going to sit around a little bit more than would be optimal. \nDave Davis: Acquiring an airplane with a lease attached, I think that makes sense. Taking an airplane that we own and leasing it out and remarketing leased airplanes, that's not really a core competency that we want to focus on. \nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Got it. Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks for the follow-up. That was actually the question I was going to ask was on fleet, but maybe you could just put a finer point on when those aircraft come into revenue service for you. In other words, how long will you be collecting that lease revenue, and how many aircraft do you need to go out and acquire to support 2024 growth? And thanks for taking the questions.\nJude Bricker: Yes. So, the aircraft - think of it this way. The aircraft come off of lease beginning in, I think it's November of \u201924, and extend through like November of \u201825. So, then we need to take the aircraft, reconfigure them and so forth. So, I would be thinking the first Oman aircraft come into service here probably second quarter of 2025 kind of a thing, and then sort of going out from there. So, we have a - we've done a couple of other aircraft deals in recent weeks that'll deliver mid this year - that'll go into service mid this year. And early 2024, we probably, from an operational perspective right now, don't need additional aircraft. Maybe one, but we don't need additional aircraft going into the first quarter of 2024. So, I think we're properly sized from a fleet perspective. As I mentioned earlier, it's a great deal. If it comes along, we'll probably do it, but we don't really need to do it right now.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. So, with that, I'll hand the call back over to CEO, Jude Bricker, for any closing remarks.\nJude Bricker: Thanks for joining us this morning, everybody. We'll talk to you again in 90 days. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

With that said, I'd like to now turn the call over to Jude.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Chris. Good morning to everybody. To review our multi-segment business is unique in the airline industry. Due to the predictability of our charter and cargo businesses, we were able to deliver the most flexible scheduled service capacity in the industry.  The combination of our schedule, flexibility and low cost model allow us to respond to both predictable leisure demand fluctuations and exogenous industry shocks. We believe due to these structural advantages, we'll be able to reliably deliver industry-leading profitability throughout all cycles. And execution of our multi-segment business is critical that we're able to deliver industry leading operational performance. I'm especially proud that, in 2022, Sun Country delivered the industry's best completion factor. During the challenging December period, we delivered 99.6 completion factor, also best in the industry. So proud of our whole team that continues to come through for our customers every day.  We continue to see strong demand for all segments of our business. And scheduled service, currently selling through August, we're seeing consistently strong yields even compared to an already strong 2022.  The first quarter notably, year-over-year TRASM improvement implicit in our guide is mostly a result of a strong recovery in international demand as compared to Omicron impacted first quarter 2022. This outperformance is overcoming West Florida demand which is still recovering from Hurricane Ian.  All indications are that unit revenues will continue to remain strong through the summer, including observable bookings, overall industry capacity across our network, loyalty spend, contracted distribution agreements and local economy metrics.  In scheduled service, through the next year, we expect to continue to build out our MSP operation to its natural share. To that end, we've decided to postpone the restart of our summer Hawaiian operations until 2024.  Keep in mind that, in the first quarter, which is typically our strongest of the year \u2013 keep in mind that the first quarter is typically our strongest of the year on constant deal and normalized demand.  I expect charters to put up big growth numbers in 2023. Mostly we're focused on long term contracted charter revenue. We've expanded our casino operation to five aircraft and added a second aircraft to our VIP operation. I expect to have eight aircraft committed to contracted charter flying by the end of 2023. Counting our 12 cargo aircraft, that brings our contracted fleet to 20 aircraft of the 55 we have in service. All these aircraft fly at consistent operational levels with pass through economics. This operating base allows us maximum flexibility with our scheduled business.  I expect our sports business to grow this year as well, focused on collegiate sports and Major League Soccer. Charter demand remains strong and we believe it's generally underserved by the industry.  Our cargo business will improve this year due to contracted escalation, but we expect volumes to be consistent year-over-year as we focus on building out our scheduled and charter businesses.  On the fleet, we'll continue to be opportunistic buyers. I expect most of our 2023 growth to come through utilization increases, which remain well below 2019 levels. This will allow us to deploy capital for debt repayments through amortization, consider share buybacks and some prudent infrastructure investment, like our new training centers that opened in 4Q and technology to support our operations. I'm confident that we will continue to find the growth aircraft that we need as we need them.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave. \nDave Davis: Thanks, Jude. We're pleased to report strong Q4 results, which I'll detail in a minute, near the upper end of our guidance range for both revenue and operating margin. Adjusted pretax income for the quarter was $10.3 million, a 39% improvement over Q4 of 2021, despite an increase in fuel prices of nearly 44% and the impact of the new pilot agreement that we signed near the end of 2021.  Although we are now comparing our results to prior year, it's important to note that our Q4 adjusted pretax income is nearly 26% higher than it was in Q4 of 2019. Additionally, we grew Q4 2022 year-over-year capacity on both a system block hour and ASM basis by 10% and 14%, respectively. Q4 system block hours were 37% higher than they were in Q4 of 2019.  Let me start with a discussion of revenue and capacity. As Jude noted, the revenue environment remains very strong. Q4 of 2022 total operating revenue of $227.2 million was 31.6% higher than the year-ago quarter.  The scheduled service business is particularly strong as TRASM grew 27% versus last year and an almost 14% growth in scheduled service ASMs. Ticket plus ancillary revenue grew 45% year-over-year as we saw an increase in total fare to $177.36, combined with an increase in load factor from 76.6% last year to 84.4% in Q4 of 2022. This strengthened unit revenue shows no signs of abating as we move into the first quarter.  The story is the same for the full-year 2022 with scheduled service TRASM growing almost 37% on an increase in scheduled ASMs of 16%. Both total fare of $175.29 and load factor of 83.5% were the highest full year result since 2018 when we began our conversion to a single class configuration.  We finished 2022 with full year revenue of $894.4 million, a 44% increase over 2021 and a record for Sun Country.  Charter revenue grew in the fourth quarter by 11% as we saw another quarter of strong growth in flying under long term contracts, referred to as program charter, and steady improvement in our ad hoc business.  Ad hoc charter revenue doubled versus Q3 of 2022 and is showing steady progress as we continue to add pilots to pursue these opportunities. We've made a concerted effort to grow the amount of our charter business under long term contracts, and we've been very successful so far.  For the full year, program charter revenue was $121.7 million, nearly 2.5 times higher than it was in 2021, and we feel there remains room to grow. We added the equivalent of a third aircraft serving our Caesars contract in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Full year revenue for the ad hoc charter business is still about 60% below its peak in 2019, but as we continue to add pilot resources, we expect to see steady growth in this segment.  Cargo revenue grew 5% in the fourth quarter on a small decline in capacity. For the full year, cargo revenue declined 1% on a 4% decrease in cargo block hours. During the first half of the year, we had numerous Amazon aircraft in heavy maintenance, which drove the block hour decrease. Our cargo flying remains a consistent source of revenue in all environments, and we do not expect this to change in the future.  Let me turn now to costs. Our fourth quarter adjusted CASM increased 7% versus last year. For the full year, adjusted CASM increased 9% year-over-year. Similar to what we have been saying all year, the main drivers of this cost increase have been twofold. First, we have been smaller than we had initially planned to be due to labor and aircraft constraints.  Second, 2022 results reflect the cost of the new pilot agreement we signed at the end of 2021. This is an important point, as the results of many of our competitors have yet to fully incorporate the cost of recently completed or upcoming new pilot contracts. Two additional aircrafts are expected to enter service in Q1 of 2023. As we grow into our expanded fleet throughout 2023, we expect to see a deceleration in unit cost increases.  Let me say a few words now about our strong balance sheet. We finished 2022 with $289.4 million in total liquidity, including $264.7 million in unrestricted cash and short term investments. Our year-end net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.7.  During January of 2023, we completed the $25 million ASR portion of our share buyback program, repurchasing approximately 1.4 million shares at an average price of $18.23. We still have $25 million in Board approved share repurchase authority and will execute any buybacks under the program opportunistically, considering the liquidity needs of the business.  Let me switch now to Q1 2023 guidance. As I said previously, we're seeing very strong demand, with approximately 80% of our planned Q1 passenger revenue already booked, and we expect the strength to continue throughout the quarter.  Total Q1 2023 revenue is expected to be between $280 million and $290 million, which would be 24% to 28% higher than Q1 of 2022. We expect total block hour growth of 3.5% to 6.5%.  We're expecting an operating margin of between 15% and 20%, assuming a fuel price of $3.58 per gallon.  Just a quick reminder. Q1 is historically our strongest quarter of the year, and we expect to see seasonal trends similar to previous years. The fundamentals of our unique diversified business remain strong and our model is highly resilient to changes in macroeconomic conditions. Our focus remains on profitable growth.  With that, I'll open it for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Great to hear the strong commentary for 1Q. If you can just kind of give us a little more detail there. How far out the booking curve can you see? Can you see past spring break, maybe into early summer as well? Does it feel like even the tail end of that booking curve kind of continues to remain strong, just trying to get a better sense of what the rest of the year might look like?\nJude Bricker: The main thing that's impacting the first quarter relative to the first quarter of last year is going to be the recovery in international demand. We have a sizable international network, traditionally, during the first quarter. Last year was affected heavily by Omicron. So we're seeing strong demand across the Caribbean, Mexican market, Central America markets that's sort of unprecedented from my experience, looking at traffic down there.  We have really good insight. As Dave mentioned, we're over 80% sold for the first quarter. So, there's not a lot of variance there. Most of the variance in our first quarter revenue will come from how much charters were able to sell into the March period.  Looking past the first quarter, April is pretty well clear at this point. And it continues the same trend of fairly dramatic year-over-year revenue improvements. The summer, we have a little less insight on just because the summer relative to the first quarter tends to book more close in. And we shift our network to more domestic markets and shorter haul markets, but also tend to book more close in. But if all we're looking at is unit revenue and fares and ancillary production, things like that, for the bookings that we can see, which again for the summer period is well below 20% of our volume, it's very, very strong. I don't see anything that would indicate \u2013 I can't find any weakness across the network. I was concerned about Ian's impact because Fort Myers is a big part of our network in March in particular and that area of the country is mostly recovered. It's still lagging the strength in other areas, but there's really no weakness that I can find anywhere across our scheduled service network.\nRavi Shanker: That's a pretty definitive statement. Maybe as a follow up to that, kind of sounds like the biggest impediment to kind of growing into that strength is going to be capacity. Can you just comment on what the pilot availability situation is like? And what do you expect in terms of maybe any headwinds there kind of easing in the next 12 months?\nDave Davis: Our pilot situation continues to get better. As we've detailed and talked through a number of times, we've had some particular issues in our training pipeline. We continue to have no issues with sort of recruiting pilots to come to the company. So that continues to hold. We're making steady progress, like identifiable improvement in pilots that are going to the line here, especially over the last two or three months. We expect that positive momentum to continue in the back half of the year. I think I mentioned 3.5% to 6.5% block hour growth for the first quarter. I think we're looking now at block hour growth for the year of around 10%. So we'll be accelerating as we move into the summer months, and then into the back half of the year. \nJude Bricker: Which is particularly positive because we'll be putting up double-digit growth rates by June, which is \u2013 so we'll be able to catch most of \u2013 the growth rate will align with where the peak opportunities are.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just to follow up on the last question. And I know we had an interesting couple of years to say the least. And prior to that, you had significantly restructured this business. But that 80% book for 1Q, do you have any feel for how that compares to kind of normal, if there is such a thing as normal?\nJude Bricker: Just on an estimation of about 5 points relative to history. We're booking ahead. And a lot of that is just us aligning our algorithms to the demand environment. We need to load higher fares from the beginning. Recall that pricing is a heuristic algorithm. So, bookings determine fares. And a lot of that depends on our expectation going into the selling period and we're aligning to the new environment. So, we're probably ahead by about 5 points.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: On CapEx, can you just remind us how are you thinking about 2023 and 2024 maybe versus the year just ended? Where do those plans stand today? And are you seeing any signs that the used 737 market is loosening up as MAX deliveries finally take the appropriate pace here?\nDave Davis: Without going into precise numbers, let me give you some color on CapEx. So, we added between seven and eight aircraft last year, or I should say in 2022. This year, we are not going to add as many planes. Jude mentioned the fact that we're going to get growth mostly through utilization, but I would expect us to add probably one or two aircraft into the fleet this year. So that CapEx will be down significantly.  We're already lining up deliveries right now for 2024 and even into 2025. So we expect to resume growth in 2024, probably seven to nine aircraft, and the same in 2025. So we're going to take a little bit of a pause here, which will bring CapEx down in 2023. \nJude Bricker: On the market, I'm pretty comfortable not being a buyer right at the moment. The opposite has happened, Duane. It's actually a pretty strong market for 737-800 values, as airlines across the world extend leases to accommodate delays in their MAX order stream. There's also sort of a broad rebound in demand across the globe. We're still seeing some spot bankruptcies like Flyr in Norway last week \u2013 or this week. But these planes get absorbed really quickly. So we're not going to get, in my view, a lot of price relief. But I'm confident we'll get the planes we need.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: I know units costs have been lumpy. But if we just solved for unit costs in 1Q based on revenue and operating margin and maybe taking scheduled data for ASM, we get to CASMx growth in the high teens year-over-year. I guess, first, correct me if I'm wrong. But then you alluded to like a lot more block hours coming online. You're doing that via higher utilization, which I'm guessing is pretty accretive on the CASMx side. I don't know if there's maybe like some efficiencies we're getting as we move through the pilot contract. But we'll just find it helpful if you guys could talk about the level of deceleration on CASMx we should expect from maybe that high teens in the first quarter. \nDave Davis: First of all, I'm not sure what the math is there, we can go through it. But that number is too high. It's not going to be sort of close to the high teens from a CASM basis for the first quarter. I would expect probably a number high single digits, very low double digits. And then as we continue growing here through the first quarter into the back half of the year, that should moderate significantly as we get to the back half of the year. So I talked a bit about CASM year-over-year. We should see any increases that we see in 2023 will be significantly lower than what we saw from 2021 to 2022. \nJude Bricker: One other bit of color is that, just recall, we did our pilot contract a year ago, the rest of the industry is rolling through pilot agreements now. And so, our cost trends will look really good relative to the industry based on that fact.\nCatherine O'Brien: Yes, for sure. Maybe just as my follow-up, we continue to see really strong growth on the ancillary side for you guys. Can you just walk us through where the future opportunities lie there? Is that going to be optimizing for yields? Are there any step function changes, kind of like the offering?\nJude Bricker: First of all, I would continue to guide you to look at total revenue per passenger. Most ancillary initiatives that increase ancillary unit revenues have an effect on the airfare, but increased total revenue per passenger. So, just always keep looking at it like that, particularly bag fees and seat assignment revenue and convenience fees and things like that that most airlines are pushing really heavily on raising right now.  What we're focused on in contrast is on new products. We launched our bundle solution in the back half of last year, which is performing as expected. We're also, like most airlines, getting a lot of uplift through our loyalty program, which is setting records in every quarter, certainly in the last quarter, was consistent with that. And then, what's exciting for me in particular is our third party products, which is us selling hotels and cars and travel insurance to our customers. And that is purely accretive. Every bit of revenue that's incremental doesn't affect the airfare for those products. And so, we're really excited to see that. And those on a unit basis are increasing by triple digits as we roll out our car solution for the first time really, which is really, really exciting.  So, we're going to continue to have tailwinds on unit ancillary revenues. And for us, in particular, I think that's going to drive continued tailwind on total revenue per passenger because of the kind of products that we're seeing growth in. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Helane Becker of Cowen.\nHelane Becker: On CapEx, what's maintenance CapEx?\nDave Davis: You mean like a total absolute dollar amount of maintenance CapEx? \nHelane Becker: Yeah. \nDave Davis: Probably for the year, depending on exactly what we call maintenance CapEx, we include some of our engine purchases in there, probably on the order of $40 million to $50 million.\nHelane Becker: And that'll be financed through cash, I guess?\nDave Davis: That would be financed through cash, yeah.\nHelane Becker: Just my other question, as you think about aircraft, are you just looking at that 800 NGs or 737-700s make any sense for you? What's like your optimal size that you would be looking for?\nJude Bricker: We think that 900 would work as well. So, 800s and 900s.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. \nMichael Linenberg: Good numbers and outlook. Just on the aircraft, I want to clarify. Jude, I thought you said you're taking two airplanes in the March quarter. And then Dave said, we'll be taking one to two this year. Is that one to two that are incremental to the two because maybe those two showed up last year and they're being put in service? I want a clarification around that.\nDave Davis: Yeah, it's what you just said. So the two that are coming in in the first quarter were purchased last year and going through induction. They'll be entering service. And then, the one to two that I mentioned are incremental to those two.\nMichael Linenberg: These airplanes, they're all being cash financed or debt financed. Right? You've moved away from leases, right?\nDave Davis: Yeah. We haven't done any operating leases. And we don't intend to do any operating leases. It will be either debt financings, pay cash for them or enter into finance leases, which gives us basically a purchase option. So, yeah, that's how we finance all of them.\nMichael Linenberg: Just from a modeling perspective, you're down to like just over $1 million of rentals. Does that does that go to zero sometime this year? Or is it next year? Or is there always going to be a little residual there?\nDave Davis: We have a couple more aircraft that are on operating leases. I think probably 2026?\nJude Bricker: 2024.\nDave Davis: 2024 for both of them. Yeah. So after that, I guess our rentals will go to zero. Yeah.\nJude Bricker: There might be some engine leases from time to time.\nDave Davis: A few miscellaneous things like that, but that line should drive to zero.\nMichael Linenberg: Lastly, Jude, you have made some interesting comments about how things have sort of shifted and changed through COVID and a few comments maybe a month \u2013 well, this is actually several months ago, about how demand was shifting through the week. And was it less business travel or more leisure? I think you made a comment about the fact that the fares were so high during peak period that it was pushing more demand into like Tuesday, Wednesday and helping out with sort of volatility on demand and pricing through the week. Any additional thoughts around that? It's always interesting. As it relates maybe to your March quarter demand, I'm all ears.\nJude Bricker: I think there's been a lot of commentary about leisure and travel patterns being kind of pushed into a more flexible customer base where you can travel on Tuesdays, you can travel in offseason. And my commentary was mostly that I see the same uplift in off-peak periods, but I don't have any reason \u2013 I can't go as far as Scott Kirby, for example, to draw a causal relationship. And I think we should be careful about it.  So what we're seeing is dollar improvement, roughly the same across all periods. But on a percentage basis then, it's a bigger percentage increase in off-peak. So I think there is an opportunity for us to expand utilization into off-peak periods, but I'm very careful about adjusting that entire strategy towards taking advantage of these opportunities because I think a big reason off-peak has been expanding the way it has is because fares are so high. And so, you get that value shoppers that are adjusting their schedules to find lower fares. And I don't know if that's really a permanent shift in behavior.\nMichael Linenberg: But it sounds like you'll take advantage of it when you can, right?\nJude Bricker: Yeah. So, if you look at monthly, year over year percentage growth, we'll show the highest percentage growth in September in 2023. That's our weakest month. And that's a function of us just having more opportunity in those months because fares are generally higher.\nOperator: The next question will come from Scott Group of Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So pretty much everyone else has given us some thoughts on full year. I'm wondering if you could do the same. I understand Q1 will seasonally be the best margin quarter. But do you feel good about double-digit operating margins this year? Can we get back to the 12%, 12.5% we did in 2019? Just any thoughts?\nDave Davis: Yeah, we've obviously not given full year guidance yet. But we feel very good about the entire year. Our 2023 plan is very strong. I don't want to give specific operating income information, but we'll be largely back on track in 2023, is our plan, to historical margin levels.\nScott Group: As other airlines get their labor deals done, do you worry that as rates reset higher that maybe some attrition issues start to emerge again?\nDave Davis: I think it's a concern. Maybe less attrition issues and more like availability issues. But there's been a number of new deals. We haven't really had any problems so far attracting folks. So we're not overly concerned about that. And actually, our attrition figures continue to underperform what we forecast them to be. So, attrition is actually lower than we've been planning. So, intuitively, you would say yes, that as others increase wages, there's going to be some competitive pressure. We haven't seen any impact of that so far.\nScott Group: To the extent it emerges at some point, are there mechanisms in place where you can make adjustments if needed? Would you think about that?\nDave Davis: We just signed a new deal at the end of 2021. We'd make spot tweaking here and there, if we needed to, to solve particular issues, but we don't contemplate any wholesale changes. \nJude Bricker: And also, the contract that we have has rate escalators embedded in and rate changes as well. So, our pilots will get raises irrespective of amendments to the contract.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question will come from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: You guys, I'm not looking for a specific guidance, but coming out of the IPO, we understood the business mix here. You guys do have a unique model relative to your competitors, with the Amazon fine and the charter fine. Hypothetically, you guys should probably be generating margins towards the top end of the group. I guess what is the impediment as you look forward in 23? Or do you think getting the pilot deal done last year was the biggest issue?\nJude Bricker: Yeah, I would call two things to your attention. One is that Amazon has low margins right at the moment because we increased pilot pay rates faster than the escalation in the contract. So those margins were compressed. That'll be a temporary issue. And it will be better this year. And it'll be even better in 2024, et cetera. \nDave Davis: There's escalators built into the Amazon contract. \nJude Bricker: Exactly. The second thing is, right now, the highest margin opportunities are constrained mostly today by pilots. And as we've talked about, as we bring our staffing up, then we'll be able to add particularly during those periods of time. So, that was what impacted us most strongly during the summer 2022, which we talked about, as we're kind of under allocated into the markets that saw the biggest rises, namely, big city connectivity, Minneapolis and our network. We're under allocated there because we didn't have a crew. That'll be different this summer. And I think margins will continue to expand as we move forward into 2024. \nDave Davis: I think it sort of more broadly \u2013 in answer to your question, the thesis that we had in place when we went public remains, and we think we can generate either the top or one of the \u2013 very near the top in industry margins on a go-forward basis. And our 2023 plan reflects that.  As Jude said, some temporary things out there. Growth, as we can continue to hit our growth targets, there's plenty of opportunities out there. We don't think we're at sort of marginal fair levels yet. And there's plenty of growth opportunity for us. We actually think the 2023 growth plan is achievable, and actually somewhat modest. And if we hit those numbers, we will be, we believe, near the near the top of the industry again.\nBrandon Oglenski: Maybe just a quick follow-up on the Amazon comment. Do you guys have built-in cost indexes there? So, like, if your pilot wages go up, then the Amazon contract will adjust? Or is that just the normal rate increase that you guys had negotiated previously?\nJude Bricker: It's normal. And pilot escalation has been lumpy. So, they eventually will align, but sometimes we're ahead, sometimes we're behind. \nDave Davis: Exactly.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Christopher Stathoulopoulos of Susquehanna.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Jude, the comment in your prepared remarks on the 20 aircraft that are contracted out of the active fleet of 55, do you have a target level for that piece of the fleet that you want to keep on contracted or charter? Or is that just going to move around in response to the market? And then, could you just remind us of the economics here? What utilization minimums are there, if any, and escalators that are built into those contracts?\nJude Bricker: I would look at it on a block hour basis and we would be optimized at around a quarter of our block hours allocated to fixed fee contracts. And that's because of the mins and maxes associated with our pilot contract. So, if those contracts service minimum hour obligations to our crews, then we're optimized for being peak to off-peak on our sched service. So, we want to keep it around 25.  Now, those opportunities aren't reliably presented to us. And we can't just pluck them out whenever we want. So we're going to continue to take those opportunities as they come and build up that side of the business and try to keep scheduled service growing as we can. And that's basically the philosophy. So, about a quarter of our block hours.  Now, each of these contracts are different. We were talking about economics. In the case of the Amazon contract, for example, there's a fixed component and then a variable component. So, margins expand as utilization goes down, actually. Most of our fixed fee contracts have something similar where there's a minimum hour obligation from the customer and then a variable component beyond that, and that variable component, in many cases, actually gets cheaper for them to incentivize more flying.  All these businesses are going to produce really high margins, and the stability of that operation is really what we're after. Chris, I don't know what else I can tell you on those.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: On a follow-up, you said utilization driven growth this year, could you just put a finer point there on the moving pieces, stage gauge, departures and then peak versus off-peak? \nDave Davis: Our peak utilization numbers are going to be \u2013 the nature of the business is a very peaky business. Our peak utilization numbers will be 12, 13 hours a day. Our trough utilization numbers will be mid to high-single digits. \nJude Bricker: We do see it coming down a little bit in the summer as we take advantage of the growth opportunities that we talked about, our new markets out of Minneapolis, which I would say are all bookings expectations, feel good about those. So, there will be a little bit of seasonality in terms of the stage length where we do longer in the first quarter and then we shorten it up a little bit in the summer, but it all corresponds with what Dave was saying.\nOperator: And for our next question, we have a follow-up from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Maybe a small percentage of your business, but for large tour operators, Apple Leisure as an example, can you talk about, in this backdrop, how willing you are to sell blocks of inventory to an Apple Leisure and how that may be compares to the past and how you think about that business when the fare environment and the demand environment are so strong?\nJude Bricker: Keep in mind that we kind of do network strategies that are fairly different. We have Minneapolis origination, and that's been expanding into the upper Midwest. In those markets, in Minneapolis, in particular, we're creating a really strong brand, we're investing in the brand through marketing, we intend to originate the maximum amount of that capacity as possible through direct distribution. And we're not having any issue with that. And so, that's a strategy. And partnering with an Apple or any kind of tour operator in those markets isn't that exciting to us.  In contrast, though, we're also augmenting our winter peak with summer opportunities, most notably out of Dallas, but also Houston and Central Texas and South Texas and many other markets in the future. Because summer is such a strong peak for most markets, with what we would say is a price driven consumer where we're going to be competitive during peak periods, still generating an average fare that's higher than the incumbents because we're only capitalizing on those very picky opportunities. In those markets, we are very open to block sales of our capacity with tour operators, OTAs, other distribution partners. And in my initial comments, I specifically called out contracted flying. That's kind of what I'm talking about. And we're negotiating those rates now or recently, and we're seeing a lot of demand from them. And we're more than happy to offload some of our capacity into those markets through those partners' channels.\nOperator: Thank you. As I'm seeing no further questions in the queue, I would now like to turn the conference back to Jude Bricker for closing remarks.\nJude Bricker: Thanks for your time, everybody. We're really excited about where we're headed. It's good to kind of get some of the challenges of last year behind us and focus on growth and execution. Thanks for joining us on the call. We'll talk to you in about 90 days. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a good day and enjoy your weekend."}, {"symbol": "SNCY", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-11-01 21:13:13", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Sun Country Airlines Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.

With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Jude.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon, everybody. We have much to be excited about in our 3Q results. I\u2019m particularly pleased though with our performance operationally. Since July 1st, we\u2019ve run a 99.8% controllable completion factor with 83% A14. Today, it\u2019s been 96 days since we had a cancellation. This would block our growth of over 15% versus the same quarter in 2019. Operational results like these are a team effort, and I\u2019m really proud of what our folks were able to deliver after coming through a tough spring. Since the demand environment\u2019s rapid recovery began earlier this year, our focus of Sun Country has been to staff for growth to restore passenger fleet utilization to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to find sufficient new hires to meet our goals. However, particularly in the case of pilots, we continue to work through training overhang. Last quarter, we were constrained primarily by first star officers, this quarter captain availability has become the constraining input. As our rapid hiring works through our training program, we expect fleet utilization to continue to improve into the beginning of 2023. Increased utilization is very valuable in this demand environment. Our scheduled service TRASM in 3Q improved versus 2019 by over 46%. Our TRASM improvement exceeds that of the industry as a whole due to our sculpted scheduling and the strength of the Sun Country\u2019s brand in our local market. Based on our sales for travel into 2023 in industry schedules, we anticipate yield strength to continue for the foreseeable future. In scheduled service, we\u2019re still seeing strength across all our markets, leisure, VFR, international, domestic, peak and off peak. Our charter business continues to show yield improvements as well. Due to the lower cost of incremental capacity adds in the strong yield environment, we expect margins to widen in the next year. The West Coast of Florida is an important destination for us, particularly in the winter travel season. Our thoughts go out to the people of that region as they work to recover from the tragedy of the Ian. For Sun Country, anticipating the demand recovery to that region is challenging. Typically, Fort Myers in particular is an increasingly larger part of our network through our March peak. We\u2019ve made cuts through the end of the year and continue to monitor bookings through the first quarter. Our customers will travel, however, we have less certainty about historically reliable demand. We\u2019ve launched two new markets into Florida, and we\u2019ll redeploy capacity to other sunny destinations. However, the uncertainty is why we have a wider guide than usual for the fourth quarter. We expect the region to fully recover and we\u2019ll be there along the way. One benefit of our model that\u2019s good to highlight in a rising rate environment is our flexible fleet strategy. We buy used aircraft in the spot market, so prices will adjust to finance costs, global weakness and a strong dollar. And the timing of our deliveries will be in response to our staffing levels. Based on our current fleet commitments, we expect the fleet to grow to 54 aircraft, while also reducing net interest expense in \u201823 over \u201822. To summarize, we\u2019re not limited by opportunities, capital nor aircraft. And I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019re making on staffing 4Q and 2023 are setting up very well for us. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave.\nDave Davis: Thanks, Jude. Before I get into a discussion of our results, I want to point out that I\u2019ll be making comparisons about last year as well as 2019 in some cases. We\u2019ve been quicker to get back to a more normalized environment and year-over-year changes are often more indicative of our progress at this point. Sun Country posted an adjusted operating income of approximately $16 million for the quarter in an adjusted EPS of $0.12 per share. Adjusted operating margin was 7.2%, well ahead of our prior guidance. We achieved these results despite continued industry challenges, including third quarter fuel prices being 75% higher than last year, lingering under capacity driven by staffing issues and the impact of Hurricane Ian in the State of Florida. Let me start with a discussion of our revenue and capacity. Third quarter revenue totaled $221.7 million, a 28% increase versus last year and 29% better than 2019. We estimate Hurricane Ian drove about $1 million in lost revenue during the third quarter. Demand continues to be robust. Q3 scheduled service revenue was $152.5 million, a 34% increase year-over-year. Q3 scheduled service TRASM increased a very strong 39% versus last year, and 46% versus Q3 of 2019. Scheduled service TRASM continue to improve within the quarter as July increased 33%, August 39% and September 55% versus the same period last year. Total fare increased 16% versus last year to $167.73. Combination of higher fares and an increase in scheduled service load factor of almost 10 percentage points year-over-year is indicative of the strong leisure demand environment that we\u2019re \u2013 that we continue to see. Charter revenue for the quarter was $42.9 million, a 27% increase year-over-year, driven by a large increase in flying under our long-term contracts, such as for MLS and Caesars. Q3 charter flying under our long-term contracts made up 80% of our charter block hours. While we\u2019ve been able to sequentially grow our ad-hoc flying, capacity remains constrained as we focus resources on other flying. As we continue to make progress towards normalized pilot staffing levels, there\u2019s a large opportunity and simply returning to historical levels of ad-hoc flying. Versus the third quarter of last year, ad-hoc charter flying is almost 70% lower. Cargo revenue for the quarter of $23.7 million was 3% lower than Q3 of \u201821. This reduction is due entirely to a one-time payment from Amazon in Q3 of last year for flying that had been done soon after we started our cargo operations, but had not yet been billed. Total block hours grew 2% year-over-year and 15% versus 2019. Since Q3 of \u201821, our average passenger aircraft count grew 12% and our cargo aircraft count remained flat. As was the case in Q2, we\u2019re still working through the process of expanding our pilot production pipeline. As such, the utilization of our fleet was 6.4 hours in the third quarter of this year versus 7 hours last year. On a normalized basis, we expect aircraft utilization to be on the order of 8 hours per day, which provides us with significant opportunity for very high-margin earnings growth as we return utilization to normal levels. We\u2019re planning for fleet growth through the remainder of 2022 and into 2023. The aircraft we have already purchased, one entered service in Q3 and five more will enter service during Q4 and Q1 of \u201823. Additionally, we\u2019re in the process of acquiring three aircrafts to be delivered during Q4 of \u201823 and Q1 of \u201824. And those aircraft will enter service in early \u201824. We continue to pursue opportunistic purchases of aircraft to support our capacity growth. Let me turn now to costs. Our Q3 adjusted CASM increased 18% on flat total ASMs versus the same period last year. The increase in our non-fuel CASM is largely driven by the fact that our aircraft utilization remains lower than target in the impact of our new pilot agreement, which we signed at the end of last year. We paid an average of $3.93 per gallon for fuel in Q3 \u201822, to 75% higher year-over-year. As a reminder, given our differentiated business model, we pass on approximately a third of our total fuel usage to our cargo and charter customers. We\u2019ve been able to offset a large portion of our higher costs through continued growth and improved unit revenues. Turning now to our guidance for Q4. We\u2019re expecting to grow block hours between 9% and 12% versus the same period in 2021 as we\u2019ve consistently seen leisure demand remains very strong. We expect total revenue to increase between 27% and 33% year-over-year to $220 million to $230 million. At $3.75 jet fuel, we\u2019d anticipate an operating margin of between 4% and 8% in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re giving a little wider guidance range in our numbers as usually the case. As Jude mentioned, we\u2019re still assessing the impact of Hurricane Ian on our bookings in Southwest Florida during Q4. Finally, we announced that the Sun Country Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to $50 million worth of Sun Country\u2019s shares. Our intent is in the near term is to enter into a $25 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, allowing us to quickly acquire a portion of these shares. Apollo does not intend to sell shares as part of the buyback program. Our balance sheet is very strong, with $318 million in total liquidity as of October 31st, which includes $25 million in an undrawn revolver. At the end of the third quarter, our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3 times which is among the lowest for airlines in the US. We\u2019ve invested heavily in our staff members, purchased the new aircraft we need to grow and steadily paid down our aircraft debt as it comes due. We\u2019ve used Sun Country\u2019s shares as a good investment, especially at current values, and we have sufficient liquidity to return capital to our shareholders in a prudent manner. We believe the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and as we continue to demonstrate our model is highly resilient to changes in macroeconomic conditions. Our focus is and will remain on profitable growth. With that, I\u2019ll open it up for questions.\nOperator: At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ravi Shanker at Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you. Good afternoon, gents. Dave, your unique seasonality kind of gives you probably a little more kind of forward look than many of your peers maybe into \u201823 even. Can you give us an update on what your kind of booking curve looks like for like January or maybe even beyond that in the spring break if you\u2019re having?\nJude Bricker: Hey, Ravi it\u2019s Jude. We\u2019re selling through May right now and we\u2019ve seen the fair improvements that we\u2019ve seen in the reported period continue out through the entire selling cycle. So you know it\u2019s too early, obviously to make predictions on year over three or year over TRASM improvements into that period. But there\u2019s no sign of any slowdown in the leisure space. Keep in mind, while we do have a leisure focus, we are fairly focused geographically, particularly in the wintertime with Minneapolis origination in the surrounding region into you know, sunny destinations across the south, Mexico and Caribbean. So from what we\u2019re seeing, it looks really good.\nDave Davis: Yeah, yeah. No slowdown like we sort of talked about previously, neither bookings or in TRASM growth.\nRavi Shanker: Great. And then maybe as a follow-up, can you remind us what the economic sensitivity of the charter business looks like? I mean, it sounds like if you\u2019re shipping like sports teams around the country, it doesn\u2019t sound particularly macro sensitive. But how has it done in previous recessions?\nDave Davis: I mean, I think particularly as the business is now configured, it\u2019s probably even more resilient than it has been in the past, which it typically is. I mean, the vast bulk of our flying now is under contract and that\u2019s under contract for things like Major League Sports, some casino flying, which proves to be pretty resilient during recessions. Some other sort of specialty stuff that we\u2019re doing under contract. So I think it\u2019s probably very resilient \u2013 in recessionary periods. You know even some of the ad-hoc stuff, we think we can get back even if we sort of enter into a recessionary mode, the military stuff and so forth. So that business I think is going to be \u2013 will be strong in all conditions.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. I\u2019ll pass it along. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth. Duane, the queue is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thank you. So maybe you could give us some detailed thoughts about 2023. But I\u2019m just wondering you know hypothetically, if we had a blank sheet of paper you know where would you be deploying the most incremental capacity across the three segments? You know where are you seeing the highest incremental margin opportunity across the three segments today?\nJude Bricker: Scheduled service particularly. So it\u2019s a seasonal function. Hey, Duane, it\u2019s Jude by the way. Scheduled service in our peak periods, is clearly the best opportunity that we have. It\u2019s also the one that\u2019s being cut the most due to crew availability, because a lot of the other segments are long-term contracts, which is great. But it\u2019s also you know when we have these kind of really rapid yield recovery environments like we\u2019re in today, we can\u2019t put a lot of capacity into these peak periods. So they\u2019re cut pretty heavily. But in the summertime you know it\u2019s our big city connectivity we really outperformed. I think that\u2019s consistent with what the whole industry is seeing. And in the wintertime, it\u2019s the very well established leisure destinations that tend to consume a big portion of our network like Minneapolis to Cancun, Fort Myers, Orlando, Vegas, LA, Phoenix. And that\u2019s where \u2013 that\u2019s where we put incremental capacity and it would \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t affect the yield in those markets. And it could absorb a tremendous amount based on the bookings we\u2019re seeing.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for that. And then just on maybe charter and cargo, is you accounted for you know the same way across those segments and maybe within charter, do you have you know some charter agreements where you know fuel is a pass through and others where it might be you know reported differently, just if you could help us think about how fuel flows through those two segments?\nDave Davis: Yeah, so on the charter side it\u2019s typically not a straight pass through. When an agreement is signed with a charter customer, there\u2019s typically a reference price that\u2019s inherent in the per block hour rate that the contract is set at. Then if fuel goes up, there is additional reimbursement from the charter customer, which is a revenue item. On the cargo side, that is in fact a straight pass through with Amazon paying for the fuel and therefore the fuel cost netting out not showing up in our fuel line.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is Thomas Fitzgerald with Cowen. Thomas, your line is live.\nThomas Fitzgerald: Hi, thanks very much for the time. Just two quick ones for me. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on just the hiring and training pipeline and how\u2019s that going? As well, just also wanted to curious if you could just talk about the benefit you\u2019re seeing from highest interest rates that we saw the interest income line and it really jumped this quarter. So thanks very much.\nJude Bricker: Hey, Tom. Yeah, I mean I\u2019ll take the last and first, which is just to say, I was just calling it out, because it will be probably an outlier in the industry. And that is to say, we don\u2019t have any requirements for debt and supportive any of our CapEx and we don\u2019t have a lot of CapEx planned for next year. And also with the spot market being the source of airplanes, we expect you know if you did see a global recession or you know even regional recessions around the world, then there would be more and cheaper airplanes coming available to our benefit. On the first part, you know we\u2019re hiring full classes every month. So we\u2019re getting all the new hires we need, there\u2019s not a whole lot of you know adding to that wouldn\u2019t help us that much, because now we\u2019re to the stage where we have sufficient FOs, we just need to transition FOs into the captain seat. And the process is taking several months to kind of get through \u2013 gearing up our new hire process into being able to handle classes of the side that we\u2019re doing about 20 to 25 a month, and then gearing up all the infrastructure we need in order to upgrade FOs into captains. So that\u2019s ongoing. You know I think what everybody really wants to hear is, when we\u2019re going to kind of get back to where utilization is what it is and the \u2013 is what it was and we have the pilots we need to fly this fleet to its optimal level. And we\u2019re still probably several months out you know say, six months until we kind of get caught up to ourselves. Keep in mind, the fleet grew for us about 70% since pre-pandemic levels, because we onboarded a whole cargo fleet through the pandemic. So we got a lot of catching up to do and it\u2019s probably going to take us another six months. But the encouraging part is, we build out the infrastructure, we opened a training center this month with two new SIMs. We have the SIM instructors, we have the check airman we need, we have the new hires we need. It\u2019s just about getting everybody through the pipeline. And so we have line of sight on finishing up and get back to where we need to be. And you know a lot of my commentary is really around \u2013 that flying that\u2019s going to be facilitated by that crew growth is really, really valuable in this environment. As we pointed out it\u2019s the flying that has been cut the heaviest because of crew shortages.\nOperator: All right. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Michael Linenberg. Michael with Deutsche Bank. Well your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg: Yeah. Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Well congratulations on being the first to announce the pro shareholder initiative. So that\u2019s great in the industry.\nJude Bricker: Thank you, Michael.\nMichael Linenberg: Yep. You\u2019re welcome. With respect to the excise tax on share repos, does that \u2013 that doesn\u2019t kick in until January 1st, 2023. Is that right? Or is it before that?\nDave Davis: No, that\u2019s right. So basically we\u2019re structuring this is, is our intent when we don\u2019t have the paperwork totally finalized, but we\u2019re very, very close, is to do a $25 million ASR and then $25 million open market. the ASR portion, the shares at auction, the vast bulk of them will be delivered to us very quickly, which means, we\u2019ll basically be able to take possession before that excise tax kicks in on that full \u2013 on that first 25.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. That\u2019s fantastic news. My second question, Jude I just want to go back to you know you did call out captain availability, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just that you aggressively hired a lot of first officers and that resulted in an imbalance on crews or if you\u2019re still seeing some more senior pilots defect to other carriers? Can you just elaborate on that?\nJude Bricker: Yeah, that\u2019s the easy one. I mean we\u2019re seeing attrition below what we had expected it to be. So we\u2019re not losing captains. We\u2019re losing some FOs, but for the most part, our captains\u2019 attrition is de minimis, it\u2019s just about giving them into the less seat at this point.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And then, Dave, I\u2019ll just squeeze in a quick one on cash taxes, when I think about you know some of the losses that you and others have incurred. I mean you\u2019ve been mostly profitable over the last year, year and a half, you were the first back to profitability. But should \u2013you know your cash taxes, is that going to be still? That\u2019s going to be a very low rate when we think about from a cash flow perspective? I just \u2013 if you can just remind us on your status on it. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Mike.\nDave Davis: Yeah, so the answer on the cash taxes piece is effectively we will be close to full cash taxpayers. And here - here\u2019s why. While we had a sufficient where we had a significant NOL that we sort of carried through from you know from many years ago. We also have a TRA agreement in place with our largest shareholder where basically the value of that NOL is essentially paid out to the \u2013 to our shareholders over you know as we generate earnings. So effectively if you look at the cash flow of the business, we\u2019d look like full cash taxpayers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Christopher Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna. Chris, you\u2019re live.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Thank you. Good afternoon. So, Dave, the eight hour utilization target you mentioned in your prepared remarks, is that based on the active fleet today or with the additional aircraft that you\u2019re planning on taking in? Also what\u2019s the ceiling that you believe you can comfortably run the fleet at into 2020 upgrade?\nDave Davis: Yeah, well the 8 hour number is sort of our \u2013 is where we would like the fleet utilization to be. So like I said, we\u2019re in the 6s now, we\u2019re going to be taking additional aircraft into service as we add pilots, that\u2019ll sort of stay flattish, and then start to drift up in 2023. And we ultimately hope some time later in \u201823 to be at that 8 hour number. The \u2013 we were doing like 9 hour utilization numbers in 2019, which is probably unsustainably high because at that time, we were doing some flying red eye stuff and other things that really wasn\u2019t that great. So we\u2019re probably not going to be doing that anymore. So I think if we\u2019re hitting 8 hours a utilization, that\u2019s where we need to be and that\u2019s a \u201823 into the second half of \u201823 number.\nJude Bricker: I will comment that our utilization is somewhat a function of the fuel price. So as fuel prices rise, marginal flying is cut, and therefore we were able to manage pass through more effectively the most carriers and as fuel prices fall we can increase utilization to absorb the increased marginal opportunity. So 8 hours is kind of where we would like to be. But you know that number could be higher or lower, depending on where fuel goes.\nDave Davis: Yeah, and one other thing, I think because it\u2019s you know the model is a little bit different than some others. So remember, the utilization is not a steady utilization day by day, it is very, very dependent on peak periods. So into the \u2013 you know low teens hours per day utilization at peak times, and then significantly lower than that on trough days. So we\u2019re trying to keep the peak utilization as high as possible and the troughs are going to be lower troughs than they typically would be. And the average of those things is what\u2019s leading to the \u2013 to the lower utilization than we want to see.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And the follow-up, so, Jude with the ATSA with Amazon, are there \u2013 just remind us if there any contractual minimums with that flying? And then how soon in advance do you know how much you\u2019re going to be flying? So for example, at this point, you have the schedule in place for this year\u2019s peak season. Thank you.\nJude Bricker: Sure, Chris. So there\u2019s no minimums. You know right now the flying, because the pilots would be more efficient flying something else is probably we would like to be a little bit smaller and you know in the immediate future. But there are no minimums in the contract. And in the schedule cycle isn\u2019t delineated clearly, but we\u2019re on a pretty good pace of about 90 days, for 90 days. So 90 days out, we\u2019re planning the schedule for the 90 \u2013 91st to 180th day, and that kind of repeats itself. And the schedule is very fluid, the volumes have been pretty consistent, but the schedule as to where the airplanes fly and when they go, it\u2019s pretty fluid. So this \u2013 these schedules move around quite a lot. And so you know I think one of the main things is that, we\u2019re one of the carriers, the few carriers, perhaps that can do this for them, because it\u2019s so you know, it\u2019s also a schedule carrier where you\u2019re used to so consistent planning. It\u2019s just a very fluid environment in cargo.\nDave Davis: Yeah. One other thing that to point out, though, is, while there are no flying minimums, the revenue from Amazon comes in the form of both a fixed payment per aircraft not utilization dependent, and then a per block hour number. So while there aren\u2019t minimums there is a fixed payment for aircraft that we receive simply for operating the airplane.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: All right. If there aren\u2019t any further questions, that does conclude our Q&A section of the call. I will now turn it back over to your CEO, Jude Bricker.\nJude Bricker: Thanks for your interest everybody. I hope you have a great afternoon and we\u2019ll talk to you again at the end of the year. Thanks.\nOperator: That does conclude the conference. Thank you for joining.

My name is Kathy Darnell, and I'll be operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Chris Allen, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Allen, you may begin.\nChris Allen: Thank you. I'm joined today by Jude Bricker, our Chief Executive Officer; Dave Davis, President and Chief Financial Officer; and a group of others to help answer questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during this call, the company may make certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements. Our remarks today may include forward-looking statements, which are based upon management's current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions, and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Actual results may different materially. We encourage you to review the risk factors and cautionary statements outlined in our earnings release and our most recent SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. You can find our second quarter press release on the investor relations portion of the website at ir.suncountry.com. With that said, I'd like to turn the call over the Jude.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Demand for all segments of our business remains as strong as it's ever been. Our revenue in 2Q grew over 29% versus the same quarter in 2019 on block hour growth at 23%. During the pandemic, we launched and built out our cargo business and now, and over the next several quarters, our main focus at Sun Country is to staff our airline to get back to 2019 utilization levels on our passenger fleet, as quickly as possible. We want to deliver this growth, while also maintaining the operational excellence and service levels that our customers expect of us. I'm especially proud that year to date, Sun Country has led the industry in completion factor with 98.2% in this challenging operational environment. That performance during such rapid growth is a testament to the hard work and talents of all our team members that deliver for our customers each day. Like all airlines, we're facing the challenges of record-high fuel, tight labor market, and inflationary pressures. We built a model that we believe can deliver profits in any environment. We were profitable through the pandemic, through a war, and now through record fuel. Our flexible network, combined with having a large percentage of our flying committed to long-term pass-through contracts, give us the ability to be successful regardless of what challenges we're facing. By design, our response to high fuel is to cut off-peak flying and concentrate our schedule on periods of the calendar when we're able to achieve acceptable returns. As fuel rose rapidly through February and into May, we aggressively cut weaker periods like mid-week, May and September and long-haul routes that are more fuel intensive. These capacity cuts, along with all our revenue initiatives, allowed us to deliver over 29% schedule service TRASM growth versus 2019 for 2Q. As we've had more lead time going into the third quarter, we expect our scheduled service TRASM to approach 40% improvement, and we continue to see strength across our selling schedule currently posted through April of next year. We expect not only to be profitable in all environments, but also to deliver industry-leading margins. I want to give some color as to why, for the first time in 10 quarters, that isn't the case. The capacity changes we've implemented in the second and third quarters were all cuts. However, the fare environment and our fleet size justifies significantly more flying during peak periods. We weren't able to add this flying due to crew constraints. Since ratifying our pilot agreement at the end of last year, we haven't had any issues with retention or hiring. However, we're attempting to train about 4x the amount of crews versus pre-COVID levels. At the end of June, about a third of our FOs were in a training status. This resulted in a reduction for June, a peak month, of 30% in passenger fleet utilization versus 2019. With 40% of the fleet committed to contract flying, we were under-allocated to the best margin opportunities during the quarter, namely scheduled service, large volume domestic markets.  As hiring retention continues to not be an issue, we expect our crew constraints to be temporary. Again, I'm so proud of all our team members here at Sun Country for going above and beyond every day. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.\nDave Davis: Thanks Jude. Before I get into a discussion of our results, recall that Q2 is a seasonally weaker quarter for Sun Country than Q1. This is unlike many of our competitors whose business strengthens during Q2. Sun Country posted an adjusted operating profit of $4 million for the quarter and an adjusted EPS loss of negative $0.03 per share. Adjusted operating margin was 1.8%. Our results were driven by a combination of unprecedented growth in unit revenue, historically high fuel prices, and under-capacity driven by staffing issues. I'll delve into each one of these items in my remarks. First, revenue and capacity. Second quarter revenue totaled $219.1 million, a 29% increase versus Q2 of 2019. Demand continues to be robust. Scheduled service revenue was $152.6 million, a 22.5% increase over Q2 2019, and scheduled service TRASM grew 29% versus 2019. For the month of June, scheduled service TRASM was 44% higher than 2019 and July finished over 40% higher than July 2019. So, recent positive revenue trends are continuing and are evident in our forward bookings. Our average fare of $173 was 22% higher than Q2 of 2019. System block hour growth for the quarter was 23% higher than Q2 of 2019, driven by the growth of our cargo segment. System ASMs declined by 6%, compared to Q2 2019, which was considerably smaller than we would've optimally been, even at $4 plus fuel prices. As Jude mentioned, since finalizing our pilot agreement in December of last year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to attract all of the pilots we need to meet our staffing requirements. In addition, attrition has continued to moderate since Q4 of last year. As we implement the new agreement, we've been increasing the size of our hiring and training pipeline to accommodate our growth plans. This work is underway and we continue to make good progress. Pilot output in June was more than double the output in April and our September new-hire class is over 30% larger than earlier in the year. Charter revenue for the quarter was $42.7 million, a 25% increase over Q2 of 2019. Over 90% of the charter flying we did during the quarter was under long-term contracts. While increasing the proportion of business under contract is a favorable trend, there remains ample opportunity to increase the amount of profitable ad hoc flying that we do. In 2019, 49% of our charter flying was ad hoc. This gap to today's number represents growth potential for our charter segment as the number of available pilots continues to increase. Cargo revenue for the quarter of $21.2 million was flat with Q1 2022, down by 4% versus Q2 2021. The decrease was driven by more aircraft and heavy check versus last year. We did not fly main deck cargo aircraft in 2019. Turning now to costs. Our Q2 non-fuel costs per block hour only increased 3.6% versus Q2 of 2019, despite implementation of our new pilot agreement. Adjusted CASM over the same period increased 15% versus 2019, and a 6.4% decrease in total ASMs. This increase in our non-fuel CASM is largely driven by the fact that, as I mentioned, we were significantly undersized relative to both our initial plans for Q2 and for the profitable flying opportunities that were available to us. The average price that we paid for fuel in the second quarter was $4.39 per gallon, was far higher than the $2.29 per gallon we paid in the second quarter of 2019. Relative to the Q2 guidance we gave last quarter of $3.50 per gallon, the higher price drove $15.5 million in added fuel expense. We experienced the $3.50 per gallon as we guided the reduction in fuel expense would've led to an adjusted op margin for the quarter of 9%. So, would've been despite the capacity challenges I've discussed. Let me talk now briefly about guidance. As we move through Q3, demand environment remains very strong and we expect scheduled service TRASM to be in excess of 40% higher than Q3 of 2019. We expect third quarter total revenue to be up 25% to 28% versus 2019 and operating margin to be between 3% and 5%. Our projected Q3 fuel price is $3.84 per gallon, and we expect to fly 31,000 to 32,000 block hours, or approximately 1.5 billion ASMs. We believe the fundamentals of our business plan remain strong and our model is highly resilient to changes in macroeconomic conditions. Our focus remains on profitable growth. The fact that we have grown less than anticipated has resulted in a decline in aircraft utilization relative to pre-COVID periods. As our pilot output continues to improve, we anticipate growth will come at higher margin as fixed aircraft costs are already being incurred. Finally, let me focus on our balance sheet where we closed the second quarter with $308 million of liquidity, consisting of $283 million in cash and $25 million of undrawn revolver. Despite extremely high fuel prices, we generated over $15 million of free cash flow during the quarter, excluding aircraft CapEx, and we continue to expect to be strongly free cash flow positive for the year. Our strong balance sheet continues to provide capital deployment flexibility in the quarters ahead. With that, I'll open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first call comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Go ahead, your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. You gave some of the stats on training, but maybe you can just kind of re-summarize that. Can you speak to how your throughput is changing? How did the number of flight instructors change? I think you were looking for a step-up there in the month of July. And just to maybe bottom line it, when do you think you're going to be fully back or where you want to be on staffing, maybe with an eye toward the fourth quarter?\nDave Davis: Yeah, so just a couple more stats. I talked about, sort of the pretty dramatic increase in our pilot output. There's been a couple of bottlenecks in the training pipeline. One of the biggest ones, which we've now largely overcome, is on basically check airmen, IOE pilots who can certify our pilots to fly before they get online. We had only five IOE instructors in the months, kind of, leading up to July 1, when we increased that number to 19. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to increase that number in the months ahead, so that bottleneck we think is largely cleared. There's a couple other things we're sort of working through here as we go forward, which I think we're going to have solved, I would say, in the next quarter to two quarters. We'll know a lot more in the next several months, but all of our trends are very favorable. If you look at our growth, as we look out later into the year, we'll be accelerating again relative to the fourth quarter. So, we've just been going through implementing the new pilot agreement. The good news is, sort of some of the uncontrollable factors, like attrition and new hires, we have a solid handle on, so we can attract all the pilots we need and our classes are as big as we want them to be.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, great. And then just for a follow-up on network, obviously, right here and now you're constrained, but can you give some color on the types of markets that maybe outperformed in 2Q versus the markets that underperformed, with the benefit of hindsight?\nJude Bricker: Sure, Duane. So, the most disappointing under-capacity allocations were markets that were in, kind of an in-elastic state where they were large enough markets to handle a lot more capacity, showed significant revenue improvements. And we believe that adding more capacity wouldn't have changed the revenue environment much. And most of those markets were Minneapolis to large cities like Denver, Dallas, Baltimore, Boston, New York, Portland, Seattle and Houston, Indianapolis. So, those markets, I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we don't know for sure, but were lifted by a return of business demand, which lifted overall fares. And we think that there was a lot of opportunity to add significant capacity. Instead, we were allocated more into fixed fee, as we talked about, but also a lot of leisure markets that didn't see the, kind of revenue   improvement that we saw in these larger markets. Grant, anything to add?\nGrant Whitney: No, I'll just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 well, I would add one thing. It's just, we've grown Minneapolis non-stop destinations by over 50% through COVID. And as Jude mentioned, some markets performed better than others, but I would say broadly, Minneapolis performed very, very well. The new markets did meet expectations and we did see a lot of good growth opportunities that remain in the market. And we will be opportunistic, we will take advantage of it as the capacity becomes available.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, thank you.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Duane.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next call comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. Hey, good morning guys. Just following up on...\nJude Bricker: Hey, Mike.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, guys. Just following up on Duane's question. When I did see you pull down also some of the long, you know high volume summer markets, say West Coast, Hawaii, I just assumed that that was all because energy prices or fuel prices were above $4 a gallon, but it does sound like that you just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you didn't have the staffing. Was it a combination of both or would those markets have worked \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some of those longer haul markets, would they have worked, given where overall fares are, where pricing is and the higher fuel was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 was it mostly a staffing issue that drove that?\nJude Bricker: It would have worked, absolutely. I mean, keep in mind, like, if you talk about Hawaii, we're talking about a market that would've started around Memorial Day, a little bit before, and, I mean, everything in June works on the schedule service side. So, we were making decisions, a combination of fuel intensity, so it's about 50 gallons per passenger to fly somebody to Hawaii versus 20 gallons or so on our domestic network. And then also crew efficiency because we're crew constrained, if there's any positioning or penalty, then we can get more flying done in a different way, then that goes into the calculus as well. Hawaii, we expect to be back next summer, it was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I would have done just fine in this environment, but we're just trying to put the best stuff in.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. That's helpful. Then just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I know this got picked up and maybe it was from an interview and it was just maybe an off-the-cuff conversation about potentially flying wide-body airplanes. And when I sort of think about what you're dealing with right now, it doesn't seem like that that's anytime soon, but maybe it is. And it may be that in conversations that you're having with Amazon, if you were to do wide-body, I'm sure that there'd be a cargo complement as well. Otherwise, I don't think it would make sense. Anything that you can sort of just add to that? Maybe again, that was kind of off-the-cuff ? I want to put that to rest.\nJude Bricker: Yeah. Sure. So, the question from the reporter was, noting that wide-body rates are in our pilot agreement, do we think it would work? And my response was, yeah, it'll work, but we don't have any plans to do it in the near future. So, multiple years from now, we might consider more than three years or so. And I agree with what your sentiment that there would be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 need to be, kind of a cargo complement as well, to get the same synergies out of our multi-segment business in narrow-bodies into the wide-body spaces. So, we're not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our focus right now is putting pilots out onto the line and that'll be the focus for the next two quarters. Yeah.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And just squeezing one quick one on the pilot contract. Obviously, you're rolling out various elements. When does the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is the preferential bidding system, is that now up and running or does that take some time? Because I do think that that will also help, kind of work through \u00e2\u0080\u0093 help you work things through. Is that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are you there yet on that part of the contract?\nJude Bricker: Yeah. So, that's a good question, Mike. The answer is no. So, we have some of the stuff in place that maybe doesn't help from a productivity perspective. What we don't have in place is prep bid, which will help us. We don't have that in place yet. So, that's probably early in the year. We're working through with   right now, very productively. We've got our vendor chosen and so forth. We just got to implement it and it's going to be early next year, but that's going to help, no doubt.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. Great. Thanks for the time, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Barclays, from the line of Brandon Oglenski.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thanks for taking my questions. Jude or Dave, does this, you know the training problems you're having right now or the constriction here, does this change your longer-term capacity plans, especially as we think about 2023 or 2024 relative to where you were, maybe pre-pilot contract?\nJude Bricker: Yeah, I mean, I think in the near term, we're certainly constrained by pilots. We expect, as we move into 2023, to be able \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our goal, and we have line of sight on a plan, to achieve a 20% block hour growth rate, which I think is achievable over a more sustained period. We're not going to grow for growth purposes.  I mean, we need to have high margin opportunities for that incremental flying, which I think exists in today's environment, even with fuel price, but in a recession or higher fuel, that growth rate would change. But we're building out training capacity, and also we have a contract and a value proposition to incoming pilots with diversity of our flying and growth rates that I think 20% is attainable.\nDave Davis: Yeah. Let me just give you a couple \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is Dave, hey, Brandon. Let me just give you a couple other numbers though. So, we originally expected to end the year with 42-passenger aircraft. That's where we'll be. We are in advanced discussions, pretty close right now, on three more aircraft that'll deliver to us later in 2023, and we are remaining active in the market. The beauty of the fleet plan, as we talked about many times before, is we don't have fixed orders coming in. So, we can pivot, go up and down, based on, sort of how much we can fly and what the opportunities are? And we're going to continue to do that, just like we've been doing. But we're in the market, we're still looking for aircraft. We've got a strong beat on three more. So, we're moving forward and planning for sustained growth.\nBrandon Oglenski: And Dave, I guess, as you look out into 2023, if you're able to achieve that 20% growth in block hours, where would you see the CASM benefit come out?\nDave Davis: You mean, like on what P&L line item or like what time period?\nBrandon Oglenski: No. I mean, I think the target was below 6 CASM, but now maybe a little bit around 6, where would you see longer-term CASM, I guess shaking out, to be more specific?\nDave Davis: Well, CASM will be heading down as we grow. I mean, I don't have a revised plan right now to give you a number. I think our costs are well in hand. I just don't have enough done on the 2023 plan yet to give you a good 2023 number. The other thing to think about, this is always tough with us because we've got a big cargo business. So, we have costs that derive unassociated with ASMs. So, we really look at a lot of stuff on a cost per block hour basis, which we feel is pretty well in-hand, but I don't have a precise CASM forecast for you right now.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate it, guys. Thank you.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Brandon.\nOperator: Thank you. So, our next call comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks, good morning guys.\nJude Bricker: Hey, Scott.\nScott Group: So, I think you talked about 44% unit revenue growth in June, 40% or so in July, any thoughts on where we go from here and what you're seeing with fares as fuel prices are starting to come down?\nJude Bricker: So, Scott, just want to make a clarifying point, which is that that's for scheduled service TRASM, which is about, I don't know, 60% of our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 70% of our block hours, 65% of our block hours, something like that. And the rest is in long-term fixed contracts, which adjusts slowly. And so, yeah, TRASM, I think your question is about long-term demand trends. We've seen really consistent year over three unit revenue improvements in sales for the entire selling schedule out through April. So, we don't see any slowdown associated with \u00e2\u0080\u0093 any pullback in demand from where we were on peak levels in July. Our own capacity can influence that if we're able to add more. We don't want fares to get too high where travel is unattainable for a large portion of our customers, but there's no indication in any of our forward bookings of any weakness or any change from this summer  .\nScott Group: And so, at least for now you feel like you'll be able to sort of keep the drop in fuel and keep the benefit of that.\nJude Bricker: Yes.\nScott Group: And then you talked about, in the beginning, that you want to have industry-leading margins. Maybe just think about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that's, maybe the goal of double-digit margins, what has to happen \u00e2\u0080\u0093 realistically, when can we get back to a double-digit operating margin?\nJude Bricker: Yeah, I mean, so if you look back in the second quarter, the foregone opportunities of flying, it's hard to tell, but it's probably worth on the pre-tax basis and operating basis, in the tune around $15 million, which would've put us pretty close to double-digits. And I think \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so then the answer to your question becomes how quickly we can put crews out onto the line to get the passenger fleet back to utilization levels that we have had in 2019. Now, the fuel price is higher, so the flying opportunities for high utilization are, sort of concentrated when fares are naturally higher. So May, there wasn't that much  ; September, there won't be that many opportunities to add other than ad hoc charter opportunities. But for summer months, where this demand environment is so good, we're forgoing significant opportunities with utilization down 30%. And that's the key to delivering back to operating margins that lead the industry, I think.\nScott Group: So, would that be your goal or expectation for 2023, to get back to leading the industry?\nJude Bricker: Yes.\nScott Group: Okay. All right. Thank you, guys.\nJude Bricker: Just a couple other color, just because I  myself. There's some \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as you compare across the industry, so Frontier is taking sale leaseback, they take a gain from that. There are three carriers in the industry with significant hedge portfolios, with significant advantage of those hedge portfolios in a mark-to-market basis, Southwest Alaska, and Delta. And then there's a business customer rebound that we're not benefiting from. So, just keep that in mind, and I think when we think more long-term, we're in a really good place.\nScott Group: Makes sense. Thank you, guys.\nJude Bricker: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn it back to Jude Bricker for closing remarks.\nJude Bricker: Well, thanks for joining the call, everybody. We'll talk to you in three months.

I will now turn the call over to Chris Allen, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Allen, you may begin.\nChris Allen: Thank you.

We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. You can find our first quarter earnings press release on the Investor Relations portion of our website at ir.suncountry.com. And with that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Jude.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. After nearly 2 years since the onset of the COVID pandemic, demand for air travel in the first quarter returned to pre-pandemic levels. While it\u2019s been a long and challenging time for our industry and its employees, the last 2 years have shown the resiliency of Sun Country and what makes us truly unique. We believe we have the best people in the industry, and I\u2019m proud of them on a daily basis, serving our growing leisure, charter and cargo customer base. While the industry now faces a certain challenge, I want to take a few minutes to highlight some differences here at Sun Country versus the broader industry. First, we\u2019re already profitable. We were profitable in the first quarter. We\u2019ve been profitable through most of the pandemic. Although we\u2019re tremendously excited about our growth prospects, we\u2019re not reliant on growth to deliver consistent profitability and cash flow. Second, our charter and cargo segments produced strong results and predictable cash flow in all demand and fuel environments. These businesses are primarily under long-term contracts with premier partners such as Major League Soccer, Caesars and Amazon, we pass through fuel cost to the consumer. Third, and importantly, the synergies between our cargo, charter and scheduled service segments have never been more apparent as they are today. Because of the consistency of charter and cargo, we have the flexibility to adjust our scheduled service operations to deliver in all circumstances. So in the second quarter, in response to the fuel environment, we\u2019ve been able to focus our growth on peak periods where fares can be achieved to compensate us for our fuel costs. And because of that peak focus, we expect to be able to deliver much stronger scheduled service unit revenue growth in 2Q versus the industry. While it\u2019s great, the industry is seeing a resurgence in demand, our improved unit revenue will be as much a result of our own doing and design. Fourth, we deleveraged through the pandemic. Our future CapEx can be adjusted for aircraft prices, interest rates and the opportunity to deploy the asset. The pandemic produced many opportunities for us to purchase growth aircraft at attractive prices. Today, we have 7 aircraft that have been purchased and financed that will enter the fleet over the next 9 months. In the first quarter, we grew block hours by 30% versus the same quarter in 2019. Through this time next year, we expect to continue to deliver over 20% growth without future CapEx while deleveraging as our debt amortizes and producing positive cash flow adding to our already strong liquidity position. Finally, as you all know, we ratified a contract with our pilot group in December. This has allowed us to attract the quality and quantity of talented aviators needed to support our growth, but it also gives us more certainty in our cost as compared to having an open contract in this environment. Again, I\u2019m so proud of all our team members here in Sun Country and what we\u2019ve achieved to date and excited about the future. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave.\nDave Davis: Thanks, Jude. Q1 was another profitable quarter at Sun Country, including our sixth consecutive quarter of greater than 15% EBITDA margins. We\u2019re very pleased with these results given high fuel prices throughout the quarter and Omicron driven demand softness prior to President\u2019s Day. Our numbers demonstrate again the benefits of Sun Country\u2019s unique and highly resilient business model. We can quickly adjust our capacity and the allocation of our flying between segments in reaction to exogenous factors like the much higher fuel costs that we\u2019re experiencing today. Adjusted pretax earnings for the quarter were $15.7 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.20 a share and revenue of $226.5 million, a record for Sun Country. Q1 adjusted operating margin was 10%, which we believe to be industry leading. Our total Q1 block hours were up 30% and ASMs were up 6.3% versus Q1 of \u201819. The quarter was a tale of 2 halves. Bookings were soft in January, but since President\u2019s Day, we have seen some of the strongest demand in our history. Our total average fare in Q1 of $183 was 7% higher than the comparable number in Q1 of \u201819. Included in this is ancillary revenue per passenger of $49, which was the highest in the history of our company. In terms of quarterly unit revenue, scheduled service TRASM was down 1% on a 10% increase in scheduled service ASMs when compared to the first quarter of \u201819. However, scheduled service TRASM in March increased 4% versus 2019, while scheduled service capacity was up 8%. Charter revenue for the quarter was $32.9 million. Q1 was the third consecutive quarter where charter revenue per block hour was higher than in 2019 and flying done under longer-term contracts made up over 70% of the charter flying we did during the quarter. Flying under our agreements with MLS and Caesars was ramping up during Q1 and will be fully operating in Q2. Charter block hours for the quarter were down 14.3% in total versus Q1 of \u201819 due to reduced ad hoc flying as we chose to prioritize scheduled service and cargo while we ramp up pilot hiring under our new contract. For example, we\u2019re typically one of the largest charter carriers for the NCAA basketball tournament, but we didn\u2019t participate this year due to capacity constraints. We\u2019ll return to this type of flying in the future as our staffing picture steadily improves, again, illustrating the unique optionality that our 3-pronged model affords us. Cargo revenue in the quarter of $21.1 million was down slightly when compared to the first quarter of last year due to the timing of planned heavy maintenance checks. Recall, we did not begin cargo flying until May of 2020. On the cost front, we continue to maintain solid cost discipline in the first quarter. Despite Q1 being the first full quarter of operating under our new pilot agreement, our adjusted CASM of $0.0621 was only 0.6% higher than Q1 of \u201819. Excluding fuel and special items, total cost per block hour in the first quarter was 5.9% below Q1 of \u201819 despite the cost of our new pilot agreement. We paid an average of $3.20 per gallon for fuel during the quarter, which was significantly higher than our initial Q1 plan and almost $1 per gallon higher than it was in the first quarter of \u201819. In March, which was our heaviest flying month of the quarter, fuel costs were $3.58 per gallon, yet we still produced an operating margin of greater than 20%. As we enter a seasonally weaker second quarter, we\u2019re pleased with how the quarter is shaping up. Demand continues to be robust with historically strong revenue trends. We expect total revenue to be up 24% to 30% versus the second quarter of 2019 and 22% to 26% higher block hours. These growth trends imply scheduled service TRASM growth of a remarkable 25% to 34% over the same period. We expect operating margin to be in the plus 5% to 9% range for the quarter, even in spite of forecasting a fuel price of $3.50 per gallon and facing some unit cost headwinds in Q2. We\u2019re rightsizing our capacity to maximize profitability in a high-fuel environment, while responding to staffing challenges. We continue to see strong application numbers from prospective new pilots, and we are filling all of our new hire classes. As we implement our new agreement, we\u2019re expanding our training capacity and plan to increase the size of our new hire classes, allowing us to grow faster in future quarters. Finally, our balance sheet remains very strong. We closed the quarter with $297 million in liquidity and completed a EETC aircraft financing for $188 million with an average interest rate of just over 5%. We expect the refinancing to save us over $2 million per year in ownership costs. We had approximately $15 million of positive free cash flow during the quarter, excluding aircraft CapEx. We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year. Of the 8 aircraft we plan to acquire this year, we have already closed on 7. Additionally, no significant non-aircraft capital expenditures for the remainder of 2022 are expected. With that, I\u2019ll open it up to questions.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: First question on the cargo side, obviously, we heard from your primary cargo customer recently that they may actually have some excess capacity in their fulfillment network for the first time in a long time. Does this have any impact on kind of the schedule they\u2019re flying with you guys and how full the aircraft are, et cetera?\nJude Bricker: No, we fly the same amount now as we did when we fully stood up the airplanes to 12 aircraft. And for the foreseeable future, the schedules that we see continue to have the same volume. A little commentary on cargo though is keep in mind, it\u2019s a long-term contract with escalation annually that\u2019s fixed. One of the biggest costs associated with it as fuel is passed through then as pilots. And our pilot contract went into effect in January. So the margins of that business are tighter now than they were last year and will widen as the escalation outpaces pilot rate increases and the juniorization as we hire more pilots. So we expect that those margins to widen as we look forward into the future.\nRavi Shanker: What is the timing of the escalator going into effect like what time of the year is that?\nJude Bricker: The calendar year.\nRavi Shanker: Calendar year, okay, got it. And a follow-up question is just on the charter side. I mean you said that you didn\u2019t fly the NCAA planes this time because of availability, and that makes sense. I\u2019m just wondering kind of how much flexibility you guys have in your charter contracts because I think one of the good things about this contracts that they are long-term contracts, and they\u2019re pretty sticky. But you guys do have the flexibility to not fly them if you didn\u2019t want to?\nDave Davis: Hello, Ravi, it\u2019s Dave. I think the way we\u2019ll think about it is this way. Remember, our charter business is composed of a fixed component, basically a component under contract, I\u2019ll call it, which we fly and we want to continue to fly and we will. And then we have this ad hoc segment. The NCAA basketball, for instance, fell in the ad hoc segment. That stuff we pick up on a near-term basis. That\u2019s where all of our flexibility resides. And as we\u2019re prioritizing the use of our resources, let\u2019s say, pilots, whatever the constraining resources is at any time. That\u2019s sort of the last thing on the totem pole because we don\u2019t need to bid it if we don\u2019t have the pilot hours available. Yes, a little bit more on that. So we have 17 airplanes in track and cargo. Those are fixed production margin businesses. And then the rest of it, we adjust for the yield environment or for fuel prices, most of that\u2019s in scheduled in the ad hoc, which comes at the very end of our planning horizon, we can adjust for the staffing situation at the time, the opportunity cost from sched service, anything really.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Duane here, nice to speak to you guys. Just on the block hours, can you put a finer point on the composition within there? Understand 1Q is a bigger quarter for you historically on scheduled service, but wonder if you could sort of give any color on the composition sequentially. And I guess any high-level thoughts about the balance of the year?\nJude Bricker: I actually just happen to have a couple of those numbers in front of me, Duane. So scheduled service block hours were 66% of our total in the first quarter. Charter was 11% and cargo was 22%. As we move into the year, I mean, remember, Q1 is our big quarter, particularly from a scheduled service perspective. So as we move into the year, particularly in Q2, there will be a modest shift away from the scheduled service business into the charter business as we reallocate resources there. Also our MLS and Caesars contracts, I think Caesars didn\u2019t get really started until March. So that\u2019s really ramping up now, and that will be a bigger piece of our flying in the second quarter as well. The cargo business, the number I gave you is plus or minus 1% or 2% on a quarterly basis.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then just on scheduled service, it\u2019s natural in the face of like what fuel did that, you\u2019d pull back on that and protect your margins. And obviously, the revenue environment has played out such that it\u2019s been a lot stronger, certainly a lot stronger than what we were looking for. So if it\u2019s possible, can you talk about for the growth that we see in the schedules, how much of that was sort of proactively protecting your margins? And maybe in an ideal world, you\u2019d actually have more of that out there than what\u2019s been cut versus this idea of constraint? Is it a constraint that\u2019s driving what\u2019s in sched service or was it just maybe being overly aggressive in taking down growth?\nJude Bricker: Well, so first, I mean, keep in mind that we\u2019re still having a distribution of opportunities that include weak and strong flights. So the response to higher fuel prices is now and will always be that we cut these weaker flights. Now we\u2019re seeing broad-based demand improvements. So week is better, but peak periods are even better and so, most of the cuts that we did are response to the high fuel prices. We certainly have looked at really peak opportunities where we can -- we\u2019re tied on crews, and we\u2019re thinking always about how we can allocate those across the opportunity set. Keep in mind also, fuel prices overly expense long haul. So if you look at some of the cuts we made, that\u2019s because of fuel prices. We\u2019re just trying to get those flights out of the sched service business. So I think -- we can\u2019t give you an exact answer, but we\u2019re just always modifying the schedule based on inputs to include the yield environment and the fuel prices and trying to continually hit a hurdle rate in every given period.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That makes sense. And as we look out to maybe the third quarter, what is sort of planned and baked. And if we looked at what\u2019s in the schedule for the third quarter, would we be taking the over on that at this point based on how strong revenue is? I appreciate you taking the questions?\nJude Bricker: Yes -- I mean our third quarter plan, we think, is appropriate at today\u2019s forward curve, which is in backwardation. So if we don\u2019t get a decline in fuel prices, we\u2019ll probably have to cut a little bit more. And if fuel falls faster than we expect, then we\u2019ll probably have some opportunities to add. There is seasonality in Minneapolis tends to go all the way through Labor Day. And so -- and also, we have a big Texas operation with travel to Mexico. And all of that is really, really strong. But I don\u2019t see it improving from where we are today. In other words, I think we\u2019re probably about right.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: I guess maybe to be more explicit, if we look at 2Q schedules right now, ASMs are down about 6%. Does that sound about right?\nJude Bricker: Yes, that\u2019s about right.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, Jude, I think you mentioned some constraints as well though, on the staffing side. Can you talk to the new pilot contract and if that\u2019s helped you on attrition or not? And I think you mentioned new hire classes are full as well?\nJude Bricker: Yes, our new hire classes remain full for pilots. We\u2019re hiring about 20 a month that began in the winter and continues on today. The company -- we have so our company\u2019s been around for a long time and traditionally was hiring 5 or so a month on a lumpy basis, and now we\u2019re growing sort of unprecedented rates. And we\u2019re starting to hit bottlenecks across the training production timeline to include SIMs which we have -- we went from 1 to 2, we need to go to 3, check airmen, which we\u2019re in the process of training more and getting more approval from the FA for more of those. So we\u2019re eliminating these bottlenecks, but we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re growing at 30%, and that\u2019s difficult to do in this environment.\nDave Davis: Yes, the other thing -- hello, Brandon, it\u2019s Dave. The other thing I want to point out is you can look at sort of our ASM production relative to 2019. That\u2019s one metric, but a more relevant metric for us is total block hours because we\u2019ve got this big cargo business now that we didn\u2019t have 2 years, 3 years ago or whatever. When you look on that metric, we\u2019re up 25% in terms of total capacity in the second quarter. So the growth continues to be very robust. Jude pointed out sort of what we\u2019re doing on the pilot front. I mean, I think this is the -- this has sort of been the trend. I said on the last call, we experienced high levels of attrition in like the October -- September, October timeframe of last year. We did the deal. Attrition has moderated and come down. It hasn\u2019t come down to what it was before, which we wouldn\u2019t expect it to given all of the hiring at legacy carriers. So what we\u2019ve done is we have increased the size of our new hire classes. And the good news is applications continue very strong, and we\u2019re filling our new hire classes. So it\u2019s not a front end of the funnel anymore. That looks to be solved. What we\u2019re working on now diligently is expanding the size, the aperture of that funnel so that we can get our classes up even larger and continue the growth sort of going forward. We\u2019re making good progress on that.\nBrandon Oglenski: Got you, Dave. And one last one for me, I think you said rates were up like 30% with the new contracts, but you had a lot of efficiency offsets that you expected with it. Is that coming through as you expected?\nDave Davis: Here\u2019s where that\u2019s going to come through. So we haven\u2019t seen a lot of it yet. So we expect some cost reductions in the future. One of the biggest ones is PBS. So preferential bidding, which almost -- which most other airlines have, we didn\u2019t have. That is not slated to come online until really the first quarter of next year. So that will be, we think, a pretty big step change in efficiency. There\u2019s some of the other stuff that we\u2019re seeing that is bearing some fruit, some of the commuter stuff, but that PBS change is going to be the big benefit to us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catherine O\u2019Brien from Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: So I\u2019m going to stick on this cost question. So I\u2019m sure the 30% increase in block hours helped drive efficiencies across fixed costs. But you do have the new pilot contract, and you just said one of the biggest productivity offset doesn\u2019t come until next year, but you still saw cost ex-fuel on a per block hour basis down 6% from \u201819. Could you just give us some more color on like what  are helping you drive that result?\nJude Bricker: Yes. I mean, there\u2019s a few things. One is just we\u2019re bigger, so we\u2019re spreading costs overhead over more block hours, which is also reflected in our CASM number. We\u2019ve done a lot of work, as we\u2019ve talked about a number of times here on the fleet front over the last few years and driven our ownership costs, which is one of our biggest cost items, clearly, down significantly in excess of 25% over the last several years. So that\u2019s bearing fruit. We\u2019ve taken our distribution costs down through a number of initiatives that we\u2019ve sort of had in work. So it\u2019s really sort of all over the map. We\u2019re working hard on reducing our maintenance costs. We\u2019ve got an active program now buying green time engines as opposed to expensive overhauls, which is another benefit of our older fleet strategy. So its items like that.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: And so is there may be just as we think about -- I think you said over the next year, you\u2019re going to keep growing like 20% plus just with the aircraft you\u2019ve got locked in. So should we continue to see that -- obviously, I know it\u2019s a little lumpy quarter-to-quarter? But just in general, like versus \u201819, should we continue to see that the efficiency build versus \u201819? So to drive that cost even lower, just we\u2019ve got PBS on the horizon, a couple of other things and then obviously more overhead spread?\nDave Davis: Yes. I mean, I can\u2019t give you the exact numbers in the quarters ahead, but that all of those concepts are absolutely still there. And particularly, as we continue to grow and add flying, we\u2019ll continue to spread our costs out over more block hours.\nJude Bricker: Yes. I think the input is fuel that we don\u2019t know and how that affects ex-fuel CASM is that we will cut out to flying and grow less fast if fuel doesn\u2019t mean revert.\nDave Davis: Yes, that\u2019s the big wildcard is how -- as we talked about before, we\u2019re very targeted in where we fly. We do it economically. We don\u2019t fly when we can\u2019t make money. So part of it is our growth is going to be tempered by both staffing as well as fuel costs.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: And then maybe just one quick last one on a related -- it\u2019s kind of going on the plan on the same string. As you said, fuel is obviously significantly higher than in 2019. And in anyone\u2019s best guess where we\u2019re at next year. But just as we think about some of the changes to the business, I would think you would improve your run rate profitability, adding the cargo business. I understand pilot costs maybe took a little bit out of margins this year, but that improves going forward. And then while charter block hours are lower, your revenue per charter block hour is higher, so these new contracts. Do you think as we get to the back half of the year, we could see margins surpass 2019 levels, if fuel and demand stay relatively stable to where they are today, takes all the time, gents?\nJude Bricker: Yes, is the answer. I mean I think the right way to think about our margins is when it\u2019s as good as it can get for everybody else, we\u2019ll be right there with them. And in all other circumstances, will lead the industry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: You talked about $49 of ancillary revenue per passenger. Where do you see that going, where do you see that going from here rest of the year or longer term?\nJude Bricker: So, I want to be careful here because we just launched a new product called the passenger interface charge, which is going to displace fare pretty substantially. So the ancillary products that are most relevant are ones that are accretive to total revenue per passenger -- and we think we have about $5 to $7 of upside in there based on third-party products, increased efficiency, effectiveness of our pricing in bags and seat assignments. And we\u2019re rolling out bundles, which is going to be really effective. But what you\u2019re going to see in our financials, just to warn you, is pretty rapid acceleration of our ancillary revenue per passenger because of that PIF and that\u2019s just going to be a displacement of the airfare. So we\u2019re probably going to finish over 60.\nScott Group: But you\u2019re saying a lot of that is just a shift from one to the other?\nJude Bricker: Yes all the ULCCs have a product like that and we\u2019re doing one that\u2019s all it is. So when -- you just may be careful as you interpret comparisons across the industry for ancillary revenue per passenger, the stuff that matters is the stuff that is accretive to total revenue. And that is particularly if you think about the stack of ancillary products, bag seats, people kind of expect to have to bring a bag and therefore it\u2019s priced into the airfare, seat  a little less, so you don\u2019t have to buy one. Onboard sales completely irrelevant to the airfare. Third-party product sales you\u2019re going to buy anyway, those are totally accretive. So there\u2019s a spectrum of incremental value associated with the product categories. The PIF, I think, Allegiant calls it a customer convenience fee, it\u2019s a CIC, customer interface charge, at Frontier. I can\u2019t remember what Spirit calls it, but they all have one and it\u2019s basically just a fee that moves money from fare.\nDave Davis: As Jude pointed out, sort of the object here is obviously accretive to total revenue. So we talked about $3 to $5 of upside in sort of truly accretive stuff. Yield management of seat pricing, getting more heavily involved in third-party products, which we started doing in the rental car business. So that\u2019s sort of coming down the road as well.\nScott Group: I know the follow-up on the Amazon cargo question from earlier. So I get no change in the business today. Do you think -- does Amazon maybe having some excess capacity in the network change your timing of when you could get additional aircraft in your mind?\nJude Bricker: We remain in discussion with them about growth opportunities. And I continue to believe that there are some. I mean, right now, scheduled service is doing really well. We\u2019re not in a big rush to grow our cargo business, quite frankly. I mean we need to try to continue to push peak period scheduled service, which is really strong today. It\u2019s our best thing right now.\nScott Group: And then just lastly, as we\u2019re seeing a little bit of an uptick in cases, are you seeing any changes in the demand environment as cases move a little higher?\nJude Bricker: No, no, none at all. I mean, it\u2019s a steady hill of average airfare sold every day. It gets higher and higher as we push into the summer. It\u2019s linear and this kind of inflection point, I know you\u2019re hearing all the CEOs across the airline say it, but it\u2019s very rare. I can\u2019t think of another circumstance where we\u2019ve seen kind of this variance from mid-February where we saw this inflection point and no signs of slowing down. And the capacity backdrop in the U.S. looks really accretive. You\u2019re going to pay a lot of travel because there\u2019s, not enough seats out there. So it\u2019s -- I can\u2019t imagine it turning around anytime soon.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: I guess just a quick one here on fuel, Dave, $3.50 per gallon. Presumably, that\u2019s the strip. What\u2019s the day end? Maybe are you benefiting from better prices, Chicago, Mid-Con, you\u2019re not dealing with New York Harbor, that did seem to be a bit lower?\nDave Davis: Yes, that\u2019s the strip along with some assumption for some crack spread narrowing, to be honest with you, that\u2019s probably, I don\u2019t know, 4 or 5 days, 6 days old, something like that. We think cracks are going to come in. The bulk of -- obviously, the bulk of the fuel we buy is here in Minneapolis. So our exposure to the Northeast is very minimal, but that continues to be where most of our fuel comes from.\nJude Bricker: Probably more relevant as you compare our fuel price to the rest of the industry is the seasonality of our business within the volatile fuel environment. So if you look to the first quarter, we probably paid a little higher fuel price -- significantly higher fuel price than comps. And that\u2019s because the majority -- as compared to them, more of our flying happened in March when fuel is higher, which is -- that\u2019s our business plan. And the same exists in the second quarter where we\u2019re going to be really heavy in June relative to the other 2 months of the quarter. It\u2019s the reverse in the third quarter, et cetera.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then this last quarter, I mean, you did make a pretty meaningful shift to your scheduled capacity, and it\u2019s -- look, it\u2019s the right thing. I mean, pulling down things like Minneapolis to Fairbanks and obviously, West Coast Hawaii, I mean, it starts getting really expensive Jude, as you said, some of these longer haul flights and given the fact that you\u2019re carrying fuel to carry the fuel to get you to that definition with these 73s? I\u2019m curious, 2, 3 months ago, sort of on a block hour basis, where that mix was? I know you said you were 66% in the March quarter, June quarter, it looks like it\u2019s going to be a little bit less than for scheduled. 2, 3 months ago, what were you above 70 and maybe there was less for Charter and now you\u2019ve been able to shift. And it\u2019s not just airplanes, but I guess it\u2019s shifting pilots from scheduled maybe to backfill pilots on reserve at the charter biz -- or at the cargo business?\nJude Bricker: Yes let me first just talk about pilots. I mean our pilot group supports all lines of flying always. So we integrated in particular trips, and we have a single crew base, and they go out and fly sched at and then they might fly a charter and then they may fly a cargo and then all in one trip. So it\u2019s very integrated and that gives us a lot of the efficiencies. And so optimally, we\u2019re at about 25% fixed flying 75% sched. We think, which gives us the ability on a typical seasonality that we would expect September versus March to draw down our sched service to about 1/3 of what it is in March and September. So -- and then there\u2019s other variations of that inputs associated with the yield environment or fuel prices or anything else, competitive backdrop, aggressive or benign or whatever. And so -- but I think over time, we\u2019re going to kind of correct into that place where it\u2019s about 75-25 sched versus track and cargo, which basically operate the same -- in our business and, Grant, if you\u2019ve got anything else?\nGrant Whitney: Yes. Mike, this is Grant. All I would say is the team does a really good job of optimizing based on forecasted best margins. And so as we -- if you would have stepped back in time, we definitely made the adjustments you made -- or you commented on from a scheduled service, which were absolutely the right ones done with this -- through a strategic framework. And then on the charter side, we absolutely, as Dave mentioned, we have these ad hoc customers that are relatively close in, and we can pick and choose there as well. So you\u2019ll see a little bit of reduction there, but still executing and operating at a high level for our biggest customers. But it\u2019s -- this team does a really good job of optimizing to drive the most amount of value.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: So I just want to get to this demand or perhaps TRASM outlook in a different way. So mask mandates off here, summer travel around the quarter. If you could give some color with respect to what the 0 to 60-day booking window looks like? And how does it compare to this time last year and then, let\u2019s say, 3 to 5 years on average pre-pandemic. And then further out, so let\u2019s say, 60-plus days or are you having to stimulate discount, excuse me, to stimulate demand or is marketing and whatever you normally do around with your RMS team sufficient to fill out your kind of required load factors into the second half?\nJude Bricker: Hello, Chris, let me make a couple of general comments, and I\u2019ll throw it over to Grant. Right now we\u2019re not doing any stimulation pricing. It is a -- if there\u2019s low prices in a flight, it cut, we just won\u2019t fly it. One of the things I think you may be getting at is kind of when we went into this new pricing environment after Omicron kind of how quickly are we going to react to the new environment. And so mid-February is when we saw the change in booking behavior and demand really recovered strongly. We just came through COVID with all its ups and downs. And I\u2019d probably give us a grace of about 2 weeks to the end of February to kind of this is real and different and good, where we would say, okay, now we\u2019re pricing in the new environment. And we had sold in the second quarter about 1/3 of our segments by the end of February with 2/3 yet to be priced into the new environment, and it\u2019s about 15% at the third quarter. So yields will go up just because more of the seats will be sold into the new environment. But all fair, so post March 1, it\u2019s kind of on a year over 3-year basis high, but like steady. And the days out of bookings are basically what they were back in the day. It\u2019s just back in 2019, it\u2019s just we\u2019re selling a lot of higher fares. And fares up, I would say, like 50%. I mean, it is a big move. One other comment is that fares are on a heuristic algorithm. So activity -- booking activity creates higher fares by nature. And so our algorithms just sort of naturally adjust. And so we\u2019re able to take advantage of it even in advance of kind of realigning our expectations. Grant anything to add.\nGrant Whitney: No. And the only thing I would add to that, Jude -- we have teams, the revenue management, the yield management team especially these are folks who know these markets really, really well. They manage these on a flight-by-flight basis, day-by-day basis. So they\u2019re seeing this, and they\u2019re doing a really good job of making sure that we are selling fares at the highest level that the market will bear, being cognizant of other things. The other thing is I would just echo Jude sentiment. When we put schedules up, we absolutely expect every flight to drive value for the airline. So we are not doing any stimulation in the schedules we have out in the future. There\u2019s been a lot of thought and just input from stakeholders on what\u2019s the best schedule for some country.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So when we look at kind of the model historically in scheduled service, you\u2019ve had good revenue. You\u2019ve had decent fares, you\u2019ve had decent yields. It hasn\u2019t been as much of a sort of push all the way on loads. But just given how tight you are with capacity right now actively deciding to be tight with capacity, should we be thinking about loads a little bit differently for the balance of this year?\nJude Bricker: It\u2019s a good question, and I\u2019ll let Grant answer, but I just want to highlight a couple of differences that we have. We do a lot of seasonal flying. The nature of seasonal flying when it begins and ends is that there\u2019s a naked leg, right. So your first round trip to Central America, the planes pulled down, but empty back because nobody was able to fly down and be on that return flight. So our -- I would say probably our steady state load factors is at such lower than what you would expect to see in Southwest, for example.\nGrant Whitney: Yes. But we do cater the schedule to fly when people want to fly. So a lot of the valid -- or the unit revenue increases are certainly going to come through fare. But it\u2019s really -- the team is doing a good job getting people on the airplane. We fly when people want to fly, so we\u2019re getting the ancillary benefit from that as well. And if you do sort of take a step down into the depths of where we are allocating capacity, we are still doing that in a very strategic way. So while at a system level we may be down, you can absolutely look at markets that we\u2019re really excited about, and we\u2019re making strategic bets there. So we feel really good about how things are coming in for us.\nOperator: All right. I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference back to Jude Bricker.\nJude Bricker: Well, thanks for your interest, everybody, and thanks for spending the time with us. Talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Jude.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Today, we're excited to announce full year record results in 2021. Further, our margins, adjusted for CARES Act benefit, again lead the industry. Our multi-segment business model is unique among airlines due to the predictability of our charter and cargo businesses. We're able to deliver the most flexible schedule service capacity in the industry. The combination of this schedule flexibility and low fixed cost model, allow us to respond to both predictable leisure demand fluctuations and exogenous industry shocks. We believe due to our structural advantages, we'll be able to reliably deliver one of the industry's best profitability throughout all cycles, as we've been demonstrating through the COVID crisis.  First, I want to talk about operations. I continue to be amazed and impressed with the aviation professionals we put on the front lines each day to make this operation work. I'm not sure I've ever seen as challenging a set of circumstances for an operation as what we've been dealing with since the holiday peak, yet our folks have delivered, as they always do. Thank you to all my team members. To start, I want to address some of the most commonly raised concerns in our industry. First, staffing issues. We've certainly seen the effects of a tight labor market on our staffing needs. Currently we're hiring across all major labor groups. Shortages, however are most acutely felt in pilots, technicians, and ramp staff. In each of those groups, we've negotiated or announced increased pay and benefit offerings just recently. We most notably reached a new agreement with our pilot group, bringing our pilot pay above those airlines in our competitive set. It should also give investors\u2019 confidence in our ability to staff to our growth targets. Across the industry, I believe staffing challenges will result in downward pressure on capacity, and therefore be positive for fares.  Second and related is cost pressures, including fuel price. We remain well in control of our cost positions, including the new pilot rates, we still expect 2022 ex-fuel adjusted CASM to come in less than 2019. Further, we still expect adjusted CASM to be under $0.06 by 2023. We expect to continue to be able to offset inflationary pressures in labor by cycling out of our legacy fleet deals, introducing technology efficiencies, and diluting our overhead with growth. However, I want to remind everyone, about a third of our flying has pass-through fuel economics. And our variable schedule service operation allows us to build a schedule that will positively contribute in any fuel environment. I believe our outperformance of the industry will widen in a high fuel environment, all else equal.  Finally, with revenue recovery, we certainly have felt the effects of Omicron variant on our bookings, and like other carriers have reported, we are now seeing a strong recovery in demand, particularly for our domestic leisure markets and for our March peak period. we're currently selling a March schedule with maximum volume limited by staff indicating our confidence in the recovery. We also announced new fleet transactions for five additional growth aircraft. Dave will talk more about the fleet plan, but I wanted to point out that we're continuing to see favorable price and availability of our feedstock 737 NG aircraft. We expect this to continue as max production ramps, along with the recovery in demand for aircraft. And with that, we\u2019ll turn over to Dave.\nDave Davis: Thanks, Jude. We're very pleased with our results in 2021, as we accomplished a lot on a challenging year for the airline industry. In March, we launched our initial public offering, which great least strengthened our balance sheet and gave us the resources necessary to drive our growth. We grew block hours during the year by 58% versus 2020, and 13% versus 2019. We added five passenger aircraft, signed long term charter agreements with MLS and Caesars Entertainment, and we rapidly negotiated and ratified a new pilot agreement. All of this was done while maintaining five consecutive quarters of greater than 15% EBITDA margins.  Our new four-year pilot agreement signed in December was negotiated in less than four months\u2019 time, which speaks to the professionalism and dedication of our pilot group and company negotiating team. The new deal is a key enabler of our growth plans. Specific benefits of the agreement include, one, pay rates, benefits, and work rules that are highly competitive with our low-cost peers and should allow us to recruit the pilots we need to support our growth. Early indications are promising, as pilot applications to Sun Country are up by 160% compared to the months prior to the new agreement being announced. Two, new work rules that will allow pilots to start trips from their home locations, and provide for the implementation of a preferential bidding system. These changes will make Sun Country a more attractive option for commuting pilots, and reduce our costs by allowing us to more efficiently schedule flight crews. And three, the ability to assign reserve pilots to bases outside of MSP. This flexibility was a key requirement to unlock potential future Amazon growth. Our pilot pay rates were significantly behind the industry, and the changes in the new contract are expected to increase our pilot cost per block hour by approximately 34% between 2021 and 2022. We expect to be able to absorb most of this cost increase elsewhere, however, and our total 2022 non-fuel operating costs per block hour, is expected to increase only 2% versus 2021, and is expected to be 9% lower than it was in 2019. Pilot costs per block hour are expected to decrease in 2023, as the full benefit of the new work rules are realized.  Let me turn now to specific Q4 \u201821 results. In the fourth quarter of \u201821, we delivered adjusted pretax income of $8 million, and adjusted EPS of $0.10, on revenue of $172.6 million. For full year 2021, our adjusted pretax income was $25.4 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.33 on revenue of $623 million. We are very pleased with our profitable results in 2021, given the impact the pandemic had on industry bookings. Moreover, the pandemic effects were particularly acute in Q1, which is traditionally Sun Country's strongest quarter. Operating margins for Q4 and the full year were 8.6% and 8.1%, respectively. We believe our 2021 full year operating margin to be industry-leading. Regarding costs, our Q4 \u201821 GAAP non-fuel operating expenses, increased $9 million or only 8% versus Q4 2019 on a 25% growth in total block hours. We've demonstrated an ability to consistently take cost out of the business, and we expect to be able to do so going forward. Per aircraft ownership expense has declined by 22% since 2019. Despite wage pressure in 2021, our ground handling costs per departure were 3% lower than they were in 2019, while we maintained a completion factor near the top of the industry. Full year 2021 adjusted CASM was $0.06.44, only 2% higher than our adjusted CASM in 2019, on an 18% reduction in ASMs. As Jude mentioned, we expect 2022 adjusted CASM, which includes the impact of our new pilot agreement, to finish the year lower than the $0.06.31 we achieved in 2019. Turning now to revenue. Revenue when the quarter finished quite strong. Despite flying 11% fewer scheduled block hours in Q4 2021 versus 2019, scheduled service revenue finished the quarter down only 7%, as average base fare was $111 in Q4 \u201821 versus $99 in Q4 \u201919. Q4 2021 ancillary revenue was $1.6 million higher than the same period in 2019. On a per passenger basis, ancillary revenue per pax was $44, which was the highest in the company's history. Q4 \u201821 charter service revenue was down 21% versus Q4 \u201919, while charter block hours were down 22% in the same period. Both MLS and Caesar's charter flying will begin to contribute meaningfully towards the end of Q1 \u201822.  Let me turn now to guidance. Q1 2022 total revenue is expected to be between $215 million and $225 million. As a reminder, the first quarter is historically our strongest quarter of the year. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be between 8% and 12%. We're anticipating a fuel price of $2.79 per gallon for the quarter. Finally, we expect total system ASMs for the full year of 2022 to be approximately $7.8 billion. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, we expect Q1 to have the highest level of ASMs, followed by Q3. With that, we're now ready to open it up for questions.\nOperator: . Our first question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nHunter Keay: Hey, thanks. Just a quick one on that last kind of Dave, that's scheduled plus charter together for the $7.8 billion ASMs?\nDave Davis: Yes. That\u2019s right.\nHunter Keay: All right, thanks. And then Jude or Dave, wondering kind of what your thoughts on this - the max planes that your old pal, Allegiant just bought, Jude. I was wondering not necessarily if you want to comment on that for them, but if there's any thought to maybe an evolving view that maybe that could work for you.\nJude Bricker: We always study it, but we haven't been able to make the economics work thus far and it's not closed. I mean, we're seeing used aircraft values for late model aircraft, so six to 10 years old, that aren't much above tear-down values still today. And I don't know. I just don't think the max can compete with that.\nHunter Keay: I got you. All right. Another question for you on the Spirit-Frontier deal. Again, how are you thinking about that in terms of the overall impact, the overall competitive landscape? And how does that change the algorithm for you in terms of how you're thinking about growth, or will it? \nJude Bricker: Not at all. We don't have a lot of overlap with either of those carriers. They've both been out there trying to find things that the other doesn't do for multiple years as they\u2019ve both been growing so rapidly. And Minnesota hasn't been very successful for them. And I don't think that changes with them as a single company. So, my view is, we don't have a lot of overlap with them now. We won't have a lot of overlap with them in the future that makes it not necessarily a great thing. it's not a real positive, but it also isn't really a negative. And therefore, it doesn't really change what we're doing. \nDave Davis: I think generally Hunter, we view sort of consolidation in the industry as a good thing. So, from a high level, we're positively inclined toward it.\nHunter Keay: All right. I'm going to get back in the queue. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey guys, nice to be speaking with you this morning. Hope everybody's staying warm.\nJude Bricker: It's actually 40 degrees today. So, a record. it's an eight-week record\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Break out the sunscreen exactly. On pilot basing, which you now have this new flexibility, and you talked about how that's going to help you on the cargo side, but could you expand a little bit on how that impacts the passenger side of the business, and how it might impact your thinking with respect to new markets?\nJude Bricker: Yes. I think one of the biggest things that we got here was the implementation of the PBS system, which is going to allow us to more efficiently schedule pilots, help us take cost out and improve trip quality for our pilots. So, most other airlines have this in place. Sun Country has it. So, we\u2019ve now got it. This ability to station reserve pilots out of Minneapolis for cargo trips was a big thing for Amazon. We needed to get it to be eligible for more growth, and we've now gotten it. So, that was a big win for us. Generally, on the passenger side, I think what this does is it improves sort of quality of life for our pilots and makes Sun Country more interesting for commuting pilots. In other words, pilots who don't live here in Minneapolis, because they'll ultimately have the ability to start trips from home locations rather than come up here to Minneapolis to start up. I don't think it necessarily changes our growth strategy or the cities we're going to fly to, but hopefully, it's going to help us get our fair share of pilots rolling forward. \nDave Davis: Yes. Duane, it sounds like you're kind of angling towards, are we going to create another Minneapolis? And that isn't in the plan. So, our summer growth is going to be on the blueprint of our Dallas network, which is seasonal, focus on origination traffic from a summer peak market like Dallas. And we'll replicate that across major Southern cities for summer traffic. We see a lot of summer opportunities to deploy Minnesota-based capacity into non-Minnesota O&Ds. And then keep in mind, we have a significant charter business that doesn't really touch Minnesota with originations out of LA and Gulfport and (indiscernible) and Reno and AC. And so, this just - the contract just adds to the flexibility that we can deploy assets around the country.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: It makes a lot of sense. And then maybe just for my follow up, you mentioned it, that this flexibility was helpful vis-\u00e0-vis Amazon. Can you talk about just broad strokes incremental growth opportunities in cargo? And maybe along those lines, how do you weigh opportunities with perhaps a larger aircraft type, which you can now support versus potentially the increased complexity of supporting a new fleet type? Thanks for taking the questions.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Duane. Yes. On Amazon growth, I mean, we're in continual negotiate - discussions, I should say, with them about growth. And obviously, their primary business is publicly know - as we all read about, is growing rapidly. But our focus remains on leveraging into the recovery for shared service. Our preference would be to kind of be able to build out the utilization of our existing passenger fleet before we started adding more cargo aircraft. That being said, I mean, if there's an opportunity, we'll take it. We remain flexible, and I really don't have any comments on any aircraft type other than the 737s that we're operating today.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open. \nBrandon Oglenski: Hey good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. Jude, I think you mentioned that you're flying a March schedule as much as you can, based on limitations with staffing. Did I hear you correctly?\nJude Bricker: Yes, that's right. So, we started hiring pilots earlier than the rest of the industry in October, of 15 months ago. And - but there was just a lot of catching up to do. we've been continually at - so we're just in a different situation than the rest of the industry. We went into COVID with 30 or so passenger airplanes, 31, added 12 cargo airplanes, and then have been adding passenger aircraft. So, the fleet has grown substantially, and it's just going to take us a while to staff up to that. Our training pipeline, we're in the process of expanding, but we kind of have the training staff that we went into COVID with, which was 12 pilots a month of capability. And we want to make that two or three times that, and it just takes a little bit of time to ramp all that up.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate that. So, it's not something commercial you're seeing like in the spring break period. I think you had pretty favorable commentary on demand.\nJude Bricker: Yes, absolutely. So, I mean, it\u2019s tough to forecast in a COVID environment as we've been talking about, it seems like a long time now. And the revenue in the first quarter for us is particularly heavily weighted towards the very last several weeks of the quarter. And so, what we're seeing in bookings just over the last, I don't know, two weeks, is really, really positive. And just like other waves of the COVID crisis, it is highly correlated to what we see in the fall-offs and hospitalizations, for example, across the country, and our bookings are turning the corner in the same way. And just like with other waves, this recovery begins with domestic leisure markets that we serve. And now we're starting to see it extend into some of our longer haul markets and international markets. So, that's why we have such a wide bracket of our revenue forecast in the first quarter, is that there's still quite a lot of uncertainty, but if you extrapolate out what we're seeing today, it looks like a really positive finish for the quarter.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, appreciate that. And if I could just ask one more, maybe of Dave. You guys mentioned in the prepared remarks, or at least in the release, about Amazon and some impacts from operational difficulties. Can you talk about the financial implications of that, if you don't mind?\nDave Davis: Yes. The financial implications were pretty minimal. We had some operational disruptions right towards the end of the year, sort of a perfect storm of some staffing issues that were COVID-related, really, really cold weather here. And then we had an IT outage that resulted in sort of an abnormally high level of cancellations for us. I would think of the financial impact in the fourth quarter to us of all these issues as, let's say $1 million-ish. So, not a huge in impact for us in the fourth quarter. \nJude Bricker: I mean, we kind of see - I just want to contextualize a little bit like just across the ecosystem. So, staffing issues for us, but also all our vendors that we rely on for maintenance and ground support, federal agencies like TSA and the FAA and air traffic control, are having staffing issues associated with both hiring and also sick time related to COVID, and then the supply chain. So, we're delayed in getting aircraft into service and repairs done, service bulletins and engineering work from Boeing. It's just like a weird environment right now. And I continue to believe that that's going to put kind of a governor on industry capacity as we see the commentary as airlines have announced. That'll be positive for fares as we push into the summer period.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. So, one, just on the revenue beat this quarter, can you walk us through what drove that? I think last quarter, there was some incremental charter ops with the Afghani mission that drove part of your third quarter beat? Any charter ops here, higher Amazon, or was it just stronger passenger demand?\nDave Davis: Yes, it was higher fare. I mean, we went into the quarter in a really uncertain environment, right? I think when we had the call, we were probably coming down off of Delta, and then the Omicron thing happened. So, we were somewhat cautious on the revenue guide, and I think the fare environment just strengthened pretty rapidly and that produced the outperformance. \nJude Bricker: Yes. If you recall back to Delta, we kind of saw this inflection point around late September that was just really dramatic where we went from a weak environment to the next day it was increasing, and we kind of saw this really strong demand increase up until really the Omicron variant and through the holiday period. And we're kind of in that same place now with Omicron as we move into the March period. And so, I I'm just really bullish on demand in the next four to six weeks as we move into our peak spring break holiday season.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. Okay. So, that - you answered a little bit of my follow-up, which is, just as you're thinking about the first quarter, you spoke about how it's very back half weighted, like the last several weeks as we get into March. It\u2019s like typical seasonality. That makes sense. But can you give us some color on how you\u2019ve thought about forecasting the first quarter out? Is there a fair degree of conservatism in 1Q too just given the Omicron variant, or due to the amount of bookings you already have locked in, do you feel like you have more certainty than where you were forecasting 4Q? just trying to get some color on how you work it all.\nJude Bricker: I'm going to turn it over to Grant maybe who runs our revenue and for some color. \nGrant Whitney: Yes. thanks, Catherine. And I would say - I would echo what Jude said. We've gotten so good at seeing these waves and sort of how things play out that as we look to forecast the first quarter, the fourth quarter was pretty instructive in terms of how that sort of return of demand after Delta performed. And we had three distinct peak periods for us, which was a little bit different. We have a holiday school break in October where we saw really good demand, Thanksgiving, and the second half of December. And so, using that, we have a pretty good sense for the first quarter. And one thing that's really notable about us, in the first quarter, we actually have an inflection point just in overall capacity. For a while, we trailed 2019. This is the first quarter where we're bigger than 2019 on a pretty substantial basis. On the scheduled side of the house, we feel really good about the schedule we have in the market. It's really Minneapolis focused. We've done a really good job building the brand in Minneapolis, connecting with customers here. So, the one thing I think that we are doing is just working really closely with our operating team, because the airline is fully deployed in March. And so, for us, it's just execution, making sure we deliver. And I can say that the team here does that as well as any airline I've seen. So, we're very focused on that. So, just anything that would bring guardrails to the first quarter, just making sure we can deliver. And I think there's a ton of confidence here that we will.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great. And then maybe one for you, Dave, on the - quick clarification. Wanted to follow up on the balance sheet. So, on the five aircraft you have signed LOIs for, I guess, are those part of the eight planned deliveries this year, or are those incremental? And then, given Jude's comment on your target aircraft being still for sale, not much above tear-down, like, do you have - I know there's still some training guardrails you guys are working on, but from a balance sheet perspective, like if those deals are perhaps not here to stay forever, is there capacity on the balance sheet, an appetite from management\u2019s perspectives, maybe lock-ins on aircraft for future periods? So, thanks - a little bit of a two-part there. Thanks.\nDave Davis: Yes. Let me just talk about the fleet situation. So, our fleet plan for 2022 has us adding eight passenger aircraft. We signed deals for two of those last year in \u201821. So, those are going to be delivering. The five I mentioned are part of the eight. So, that brings us to seven, and it's only early February, that'll be delivering through the year. And we need to find only more to hit our fleet plan. But I think it's fair to say that what you said is accurate. We continue to see attractive deals in the market. We're very active. And to the extent that we see really good deals and maybe we front load the fleet a little bit, we will do that. Balance sheet is not a concern. we're very well capitalized. We have access to whatever - to the financing that we need at really attractive rates. So, that's not a limiter for us. Really, the only limiter at this point is our ability - is really the staffing side, our ability to train pilots, get them through and fly the aircraft. There's plenty of market opportunities for us, plenty of aircraft that are available. We have the balance sheet capacity to bring them on. So, yes, we're in a good spot from the fleet perspective.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, great. Thanks so much for all the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Oh, hi. Yes, this is (indiscernible) on for Mike. My first question is, given the recent runup in fuel and putting cargo and charter aside, can you provide us with some more detail on your historic ability to recapture higher fares?\nJude Bricker: So, this is an important concept. It's just there's a wide spectrum of revenue outcomes on a scheduled service network. And our response to high fuel prices is to eliminate flights that are predictably under return targets. That's how we raise fares. We don't raise fares by going out across the fleet and adding a dollar, whatever, to the airfare. We just go in and eliminate flights to become marginal and as the new inputs for fuel price become clear to us. And so, that's the model. We don't have much of a relationship for unit cost and utilization. So, it just becomes, okay, what's the fuel price input? What flights are profitable and hit our hurdle rate at that fuel price? The other ones are eliminated, and that's how we run the service business. And that's how we're able to pass on - that's how we're able to maintain our margins in high - rising fuel prices. \nDave Davis: Yes. And I think if you look across the industry, you definitely see that recapture effect that Jude's talking about as sort of, call lower profitable - less profitable flights or unprofitable flights capacity comes down, fares rise. And part of this cost is recaptured over time. It's not instant. there's a lag, but that's the trend.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks. And my second question, can you give us any cost inputs that perhaps maybe run tailwinds throughout 2022 to drive the adjusted unit cost below 2019 levels? Or is it really more about just restoring the ASM growth and the better utilization of the network? Thanks for the questions.\nDave Davis: Yes. I mean, I think continued averaging down in cost on the fleet side is part of the metric. We insourced our ground handling here in Minneapolis in 2020. That continues to provide dividends for us. A significant opportunity in \u201822 is just continued cost control and leveraging as ASMs come back. As I pointed out, we've been able to essentially absorb the cost of the new pilot agreement. that's in the numbers. So, it's cost control elsewhere and leveraging in to growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, going back to the new work rules you mentioned with respect to the new pilot deal, curious if that was something that the union brought to you or was kind of mutually brought to the table, and whether there were sort of any atypical or out of ordinary concessions made during the bargaining period, meaning, in this kind of great resignation environment, or however you want to describe it, should we expect that perhaps we could see other changes to any upcoming deals you have with other groups? Thanks.\nDave Davis: Yes. So, there's sort of a lot in that. Basically, some of the work rules that I talked about here were brought to the table by the company. others, like let's say PBS, I would probably characterize it as both sides had an interest in getting that in place. There's nothing - thinking through sort of the deal, there's nothing kind of out of the ordinary for the industry in work rule changes that we made, nothing particularly unique that's in this deal. Some of this, starting trips at home stuff is fairly unique, and we\u2019re hammering out the final details on that. I think one of the things about this agreement is, our pilots were substantially behind the average of our - who we believe are our competitors in the low-cost world. So, there was a lot of ground to be made up, which is what drives that pilot class per block hour number I gave. We don\u2019t believe, and the data would indicate that we're not in the same position with our other work groups. In other words, pay rates, benefits, and so forth, are quite consistent with what our peers pay at this point. So, I wouldn't expect to see similar moves with other work groups for us.\nJude Bricker: Just a little more commentary on the negotiation that we got done a contract that was pretty old. We got an amendment negotiated in two months. And it takes a tremendous amount of effort from our team, obviously, but also our pilot group and Alpha National and our MEC. And I was just so impressed with those guys. And I'm really excited for the pilots that have been here through all the challenges that Sun Country has had. We\u2019ve got pilots been on payroll for 35 years, and now they're going to get, for the first time maybe in their whole career, an industry-leading contract. I'm just really excited for those guys. It's really kind of amazing that we got this across the finish line in the timeline that we did, and it took a lot of working together, and it was great that it happened.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And my second one, so we go back to, I think it was Hunter's question on the announced merger proposal with Frontier and Spirit yesterday. So, you mentioned it doesn't really impact anything you do. And I think you said that you kind of look at consolidation as favorably. But if the recovery in business and long haul international does take longer, and we have this kind of jump-all approach to managing inventory from your peers in the US, is there perhaps - there's also the upselling phenomenon that we keep hearing. So, is there perhaps an opportunity within this - if this merger goes through and everything else that's happening, to perhaps look at markets where you typically wouldn't have looked to sell inventory? Thank you.\nJude Bricker: I just want to be really clear, like, we're focused on the peakiest of days. And so, the combination of Spirit and Frontier that drives these 12 and 13-hour daily utilization of their new aircraft, is still going to have that same dynamic. So, I don't think this changes at all our opportunity set of really peaky leisure markets that have predictable peaks along a day of week or primarily seasonal sensitivities. So, there's a set of three 400 O&Ds that have these really peak contributions from late leisure demand. And they're not going to be effectively served with any other carrier than us. Spirit and Frontier just can't modulate their capacity as to what's required to pick up that demand that exists on those peak periods. So, I don't think - as Dave mentioned, I think it's a net positive. I don't think it changes the dynamic much here in Minneapolis, which is quickly becoming a two-airline market. And I think our growth outside of Minneapolis is still going to be focused on these predictable peak-season leisure markets originating from major DMAs. \nDave Davis: And I think that I feel strong - more strongly about that with the merger. And it's new to us and we're still evaluating it. And I think we'll kind of see how it plays out, but I think it's positive for our ex-Minneapolis growth, and it's kind of neutral for Minneapolis and our plans here. \nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I have a follow up with Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Yes. Thanks. I\u2019ve got a few. Jude, that last comment you made, have you guys studied what happened in Seattle when that place became a two-airline market with Delta, and what happened with some of the tertiary competitive capacity there that maybe couldn't compete on schedule and loyalty? Any similarities you may see developing here or there? \nJude Bricker: Yes. I mean, yes, of course. look, I mean, Seattle's a bigger market than what we have here, and the geography is a little bit different, with flow over the ocean. But yes, I mean, I completely agree with you. I think it's an allegory to what we're seeing here with Delta, and we're focused on leisure market. I mean, I think more carefully, we want to be even more segmented the way we think about the twin cities and focus more directly on leisure, which I think will be less of a front than Alaska is in Seattle to Delta. But yes, I mean, I think there's a good model for coexisting, and I would put us right up there with Alaska as an example here.\nHunter Keay: Yes. You guys are flying commies now, but all right. And then - on the CASM comment that you made, just to completely be clear, you're expecting your \u201823 CASM ex-adjusted to be under $0.06 on a full year basis. you're saying you're just going to get there at some point in \u201823.\nDave Davis: Yes. I mean, at this point, we're thinking that our full year number is going to be sub six.\nHunter Keay: Got it. All right. And then, can you talk a little bit about PBS some more, and just elaborate on some of the benefits that it's going to bring to you that might be unique to Sun Country. And also, just help people on the call understand why PBS is a beneficial thing for - to run anyway.\nJude Bricker: So, I'm super passionate about PBS, inappropriately. Like it shouldn't be so much \u2026\nHunter Keay: You don't hear that.\nJude Bricker: \u2026 a focus to me, but I just love the product because, and I think it's going to be great for our pilots. So, what PBS does is, it just allows a pilot, while honoring seniority, to select their own schedule instead of us building a month-long schedule and then pilots in seniority order select from that set of scheduled options. And so, imagine just a portfolio of trips out there, round trips from Minneapolis, two- and three-day trips for charters, a cargo line that takes you through multiple cities on four, five days. And then, depending on your situation personally, you can select and build a schedule that's best for you. Obviously, not everybody gets what they want, but we're just a lot more likely to satisfy pilots for their own personal scheduling desires in a PBS system than an Alliance system, which is just an outdated system.  Further, in 2017, the pilot work rules changed, Part 117. And the primary change was that legalities are now on a rolling basis instead of on a calendar basis. You used to be able to start the month anew, and now I think it makes perfect sense. It's a rolling basis. So, PBS, as it awards pilots or even flight attendants\u2019 calendars, it takes into account those restrictions. It's just a lot more efficient for both pilots and the company. Greg, any other comments?\nGregory Mays: No. your passion came through. And I mean, more desirable trip construction means fewer dropped trips, which means more efficiency, the pilot workforce.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Can I ask a couple more, Chris? Are there others behind me? \nChris Allen: Yes. I\u2019ve got two behind you. \nJude Bricker: Go ahead. One more.\nHunter Keay: All right. One more. Fine. Why do you think your ops have been so strong while others have been so weak? Do you have folks just volunteering to pick up trips? I mean, is it a cultural thing? I mean, like, how are you getting people to show up? Is it because you're small? I mean, you can have direct contact. \nJude Bricker: Wow, I love the question. I feel like it's been really hard. Let me go over to Greg. \nGregory Mays: Yes, Hunter. I think it's a few things. I think that - as evidenced by our agreement that we\u2019ve got with our pilots that shows that we've got a good relationship, and we have seen some leaning forward. Grant had mentioned just the close relationship that we have between the commercial team and the operations team to really pinpoint decisions that we need to make super close in. We actually have daily discussions where we're looking, not only day of, next day, next few days. So, it's just been a lot of close work and I think that the organization is very much aligned on what we need to accomplish. I mean, I think that's largely what it is, but there's a whole lot of tactics that come in on a daily basis to make this work.\nDave Davis: We should touch on just structural advantages we have. One is, we're a single-based operator, single fleet type. we're in Minneapolis, which isn't JFK. it's not Honolulu, but kind of in the middle. And so, we didn't have to deal with a lot of the ATC constraints other airline - field congestion and things like that. \nJude Bricker: We've also got a good position at T2 in our terminal here, which helps with consistency of operation. \nGregory Mays: Yes. There are definitely some advantages such as that that we've got. Yes. \nGrant Whitney: And the variable capacity that we can reset the schedule when we need to. \nJude Bricker: Yes. That's the other thing is kind of fire breaks, natural fire breaks in our schedule that exist as we schedule for demand, but if you\u2019re Spirit-Frontier and you\u2019re - the only recovery option is to cancel down and reset. We have today, Tuesday. that's our reset date, which is naturally scheduled.\nHunter Keay: Right. Yes. No, that makes sense. All right, great.\nGregory Mays: It is hard and it's come with a lot of work. There's a lot of work involved. So, it's very difficult. \nJude Bricker: All right. That\u2019s enough. \nHunter Keay: Thank you. Appreciate it. I have more by the way.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks for the follow-up. This may be an off-the-wall question and not one I would ask most airlines at this point in the recovery. But can you just remind us when restrictions on capital return go away and how you'd be thinking about it if you didn't have those restrictions with your stock at these levels?\nDave Davis: Yes. The restrictions go away, I think end of September of this year. Yes. Let me position it this way. The balance sheet is really strong. We have excess capital on the balance sheet above and beyond what our operating needs are to either buy planes or operate the business. We're strongly cash flow positive. We think that the shares - the share price is substantially undervalued. You can sort of draw from that conclusions you would, but we think our shares are strong buy at these levels. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I have a follow-up with Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey guys. Thanks for the extra time here. I thought one of us might try for this, but just any high-level guidepost we should think about for what down versus 2019 means in 2022. Obviously, the path to below $0.06 in 2023, I'm guessing this year is a step towards that. But just any kind of like high level thoughts on how we should be thinking about full year 2022 CASM exercise and the context for that down versus \u201819 comment.? Thanks.\nDave Davis: Yes. I think you should be thinking about it as modestly below 2019 levels. So, in other words, we're not sort of knocking on the door of six quite yet. We should be there in \u201823. So, we'll be modestly below - if everything goes according to plan, which we're confident in, we should be modestly below our 2019 levels. \nJude Bricker: I think the big variable is input around cap level and how quickly the recovery happens, and whether or not the shoulder months in particular were able to blow those out or not. And that's going to drive some effect on CASM.\nCatherine O'Brien: Yes. Got it. Makes sense. And then just one more for me. Just on the new charter contract, can you just give us some color on the impact of those as they ramp up? I know in the fourth quarter you're still down 20% or so from \u201819 due to lower military flying. Will these contracts backfill some or all of that? And then I guess, if so, do you still have capacity to do more military flying if that demand comes back stronger? So, just helping us think through the impact of the new contracts and then what's left in the tank after those contracts are fulfilled. Thanks so much. \nGrant Whitney: Great question, Catherine. This is Grant again. Yes, so this year, the successes of the team in 2021, in terms of selling ourselves, winning back business, winning new business, we feel really good about the portfolio in total for 2022. We have a lot of precision in terms of what it's going to be, and that's really helpful in these times, because this - it\u2019s very operationally friendly. So, a lot of the flying we're going to be doing, it will be in pilot bids. we'll have good lineup sights on it. So, it's not going to drive close in changes or drive a lot of work for the organization. So, we feel really good about that. Getting our sort of casino business back to where it was and above where it was in 2019, is really important, because those are really good contracts for us. And then you're absolutely right. We will watch military very, very closely, and we can opportunistically take it when it makes sense. And military has been more competitive, just as other airlines have some spare capacity that they've been deploying to military. As things change and based on the recovery, we will keep close tabs on the military business. We do, and we will very much engage when it makes sense for us. So, yes, we have upside and we have a really good portfolio to begin with.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, great. Thanks so much for that.\nOperator: Thank you. And I have a follow up with Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thanks for taking my follow-up. So, going back to the question on cargo. So, you mentioned sick-outs and some IT issues, but just curious in the context of utilization, is the current fleet, I believe it's 12 aircraft, sufficient to handle growing or what could be erratic peaks, as well as what looks like Amazon is adding a few more dots or air hubs on the map here. Thanks.\nJude Bricker: You said sick-outs. I just want to be very clear. Like we have \u2026\nDave Davis: Legitimate COVID. I mean, people were \u2026\nJude Bricker: Right. COVID (unintelligible).\nDave Davis: I don't know. I think the answer - I mean, we have - we're running right now, a C-check line and that'll - that won't be a constant. I think what we saw in the fourth quarter for Amazon production, for our cargo production, is kind of what we would expect in a standard quarter going forward until we get more aircraft. I mean, and I think that's - my view is, it's kind of relatively likely. I think that we would intend to continue to have great operations that'll be valuable to Amazon or any other cargo partner. And we have a capability that I think is really valuable. \nJude Bricker: I mean, we\u2019re comfortable and confident that Amazon is happy with our performance. And are -if they want to grow the 737, 800 fleet more, we\u2019re very, very viable competitors to get more of those aircraft, but ultimately, it's up to them.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm currently showing those further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Jude Bricker for any closing comments.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, guys. Thanks for your interest. Everybody, have a great day and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "SNCY", "quarter": 3, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-11-02 17:38:05", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Sun Country Airlines Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. My name is Amitras, and I will be your operator for today's call. . I will now turn the call over to Chris Allen, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Allen, you may begin.\nChris Allen: Thank you. I'm joined today by Jude Bricker, our Chief Executive Officer; Dave Davis, President and Chief Financial Officer; and a talented group of others to help answer questions.  Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during this call, the company may make certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements. Our remarks today may include forward-looking statements, which are based upon management's current beliefs, expectations, assumptions subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the risk factors and cautionary statements outlined in our earnings release and our most SEC filings.  We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. You can find our third quarter earnings press release on the Investor Relations portion of our website at ir.suncountry.com.  With that said, I would like to turn the call over now to Jude.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. To review, our multisegment business model is unique in the airline industry. Due to the predictability of our charter and cargo businesses, we are able to deliver the most flexible scheduled service capacity in the industry. The combination of our scheduled flexibility and low fixed cost model allow us to respond to both predictable leisure demand fluctuations and exogenous industry shocks. We believe due to our structural advantages, we will be able to reliably deliver the industry's best profitability throughout all cycles.  Traditionally, the third quarter is a relatively weak quarter for us. However, I'm happy to report industry-leading EBITDA and operating margins of 21.3% and 13.2%, respectively. While the Delta variant negatively impact our scheduled service revenue, our cargo and charter segments outperformed to the upside. In addition, our variable capacity model helped to minimize our exposure to the demand weakness in late August, early September as we flew 41% of the quarter's scheduled service departures in July and just 22 in September. This focus on flying more during peak demand helped to produce a 4% TRASM-ings versus the third quarter 2019. In fact, TRASM improved in every month within the quarter in spite of the Delta variant. We attribute this trend to careful allocation of our capacity and continued improving performance of our ancillary products.  Fourth quarter bookings are trending positively as well. Similar to the third quarter, we've loaded a schedule focused primarily on peak periods. For example, currently, in the fourth quarter, 85% of our ASMs are on peak days, up from 80% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  I want to address 2 common themes across our industry. First, operational performance. It seems operations are straining everywhere across the economy as we recover from the COVID crisis. So I'm especially proud of our team's performance. We have maintained a schedule controllable completion factor of 99.9% throughout the quarter and in the trailing 12 months.  Further, our trailing 12-month on-time performance is above 84% with a mishandled bag rate of less than 2 per 1,000. This is while growing system block hours 15% versus the third quarter of 2019, and we've added our fleet, substantially increasing it by about 50% since COVID began. In light of our growth rates, our operation performance is particularly impressive.  Second, cost pressures. While we're certainly not immune to labor cost inflation, we still expect our fourth quarter '21 ex fuel unit cost to be roughly in line with the 2019 comp. This is in spite of significantly lower utilization as we bring back utilization on our passenger fleet to 2019 levels and work through some of our legacy contracts, we'll be able to continue our ex fuel CASM trend heading to below $0.06.  Finally, I want to give a few thoughts on our charter business. I haven't devoted much commentary to this segment in the past. Our charter business is extremely valuable because it has pass-through economics. It is counter-seasonal to our leisure demand. It's a space where we have significant advantages and namely, we can be more responsive than any other carrier. For example, all in the third quarter, we participated in the Afghan evacuation while also delivering our VIP product on our Kona Shuttle, and we flew our usual seasonal NCA football schedule facilitated by positioning aircraft throughout the country on sched service. In short, we're better charters than anybody.  Recently, we announced a new 5-year agreement to support Major League Soccer and their charter needs. Generally, we're now seeing charter volumes back to 2019 levels. As we continue to find new charter opportunities, I'm confident that our charter segment will continue to grow proportional to our sched business.  With that, I'll turn it over to Dave.\nDavid Davis: Thanks, Jude. I'll now review our third quarter financial results in more detail and provide an update on our fleet acquisitions before moving into Q&A. We produced $173.7 million of revenue in the third quarter. This is the highest level since Q1 of '20 and is higher than the third quarter of 2019.  For the scheduled service passenger business, PRASM was $0.0619, which is only 1% below Q3 '19 levels. Viewed sequentially, PRASM increased 11% versus the second quarter of '21 and an 8% increase in scheduled service ASMs.  Ancillary revenue continues to stay strong at $42.91 per passenger, which is 33% higher than the third quarter of '19. We're still trailing our 2019 load factor but are encouraged by the strengthening that we are seeing in pricing.  Total revenue per ASM, or TRASM, which includes revenue from our charter business but excludes our cargo segment, was $0.0963, up from $0.0926 in Q3 of '19. Charter revenue was $33.8 million for the quarter. Although still not fully back to Q3 '19 levels, charter revenue is rebounding nicely, and we are seeing strong growth in our sports business, particularly our flying for Major League Soccer. As Jude noted, we recently signed a 5-year deal to be the charter service provider to the MLS.  Our track charter programs, which consists largely of casino flying, are still recovering from the pandemic, and there remains excess capacity from other airlines and the military charter market, which we think will subside once more lucrative international and business traffic begins to return. Cargo revenue in the third quarter was $24.4 million and benefited from a 4% increase in block hours versus the second quarter of '21.  Turning now to operating costs. We continue to maintain solid cost discipline with total operating expenses 6% lower than they were in the third quarter of '19. Conversion from a leased to owned aircraft fleet continues to pay dividends as the combination of aircraft, rent expense and aircraft depreciation was 13% lower than in the third quarter of '19.  Our efforts to lower distribution costs have resulted in a reduction in sales and marketing costs per passenger of 15% compared to the third quarter of '19. Salaries were 26% higher versus the same period in 2019 due mainly to the insourcing of our MSP ground handling operations in April of '20 as well as growth in our flying level.  On a per block hour basis, however, the combination of both rents and salary expense was essentially flat versus the third quarter of '19 and operations at our MSP base have markedly improved.  Turning now to our fleet. As we've mentioned in previous calls, our intent has been to acquire 5 incremental aircraft in 2021 and 8 in 2022, on our way to at least 50 passenger aircraft by the second half of 2023.  With the acquisition of 2 aircrafts since the end of the second quarter, we've now reached our fleet goal for 2021. We remain engaged in discussions on a number of additional planes, and we're confident that we'll be able to find what we need to grow at prices that will allow us to continue to average down our ownership costs.  During Q3, we purchased an engine, an aircraft and 3 engines for cash resulting in a reduction in our liquidity balance from $336 million at the end of the second quarter to $300 million at the end of Q3. We may finance unencumbered assets in the future, and our liquidity is sufficient to provide flexibility on the timing of future financing decisions.  Total debt, including both finance and operating lease amounts on the balance sheet has only increased $5 million since the beginning of the year. And liquidity as of November 1 was $325 million, so we are in a very strong position to fund our growth.  Finally, we summarize our expectations for Q4 in the earnings release. Q4 is a typically seasonally weaker quarter for Sun Country than Q3. In addition, fuel prices are expected to be $0.31 per gallon higher in Q4 than in Q3. For the quarter, we expect total revenue of between $164 million and $169 million, a fuel price of $2.55 per gallon and operating margins of 1.5% to 5.5%.  With that, I'd now like to open it up to questions.\nOperator: . The first question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nNoah Chase: It's actually Noah Chase on for Hunter Keay. I noticed you used the word sensibly when describing your capacity growth. What do you mean by that in the context of your expansion plans?\nJude Bricker: The main thing we would mean is making sure that we're able to deliver quality operational results. So we have the fleet to grow substantially faster than we're growing. But recall, we didn't have the kind of drawdown most of the airline industry had, so we kept everybody working through the COVID pandemic. Now we're running about 15% to 20% higher depending on the period. But as we look into the next year, then 2019 levels, which is substantial, considering that we stopped hiring like most airlines through the pandemic. So we're in a full ramp-up mode right now. We're having across all major labor categories, and that's about as fast as we can go.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: So I think you guys were the only U.S. airline to beat your initial guidance this quarter given the impact of the Delta variant mid-quarter. I guess what went better to offset that delta really weakness? I know you had mentioned in the press release, you did see some across your system.\nDavid Davis: Yes. I think -- this is Dave. I think there were probably a few things. When we went into our initial guidance, I think the demand environment has continued to be pretty unclear. So we were maybe a tad conservative just not knowing what to expect with the ups and downs due to COVID.  We benefited from a little bit more cargo flying during the quarter than we had originally anticipated. And then I think everybody at the company is just doing a great job at cost control and keeping our operating costs in line.  I think all those things sort of manifested themselves during the period to produce the operating margins that we saw. So I don't think there was anything really extraordinary, just sort of continued tight management of the business.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Got it. And then maybe just one on the forward book. Your implied CASM ex fuel, based on your guidance, would be down sequentially from third quarter despite ASMs actually being lower in the fourth quarter. Were there some timing events in the third quarter that drove a little bit of inflation? Or is the operation just really gaining efficiency going forward? What's driving that?\nJude Bricker: I don't know that our CASM is going to be lower in the fourth quarter than it is in the third quarter just because we're smaller. So I don't think -- I don't necessarily think that's the case. There wasn't any sort of particular -- I'm thinking there wasn't any particularly costly onetime item in the third quarter at all.  In the fourth quarter, actually, we're seeing a bit of a step-up in some maintenance events with just that the impact of that is pretty small. So really, any drivers of CASM change from 3 to 4 is mainly just due to capacity.\nDavid Davis: Yes. My comments, Catherine, were mainly around fourth quarter as compared to '19, which we would expect to be roughly flat. And there's some variability in there, so give or take a little bit.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. I'll sharpen the pencil on the midpoint for the model. If I could just maybe sneak in 1 last quick one. I've been hearing that the secondary aircraft market is starting to heat up a little bit and that used aircraft values are starting to improve. I guess, first, you've seen the same thing and probably it would be helpful if you could help us frame where used aircraft are versus pre-COVID when you're probably initially making the growth plans over the next couple of years?\nDavid Davis: We've sort of tallied it up the other day. We've looked at 150 aircraft so far this year. I told you we've acquired 5, so we're pretty picky. But there's plenty of aircraft out there from our standpoint to acquire. I don't think we've seen any real tightening in pricing. If we have, it's maybe been pretty minor. But we continue to find aircraft probably at similar pricing to what we saw in -- earlier in the year. So I haven't noticed any big change other than maybe a little bit on the margins, but nothing significant.  The last two airplanes we did were done very recently, and they are in line with the same economics as the other airplanes we acquired this year. And what I'd say is the used market is driven by weakness throughout the world. So where we saw now North America and Europe tightening a little bit, Southeast Asia is really weak right now. And so we see a lot of capacity still coming to market from those jurisdictions. I'm not too concerned about finding the lift we need. Relative to pre-pandemic, what do you think, Jude? Down 30% -- 25%, 30% in pricing?\nJude Bricker: Yes. about right.\nDavid Davis: Yes, we're buying mostly part-out values, even newer equipment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Look, as a federal contractor and having to deal with this vaccine mandate, where are you guys on that? How does your personnel situation look?\nJude Bricker: Do you want to take that one?\nGregory Mays: Yes, this is Greg. So as you said, the vaccine mandate is something that applies to us. We -- we've rolled that out. Our team has done a great job of getting the technology up so that people can upload their status. We're continuing to encourage all of our employees, and we're pretty optimistic with regard to where we are right now. I think for the entire industry is sort of trying to figure out how to manage through this and I think we've got a good plan.  The deadline is the 8th of December by Federal mandate. I think probably we'll use that month to try to chase down folks that haven't submitted their vaccination cards. I wouldn't expect any operational impact from the vaccine mandate this quarter. The reaction from the employees was mixed, as you would imagine. We're kind of dealing with some frustration, but we'll be compliant.\nMichael Linenberg: Very good. With respect to the pass-through economics of charter and cargo, Jude, as you mentioned, as you think about with fuel prices up a lot, I think Dave said they were up like $0.31 or maybe it was 31%, maybe it is $0.31 per gallon, 4Q over 3Q. How quickly can you sort of repivot your capacity towards charter and cargo? And I guess you did say that 85% of your capacity in the fourth quarter is going to be peak days versus 80% in '19. So it seems like in the scheduled business, you're really focused on the busiest days, maybe because of higher fuel prices. Just thoughts on that.\nJude Bricker: We can be pretty responsive when you think about ad hoc opportunities in the charter market. We can very close in and reallocate. But it doesn't have the kind of volume to really move substantial units of capacity out of sched service. So sched's planned at least 90 days in advance. And our Amazon flying is mostly flat. So the way we think about it is we want to have a cost structure and these other segments provide the kind of economics where we can fly a little or a lot in sched business and deliver the same unit costs. And that's kind of where we're headed. I wouldn't think of it, though, as a reallocation in response to fuel prices.  And one other bit of commentary, Mike, is like what we're seeing on the yield side is really positive right now. I'm not sure even in this fuel price, we want to move that much capacity out of the sched, particularly for the holiday season.  I mean if you're out there buying tickets, it's going to be pretty expensive these days. Like the rest of the economy, we're dealing with reflation here and that the airlines just aren't able to bring back seats as fast as demand is recovering.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes. No, I've definitely seen it firsthand. Just one quick one on the Amazon. You did say it was fairly flat, but I suspect even though your fourth quarter seasonally is weaker than your third. Is that the quarter where you're going to have the highest from an Amazon? And I'm just thinking holiday shipping and the fact that I think everybody is running tight. Is that going to be your big quarter revenue-wise from a cargo perspective?\nJude Bricker: For this year, yes, I can't speak to the future. But this fourth quarter will be our highest volumes we've ever flown for them.\nOperator: . Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: So Jude, maybe can we follow up there on the comments about better yields? Because obviously, margins are coming down a little bit in the fourth quarter and probably a little bit due to fuel. So how does that change your behavior on the margin here on pricing and the outlook?\nJude Bricker: Yes. So we had the remnants of the Delta variant effects on bookings to kind of begin in late August and come basically affected through the end of October, but the beginning of November is weak anyway.  But what we're sitting here right now looking at is a winter travel season, which for us is from Thanksgiving to Easter, which looks as good as we've ever seen. I mean there's no -- I mean, we have kind of maturity in our ancillary products, which are now producing in excess of $40 per passenger segment, which is up substantially from the 2019 comp -- winter '19, '20.  And as Dave mentioned in his comments, load factors haven't quite got back to where they were, but yields are fully recovered. I mean -- we would add a lot more capacity if we had the ability to do so going into the winter season.\nDavid Davis: Yes. I think -- this is Dave, hey, Brandon. I think one of the things to think about is just the seasonality of this airline. Fourth quarter is typically weaker from a margin perspective than the third quarter anyway. As Jude points out, yields remain strong.  We -- the guidance we gave for fourth quarter operating margin. The biggest effect on that number relative to where it would historically be is fuel. If you add sort of this big run-up in fuel sort of back to that number, we'd be typically seeing the same third to fourth quarter patterns that we see for this company yearly.\nBrandon Oglenski: Got it. And I guess to those comments about you'd be flying more, if you could. What's the constraint right now? Because I think you hit your fleet expansion plans? And Dave, you spoke about what you plan to add to the fleet next year. I guess, is it pilot limitations? Is it airport capacity?\nJude Bricker: Yes, it's hiring pilot constraints. As with everywhere across the economy, labor is just tight right now, and we're seeing some of the same things. I would want to make the point we're hitting our head count objective, but there's some uncertainty in that. And so the way we deal with uncertainty is pull down some of what we wanted to fly with sched service. And then if we perform to the upside on our hiring or attrition is lower than what we had downside case forecasted, then we'll add more charters. And if you -- if we're sitting here talking in 90 days, and we have a higher charter production, that's why.\nBrandon Oglenski: Got it. And then last one for me. I guess, hypothetically, if you could get all the pallets that you needed and you took utilization up, where could you have system capacity today relative to where you were prepandemic?\nJude Bricker: Well, I think a good rule of thumb would be 9 hours a day per passenger aircraft, which would be an increase of ASMs from where we have loaded of about 20% to 25%.\nDavid Davis: Yes. I think 1 thing to notice that's not just sort of staffing issue. I mean, there's still, as you pointed out, load factors remain a little low and demand remains a little bit weaker than it was sort of at prepandemic levels. So there's the impact on our capacity of just the overall environment relative to prepandemic levels and then some of the staffing constraints that you're talking about.\nJude Bricker: Yes, Brandon, just -- that was a great point. And I think the real -- so when we think about October, we were optimal. But there are periods of the calendar where we are capacity constrained every year always. And we're starting to enter that period basically Thanksgiving until early January and then mid-February to mid-April. It's never been the case that we didn't have enough demand for capacity. And so during those periods of time, yes, we could easily take utilization of 20%, 25%.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So curious on the charter business, mostly commercial and there's the military piece as well. But given what looks to be a fairly strong peak season. Is there an opportunity? Or are you able to do any ad hoc flying for cargo within that segment?\nDavid Davis: Well, ad hoc, as we would define it, would be scheduled after we bid the pilot deck. So we're taking reserve pilots or open time, in other words, putting out to the pilots for volunteer. The opportunity in cargo is pretty close to zero for that because the fleet is allocated to Amazon, who in particular in this quarter were flying about as hard as we can with that fleet. We don't have any slack.\nJude Bricker: Remember, Chris, we're basically scheduled takers in our cargo business. So we operate Amazon schedule. So the seasonality of that business is really driven by, as someone pointed out earlier, holidays, Prime Day, that kind of stuff where they have busier periods than other periods and not so much us allocating things to that segment.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And a follow-up. So is your larger peers are focused on restarting business and long-haul international travel into 2022? Curious if you could give some color on the opportunities domestically. And as we look at your network, should we think about 2022 as filling out the schedule? Or adding more dots on the map? Or a little bit of both?\nGrant Whitney: Chris, this is Grant. I think it was -- we've sort of shown what we're going to do and that we just extended our summer schedule, and we've had our winter schedule out there for a long time. And so the themes that we're really hitting on is building out Minneapolis to full potential. We're really happy with what we've been doing here just in terms of broadening our network, giving our customer base here in the Twin Cities opportunity to fly to new destinations.  We're up to over 70 nonstop destinations from Minneapolis. You go back to 2019 and compare that to where we were, about 40%. So put that into context, through COVID, we're really happy about that development. But we also see opportunities outside of Minneapolis and take advantage of that. And we're going to be really nimble and agile to the business plan, and we feel like there's a lot of opportunity out there. And as Jude and Dave have mentioned, is sort of all the inputs come together, we can take advantage of that, and we will, and we will communicate it as it comes up. But we're -- but our schedule is out there, and we feel really good about how we're positioned in the schedule environment, but we're having these wins on the charter side and the cargo business is really consistent. So the plan for 2022 is coming together very nicely.\nJude Bricker: And that's consistent with our network strategy as communicated during the IPO. So for the Twin Cities, we want to be the leisure carrier for everybody paying with their own money. And then outside the Twin Cities, we want to be flexible capacity that can bring down fares during peak periods in large city origination market like Dallas.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Jude Bricker.\nJude Bricker: Well, thanks for your interest, everybody. Thanks for tuning in, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

My name is Brian, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator instructions] After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I will now turn the call over to Chris Allen, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Allen, you may begin.\nChris Allen: Thank you. I'm joined today by Jude Bricker, our Chief Executive Officer; Dave Davis, President and Chief Financial Officer, and group of others to help answer questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during this call, the company may make certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements. Our remarks today may include forward-looking statements, which are based upon management's current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the risk factors and cautionary statements outlined in our earnings release and most recent SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. You can find our second-quarter earnings press release as well as our 10-Q on the investor relations portion of our website at ir.suncountry.com. With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Jude.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Sun Country's second-quarter earnings call. Our multi-segment business model is unique in the airline industry. Due to the predictability of our cargo and charter businesses, we are able to deliver the most flexible scheduled service capacity in the industry. The combination of our scheduled flexibility and low fixed cost model allows to respond to both predictable leisure demand fluctuations and exogenous industry shocks. We believe due to our structural advantages, we will be able to reliably deliver strong profitability throughout all cycles. And as demonstrated in the second quarter, and we're clearly pleased with our results. We are experiencing a rapid recovery in demand of our scheduled service. In June in 2021, our scheduled service TRASM exceeded our comp for June in 2019 and advanced bookings throughout our selling schedule continue to pace ahead of their pre-pandemic comps. Unsurprisingly, demand is particularly strong and domestic leisure, which represents most of our network. Additionally, we're seeing fall charter demand in near pre-pandemic levels, with a return of fall NCAA football. And of course, our cargo business continues to perform well. Currently, we're focused on two corporate priorities. First is delivering quality operational results while building the airline-backed pre-pandemic utilization levels. This is a big lift for us as July 2021, departures will already exceed our July 2019 departures by nearly 16%. Currently, we're hiring across all major labor groups to meet our operational growth needs. Thus far, we've been successful, delivering over 99.9% controllable completion factor, meeting our goals for on time and baggage metrics. I'm so proud of the talent and hard work demonstrated every day by our frontline employees and our operational leadership. Second is making some strategic investments afforded to us by our balance sheet strength and historically cheap asset prices across commercial aviation. Mostly, that means fleet growth and at appropriate prices, we're willing to spend on future fleet needs, even if that means running a small short-term surplus. Thus far, we've committed to three growth aircraft that we previously reported, but we're in late-stage negotiations on several larger aircraft deals. Aside from fleet opportunities, we found compelling investment and engines with a commitment on five engines and infrastructure as we recently closed on the purchase of our own flight simulator. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave, who will discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail.\nDave Davis: Thanks, Jude. I'll now review our second-quarter financial results in more detail and provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position before moving into Q&A. For the three months ended June 30, 2021, total operating revenue was $149.2 million, a decrease of 12% versus the second quarter of 2019 and a dramatic improvement versus the trough of the pandemic in the second quarter of last year. This 12% decline compares to a 35% decline in Q1 2021 revenue versus Q1 2019 revenue, demonstrating the strong, steady sequential improvement that we're seeing. Q2 revenue was also significantly higher than our total revenue expectations that we described in early May. This increase was predominantly in unit revenue as our capacity was largely in line with our expectations. For the quarter, our total revenue per ASM or TRASM, which excludes cargo revenue, while including our charter revenue, was down 9% versus Q2 of 2019, while our total ASMs declined 19% versus the same period. Our ancillary revenue per passenger continues to be strong at $41.66 or 26% higher than Q2 of 2019, and our average fare was $95.81 or 11.2% lower than Q2 of 2019. While this is still down versus 2019, it demonstrates strong continued improvement even in our seasonally weaker second quarter. For example, scheduled revenue per passenger declined 22% sequentially between the second quarter and the first quarter of 2019, while it only declined 3% this year in spite of 3.5% sequential growth in scheduled ASMs. Typically, we would fly fewer ASMs in Q2 than in Q1. TRASM for June was down only 4.9% versus June of 2019. Charter service revenue was $29 million for the quarter, which was approximately 31% lower than the second quarter of 2019. Charter block hours in the quarter were down 24% versus 2019, and charter revenue per block hour has only declined 8.6% in that same period. Charter revenues from ad hoc charter flying have recovered much faster and are only down 8% versus 2019, and we're expecting to add additional track charter flying later this year as that part of the business has taken a bit longer to recover. Cargo revenue was $22.1 million in the second quarter, consistent with our expectations. We started this line in Q2 of 2020, and it was fully ramped up in Q1 of 2021. Total operating expenses for the quarter decreased by 38% compared to the same period in 2019. If you exclude the special items and fuel from our results, total operating expenses were about flat in Q2 of 2021 versus Q2 of 2019. We're very pleased with this result as total block hours in the quarter were 11% higher in Q2 2021 than in Q2 of 2019. Of note, salaries, wages, and benefits were up 17%, and maintenance expense was up 84% versus 2019. The increase in salaries was driven by the 11% block hour increase and the in-sourcing of our ground operations at Minneapolis. Higher maintenance costs in Q2 2021 are due to the larger passenger fleet, the addition of the cargo business, which didn't exist in 2019, and the timing of certain heavy maintenance events. Aircraft rent expense dropped 36% last year, while depreciation expense increased 11% as we continue to prioritize owning our aircraft versus utilizing operating leases. Operating expense includes a net special items credit of $38.5 million, consisting primarily of $39.8 million from the CARES Act payroll support program, offset by certain onetime items related to the purchase of an aircraft that was previously under operating lease at Sun Country. Excluding these special items, we still had a positive adjusted operating income of $11.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of $28.8 million in the quarter. This will be the second consecutive quarter where we have positive adjusted operating margins, and we expect this trend to continue into the next quarter. The second quarter is also the third consecutive quarter where adjusted EBITDA margins have been north of 15% as we produced over 19% this quarter. The company ended the second quarter with liquidity of $336 million, which consisted of $310.7 million in existing cash and equivalents and a $25 million undrawn revolver. During the quarter, we purchased our sixth aircraft off-lease using the same delayed draw term loan facility as we did for the last five aircraft. For all six aircraft, the total amount financed using this facility is $80.5 million. We only have six aircraft still under operating leases, while at the second quarter \u2013 while at the end of the second quarter of 2019, that number was 18. Our net debt has declined for the third consecutive quarter as we grew cash balances from operations, while total debt rose from $505 million to $519 million due to the addition of two finance leases to the balance sheet. We are actively in the market for 737NGs that fit our cost parameters, and we have seen a lot of aircraft coming available in the market in recent months at attractive terms. As a reminder, Sun Country has no committed aircraft book, and we're able to fund our growth with low-cost aircraft purchased opportunistically in the used market. Let me turn now to the outlook. We still see strong improvement in demand through the summer. Third-quarter total revenue is expected to be between $170 and 175 million, which compares favorably to the $171 million that we produced in the third quarter of 2019. In addition to this, we're expecting to achieve an operating income margin between 5.5% and 9.5%, which would represent our third consecutive quarter of positive operating income. The midpoint of this range is also higher than the 6% operating margin that we produced in the third quarter of 2019. It's also worth noting that we are expecting to produce this level of higher operating income, while assuming an average on fuel price of $2.30 versus $2.07 that we saw last quarter. Total Q3 ASMs are expected to be 16% to 19% lower than they were in 2019, as we're still in the process of normalizing capacity for the current demand environment. With that, I will open it up to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] First question, we have Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, everyone. Thank you so much for the time.\nJude Bricker: Hi, Catherine.\nDave Davis: Hi, Catherine.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, guys. So, revenue came in quite a bit better in your forecasting at the beginning of the quarter. We've heard from other carriers that demand picked up through the quarter. But can you just give us some color on what trended better for Sun Country? Is that fares, loads? Were there some standout regions? Thanks.\nJude Bricker: Sure. So, Grant Whitney is here, so I'll turn it over to him in just a second, but let me give you my comments. Beginning around mid-February was where we saw really a dramatic move in demand to the better. And that continued all the way through June. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we exceeded June 2019 TRASM, which is higher fares than a slightly lower load factor. And the demand environment improved throughout the quarter on a flown basis relative to pre-pandemic comps. Across the network, we're seeing strength. Some of that can be explained through restarts of OA capacity in certain markets. But generally, the leisure markets continue to do well. And we're seeing big city connectivity to Minneapolis perform really well. The only exceptions to a broadly strong picture, we believe, can be explained through a delay in the infrastructure build-out in some of the destination markets that we serve that are relatively small. That means that travelers aren't able to get a hotel room or a rental car or go out to dinner. And so generally, things look really good, and that is continuing in the trends that we're seeing for bookings going forward through October, which is the time period that we have a meaningful booking profile. Grant?\nGrant Whitney: Yes. Jude, that's a great answer. Catherine, the only thing I'd add to that is, I think, as we saw through the quarter, we \u2013 the Southeast, particularly Florida, was really strong in April. And then as Jude mentioned, sort of the coasts and the Mexican resort destinations really turned on in June, and it just speaks to the value of our business model and then we can move the capacity that quickly. So we were able to take advantage of it and as things slowed down, we got out of them and moved into better things.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great. Thanks for the color. And then I guess, following on some comments you made last quarter. It sounds like you've been busy sourcing attractive aircraft in the secondary market. Can you just help us think through what the upper bounds of your acquisition targets might be just in terms of what you could smoothly add over the next 12 months from an operational and hiring standpoint? And I guess, I think you might have mentioned something about this in the prepared remarks, but would you consider buying aircraft today, just given the current market backdrop and then waiting to induct them when the operation could support them? Thank you so much.\nDave Davis: Yes. So this is Dave. I mean, first of all, we've \u2013 there's a lot of aircraft on the market, and we have gone through a lot of different \u2013 through bidding processes on a lot of aircraft to yield the aircraft that we have brought on, which is three more so far this year, and we have a strong bead on many others, including some interesting multi-aircraft deals. We've said many times, I think that our passenger fleet plan target is 50 aircraft sometime late in 2023. I think operationally, probably the max pedal to the metal for us would be an aircraft a month. I don't know if we could sustain that for two years, but it's an aircraft a month kind of thing at max. So I think operationally, we can bring in the aircraft that we need to bring in to meet our fleet plan. The answer to your second question is potentially, yes. In other words, if there were some really attractive deals out there, particularly multi-aircraft opportunities or really economic aircraft opportunities. We probably wouldn't bring those in, even if we didn't have an immediate need for them.  One of the things we can always do though, given the strength of our model, we can bring an aircraft that we might not necessarily have a scheduled service need for in a particular month or quarter, even that we bring it in, but we can throw it into our ad hoc charter pool. And as long as we get the pilots to resource it, we can use the aircraft to pick up some incremental charter revenue. We talked about keeping our ownership costs low, which we do. So that helps us be able to sort of utilize these aircraft less than we otherwise would at periods where we don't have scheduled service opportunities for them.\nJude Bricker: One other quick point on asset value is that most of the value of the planes that we're transacting on are encompassed in the engines, and that's an appreciating asset along with OEM escalation. So there's not a lot of cost with the stockpiling.\nCatherine O'Brien: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question, we have Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Good morning.\nJude Bricker: Hey, Hunter.\nHunter Keay: Hey. So on Amazon, if they were to theoretically come to you and say, please take 10 more airplanes. Would you feel the need to go out and find 10 more passenger aircraft just to ensure that you stay balanced and maybe not immediately, but would you feel a need to sort of accelerate passenger aircraft acquisition to stay balanced? Or would you just kind of let yourself get a little over-indexed to Amazon?\nJude Bricker: We would probably let ourselves get over-indexed temporarily. I mean, the optimal ratio is in between the 20% to 30% range, and that's based on minimum guarantees to our crews so that we can build an optimal scheduled service seasonal airline. So I mean, if there's an opportunity to expand with Amazon, we would probably take it on and wait and see what happens. Our current plan is that there isn't anything in the horizon, and we're going to focus on building out our scheduled service to pre-pandemic level utilization levels of the fleet that we have. And so I think it's good flying and if it's an opportunity, it presents itself, we'll evaluate it, but optimal is 75-25 for us, roughly.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thanks, Jude. And then the \u2013 your loyalty program, what is your penetration of the Twin Cities area relative to your local origin market share?\nJude Bricker: Yes. So let me define loyalty. First is just active customers that we interact with through digital marketing. There's about 1 million. So there's 4.5 million people, 90 minutes from the Twin Cities airport. We have 1 million households that we deal with, which is pretty high penetration. I'm not going to give you numbers on our credit card program, which we would consider like the active loyalty members, other than that it's growing really rapidly. Keep in mind, we inherited when we got a loyalty program that we trashed and rewrote. So the loyalty program at Sun Country is effectively three years old. And so we're still kind of making some adjustments and tweaks and working to grow that program out.\nDave Davis: And one of those years was a COVID year.\nJude Bricker: Exactly, yes.\nHunter Keay: Okay.\nJude Bricker: So I think the encouraging thing about our credit card program is that it's growing and that now that we're through COVID, we're seeing sign-ups back to the pace that we had had in 2019, and spend is back. And we can talk more about it as we get a full year out of COVID and kind of see what the steady state of that product looks like.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nDave Davis: We've also \u2013 sorry, Hunter, I'd only add that during COVID, we've made sort of a strategic focus on making sure we're building out the Minneapolis network. So our market share in Minneapolis, we're really happy with how that's developed over the last 12 months.\nHunter Keay: Right. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next question, we have the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Good morning, everyone. Two questions here. Hey Dave, as you think about your liquidity, which is actually quite high relative to your revenue base? I realize we're still sort of in the midst of a pandemic here. But as you think longer term, have you sort of thought about what is the appropriate level? And the fact that unlike most other carriers, you've got about third of your revenue that is under sort of long-term contract or longer in nature. And so you may not need to carry as much cash as your competitors. Where are you coming out on that?\nDave Davis: That's a good question. I mean, here's the dilemma with that. Given the way the model works, the fact that a big chunk of our business is under long-term contract or let's say heavily repeatable at least, we can probably operate and we've demonstrated the ability to operate with a whole lot less capital than we have on the balance sheet right now. So there's no question about that. We have surplus cash on the balance sheet today. What the optimal number is something probably lower than that. Now the one caveat that I would sort of put in here is we talked about a pretty aggressive growth plan. And that means hiring, it means buying aircraft, it means going to airports, it means ground equipment, it means everything sort of training infrastructure, everything associated with that and we said at the time of the IPO that, that's what we were going to use our capital for. And that is what we're going to use our capital for. I hesitate to throw out a precise number of the optimal amount of capital. If you're looking at a number of 20% to 30% of our total revenue that seems from my history in the industry like a rough number and we got more than that now.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Okay, that's helpful. And then just a second question. You look through your list here of 11 new airports. And I'm curious, I'm going to focus in on Punta Gorda and Asheville. I'm curious about how much work you had done in advance before announcing those \u2013 or was that more of a reaction to a competitor flying for many to those markets? And look, I \u2013 many at your home, it's your bread and butter. And I suspect that at the end of the day, you're going to do everything you can to defend that market. So just curious on kind of market selection and kind of the response there. Were those markets that you had been planning for some time? Or was that more of a reactionary move? Whatever you can \u2013 any color on that would be great. Thanks.\nJude Bricker: West Palm is a reentry. And in West Florida, along the coast, we want to be there for Minnesotans to go to every single destination across the West Coast. I think it kind of answers your question, Mike. I mean it's our home market. We aim to be the choice carrier for everybody in the Twin Cities that pays with their own money as distinct from Delta's customers, and we're going to defend this market aggressively.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question we have Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna Inter.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. So in your prepared remarks, you mentioned about the resiliency of your margins through the cycle, given your unique operating model in that business. So I realize that your business is a lot different today than it was a few years ago. But could you help us frame what margins might look like through a few cycle with the current business line that you currently have? Thanks.\nJude Bricker: I don't think we want to get into a lot of forward-looking multiyear margin guidance. I think the point was is that sort of given the stability of our cargo business, given the high degree of repeatability of our charter business, we can work through cycles on the passenger scheduled service side and still maintain above-average levels of profitability for the industry. I hesitate to give out exactly what those long-term margins would be. But I think we're very confident that they would be in excess of the margins that could be generated by carriers who rely almost exclusively on the scheduled passenger business.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you. And as a follow-up, just curious on your utilization levels with Amazon as more people return to office and perhaps there's less online orders for home. Curious if you're seeing any change in volumes in utilization there? Thank you.\nJude Bricker: No. It's very consistent. And our expectation is that continues into the future. What you saw in the second quarter should \u2013 is steady state in the future.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thanks for the time.\nOperator: And there are no further questions, presenters?\nJude Bricker: All right. Thanks, everyone. Thanks for your interest in Sun Country. Have a good day, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the risk factors and the cautionary statements outlined in our earnings release and our most recent SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Jude.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Sun Country's first quarterly earnings call as a public company following the successful completion of our initial public offering in March. It's great to have all our new shareholders on board. I'll start with some brief commentary about our operational performance and then provide some color about the demand environment. During the first quarter, we had a perfect controllable completion factor, in fact, we had over 250 consecutive days without a controllable cancellation. This was done while also delivering first quarter on time of 85% in industry-leading baggage performance. It's been a really tough year for our people, and I'm so proud to have been a part of this team that delivered these impressive results through such adversity. Thank you to all our employees. I'm also proud of our financial results for the first quarter as we delivered positive operating margin, even adjusting out special items, which includes the benefit of Cares grants. While we remain in an unpredictable demand environment, I'm encouraged by recent improvements that we're seeing in forward bookings. Demand really picked up around mid-February, and that momentum continues today. So first, for our scheduled service business, here are a few data points that give me confidence in a continued recovery. As of today, our summer schedule is sold to a higher load factor as compared to the same time in 2019. Also, we all know fares have been depressed throughout the pandemic. However, beginning in mid-March, our sole fares for summer travel have been in line with the same period in 2019, while ancillary unit revenues continue to trend well ahead. Our summer network is much more focused on VFR traffic return as our winter schedule, which tends to focus on vacationers. For the first time in the pandemic, we're starting to see VFR traffic returning. I think this is the progression of the recovery, which began with vacationers primarily to domestic Sunbelt destinations. A willingness to visit friends and relatives demonstrates increased comfort with the COVID situation. Our no-show rates have returned to pre-COVID levels, again, demonstrating a traveler confidence. In March and April, our credit card sign-ups and credit card spend exceeded pre-COVID comps. This indicates consumer desire for future air travel with us. Finally, we're seeing substantial booking demand for far future itineraries. During the pandemic, we experienced extremely compressed booking curves understandably. Recently, however, we've been taking substantial bookings throughout our selling schedule, including into the first quarter of 2022. Based on these inputs, we're planning a continued recovery of scheduled service through the end of the year. Separately, our charter business continues to improve. We focus on three broad charter areas, starting with our track programs, which consist of three dedicated aircraft. Two of our aircraft in track programs are up and running with the third scheduled to restart in the third quarter. Next, our sports programs, which have recently produced pre-COVID volumes as March madness has returned in our major league soccer program, picked up in April. And finally, our military flying, which is yet to recover, however, military tends to peak during summer months. Lastly, our cargo business continues to perform well. First-quarter 2021 marks the first quarter where we flew a full cargo schedule with all 12 committed aircraft. The program only began in May of last year, and it's a testament to our operations professionals that we're able to stand up that program so rapidly in the middle of a pandemic. We expect stable volumes from our cargo business going forward. While we're obviously not through with the pandemic, our financial performance and balance sheet allow us to now focus on making smart investments in our future. Broadly, that means taking advantage of the used aircraft market, finding network growth opportunities, and making the appropriate investments so that we can continue our operating performance as we grow into the recovery. Along those lines, here are a few highlights from the first quarter. We went public and paid back our government loan. We've committed to the purchase of three growth aircraft to a finance lease structure. We announced two separate major network expansions, a summer 2021 expansion focused on Minneapolis VFR markets like Indianapolis and Houston plus more Cancun service out of summer peak origination markets like San Antonio. Then last month, we announced a major expansion for our winter 2021, 2022 schedule, which was focused on expanding our footprint for leisure travelers across the upper Midwest highlighted by our launch of service from Milwaukee, Green Bay, Duluth, and Rochester, Minnesota; and also new Minneapolis service to destinations like Grand Cayman and Turks. Plus, an expansion of our popular bus connecting service branded as Landline to smaller cities across Minnesota. I'll now turn the call over to Dave, who will discuss our financial results and outlook.\nDave Davis: Thanks, Jude. I'll review our financial first quarter results in more detail and provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position before we move into Q&A. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, total operating revenue was $127.6 million, a decrease of 52.7 million or 29% compared to Q1 of 2020 and 35% compared to Q1 of 2019. The decrease was driven largely by a 52% drop to $54.6 million in scheduled service revenue versus Q1 2020 resulting from the ongoing impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in January and February. The company saw improving demand during the quarter as the number of vaccinations in the country increased and normal seasonal leisure demand patterns began to return. Average fare in the first quarter of 2021 declined 30% to $98.77 versus $140.34 in the same period last year. Despite the decline in base fare, ancillary revenue per passenger was essentially flat, going from $43.04 in the first quarter of 2020 to $42.98 in the first quarter of 2021. Charter service revenue held up relatively well and decreased by only $3.4 million or 12% to $25.8 million versus Q1 of 2020. The return of some of our sports charters offset continued weakness among casino operators. Our first-quarter results were greatly strengthened by $21.6 million in revenue from our cargo services segment, which commenced in May of 2020 and therefore wasn't present in last year's first-quarter numbers. Our cargo service revenue comes from our air transportation services agreement with Amazon. Total operating expenses for the quarter decreased by 38% compared to the prior-year period. Operating expense includes a net specialized items credit of $26.9 million, consisting primarily of $32.2 million from the Cares Act payroll support program, offset by certain onetime items related to the purchase of five aircraft that were previously under operating leases here at Sun Country. Excluding these special items, we still had a positive operating income of $1.2 million and adjusted EBITDAR of $19.4 million in the quarter. Of note, salaries, wages, and benefits were up 16%, and maintenance expense was up 42%, primarily due to increased flying to support our cargo services business, which did not exist at the same time last year as well as the timing of certain maintenance events. Aircraft rent expense dropped by 49%, while depreciation increased 20% versus last year due to a double ETC financing we undertook in 2020 and the purchase of five aircraft in Q1 that were previously on lease. These purchases allowed us to further reduce our aircraft ownership costs and were financed using a delayed draw term loan facility. We also purchased a sixth aircraft off-lease in the second quarter using the same financing facility. For all six aircraft, the total amount financed using this new facility was $80.5 million. As Jude mentioned, we successfully completed our IPO during Q1, which resulted in net proceeds of $224.7 million and the issuance of more than 10.4 million shares of common stock. With some of these proceeds, we repaid the $45 million Cares Act loan from the U.S. Treasury that we originally took out in October of 2020. The company ended the first quarter with liquidity of $295 million, which consisted of $269.6 million in existing cash and cash equivalents and a $25 million undrawn revolver. On April 29, we received the first installment of $17.3 million from the third PSP grant program. Our total liquidity at the end of April was $325 million consisting of $300 million in cash and $25 million in an undrawn revolver. We expect to receive the remainder of the third PSP grant, which we think will be around $17 million in May. Our strong balance sheet will allow us to fund our fleet growth plans. We're actively in the market for 737-NGs that fit our cost parameters. We've seen a lot of aircraft coming available in recent months at attractive terms. As a reminder, Sun country has no committed aircraft order book, and we're able to fund our growth with low-cost aircraft purchased opportunistically in the used market. Turning now to our outlook. We saw a strong improvement in demand as we move through the first quarter, and our base case assumption is that demand will return to pre-COVID levels steadily throughout 2021. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, the first quarter is typically the strongest of the year. Under normal conditions, our average fares and ASMs are typically lower in the second quarter than the first quarter and CASM is typically higher in the second quarter than the first quarter. We expect the second quarter of 2021 to follow our typical pattern with second quarter revenue down 20 to 24% versus 2019, capacity to be between 1.4 and 1.45 billion ASMs, and our adjusted CASM to come in between $0.064 and $0.067. Assuming current demand trends continue, we're highly confident that we will meet our initial expectations for 2021 and beyond, even in an environment of higher expected fuel costs. As a reminder, total revenue in the second quarter of 2019 was $169.4 million and details on 2019 can be found in our S-1. With that, I'll open it up to any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] We have our first question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Good morning, everybody. Congratulations on the IPO.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Hunter.\nHunter Keay: Of course. So how do we think about the long-term partnership with Amazon? I guess one way of asking this question, Jude, is if you were me, what would be the best way to model out revenue growth for the next three to five years?\nJude Bricker: Internally, for the next two to three years, we're looking at it as an annuity with a stable aircraft fleet of 12 aircraft that continue to produce reliable results with pass-through economics for fuel and heavy maintenance. So, it's basically an annuity in our business. You are kind of angling for some guidance on growth of that fleet, and we don't have any plans for that to happen in the near future. We continue to produce, I think, great results for them. And hopefully, that results in some growth opportunities for us in the future, but we don't have anything that we can commit to. I think one of the challenges in interpreting the results, which we've yet to demonstrate, is the synergies between that business and our SCAD business. Some countries always had a really seasonal business. And when we entered the contract before COVID had happened, the real value of that contract was to de-seasonalize our business so that we could be even more responsive to peak season demand in times like March and summer and the holidays. And I'm excited to be able to demonstrate those results as we move forward. So, as you look at it on a segment basis, I think, that understates the value of the cargo business as we look to grow out of the pandemic.\nHunter Keay: I got you. Thank you. And then to that point, Jude, on the seasonality, this has always been a very 1Q-heavy EBIT margin business for some country. You mentioned that in the prepared remarks too. But is there going to be a goal over the next few years to get a little more balance on a quarter-to-quarter basis? Or are you pretty much just in first quarter always? Yes, go ahead.\nJude Bricker: Yes, I mean, that's not really a stated goal. I think as we brought down our unit costs, more of summer should be good for us. I mean, we'll do a really nice business between Memorial Day and Labor Day. And that's just because of the cost structure of the business relative to 2018 and 2017 and earlier is just substantially different today. So, we'll be able to stimulate a lot of demand during that period. And then we've also found a lot of success in non-Minneapolis network opportunities, which tend to concentrate around the summer period. So, our Hawaii network is doing quite well. Our Mexican and Caribbean source market \u2013 destination markets out of source markets in the south in the summertime are doing really well. So, yes, I think the business will de-seasonalize, but there's nothing we can do to get people to travel in September or just be flying boxes.\nHunter Keay: Yes. And that's actually a good lead to my last question is how are you going to sell in O&Ds where you don't have a strong point-of-sale presence? You mentioned San Antonio, for example. Is there a way to compete there in any other way other than price and just gunning for spill traffic?\nJude Bricker: No, it's price. I think over time, we'll build a brand in the market like what we've done here. But people get on the airplane for price first. And that's why we're participants in the GDS distribution platforms and meta will be really important to us for people to find our airfares. And in many of these cases, we shouldn't understate the value of having a peak schedule. So, price is important, but averages are deceiving because we can have a higher average fare than most of the competitors in the market that would be low-cost carriers by competing with them on price but only during the peakiest times.\nHunter Keay: Okay, great. Okay, thanks, again.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Hunter.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey good morning, everyone, and congrats on the first call as a public company.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Catherine [ph.].\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey. So, you spoke to how attractive the used aircraft market is right now. We heard some pretty interesting numbers from one of your competitors just a couple of days ago. Should we be expecting to see you guys be pretty active acquiring aircraft this year? I know we're still in the throes of COVID, but things looking a little better. Do you guys have dry powder on your balance sheet? Or if not, would you consider raising capital too?\nDave Davis: Yes, so this is Dave. I think the trends that you're hearing about in the used market for 737-800s are very similar to what we're seeing. And we have already signed up three incremental growth aircraft in the first quarter, and we're actively in the market for additional aircraft. I mean, we have a growth plan built out into the future, and it's likely that we may accelerate some of those aircraft acquisitions into this year just given sort of what we're seeing in the market. That's one of the advantages that we gained through the IPO was you can look at our balance sheet, we got a really healthy liquidity position, so we got the powder to grow. That's not to say that we're just going to simply use cash off the balance sheet to do that. I think financing is available to us at pretty attractive terms as well. So, we'll look at the most economic way to finance the aircraft, but we're very active in the used market.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Great. And maybe just like a quick shorter-term question. Some of your ultra-low-cost peers we've heard from so far are planning on adding back more capacity in the second quarter. I think one just north and the other one is just south to flat versus 2019. Are you seeing something in the demand environment that is driving your relatively more conservative capacity plan, or is that some sort of structural constraint? Would love to hear some color. Thanks.\nDave Davis: Well, we're getting higher payers than them for that reason. Look, I mean, the point is just that if you got a bunch of pilots sitting on their hands, then you probably want to add some flying because it's \u2013 you're chasing cash. All our pilots are fully employed right now because of our cargo business. So, our block hour production is well above what it was in pre-COVID levels. And we have the metal to grow into a recovery when it's worthwhile. But in order to add substantially back the same scheduled service volumes is what we had we're going to need to hire more crews. And so, it's just different dynamics here for the add-backs to happen.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Got it. So maybe it would be fair to say, just since your pilots are already busy that allows you \u2013 and generating revenue on those Amazon flights allows you to perhaps be a little more focused on yield management versus load into the summer?\nDave Davis: Absolutely. Yes, that's accurate.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Great. Thank you so much for the time, everyone.\nDave Davis: Sure.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.\nMike Linenberg: Yes, hey, good morning.\nJude Bricker: Hey, Mike.\nDave Davis: Hey, Mike.\nMike Linenberg: Hey. Check on everybody else congrats. On the ancillary, that's held up well. In fact, you indicated that it was sort of trending better than previously. How much of that is that you just have a more robust ancillary product? Or is some of that just additional uptake in sort of what it was previously? Are there better uptake, more robust program? And when we think about the innings on ancillary, I know that you guys did have sort of a later start than a lot of other ULCCs, LCCs. Sort of what inning are we in on ancillary and sort of rolling out the various elements?\nJude Bricker: We're kind of in the seventh inning stretch right now. We really kicked off our ancillary growth with the migration over to the Navitaire platform, which happened in the summer 2019. And most of the momentum that we picked up immediately thereafter was in seat assignment and bag revenue, and that continues to grow, though at a much slower pace. Those product offerings will expand through machine learning and best practices with merchandising on the website. However, our recent growth is more focused on launching new products, like our insurance product and getting our third-party sales, which are car rentals and hotels back to what we have had in 2017, for example. And so \u2013 and those are really value-add initiatives because they have very little impact on the airfare. If I rated bag fees, there's going to be a negative impact on fair. So, I'm just really bullish on ancillary. And there's \u2013 we have some headroom left to go. It's, I don't know, $4, $5 that we're going to get over the next, I don't know, year or two. But it's going to be largely focused on non-bag and seat unit revenue expansions.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Great. And then just a question to Dave. We've seen some of the more profit carriers that have had good profitability in the past under the Cares Act to be able to utilize the benefit of NOLs and go back four, five years. Now I know that there was a tax-sharing agreement here with your primary shareholder. Do you get \u2013 should we anticipate that you do get some cash tax refunds in subsequent quarters from here? Is that out there as we think about liquidity? Can you just shed some light on that, if there's anything? Thanks.\nDave Davis: Yes. As I think it's pretty typical with a private equity ownership like us, we have a tax receivable agreement with our owner. I think you pointed it out, given restrictions in the Cares Act, we really don't pay out anything under the TRA, while the Cares Act restrictions are in place, those go through March of 23 right now.\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nDave Davis: Yes. Yes. So essentially, during that period, we're going to get the benefit of our NOLs. Post that period, you should think of us, for the most part, as a kind of a full cash taxpayer as the benefit of the NOL will accrue to the owners.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, Dave. Thanks, everyone.\nDave Davis: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: We have our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, and congrats, guys, on your first quarter as a public company.\nJude Bricker: Thanks, Brandon.\nBrandon Oglenski: Jude, I wonder if you could just give us some clarification here. You did say the summer schedule is sold to a higher load factor, but I'm assuming you're relating that to the same period in time in the booking curve in 2019. And I think you also said fares are also coming in higher, but is that also in relation to the same time in the booking curve?\nJude Bricker: Yes. So, for clarity, as we \u2013 if we were to compare today versus the same period in 2019 and looking at summer bookings, which for us are between Memorial Day and Labor Day, our load factors for that period now are about a little bit higher than what they were in 2019, but there's less capacity. Fares for the last roughly 45 days have been selling at the same level as they were selling in the same period of 2019, but we've been selling the summer schedule for much longer than that and the fares that we sold in advance of that period were lower. So, we've seen a recovery in fares. We've seen a willingness of consumers to pay what we're paying in pre-COVID environment, but it just started about 45 days ago for the summer travel period. And then the color there also is that, sorry, is that we're selling at a much higher ancillary level today as well, which is good.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. This question is coming from a novice, but I would assume that in this type of environment where you're getting up in the booking curve, you're actually able now to revenue manage and maybe that wasn't even possible 45 days ago?\nJude Bricker: Yes. I mean, it's just such a dynamic environment. We don't expect the kind of close in fair premiums that we had achieved like going into March period. So, we expect a much flatter booking curve, if I had to guess, but it really depends on kind of what OA capacity does across the industry for the summer months. Thus far, carriers have been pretty controlled and restrained. Summer looks really good, but it's just been a really dynamic environment for the last year. So, I can't make any predictions about what close in fair are going to look like.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate that. And, Dave, this is kind of a specific question, but are you guys going to be providing any block hour disclosure on the cargo business?\nDave Davis: Yes. So, the Q will come out this afternoon, and there will be more of a breakdown about block hours by segment in that document.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Great. So, I guess, more importantly then, do you view the Amazon contract as fully up and running now, so at the profitability levels you want to see? Or I guess, what could potentially drive profitability of that business higher?\nDave Davis: Yes. I think you should probably think about it as fully up and running in the first quarter. We really got fully up and running at the end of last year. There is an opportunity for some profit growth going forward. Obviously, if we grow the fleet at some point, there's an opportunity there, but there's also some escalators built in later years. But I think for the time being, you should think about first quarter is kind of our number.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\nJude Bricker: I just want to clarify one other thing from the last comment, Mike. So, the Cares Act grants, the restrictions on exec comp go through March of 2023. The restrictions on dividends only go through September of 2022.\nOperator: And thank you. I see that we have a follow-up question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, sir.\nHunter Keay: Thanks, again. So just, I guess, a couple more sort of just like philosophical questions for you guys here. When you contemplate buying a used plane, using cash versus debt or finance lease, whatever it might be, what are the things that you factor in other than just obviously, just the pure economics? Is there anything philosophically attached? Is there a bias toward using cash and you have to be convinced of some other vehicle to use that over using cash? What's the default way to think about buying planes?\nJude Bricker: I guess up until the IPO, the default way was thinking about how can we finance the aircraft. So, we're in a bit of a new world. Look, I mean, for us, it's legitimately just sort of straight up what the economics are. We're obviously going to be a little bit more biased toward cash than we have been in the past, so if really attractive financing is available. Previously, we were looking at really high LTV financings that had an impact on the rate that we paid. Now we don't need to do that anymore, and we can look at lower LTVs with better pricing. So that world is a little bit more open to us now. But I think you'll see us move forward with some combination of cash and financing. It's just we're seeing attractive financing out there. And as long as that's available, we're probably going to tap it. Right now, we're seeing, honestly, the structure being dictated more by the seller managing their book values than by whatever we prefer, which we're happy to do.\nHunter Keay: Yes. I was wondering if there's sort of like a \u2013 is there an aversion to debt, is the corporate philosophy, but let's try to just keep our debt down and let's view buying a plane with cash is sort of having a de facto revolver available because it's an unencumbered asset that we would buy? Or is it more just like, hey, we're not afraid to lever up here, which folds into the next sort of philosophic question I have for you, Dave, is how do you think about the balance sheet philosophically? Is there a minimum cash balance you feel comfortable with? What are your general views on debt? Just tell us how you're going to think about managing the balance sheet over the next few years.\nDave Davis: Yes. I think our general philosophy overall is to keep our leverage ratio relatively low, particularly compared to our peers. We don't have an appetite for really leveraging up the balance sheet. I think we're probably pretty conservative in that respect. We've run the business with pretty low levels of cash before, and I'm confident in our ability to do that. We have ample cash on the balance sheet at this point. And as I said, we're going to use some of it to grow. But we don't have plans to significantly lever up the balance sheet here. I mean, that's driven, in my mind, by a pursuit for the absolute flexibility, which is the core of our fundamental core is to be able to be absolutely flexible with our capacity and debt is a fixed cut.\nHunter Keay: Yes. Okay and, Jude, is there \u2013 from your time with Allegiant, I think there were a couple of times where Allegiant got \u2013 I'm not saying this was your decision, but a little over its skis in terms of growth. Is there a maximum number of airplanes or capacity growth that you feel comfortable pursuing in a year?\nJude Bricker: Well, last year was pretty big for us. I mean, we took on 15 airplanes. Grant is sitting here next to me so we had a little bit of my answer. I think we can do about one a month pretty sustainably.\nHunter Keay: Okay\nJude Bricker: But I think the important message there is that we're going to find airplanes at values where we can generate the returns, we think we should get. And if we don't get those airplanes, we're not going to buy them and not going to grow at the same rate. And if we do, we'll grow it more rapidly. So, the market prices of aircraft will be an input into our growth profile.\nDave Davis: Yes. I mean, I think we have a pretty well-structured growth plan over the next three years here, which is driven by a network plan and the knowledge of where we want to grow this business. So, it's not \u2013 we're not just adding aircraft just for the sake of growth. As Jude pointed out, we need the kind of returns that we need in order to add aircraft. When I was talking about growing more quickly before it's sort of pulling some of that forward, just given the pretty unprecedented market for used aircraft right now.\nJude Bricker: Yes. I mean, one of the problems the industry has is like an airplane isn't always the same amount of production. If we get the right value, we can do the same amount of flying with more aircraft generating higher unit revenues because of our peak strategy.\nHunter Keay: Can I ask another question? Are there more people in queue?\nJude Bricker: I'll lean into it. I think we\u2026\nHunter Keay: All right. No. That's cool. Just \u2013 I'm not trying to fill time. Normally, this is a good use of time. But the \u2013 help us understand charter a little bit. It's kind of a \u2013 it's an industry that \u2013 I understand what charter is, but I don't really know a lot about how it works in terms of how you sell the business and what the barriers to entry are? Why \u2013 we saw United take some airplanes instead of flying nonhub point to point, Columbus to Myrtle. What's preventing one of these network airlines on taking five airplanes and just throwing them into the charter business? If their SCAD stuff doesn't recover as well as they wanted to. I mean, what are the \u2013 what makes you guys have a competitive advantage in that market? And how does it generally work? What can you tell us about charter that we might not know about in terms of maybe how relationships drive business and things like that?\nJude Bricker: Let me introduce Grant, who runs our charter business.\nGrant Whitney: Hey, Hunter. This is Grant, and I have some background in that space. So, one of the things they absolutely could to both the airplanes. But what's really unique about the charter department is you need to have really close relationships, both internally and externally. Your customers sort of come to you late. They can change on the fly, and our organization handles that well. I think we do this well as anyone in the industry. But big airlines, those close in changes, and it can sometimes throw the operating side of the airline into a little bit of flux. So, we do that really, really well. And you also mentioned relationships. Relationships with customers are \u2013 they're just key in this business. And this airline has a long track record, and we've doubled down on that. We're doing a lot of work to just make sure we have great existing relationships and then taking our brand on the road and introducing ourselves to new customers. So, I think there's a lot of opportunity in this space.\nJude Bricker: I mean, pure charter airlines haven't historically done very well financially because of the volatility in the charter space. And then pure SCAD carriers that are of scale are challenged with charters because of the required flexibility from the customers. So, we're kind of uniquely positioned with both the flexibility and also the financial wherewithal to handle the variations in the business. And I think that comes back to our overall business model and the flexibility we talk about between these three segments. The unpredictability leads to the fact that we need to maintain lower cost at somewhat lower utilization to be able to sit an airplane when we need to. So, we're buying in the used market. We've tried to build sort of a holistic business model.\nHunter Keay: Yes. Okay. Well, thanks for all the time, everybody. Appreciate it.\nJude Bricker: Sure, Hunter.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a follow-up from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, guys. I figured we could ask one too. But I did want to touch on growing outside of Minneapolis. And, Jude, does that create any difficulties going forward because I think MSP is you're only base. Right?\nJude Bricker: That's right. Yes. I mean, operationally, we look at it as a strength. I think as we mature as an airline, say, four to five years from now, we might need to revisit this. But the flexibility of being able to fly a Hawaiian network and only doing it between Memorial Day and Labor Day without having to move crews around on a permanent basis is really valuable. Our Dallas network to the Mexican Caribbean markets is substantial, but it's really concentrated, again, Memorial Day to Labor Day. And we are effectively able to do it here out of Minneapolis. There's a little bit more cost because we position crews, but then we don't have to burden the operation in those markets with the shutdown in September. So, I view it, again, the next three to four years, we may need to revisit this. But right now, it's working really well that we can be really efficient in seasonal markets. We also have the advantage of having a winter peak so that we're deploying capital. We're deploying assets when it's in most demand in other markets. So, this is really powerful right now. Those growth opportunities are just working really well.\nBrandon Oglenski: But I would assume your Minneapolis opportunities probably have a little bit lower hurdle given your brand power in the market. Is that challenging outside of Minne?\nJude Bricker: In the Upper Midwest, our brand is pretty strong. I mean, I think we've seen ads in Madison and other places that have been \u2013 that have worked really well for us. So, I think there's definitely a strong \u2013 the strongest brand affinity is here in the twin cities. But if you get into the Upper Midwest in general, I think the brand is still recognized.\nGrant Whitney: Yes. And this is Grant, Brandon. One of the other benefits is Minneapolis is a big market. So, you actually can do non-Minne by being connected to the Minne franchise as well. Think of Houston this summer. We turn on Houston-Cancun, which, as Jude mentioned before, we're going after the peak days of the peak season, and that's going to be a really successful plan for us. But we've also tied in Minneapolis to Houston, which is a viable market as well. So, we sort of get the benefits on both sides.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Thanks for the follow-up.\nJude Bricker: Sure.\nOperator: And now we have a follow-up question from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey, guys. This is great. We always have more questions. So, one for me. As \u2013 a longer-term one, as we think about the balance sheet from here, obviously, Dave, I know you just mentioned there's no dividends allowed until 2022. We've seen growth airlines take different tax with capital returns. Should we think about kind of for the medium-term for you guys even beyond that 2022 official restriction at the best use of capital is going to be growth? Or would you guys consider share buyback, special dividend? How are you guys thinking about that?\nDave Davis: Here is honestly how we're thinking about it. Share buybacks aren't in my radar screen right now. I mean, we're focused on growing the airline, and we're restricted anyway for, what, another year and a half or so. So, we're going to manage the balance sheet prudently. But at this point, we think we got opportunity in front of us. The business model is working. So that's our focus.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Got it. And then maybe one on cost, sprung to mind when we talked about pilots already being fully employed. Across the industry, you're seeing a lot of other carriers who have costs stepping up in the first half of this year around getting pilots that were furloughed or on leave, retrained at the summer peak, putting aircraft back into the shop that's been in storage. How do we think all that for you guys? I know, obviously, you were able to fly a bit more than the industry throughout just given cargo and some of the charter opportunities. Should we see any pressure on those items? Or have you really been fully \u2013 like that already happened a couple of quarters ago? Thanks.\nDave Davis: Yes. I mean, one of the things to think about for Sun Country is we were actually bigger in the fourth quarter of 2020 than we were at the beginning of 2020 because of the Amazon business. So, we didn't go through furloughs. I mean, I've been at network carriers before with multiple fleet types and you get into furloughs and shrinking and you're training down the system, and it's turning a battleship to regrow it. We don't have any of that. First of all, our fleets obviously one fleet type. And then we didn't get any smaller. So, we didn't furlough people. Going forward, the challenge is just going to be to continue to hire pilots and grow at the rate that we want to grow.\nJude Bricker: Yes. And also, Junior Ridge is really valuable. So, we're continuing to hire a new staff and that keeps unit rates relatively moderate, which is going to be a standout in the industry as other carriers have done the opposite.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Got it. Thanks for the extra time.\nJude Bricker: Yes.\nOperator: And thank you. We have no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Jude Bricker for closing remarks.\nJude Bricker: Well, thanks for your participation in our first-ever earnings call. We're excited to have our new investors, and we're excited about the future, and talk to you guys again in 90 days. Thank you.\nDave Davis: Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect."}]
