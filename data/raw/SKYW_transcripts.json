[{"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 3, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-10-26 23:16:04", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Brent and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SkyWest Inc. Third Quarter 2023 Results Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Rob Simmons, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.\nRobert Simmons: Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As Brent indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; and Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer. I'd like to start today by asking Eric to read the Safe Harbor, then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results and then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2022 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. I want to start by saying how devastated we are by the horrific attacks on Israel and the escalating conflict in the Middle East that has put millions of innocent lives at risk. While we do not operate in these areas, the SkyWest team is made up of thousands of people from different backgrounds, countries and cultures and together, we mourn the loss of innocent lives. We're working where we can to provide opportunities to aid in the humanitarian response and look forward to an end to the violence in the region. Today, SkyWest reported net income of $23 million or $0.55 per diluted share and announced new flying contracts with United for 19 new E175 aircraft over the next 3 years. Also during the third quarter, we purchased 1.2 million shares for $50 million under our previously communicated share repurchase plan and have acquired 19% of total shares outstanding year-to-date. The quarter's results demonstrate that the SkyWest playbook continues to work as intended. This playbook is focused on our team, our fleet, our partnerships and a strong balance sheet. We continue to one, execute our multiyear fleet transition with focus on dual class and maintain an efficient and flexible fleet. Two, enhance our partnerships and ensure we continue to deliver on our partners' needs. Three, maintain a healthy and strong balance sheet that continues to help create opportunities benefiting our people, our partners and our shareholders. SkyWest teams continue to deliver exceptional performance, helping the airline achieve top 3 DOT on-time carrier status now for several months out of the year. So far this year, SkyWest has delivered a record of more than 240 100% completion days when adjusted for weather, the most in a single year in our history. This is an outstanding achievement but even more so when you realize that we report performance at more than 240 airports nationwide. This feat doesn't happen without extensive planning and resource allocation to manage through challenges as well as exceptional teamwork. Our people do a tremendous job and I want to thank them for their commitment and reliability and great service. Pilot availability and specifically captain availability has been an ongoing challenge here and across the industry and we continue efforts to stabilize our crew balance. We recognize that pilots have more options than ever before and appreciate that they are recognizing the value proposition at SkyWest. Both for those who choose to make a career here and those who want to transition to one of our major partners. We're fortunate to have positive working relationship with our labor representatives that enables us to move quickly on behalf of our teams. This unique relationship continues to benefit our people and helps us consistently deliver an outstanding product. Captain attrition has continued to stabilize through this quarter and attrition was again slightly lower than planned. We are still prioritizing upgrades while filling new higher pilot classes. And it will take some time to regain our crew balance and restore production and full utilization of our fleet. However, our existing fleet can accommodate large future growth without additional CapEx spend. And with the captain situation beginning to stabilize, we feel good about adding another 19 175s over the next 3 years. I want to shift gears to SkyWest Charter or SWC which has continued to successfully complete on-demand charter flying since it began operation earlier this year. Demand for these charters is extremely strong and we are encouraged by SWC's business. While commuter authority at the Department of Transportation has languished for no regulatory reason, we still believe SWC is the best possible answer for small community air service. Regardless of the status of that application, we're pleased with strong demand for SWC's product and are very optimistic about its future. In fact, charter demand is stronger than we originally anticipated with the SWC fleet now at 13 aircraft. We did not anticipate this level of flying within our original plan operating under commuter authority. SWC is certainly exceeding expectations even without commuter authority. That said, it is and will remain a very small portion of our overall business with our primary focus remaining on our contract flying and major partner relationships. As always, we remain disciplined to ensure our assets are deployed efficiently and profitably. Overall demand for each of our products remains exceptionally strong. As we deliver on our business fundamentals, we remain laser-focused on executing reliably for the long game and ensuring we are best positioned to respond to opportunities. Rob will now take us through the financial data.\nRobert Simmons: Today, we reported a third quarter GAAP net profit of $23 million or $0.55 earnings per share. Q3 pre-tax income was $24 million. Our weighted average share count for Q3 was $42.6 million and our effective tax rate was 4% which reflected an $8 million benefit from the lapse of an uncertain tax position. First, let's talk about revenue. Total Q3 revenue of $766 million is up 6% sequentially from Q2 2023 and down 3% from Q3 2022. Q3 revenue breaks down with contract revenue up 2% from Q2 and down 5% from Q3 2022. Prorate revenue was $110 million in Q3, up 33% from Q2 and up 16% from Q3 2022. Leasing and other revenue is down by less than $2 million sequentially and year-over-year. These GAAP results include the effect of $57 million of revenue deferred this quarter compared to $60 million deferred in Q2 and $13 million that was released in Q3 2022. As of the end of Q3, we have $305 million of cumulative deferred revenue that will be recognized in future periods. As indicated last quarter, we expect to defer revenue of roughly $60 million in Q4. We anticipate we will begin to recognize previously deferred revenue in Q1 2024 and beyond. Let me move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $820 million, down $42 million from $862 million last quarter. The $42 million reduction in cash during the quarter included the accretive actions of number one, repaying $110 million in debt. Number two, buying back 1.2 million shares of SkyWest stock in the open market for $50 million at an average price of $42 per share. During the 9 months ended September 2023, we have repurchased 9.6 million shares or approximately 19% of the outstanding shares of the company for $244 million at an average price of $25 per share. And number three, paying $36 million in aircraft deposits toward our order for 19 new E175 aircraft we announced today as we continue to invest in our fleet transition. Our CapEx during the third quarter was $32 million. We ended Q3 with debt of $3.1 billion, down from $3.4 billion as of year-end 2022. These cash-related numbers tell an important story about the quarter that we continue to generate positive free cash flow from operations despite production constraints. Our strong free cash flow also benefits from a lower investment in CapEx than in prior years. Our balance sheet and solid liquidity continue to be powerful tools to create shareholder value. Tools that have helped us repay over $330 million in debt and repurchase over $244 million in stock during the 9 months ended September 30, 2023. Consistent with our policy and practice, we are not giving specific EPS guidance at this time but let me give you a little color on Q4 and the preliminary outlook for 2024. We expect Q4 to be modestly profitable on pre-tax GAAP basis, including approximately $60 million of deferred revenue but seasonally down from Q3 as per normal. As Wade will discuss in a minute, we anticipate our Q4 block hours to be flat to down slightly from Q3, primarily due to seasonal factors. Although many variables can impact our 2024 production outlook, we are currently planning for our 2024 block hours to approximate our 2023 block hours with pilot availability the gating factor. As the GAAP noise from deferred revenue goes away in 2024 and including the benefit from our share repurchase activity this year, our 2024 GAAP earnings per share could again return to the high $5 handle where we were pre-COVID. Our solid balance sheet, reliable cash flow from operations and strong demand for our product provide a catalyst for improving our return on invested capital, including the following. As a result of our year-to-date purchase activity, repurchase activity of 9.6 million shares, as of September 30, 2023 we had 41.2 million shares outstanding. As of September 30, we had $136 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization and we anticipate continuing to be opportunistic in repurchasing shares going forward. Over the first 3 quarters of 2023, we executed on our balanced capital deployment by also repaying over $330 million of debt. Our debt net of cash continues to be lower than our pre-pandemic levels of 2019. The underutilization of our fleet in place today can accommodate 14% ERJ future block hour growth and 35% CRJ future growth in block hours before the incremental capital investment in the 175s announced today. Wade will give us more color around this in a minute. We continue to expect our 2023 capital expenditures to be approximately $300 million lower than 2022. And as announced today, we continue to deliver fleet solutions for our partners with 19 new E175s being added for United. We now expect to take delivery of 23 new E175 aircraft starting next quarter through 2026. We believe that our strong cash position and the actions we are taking now to prepare the way over the next couple of years for incremental utilization of our fleet, to work through the pilot shortage affecting the industry and to preserve the optionality of monetizing strong demand opportunities over time will position us well to drive total shareholder returns. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. Today, we announced a new flying agreement to acquire 19 new E175s and place them under a long-term contract with United. These new E175s will replace 19 CRJ700s. We anticipate 4 of the E175s will be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2024, 7 in 2025 and 8 in 2026. These 19 are in addition to the remaining 4 E175s we have on order. We anticipate taking 2 in the fourth quarter of this year, 1 in 2024 and the last E175 in 2025. At the end of 2026, our E175 fleet total will be 258. This order will continue to solidify SkyWest as the largest Embraer operator in the world. The debt remaining on the 19 CRJ700s will be repaid by the time they come out of contract with United. We expect working to place these 700s under flying agreements and believe they will be extremely valuable to our partners as they move to replace single-class 50-seat product with dual-class aircraft. These aircraft are some of the newest next-gen CRJ700s in the world. Let me review our production. The third quarter block hours increased by approximately 3% as compared to the second quarter of 2023. Based on the current schedules we have from our major partners for Q4, we anticipate that our fourth quarter block hours will be consistent with the third quarter. With regard to staffing, we have seen an improving trend in our captain attrition and anticipate that our 2024 block hours will be flat as compared to 2023. I would also remind you that we can add approximately 14% more block hours to our ERJ fleet before adding any aircraft. This number is over 35% for our CRJ fleet and makes each additional block hour accretive to the model. Our partners remain very engaged in supporting our efforts to restore production. Let me give a brief update about the status of SWC, our new charter business. SWC began operating on-demand revenue charters beginning in April and we have been investing in training and hiring of employees since that time. We are pleased with SWC's progress and the sport charter bookings for this fall and winter have been significantly higher than we originally anticipated. We anticipate SWC could create a positive contribution to our earnings beginning in November. As far as our prorate business, the demand remains extremely strong, just like the rest of the industry. We have seen very strong yields and great community support. We will continue to work with the communities on the best way to continue our service. We have spent the last several years reducing and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility to ensure we're well positioned. This flexibility will continue to be a differentiator for us and we are committed to continuing our work with each of our major partners to provide creative solutions to the continued exceptional demand for our products. Okay operator, we're ready for Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Just a couple here. You gave us, Rob, you gave us CapEx for this year. You said it was $300 million lower than -- or this year lower than 2022. With the 19 E175s coming in, how should we think about your -- what your CapEx was before and what the new number is for say '24, '25?\nRobert Simmons: Yes, hi, Mike. Yes, for '24, we expect to bring in a total of about 5 new E175s. Including the CapEx from those 5 next year, I would expect CapEx in '24 to be flat to slightly up from '23.\nMichael Linenberg: That's helpful.\nRobert Simmons: And again, in '25, Mike, the number of deliveries is 8.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. And then when we think about the CRJ700s, Wade, you said that they would replace as fuel class I guess 50-seat CRJs. But are those CRJ700s going to get converted from 70-seaters to 50-seaters like the CRJ550? Is that the future role of those airplanes? And will you be flying them?\nWade Steel: Mike, yes, this is Wade. As I said in my script, there's lots of opportunities for those airplanes, both in what you just articulated. There's also -- you know American's scope very well and they have a 65-seat CRJ700 that has a lot of demand for it as well. Both of those opportunities are out there for us and we would anticipate flying those in the near future.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, that's great. And then just last, Rob, on your GAAP EPS for next year, if I heard you right, I think you said $5. What is the release per quarter? Is it just the reverse? Is it roughly $60 million of revenue that gets released for each quarter? Or is it a different number? I want to make sure my pacing is right.\nRobert Simmons: Yes, sure. What we -- first of all, let me just clarify. What I said about GAAP EPS next year was something in the high 5s, high $5 earnings per share for 2024. And that would include something between $40 million and $50 million of deferred revenue reversals for the entire year. Something like $10 million to $15 million reversal per quarter. Not a huge number for next year.\nMichael Linenberg: And does it -- beyond '24, does it pick up actually? Or does it get released at that rate until you run through the entire $300 million plus?\nRobert Simmons: Yes. What I would say is it's going to be approximately that 24% rate for the next couple of years in all likelihood. It depends on a number of factors, including our overall production but '25 should look quite a bit like '24.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Just curious on the E175 order with United, does that replace any of the aircraft that you're flying for United today? Or how does that work?\nWade Steel: Yes, Savi, this is Wade. We have 19 CRJ700s that are flying for United today. And as the new 175s come in, they will replace those airplanes. And as we said, we anticipate that we would still work with our other -- all of our major partners in placing the 700s elsewhere to replace potentially single-class 50-seat airplanes.\nSavi Syth: Got it. I missed that comment and it makes sense what Mike was asking before. Thank you. And just on the pilot side, I wonder if you can provide a little bit more color. It seems like what we're hearing everywhere is much slower growth next year. Some of those low-cost carriers might not even be doing extra hiring. Are you seeing that today? And just any kind of updated thoughts on how kind of the building up the captain supply will progress over the next year?\nChip Childs: Yes. Savi, this is Chip. That's a great question. I think your -- sort of your industry take from the last 10 days is sort of something that we've sensed over the past month or so. I think that when you look at the environment, we continue to say that there's further stabilization of captains and pilots relative to what we're seeing and in our models. And I think when you take a look at some of the events that are going on relative to capacity, relative to the number of pilots that all the major carriers already have, I think most of them have more pilots than they did before the pandemic. There's a lot of factors that come into play when we try to predict what our models are going to produce. All of those are causing us to be more positive all the time. We think that we are going to have and build some relatively good momentum in the back half of 2024 into 2025 with this. But as you know and as you paid attention the last couple of years, it's still a very dynamic model that we are very keen to pay attention to and do what we can to make sure we continue to stabilize and get our production back up where we think it should be.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with TD Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi team, thanks for the time. I'm just wondering about SWC because it seems like this is a good avenue for growth. And you mentioned -- I think, Chip, maybe you mentioned that you don't understand why the FAA isn't approving this in a more speedy fashion. But aren't American and Southwest kind of complaining about this whole developing sector of the business?\nChip Childs: Helane, this is Chip. Yes, I'm looking for a question in there but I will try to add some commentary on all of it if you will.\nHelane Becker: I guess my question, I was just --\nChip Childs: I'll try to address like kind of what you're trying to I think ask, is what -- there's a lot of opportunity with SkyWest Charter. We're very optimistic about some of the things that have happened within the college world, some things that are happening within certain markets of what SWC is operating in. One thing to be aware of I think that makes us most optimistic about this is the fact that we're entering into some of these different markets that have created a lot of demand since the pandemic and they have not had good service providers operating in these types of circles. From our perspective, I mentioned earlier that as SkyWest is used to being a very strong top performer in the overall aviation industry and as we start to penetrate into some of these other markets and models, we're finding a very strong welcome mat that people are very interested in what we have to do with this entity. Now from the perspective of the DOT, I think we kind of know why they're not approving what we want for commuter authority. There's a lot of unnatural behavior relative to what they're doing. And from our perspective, as we continue to monitor how this process works, we're not going away. We're going to continue to fight for what we believe the communities deserve. And so, look, I think from that perspective, I want to also make sure that we understand -- we were hopeful that SWC would probably deploy about 20 to 25 aircraft in small community service with a commuter authority. That's a very small fleet actually. We're up to 13 or more with actual on-demand service within Charter. Look, there's a lot of good opportunities we see with this. But when you look at the big picture, this is still extremely small relative to SkyWest Inc. and our overall fleet with SkyWest Airlines and what we're trying to do. I mean we're still deploying in that plan to deploy 19 E175s to SkyWest Airlines. It's part of the picture that we're seeing where we can actually be motivated with our expertise, with our impeccable safety record and our procedures that we have that are absolutely proven and the best in the industry to carry our product forward to different models in different places. That's kind of where we are with SWC.\nHelane Becker: That's really helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: First, congratulations on the United deal, it's exciting. With those additional aircraft, you called out that your 175 fleet is going to increase to 23 aircraft between now and 2026. We've seen your CRJ900 200 seats get a bit smaller over the last year. How should we think about net growth of the total fleet between that E175 growth and any changes you would anticipate in the CRJ side? Understanding that you expect those 19 CRJs coming out of United to land somewhere else. I guess like any changes above and beyond that if there are any.\nWade Steel: Yes. Kate, this is Wade. Great question. As we said, we have 19 -- well, we have 23 175s coming. 4 of them were already on order. They're coming in '24, '25 and '26. On top of that and this is our focus, our current ERJ fleet is still underutilized by 14%, right? We still have the opportunity to grow back that utilization. Our CRJ fleet is more closer to something like 35% underutilized, so there's still plenty of opportunities there to grow back that utilization. We have enough shells on our CRJ side at the moment. And we're always in discussions with our major partners about potential fleet needs in the future and what they need. Between what we have on order, our existing fleet and our discussions, we definitely have a lot of opportunities in the future to continue to grow and use our dual-class fleet how we anticipate to.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. You'd expect like CRJ probably and understanding there's tremendous capacity to increase utilization on that side of the business but you'd expect like shell count to be fairly stable over the next couple of years. Is that right?\nWade Steel: Yes. Yes. No, we have -- our shell count we anticipate being very stable. We've got a lot of CRJ900s and a lot of CRJ700s that we can deploy in the future.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. And then maybe another one on SWC, that being a positive contribution to earnings in November on better-than-expected demand. I know obviously things have changed with some of the delays in the commuter authority but it sounds like the on-demand charter, that's a happy new piece of news there for you guys. What was your initial expectation of when SWC would be a positive to the bottom line? And I guess how should we think about the size of that contribution going forward? Thanks so much.\nChip Childs: Yes, Katy, this is Chip. Just real quick on it, I think that initially we anticipated that we would probably be well into 2024 before we would have a positive contribution from SWC. I mean clearly, our plans originally, as we were looking at commuter authority, we knew it would be a measured, I don't want to say a slow but a measured and predictable process as we were starting to pick up more small communities through the process that that takes. And now we have massive demand from colleges and other entities that want on-demand service absolutely right now. That's why the time line has certainly picked up. Now I think from our perspective, since we're still in the infancy of how we're trying to build up the demand, we'll probably hold off and evaluate it and give you some more information when we meet on the fourth quarter results, maybe give some more color of what our expectation contributions are going to be there. But so far we're optimistic but it's still a little bit early and we'll know a lot more in the next 3 months and get back to you on some more specifics then.\nCatherine O'Brien: Totally fair. Maybe if I could just sneak one last one in, just on the leasing business, I think that revenue has been kind of flattish. We hear a lot about scarce availability of new tech narrow-bodies driving pretty attractive lease rates in that area of the market. Are you seeing -- is it just that the supply and demand dynamics are different on the aircraft and engines that you were looking at that business? Or has like the objective changed and you think that you want to hold on to those and fly them in your own business? But would just love an update on what the trend line is there going forward. Thanks so much.\nWade Steel: Yes, Kate, this is Wade. The demand has been really strong. We've actually, between both leasing and selling some assets, we've had very strong demand in both our -- in all types of our engines. It is flat on that line item. Some of the decrease is actually related more to kind of our ground handling business in that. The leasing is definitely -- we see the pipeline out there and what we have in the future kind of lined up as definitely some increase going forward. We definitely see the supply chain challenges and there's lots of people in the market that are reaching out for engines really at this point for help. There's still some upside to that. We are working through that with them right now. But yes, we see good demand over the next couple of years for sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just maybe just to revisit some of the themes, so first on staffing and your kind of increased confidence, what are you seeing? Is this a function of things that you have implemented on the retention side? Or do you suspect that there's maybe less competitive bidding at the moment from the mainline carriers? Is this a function of maybe adjustments to capacity plans out into early 2024?\nChip Childs: Yes. I would -- Duane, thanks for your question. This is Chip. I'd take it to probably 3 separate things. One, you're right, we have done a lot of things internally to try to make sure that we are the premier regional carrier for pilots to stay and build a long-term career. And we have seen some interesting things relative to attrition with captains with what we've done over the past 18 months, so that's been a very positive impact, probably the most positive impact that we've seen in the last 12 months. And now looking to the future, when you start talking about overcapacity, we evaluate -- to be candid, just the sheer numbers that the major carriers have hired and what they have today. I mean, I think you can look at publicly filed documents and see most of the major carriers have more pilots today than they did back pre-pandemic. And now we're having conversations about capacity. That's an industry event that we have sort of seen a trend over the past 2 to 3 months which we expect is going to be even stronger over I think the next coming months. That's the big one. And I guess the third one is the overcapacity because I think -- I mean, it's not to say that we're still not out of the pilot supply problem because there still is a lot of time and cycles we have to produce to produce captains. All of the schools that we work with, our cadet program has never been stronger than it is today. We are getting very, very positive responses on first officers. But now we're at that point when all these things align and we just have to continue to produce captains, to produce more productivity to produce captains which is what I think from now for the next 12 months is going to be key for us to do.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, great. And then on the United agreement, maybe you could just talk a little bit about is it a function of the demand appeared or your ability to service that demand appeared? If we think about like the pipeline of incremental business where you'd be going out into the market and acquiring new aircraft, what's the rate limiter on that? Is it sort of coming to the right terms with the legacy? Or is it your confidence in your ability to go execute that business?\nWade Steel: Yes, this is Wade. We've been working with United on this deal for a while, right? And United has been extremely supportive of us to continue to get a very good complete 175 fleet in their large dual-class scope with them. And so, we've been working with them for a while on this. The legacy was very supportive. They wanted this product in there. They could see that we were improving, that our demand is coming back, that we're able to fulfill these contracts. And so I think between the confidence that United had and what we had in our abilities, we worked with them and we came to an agreement on this with Embraer and United. And we do have these deliveries over the next 3 years, right, the end of '24, '25 and '26. It will give us time to get our overall fleet utilization back where it needs to be as well. It was just a great 3-way agreement that we did. I would even add GE into that as well. All of our major partners that we had in this one was very good and it was a good transaction for us.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I guess just should we expect more of these over time is kind of the question? Is this a one-off? I mean it's great to see it. Is this a one-off? Or do you think there could be more of these over the coming quarters?\nChip Childs: Duane, this is Chip. Man, I hope there's a lot more of these over the coming quarters. But I think that you've got -- I think for us, we're realistic about the current environment. I think that when you talk about us getting 19 175s, this is a fantastic deal given the timing and the things we're facing in the world. I will tell you there's a lot of headwinds to having more of these though. First and foremost, interest rates are extremely high relative to aircraft financing. We still have, as we talked just earlier in your other question, you still have the development of captains. We think ordering more aircraft helps with that. We think it helps recruiting. We think it helps retention. But to the extent that you've got some challenges in making sure that we get the right pricing of aircraft and get them financed the right way, the beauty of it is, is we think at SkyWest we are by far the most competitive in the industry of being able to be creative to do more of these more than anybody else. While I can't promise that there's going to be a lot of these coming, I can say that this is a very direct part of our strategy and we're significantly better positioned than anybody else given what we can do with our balance sheet, the most amazing professionals in the industry and our creativity. I hope there's more of these in the future. But there's a lot of headwinds at the same time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Thanks for the follow-up. Can I ask on the prorate side, how many kind of aircraft are you doing on the prorate side? And is that now mostly the larger RJs or kind of just a mix there?\nWade Steel: Yes, Savi, this is Wade. We have somewhere in the range of 25 to 30 airplanes in the prorate side. I think you have probably seen publicly our Delta fleet has transitioned to a dual-class fleet primarily on that starting the first part of October. And so that has transitioned. The rest of it still is in a single-class 50-seat airplane.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And then just on the chartered, a quick follow-up. What's the seasonality like on the charter side? Is it a bit more counter seasonal so it gives a nice offset? Or is -- just curious.\nChip Childs: Yes. I think honestly, Savi, this is Chip. We're kind of still learning ourselves. I mean what I do know is that from now through the spring is extremely busy. And we're hearing, I mean to a certain extent, we're like, okay, this is basketball and is that what this primarily is? And if it primarily is basketball and we start to look at what happens after spring and summer and there's also other sports of baseball and other ones where there's a lot of other things that happen with this. We're new to this. And to a certain extent, like I said before, the industry is new to an entrant that can do this reliably and predictably. Because that's the number one shocking thing for us getting into this space is how bad the competition is to be candid. It may be unfair but just to be honest, we can deliver a product that a lot of people haven't seen before in this space. That having been said, it is a bit seasonal that we see today. We're looking at what things can happen next summer to keep the seasonality strong throughout the summer. But obviously, we're going to, as we said before, we're going to continue to pursue commuter authority. And when you get to that level of seasonality on that side of the business, it could offset very nicely. That's kind of the process that we're going to take with it.\nSavi Syth: Is that still like 100 pilot type operation? Or does that need to grow?\nChip Childs: No, that would need to grow. If we are sitting here, we typically assume we need about 10 pilots per aircraft. We have the needs of 13-plus today. And like we said, there's a fair amount of small community service we could do on top of that, so we'll continue to need to grow the pilot element of that business model. Which, to be candid, has some very, very attractive prospects. We have some amazing pilots joining and we have a long list of pilots that would love to be involved with it.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chip Childs for closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Thank you again, everybody, for your interest. We appreciate the amazing work that our people have done this last quarter. I can't speak highly enough of what our performance does with the opportunity it in turn provides for our people and shareholders and all of our stakeholders. Quite candidly, we're grateful for the sensitiveness that everyone is moving forward in the world we're living in today and keeping safety the utmost paramount priority that we have and we continue to have what we hope is a very good, well executed and safe holiday season and we will return back and report on the fourth quarter in 3 months. Thanks again for your interest.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-07-27 21:26:14", "content": "Operator: Hello and welcome to the SkyWest Incorporated Second Quarter 2023 Results Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now turn the conference over to Rob Simmons, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nRobert Simmons: Thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; and Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer. I'd like to start today by asking Eric to read the Safe Harbor, then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results, then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2022 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call again today. Today, SkyWest reported net income of $15 million or $0.35 per diluted share. Reflected in those results were $60 million of deferred revenue. Halfway through 2023, we're making strong progress on all of our strategic objectives, including, one, enhancing our partnerships and ensuring we continue to deliver on our partners' needs; two, effectively and efficiently utilize our industry-leading flexible fleet; three, maintaining a healthy, strong balance sheet; and four, continuing to ensure that we take care of our people and create value for our shareholders. We are pleased to exceed all of these internal targets for the first couple of quarters in a row now. The second quarter was the first full quarter reflecting our updated partner contracts helping to offset our new pilot costs. We appreciate the confidence that each of our partners have in our product and their continued support of our efforts in the new environment. We remain committed to working with them to evolve, adapt and provide strong solutions to their needs. During the second quarter, we purchased 3.3 million shares for $94 million under our previously communicated share repurchase plan and have acquired 17% of total shares outstanding year-to-date. Captain availability remains an industry-wide constraint, and we are making good headway. We also continue to work with our pilot group to ensure SkyWest remains a career destination and not just a stepping stone for exceptional pilots. We are prioritizing upgrades, while prioritizing upgrades, we continue to fill new higher pilot classes. Additionally, captain attrition continued to stabilize, although we've seen a slight increase in first officer attrition. Overall attrition was slightly lower than planned for the quarter. These improved metrics continue to improve our outlook on block hours for 2023, which are now expected to be about 11% lower than 2022. It will take some time over the next couple of years to regain our crew balance and restore production and full utilization of our fleet. I would remind you that as we do so, our ability to restore even a portion of production becomes accretive with our existing fleet mix. Our existing fleet can accommodate large future growth without additional CapEx spend. We invested heavily in our people over the past year and continue to believe it is our most important investment. To that end, SkyWest became the only regional and second airline ever to implement flight attendant boarding pay during the second quarter. This is in addition to last year's pay increases. We're fortunate to have positive working relationship with our labor representatives that enables us to move quickly on behalf of our teams. This unique relationship continues to benefit our people and helps us consistently deliver an outstanding product. Constant strong operating performance is a key differentiator for SkyWest, and we remain disciplined in ensuring we deliver on our commitments. Our teams began the second quarter by ranking 1 in the Department of Transportation's on-time performance list for April and producing over 99.9% adjusted completion for the quarter. I also want to mention that so far this year, SkyWest has recorded over 160 days of 100% controllable completion. This feat does not happen without extensive planning and resource allocation to manage through challenges. Our people continue to do a tremendous job as we adapt and lead the industry. I want to thank them for their commitment to reliability and great service. SkyWest Charter, or SWC, has continued to successfully complete on-demand charter flying as we await the DOT's approval of a commuter authority. It is unclear to us why this approval has taken longer than similar applications. However, we are committed to seeing this application through to completion. SWC has completed all requirements necessary to provide what is already available to numerous operators within the existing regulations and well-established precedent. Additionally, we've committed that SWC will enhance safety in the Part 135 space by hiring ATP pilots in both seats, active flight dispatching, advanced qualification program training, SMS and FAR 117 res rules and many more enhancements to Part 135 requirements, even above what is being done at some 121 carriers, particularly low-cost carriers. We are committed to doing the right thing regardless of what is required. Small airports have suffered with the loss of connectivity in recent years, and we continue to believe SWC is the best possible answer for small community air service. While SWC will be a small portion of our overall business, we look forward to continuing to raise the bar for the national airspace and utilize existing assets to deliver critical service in small and underserved communities. Overall, demand for all of our flying remains exceptionally strong. As we deliver on our business fundamentals, we remain laser-focused on executing reliably for the long game and ensuring we are best positioned to respond to opportunities. We are putting solid components in place and have set ourselves up to be a fundamentally better company by focusing on the core areas of our business that will set us up for growth in 2024 and beyond and ensure we have a solid, sustainable future. Rob will now take us through the financial data.\nRobert Simmons: Today, we reported a second quarter GAAP net profit of $15 million or $0.35 earnings per share. Q2 pretax income was $18 million. Our weighted average share count for Q2 was 44.2 million, and our effective tax rate is 13%. First, let's talk about revenue. Total Q2 revenue of $726 million is up 5% sequentially from Q1 and down 9% from Q2 2022. Q2 revenue breaks down with contract revenue up 5% from Q1 and down 9% from Q2 '22. Pro rate revenue was $82 million in Q2, up $0.06 from Q1 and down 13% from Q2 2022. Leasing and other revenue was down $3 million sequentially and flat year-over-year. These GAAP results include the effect of $60 million of revenue deferred this quarter compared to $63 million deferred in Q1 and $16 million that was released in Q2 2022. As of the end of Q2, we have $248 million of cumulative deferred revenue that will be recognized in future periods. As indicated last quarter, we expect to defer revenue of approximately $60 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4. We anticipate we will begin to recognize previously deferred revenue in Q1 2024 and beyond. Let me move to balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $862 million, down $74 million from $936 million last quarter. The $74 million reduction in cash this quarter includes the accretive actions of number one, repaying $114 million in debt and number two, buying back 3.3 million shares of SkyWest stock in the open market for $94 million at an average price of $28 per share. During the first half of 2023, we repurchased 8.4 million shares or approximately 17% of the outstanding shares of the company for $194 million at an average price of $23 per share. Our CapEx during the second quarter was $31 million. We ended Q2 with debt of $3.2 billion, down from $3.4 billion as of year-end 2022. These cash-related numbers tell an important story about the quarter that we continue to generate positive free cash flow from operations despite production constraints. Our positive free cash flow also benefits from a lower investment in CapEx than in prior years. We also continue to have well over $1 billion of unpledged collateral that could be deployed for additional liquidity, if ever needed. Our strong balance sheet and strong liquidity continue to be powerful tools to create shareholder value, tools that have helped us repay over $200 million in debt and repurchased nearly $200 million in stock just in the first half of 2023. Consistent with our policy and practice, we are not giving any specific EPS guidance at this time, but let me give you a little color. We now anticipate achieving GAAP income both in the second half and for the full 2023 year driven by improved production forecasts resulting from favorable attrition trends. We're pleased several elements of our model have improved in the last 90 days. We expect Q3 pretax income to be flat to up from the Q2 results announced today, and we would expect Q4 to be seasonally down from Q3 as usual. Our outlook for block hour production that we expected last quarter to be down 14% in 2023 from 2022 has improved, which Wade will discuss in a minute. We now expect block hours to be down approximately 11% for 2023 based on improving captain attrition metrics. As I mentioned earlier, strong cash flow enabled us to buy back 8.4 million shares or approximately 17% of the company's outstanding stock for $194 million during the first half of 2023 under our repurchase plan. This is an important data point as analysts rebuild their EPS targets for the second half of 2023 and 2024. Total shares outstanding as of June 30 were 42.4 million, down from 50.6 million at year-end. As of June 30, we had $186 million available under our current repurchase authorization. There are four points I would like to call out regarding our return on invested capital trajectory. Number one, the fleet in place today can accommodate 20% to 35% future growth in block hours without incremental capital investment. Wade will give more quantification around this in a minute. Number two, the 17% reduction in shares outstanding in the first half of the year will set the stage nicely for EPS growth as we expect to generate GAAP profitability in the second half full year of 2023 and beyond. We expect CapEx to be down over $300 million year-over-year in 2023 compared to 2022. And this year's CapEx reduction, along with our improving production outlook, although still negative year-over-year, could drive the best free cash flow in 2023 that we have had in the last five years. We believe that our strong cash position and the actions we are taking now to prepare the way over the next couple of years for incremental utilization of our fleet to work through the pilot shortage affecting the industry and to preserve the optionality of monetizing strong demand opportunities over time will position us well to drive total shareholder returns. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I'll provide a fleet and production status update as well as an update on our charter and prorate businesses. As discussed last quarter, we are nearing completion of our strong delivery schedule. We have four remaining E175s on order. We anticipate taking two of those in the fourth quarter of this year; one in 2024 and the last E175 in 2025. We also returned on partner-owned aircraft to that partner during the second quarter. This will bring our E175 fleet total to 239 aircraft. As we previously discussed, we worked with each of our mainline partners to address the increased pilot pay agreement ratified last year. The second quarter was the first complete quarter to include the full impact of all partner reimbursements. We appreciate all of our partner support and continued confidence in our product with this additional cost reimbursement. Let me review our production. The second quarter block hours increased by approximately 2% as compared to the first quarter of 2023. Based on the current schedules we have from our major partners for Q3, we anticipate that our block hours will increase by approximately 2% in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. We have seen a positive trend in our captain attrition. With the captain attrition lower than planned, we anticipate that our 2023 block hours will be down 11% as compared to 2022, which is an improvement from the down 14% we communicated last quarter. As we look into 2024 and beyond, we can add approximately 20% more block hours to our ERJ fleet without any additional aircraft. This same number is over 35% for our CRJ fleet and makes each additional block hour very accretive to the model. Given our conversations with our partners, we are very engaged in supporting our efforts to restore production. Let me give a brief update about the status of SWC, our new charter business. During March, we completed all proving runs and received all the approvals necessary from the FAA to operate as an airline. During April, we operated our first on-demand revenue charter fight. We are pleased with the progress of our on-demand charter business and look forward to the fall when the sports charter demand increases substantially. However, we still have not received commuter authority from the DOT. The commuter authority application is meant to demonstrate the fitness of the carrier in terms of financial, managerial and operational matters, among other things. We believe SWC is a well-capitalized entity and has some of the best operational leaders in the industry. We have provided the DOT with the information they requested and are still waiting for them to approve and issue the commuter authority. Once granted commuter authority, SWC will be able to better serve small communities. Regardless of the status of our commuter application, we are moving forward with our plans for SWC to operate on-demand charters. As far as our prorate business, the demand remains extremely strong. Just like the rest of the industry, we have seen very strong yields and great community support. We will continue to work with the communities on the best way to continue our service. We have spent the last several years reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility to ensure we're well positioned. This flexibility will continue to be a differentiator for us, and we are committed to continuing our work with each of our major partners to provide creative solutions to the continued exceptional demand for our products.\nRobert Simmons: Okay. Operator, we're now ready for the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Thanks. Hey, good afternoon, everyone. The point about -- and congratulations on the results here. I was kind of curious on the point about kind of being able to increase your block hours 25% to 30% without incremental investment. I'm curious if you can share a little bit more about do you have the pilots needed to kind of get to that level of increase? Or how long would it take to get that increase into your block hours? And what kind of -- if there are any kind of OpEx cost investments that need to be made as we try to figure out what's your -- once you have a full utilization, what your cost of block hour might look like?\nChip Childs: Yes, Savi, this is Chip. That's a great question. We appreciate it. I think from our perspective, I mentioned a little bit of it in the script. We have a lot of underutilizations within our fleet today, and we do need pilots to get the utilization back up. As I mentioned in the script, we believe that this is going to take place over at least in 18 months to two year period. I think we've also indicated we're gaining some optimism about what's going on with the trajectory of -- and rates of attrition. So look, we're hopeful. I would also add, we are keeping a very close eye on what's going to happen this fall. But as we've seen some trends compared to the previous years in 18 months, look, we're gaining in optimism, but even that, it's going to take a while to produce captains. We think we've got a good stable base. We've gotten good things in place to make sure that we maximize what we can do relative to the fleet, but it's going to take a couple of years still to get to that pre-pandemic, very high utilization among our fleet, which has even increased since 2019 as well. So look, we're hopeful, but we still have to continue to be patient and hope that some of the rates and trajectory turn around as well.\nSavi Syth: Is it -- so maybe without asking kind of the specific possible outcome, is it that given where you're at, you should be able to get -- once you're at full utilization, you should be able to get at kind of similar pretax margin as '19? Is that right or --.\nChip Childs: Yes, we'd have to see what it looks like because it's going to take a little bit of investment to get there, but we're optimistic that we would be back to the pre-pandemic margins by the time we get our fully utilized.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. And thank you for the time here. So just a point of clarification. Are you on the share repurchase program and what you have left? Are you thinking of getting the whole program down this year then? Is that how we should think about that?\nRobert Simmons: HI, Helane, it's Rob here. So the $185 million or $186 million that we've got left on the current program does not have a specific time frame for executing it, so we intend to be somewhat opportunistic about this. So -- but no time frame. But again, as in many years in the past, as we've demonstrated. Typically, when we get a Board program approved, it's executed.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks Rob. And then just for my follow-up question, unrelated, maybe even a follow-up to Savi. Have you guys looked at what happens if the pilot retirement age is successfully raised from 65 to 67 in terms of the number of pilots who avoid retirement? And what that does to the ability to continue to get those captains in the left seat, a, and then b, the other part of the question is on the charter business, is there a political element to the DOT not giving you the approval, do you think?\nChip Childs: Well, just again, Helane, thanks this is Chip. I'll address both of the issues. I think to your first point, we've evaluated the age 65 rule in several different factors. And to us, in our situation with Charter and SkyWest Airlines and what our major partners are hiring, we're largely neutral on what the data is showing. I know that there are some special interest groups that are talking about the biggest concern about it is the fact that it does some things internationally with seniority of the list, which complicates it from the major carrier perspective. From our perspective, we're in favor of it. From a pure perspective, should someone older than 65 flying airplanes, but you have to understand, we're coming from the point of view where we probably have one of the best pilot training and monitoring programs in the entire world. So from our perspective, we have our own bars you have to meet. We have our own programs to monitor all these things. We don't believe a birth certificate is necessarily the key element that's going to make somebody a safe pilot, just like we're not sure that 1,500 hours is going to do the same thing. We believe in the programs and the safety programs and the training programs that are going to find out how good and how safe pilots are. We -- there's a lot of 1,500 -- young 1,500-hour pilots that do not cut the bar every month here at SkyWest. And so from our perspective, it's a view that we are quite candidly supportive of because of the confidence we have in our training and monitoring programs. But I think net-net, it's largely, we think it would be good for SkyWest. On the charter side, do we think that it's political? I would suspect it is. I fundamentally do believe that the Department of Transportation has a very strong internal priority, and they want to solve the solution with small community service. So from that perspective, us and the DOT are absolutely perfectly aligned in what that overall objective is. There's no doubt that there's a lot of special interest group that don't want us in this space. We, our objective here is, as Wade said, the on-demand charter business is doing really well. We are flying a lot of wealthy individuals as well as sport teams around right now, and it's not what we necessarily want to put our priorities at. We, 50-plus years ago, SkyWest was built on small community service. We fundamentally have a passion for that, and that's why we're going to do and continue to pursue what we need to relative to Charter. So I think generally, we're aligned. There's obviously probably our biggest problem is that we're probably the most qualified applicant in this process that the DOT has ever seen from a capital perspective, a safety perspective and an operating reliability perspective. So we thought that it would be easy, but it's definitely harder than what we thought it would be, but we're going to continue pursue.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes, hey, good afternoon, everyone. And nice results. Just a couple of quick ones here. The block hours going from down 14 to down 11. Just remind us at the start of the year of the initial guide, we're looking at what, I think it was minus 19. Is that where our starting point was and that's we're at minus 11 now?\nWade Steel : Yes, Michael, this is Wade. Yes, you're right on it. It was 19, and we have seen. As we said in our script, it's, we've had some positive trends in our captain attrition and we've been able to benefit from that, so. .\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. And then, Wade, on the attrition front, I think I did hear you say that first officer should went up and or maybe it was Chip who said that. And curious, what's the dynamic there on first officers going to up.\nChip Childs: Yes. I think, Michael, I think as we go through this pilot shortage process now, and we talk about pilot shortage, it is absolutely real. Otherwise, our results would be higher than what it is today, which we like. To the extent that we go through this journey that we started post-pandemic, as time goes on, the demand for pilots sort of changed, so I don't think there's any doubt what we're trying to do with captains at SkyWest is certainly motivating them to stay. And as that happens, then I think that the recruiters of the low-cost carriers and others have to go down a little bit further from our seniority list, and we are seeing some things hit from a first officer perspective. Now from our perspective of that, it's very easy to replace the first officer at SkyWest. Our -- honestly, our cadet program and our long-term classes can be full for several, several months based on the candidates we see out there. We don't like as much churn as what we have. So look, we're doing some things internally and with some various programs with our partners to make sure that we have people that are going to be willing to stay here longer if they're eventual objective is to go to our major partner, which by the way, that will be our long-term objective for both captains and first officers, is to make sure that we have programs aligned with going from directly, from SkyWest directly to a major carrier. And then admittingly, it's taken us some time, but I think there's going to be some very cool things come out here in the next month or two. So it's just, it's a journey. And I think the fact that first officers are a part of the thing that we see an uptick does give us confidence that we're at least on the right pathway, although we're not done making sure we're retaining the captains in a better fashion than we want because we're very, very invested in that.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. Thanks Chip. Great. And just if I could sneak in a quick tax question for Rob. I heard the effective tax rate is 13%. How should we think about that for the rest of the year? And Rob, when you gave us the earnings guidance for the next two quarters, you're referencing a pretax number, right, not an after-tax or an EPS? You're looking at pretax, just to clarify. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nRobert Simmons: Sure. Yes, Michael, the comment on next year is that we expect to be GAAP profitable in the second half and for the full year. So that would be pretax and EPS, both. And then on the tax question, as you know, when your numbers go from negative to positive during a year, it's a little funky with tax rate. So the tax rate for the second quarter was 13%, which is obviously a little below what a normalized rate would look like. We expect that Q3 will also be unusually low, and then Q4 will pop back up. And then '24 and '25, we think that we'll start to get back to a more normalized tax rate. But for now, 13% is a little lower than expected. That's why some of the volatility there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for taking me on. Maybe just first a follow-up to Savi's question on upside to block hours at full utilization on your ERJ and CRJs fleet. Are all of those aircraft you're talking about multipart one, so forgive me in advance, but are all of those aircraft currently on contract, one? And then two, I know you moved some of the minimum block hour language in your contract recuts, but obviously, the industry is short capacity. So I'm guessing your partners who want to flex up as much as you can. But I guess do you agree on that? And then three, if your staffing issues were solved tomorrow, would we see the ERJ fleet start flying 20% more and the CRJ start flying 35% more? Or are there some other things that go to equation that we need to solve besides staffing?\nWade Steel : Yes. So Catie, just I'll tackle a couple of these questions. So the first one was just on the fleet itself, are all of those airplanes currently under contract? And I'll answer it a couple of different ways, right? The ERJ fleet, yes, 100% of those airplanes are under contract. The CRJ fleet, there are some CRJ200s that we have had that are no longer under contract and are parked in the desert and would require some maintenance on. And so as far as bringing up the fleet to full utilization, what I will say on that the ERJ fleet, all of them are flying today. They're all being maintained today. And so to get to that level of utilization, if we have the pilots available, yes, those could be flexed up very quickly and staffed. There would be no maintenance constraints. On the CRJ side, we would need to definitely spool up some of our MRO capacity to get all of the benefit of that CRJ utilization, but the ERJ would be ready to go as soon as we have the pilots to staff that. So Chip?\nChip Childs: Yes. And Catie, this is Chip. Just on your third point there about if our attrition sort of solved itself how fast do you get back to those pre-pandemic utilization, I would say it depends on what your definition of solve is. We had a fair amount of attrition back pre-pandemic that we're accustomed to. If it got back down to those levels, we're still, as we've talked about the last couple of years, in a deep hole. I mean I don't think we're not serious about some of the communication we put out there about small communities that we've had to get out of because this situation is real, and it's going to take us some effort to get out of. But if our attrition went to zero, we'd be very optimistic at which the speed that we could get the utilization back up. But we continue to evaluate what the fall looks like. We continue to evaluate what the holiday season and the middle parts between those look like so that we can give some better projections for 2024 and beyond. But I think that we're relatively conservative about our view about this, and we're going to continue to be that way until we start to see some really good data further out on the horizon. But we're still, look, we're still optimistic, and there's -- and I think to your point and your question is there is a tremendous amount of capital investment free upside in our business model relative to the pilot recovery process that we're going to have over the next couple of years.\nCatherine O'Brien: That makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much .And then maybe just beyond, listen, we saw 18 to 24 months, as you said, upside from just utilization, so I do not want to underplay that. But longer term, as we look forward, maybe over the next three to five years, what do you think are the main buckets of earnings growth from that point on? Is it adding that aircraft? Is it the impact of your charter and leasing businesses? Are there more accretive opportunities to buy aircraft off lease? And I guess I'm speaking about net income versus EPS, which, obviously, could continue to see upside from share repurchases. Thanks so much.\nChip Childs: Yes, Catie, that's a great question because I think that the answer to what you're looking for, for the opportunities beyond the next two years is still continued all the above of what we've been doing in the last seven years. There's no doubt there's some things we need to do with shareholders and the number of shares that we have. We'll likely continue to do those programs. Based on the fact that we have invested so much in the model in our people and in our partners, even post high utilization, I can tell you we are very optimistic, once we get a further good string of supply of pilots that all the things that we've done in the past 7, 8, 10 years are going to continue to have even greater opportunities in the future. And I hope that doesn't sound too optimistic. But from our perspective, I think that we've done some things right through the pandemic and since the pandemic. We've made the investments in all the right things. And again, as we say, we play the long game. So we're actually playing the long game beyond the next two years, and we're optimistic about what both Charter and SkyWest Airlines can do with these four amazing partners with the best aviation professionals in the world. So look, we're pretty optimistic over the long, long game as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey, and thanks for the follow up. Just curious, you called out your operational performance, which has been really stellar. And if I look at it, partially, there is a benefit on geography and not having as much more exposure to the Northeast. But if I look at some of your kind of competitors, they aren't doing as well on that. Is there something that's kind of different other than geography that's driving SkyWest to kind of perform that much better? And are you seeing that in your conversations with partners and maybe perhaps a willingness to kind of give more responsibility or kind of opportunity as things recovered to take on more flying?\nChip Childs: Yes. I think, Savi, first and foremost, I'm going to challenge your geography question a little bit. I mean we talk a lot about the northeast corridor, and I get all of that stuff. We still have four partners spread out all over the United States, and we are always impacted by something at least one or two places every single day and holding four separate partners together as far as we're spread out is a feat as opposed to just flying in the northeast corridor. And I get all of those elements. That having been said, I'll be very deliberate in my answer to that. We've learned hard lessons over the last four or five years relative to capacity and investment. And I know a lot of others have learned them this year. But I think we pride ourselves on agility, we pride ourselves on creativity and execution. And I will tell you that the investments that we've made have all been centered around making sure that we take care of our people, and our people want us to be an outstanding performer. We only recruit people that want to perform. We only want to hire folks that want to perform and that take pride in the fact that we invest in the right systems. And look, we benchmark ourselves not against other regional carriers or low-cost carriers. We benchmark ourselves in our investments in our programs and IT and everything against major carriers like our partners, the best carriers in the world, United, Delta and Alaska and American. That's our benchmark. And we still want to even exceed them because we have the challenge of dealing with all four of them from a dispatch perspective when they're having the same storms that we are. So for us to be where we are, I think, is, I will admit, probably be the biggest windfall. We do have a lot of assets that are not utilized as hard as they could be. And as we get our utilization back up, I think that's going to be a challenge because we surely have a lot of airplanes. That having been said, I think we've become a lot more sophisticated about the partners that we work with. From a vendor's perspective, I think our culture has gotten a lot better over the last two to three years. And I just can't say enough for the engagement on our team. I mean our team is absolutely second to none. I'll put them up against anybody, particularly when there's a challenge from senior management to mid-level management to the frontline employees. The only thing I can say is that they're among the best in the world, and they continue to deliver. So that's our secret right there. And it's probably not as eloquent as you want, but it's pretty straightforward.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes. Just a quick one, team. The on-demand charter business, which I know has now been up and running for several months now, what who we talking about sort of magnitude-wise on its contribution to top line? Is this a $10 million or $20 million annual business than that? I'm just trying to get a feel from a modeling perspective. Thanks for taking the question.\nWade Steel : Yes, Michael, this is Wade. As you said, this business is just getting up and going. And we're filling the -- we're testing the demand right now. And so we're definitely seeing that the fall and winter and spring are definitely busy seasons, right? And so we're staffing up for those times. We're working towards those. So we really -- we're still exploring what that's all going to be right now. We've got airplanes ready. We've got pilots ready. We've got flight attendants ready to go. So as far as the top line number at this moment, I think we're going to hold off on giving any of that kind of stuff. We need to test and see what the demands are, but the preliminary indications are that it's going to be strong. It's going to be good. So we're excited about that, and we'll see where it goes this fall so.\nChip Childs: Michael, this is Chip. I'd only add, I think that's a good answer from Wade, but I would only add that this year, it's not likely to make money because we are so heavy on crews. I mean, we were stacked with pilots in the night now. We have almost 100 pilots in there, and there's not enough flying for those almost 100 pilots. And we have a very strong cadre of pilots that want to be a part of this organization. So financially, it's not terrific right now. We think that it'll be as soon as we get some things in place with the DOT. But the commitments and everything that we've made to communities and what we're trying to do, we're investing in it now. It's not like we're going to invest in it later so.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey. Thanks [inaudible]. So maybe just digging into demand from your partners a bit more. Can you just walk us through what percentage of your fleet is coming up to the end of its contract term over the next couple of years, how conversations on extensions are going? And then a lot to tackle as we already cover on getting back to full utilization. But from beyond there, are your partners talking about adding net aircraft to SkyWest over the coming years? Is that a function of regional growth there? Or is that share shift? A multipart question again for me. I really appreciate the color. Thanks.\nWade Steel : Yes. As far as the demand and the fleet renewals, in the Q, we do give a little bit of information about when some of our contracts expire. We have a handful of airplanes that are expiring at the end of this year. We have some next year in '24. But our 175, which is the backbone of what we do right now, we've signed up for 12-year contracts. The first expirations aren't for several more years on those. And so those are out there. As far as the conversations go about renewals, they're very good. All the partners are very supportive on renewing, they want the fleet to be up. They want them to be ready to go. So we are having great conversations with all of our partners about continuing to get the fleet where it needs to be and going. And so the conversations are very good with the partners. The demand is still very strong from our side. About fleet renewals, the growth, we are always having conversations with our partners about not only our current fleet, about future fleets, about refreshing our existing fleet. So those conversations are always ongoing and they're ongoing today as well. So the partners have been great, and they're very supportive of what we've got going on.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over to Chip Charles for closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Thank you again for everybody for joining us today, and we really appreciate your interest. I think from the call, you can understand that we feel like we've got some very momentum in critical areas. Again, I want to reiterate a couple of things just briefly. One is that we continue to invest in the long game of our future and think that the things that we've been doing in the past are going to continue to magnify opportunities in the future. Lastly, I want to reiterate what we talked about on the call relative to our people and our performance. At times, we get questions about what are your future opportunities long term, short term. I can tell you we've got just the best partners to work with, and we have the most amazing group of people that are vested in the success of SkyWest now as much as ever, and we're humbled by that opportunity and take it seriously and hope that we can do what we need to return that value to all of our partners, people and shareholders. And with that, we appreciate your interest, and we will talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 1, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-04-27 23:29:07", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the SkyWest Incorporated First Quarter 2023 Results Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nRobert Simmons: Thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; and Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer. I'd like to start today by asking Eric to read the Safe Harbor, then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results, then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2022 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Our foundational work over the past year has provided solid traction during the first quarter. So SkyWest reported a pretax loss of $26 million or $0.45 loss per share for the first quarter of 2023, reflected in those results were $63 million of deferred revenue. As previously shared, we expect moving forward, we will be discussing deferred revenue regularly until utilization normalizes. As we advance through 2023, we're pleased with the progress we're making in our strategic objectives that provide unmatched value for our people, our partners and our shareholders. I talked last quarter about our significant investments in our people during 2022, including increased pay for nearly every work group and have finalized pilot agreement. During the first quarter, we were able to finalize all partner contracts to help offset our new pilot costs. We appreciate the confidence of each of our partners in our product and their deep engagement with our efforts in the new environment. As always, we're committed to working with our partners to evolve, adapt and provide strong solutions to their needs. During the first quarter, we purchased 5.1 million shares for $100 million under our previously authorized share repurchase plan and have acquired 6.3 million shares or 13% of total shares outstanding, totaling approximately $130 million year-to-date. We're focused on the importance of creating value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders to provide the best value proposition in the industry. This quarter's results also included early lease buyouts of 32 aircraft for $125 million. We deployed this capital to create future fleet flexibility for our partners as we work through the industry-wide captains imbalance. Rob and Wade will cover more specifics about that transaction in a minute. We're making good headway on our captain imbalance, and while we are prioritizing upgrades, we continue to fill new hire pilot classes as we work to rebalance our crews. Additionally, captain attrition has begun showing signs of stabilization and was lower than planned for the quarter. As a result, our previous outlook on block hours for 2023 is slightly improved compared to our comments last quarter. I would remind you that as we rebalance our ability to restore even a portion of production becomes accretive with our existing fleet mix. We continue to believe it will take some time over the next couple of years to rebalance our cruise and restore production and full utilization of our fleet. With the addition of 25 E175s last year alone, our existing fleet can accommodate large future growth without additional CapEx spend. We have continued to shore up our operational processes and resources, we remain disciplined in ensuring we deliver on our commitments. During the first quarter, our teams produced over 99.9% adjusted completion, and their commitment to reliability and great service continues to set our operations apart. Despite the quarter's winter weather affecting our key geographies, we continued to proactively manage through these challenges with solid planning and resources. Our teams continue to do a tremendous job as we adapt and lead the industry. Thank you to our team. We made exceptional progress with our SkyWest Charter entity during the first quarter as well. We successfully completed its first commercial flight this month. While there have been some unfounded claims made by special interest groups, SkyWest Charter has completed all regulatory requirements necessary to provide what is already available to numerous operators within the existing regulations and well-established president. I want to be clear that, as always, the first and foremost priority for SkyWest and its subsidiaries is always safety. SkyWest Charter will enhance safety in the Part 135 space with active flight dispatching, advanced qualification programs through training, SMS, Part 117 rest rules and many more enhancements to Part 135 requirements even above what is being done at some Part 121 carriers, particularly low cost carriers. SkyWest Charter looks forward to raising the bar in this space and utilize existing assets to deliver critical service in small and underserved communities. Overall, demand for each of our products remains exceptionally strong. As we execute on our business fundamentals, we remain laser focused on executing reliably for the long game and ensuring we are best positioned to respond to opportunities. As I discussed last quarter, we have set ourselves up to be a fundamentally different and better company. We have done this by focusing on the core areas of our business that will set us up for growth in 2024 and beyond and ensure we have a solid sustainable future. Rob will now take us through the financial data.\nRobert Simmons: Today, we reported our first quarter GAAP net loss of $22 million or $0.45 loss per share. Q1 pretax loss was $26 million. Our weighted average share count for Q1 was 49.4 million and our effective tax rate was 15.5%. First revenue. Total Q1 revenue of $692 million is up 2% sequentially from Q4 2022 and down 6% from Q1 2022. Q1 revenue breaks down with contract revenue up 2% from Q4 and down 7% from Q1 2022. Prorate revenue was $77 million in Q1 down 4% from Q4 and down 2% from Q1 2022. Leasing and other revenue is up 5% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. These GAAP results include the effect of $63 million of revenue deferred this quarter compared to $69 million deferred in Q4 and $11 million that was released in Q1 2022. This $63 million of deferred revenue in Q1 relates to $63 million of cash received with related performance obligations completed during the quarter. As of the end of Q1, we have $188 million of cumulative deferred revenue that will be recognized in future periods. As indicated last quarter, we expected deferred revenue of approximately $60 million per quarter for the next three quarters before these balances begin to reverse into revenue in 2024 and beyond. Let me move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $936 million, down about $100 million from a little over $1 billion last quarter. This quarter, we repaid $107 million in debt, we bought back 5.1 million shares of SkyWest stock in the open market, approximately 10% of the outstanding shares of the company for $100 million and we acquired 32 CRJ aircraft under an early lease buyout agreement for $125 million, the estimated fair value of the acquired aircraft and engines. This transaction allows us to avoid paying future lease cash obligations of approximately $90 million. So, instead of paying $90 million in future lease obligations and then giving the assets back to the lessor, we unlock tremendous value by both avoiding $90 million in future lease costs and by acquiring and retaining the aircraft and engine assets worth $125 million, all for $125 million. Our CapEx during the fourth quarter was $103 million, including $86 million of net assets capitalized from the early lease buyout transaction and other fixed assets. We ended Q1 with debt of $3.3 billion, down from $3.4 billion as of year-end 2022. These cash related numbers tell an important story about the quarter, with cash falling only $100 million from last quarter, in spite of repaying $107 million in debt, buying back $100 million in stock and executing a $125 million early lease buyout, it illustrates that we generated strong cash flow during the quarter. This reflects positive free cash flow from operations despite production constraints and higher labor costs combined with the benefit of a lower investment in CapEx than in prior years. We also continue to have well over $1 billion of unpledged collateral that could be deployed for additional liquidity if ever needed. Additional flexibility comes from the fact that including partner-owned aircraft over 50% of our fleet in service has no financing obligation. Our strong balance sheet and strong liquidity continue to be powerful tools to create shareholder value. Consistent with our policy and practice, we are not giving any specific EPS guidance at this time, but let me give you a little color. From last quarter, when we commented that we expect 2023 results to be \"modestly profitable\" before the effect of roughly $60 million per quarter in deferred revenue in 2023, several elements of our model have improved. One, we have now completed amendments reflecting higher pilot cost reimbursements with all four of our partners. Two, our outlook for block hour production that we expected to be down 19% in 2023 from 2022 has improved, which Wade will discuss in a minute. We now expect block hours to be down approximately 14% for 2023 based on improving captain attrition metrics. Three, we were able to buy back 5.1 million shares or approximately 10% of the company's outstanding stock for $100 million during Q1 under our previously authorized repurchase plan that had $139 million still unused before this Q1 activity. This is an important data point as analysts rebuild their EPS targets. Total shares outstanding as of 3/31/2023 are $45.7 million down from $50.6 million at year-end. And number four, the early lease buyout transaction mentioned earlier will reduce our previously projected pretax operating expenses by approximately $10 million per quarter for the next four quarters. Note, that there was not a similar impact on Q1 as the transaction closed near the end of the quarter. This $10 million quarterly P&L benefit includes lease expense avoidance net of new noncash depreciation from the 32 CRJ aircraft acquired under this transaction. Consistent with last quarter's comments, we continue to expect total 2023 GAAP results to be down from 2022, but remain profitable before the effect of roughly $60 million per quarter in deferred revenue in 2023. We expect this deferred revenue balance will reverse by approximately $10 million to $15 million per quarter in 2024 and continue to reverse for several years thereafter. In spite of the GAAP loss expected in 2023, driven by deferred revenue, there are five points I would like to call out. Number one, the fleet in place today can accommodate 20% to 35% future growth without incremental capital investment, Wade will give more quantification around this in a minute. Number two, we expect CapEx to be down over $300 million year-over-year in 2023 compared to 2022. Number three, we expect cash at the end of 2023 to still be near $1 billion including expected debt repayment in 2023 of $400 million. Number four, this year's CapEx reduction, improving production outlook and partner contract amendments could drive the best free cash flow in the last five years. And number five, the 10% reduction in shares outstanding from the first quarter share repurchase activity will set the stage nicely for EPS growth when we return to GAAP profitability. We believe that our strong cash position and the actions we are taking now to prepare the way over the next couple of years for incremental utilization of our fleet to work through the pilot imbalance affecting the industry and to preserve the optionality of monetizing strong demand opportunities over time will position us well to drive total shareholder returns. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I'll provide a fleet and production status update as well as an update on our charter, prorate and leasing businesses. As discussed last quarter, we are nearing completion of our strong delivery schedule. We have four remaining E175s on order. We anticipate taking two of those in the fourth quarter of 2023, one in 2024 and the last E175 in 2025. This will bring our E175 fleet total to 240 aircraft. As we previously discussed, we've continued working with each of our mainline partners over the last two quarters to address the increased pilot pay agreement ratified last year. During the first quarter, we came to an agreement with our remaining mainline partners on increasing our rates for this new cost. The second quarter will be the first complete quarter to include the full impact of all our partner reimbursements. We appreciate all of our partner support and continued confidence in our product and this additional cost reimbursement. Let me review our production. The first quarter block hours were down by approximately 3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Based on the current schedules we have from our major partners for Q2, we anticipate that our block hours will increase by approximately 2% in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter. As Chip discussed, we have seen a positive trend in our captain attrition. With the captain attrition lower than planned, we anticipate that our 2023 block hours will be down 14% as compared to 2022 which is an improvement from the 19% we communicated last quarter. As we look to 2024 and beyond, we can add approximately 20% more block hours to our ERJ fleet without any additional aircraft. This same number is over 35% for our CRJ fleet and makes each additional block hour very accretive to the model. Given our conversations with our partners, they are very engaged in supporting our efforts to restore production. Additionally, during Q1 2023, we acquired 32 CRJ aircraft under an early lease buyout. These leases were some of the most expensive and inflexible agreements. We purchased the aircraft for $125 million. We believe the fair value of the engines alone are worth over $100 million and we also avoided unnecessary lease return costs and lease cash payments of over $90 million. Let me give a brief update about the status of SkyWest Charter. our new charter business. During March, we completed all proving runs and received all the approvals necessary from the FAA to operate as an airline. During April, we operated our first on-demand revenue charter flight. We are very excited about the progress of our new airline. However, we have still not received commuter authority from the DOT. The commuter authority application is primarily meant to demonstrate the fitness of the carrier in terms of financial, managerial and operational matters. Among other things, we believe SkyWest Charter is well - is a well-capitalized entity and has some of the best operational leaders in the industry. We have provided the DOT with all the information they requested and are still waiting for them to approve and issue the commuter authority. Once granted, commuter authority SkyWest Charter will be able to better serve small communities. Regardless of the status of our commuter application, we are moving forward with our plans for SkyWest Charter to operate on-demand charters. As far as our prorate business, the demand remains extremely strong, just like the rest of the industry, we have seen very strong yields and great community support. We will continue to work with the communities on the best way to continue our service. We are also having some success of selling some of our excess CRJ assets. During the past 15 months, we sold over $9 million of assets and we currently have signed letters of intent or purchase agreements to sell approximately 15 million of assets. We anticipate these transactions will close during the second and third quarters. We have spent the last several years reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility to ensure we're well positioned. The flexibility will continue to be a differentiator for us and we are committed to continuing our work with each of our major partners to provide creative solutions to the continued exceptional demand for our products.\nRobert Simmons: Okay. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a couple here. Rob on the share repurchase program, the $100 million, although there was an authorization of $139 million. Do you still have another $39 million of dry powder or would you have to go back to the Board and get that reauthorized. I guess I know it had been outstanding for some time, and I'm just curious of the status of that?\nRobert Simmons: Yes, thanks Mike. Just to clarify, going into the first quarter, we had $139 million that was still available under a previously approved program. During the first quarter, we deployed $100 million of that. And in the month of April, as Chip mentioned, there was another $30 million done. So as of the end of April, we will only have about $9 million available under that original program.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thanks for clarifying that. I missed that second point. Then just on the airplanes, the 32 I think that were just purchased off lease. Are those all in productive service with SkyWest or some of those leased out to other carriers, what's the status of those airplanes?\nWade Steel: Hi Mike, this is Wade. So yes, there were 32 CRJ assets as you said. They're all in the SkyWest Airlines fleet. There are, like I said in my script, we thought there was a $100 million worth of engines. So those engines are clearly all flying today within the SkyWest Airlines fleet. Some of the airframes may be on the ground as we're optimizing for our captain and our pilot situation right now, but they are all within the fleet right now.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. And then just my last question. Congratulations on getting a deal done with your - the last of your four partners. Typically when these deals get done, there's always some element of a quid pro quo, anything that you can share as it relates to length of contract? Obviously, you have better economics, but were there any sort of trade-offs as it relates to terms, tail risk, number of aircraft that they wish to utilize under the contract, anything that we just have to kind of be watching out for with that one partner? Thanks for answering my questions.\nWade Steel: Hi Mike, this is Wade. So that's a great question. So, like we said, we finalized our last agreement. With all of these agreements, we did not extend the term on any of those and we purposely did not want to extend the term. Right now, they are primarily just additional rate reimbursements that are under these agreements, all of them are very consistent with that. So there was really nothing unusual. We didn't take any airplanes out of contract, there was nothing like that done. It was primarily just a reimbursement for the additional pilot costs.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Helane Becker with TD Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, team. Thanks for the time here. So on the SkyWest Charter, can you use some of your existing pilots to fly that or is that strictly going to be new hire pilots?\nChip Childs: Hi, Helane, this is Chip, yes, it's a completely different certificate, completely different airline and we will be hiring as we have been with really good demand on new pilots for that operation.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then do you have a flow-through agreement or I don't know what you want to call it, the mainline SkyWest?\nChip Childs: So there is not necessarily any type of a flow between the two entities at this moment. To be candid, I think they're going to be very different from each other. The type of flying will be very different from each other. There's no doubt we may have some opportunities to move from charter to SkyWest Airlines as some of those things may arise. But like I say, the demand to join SkyWest Charter is extremely strong. We're very pleased with that, and as we continue to build right now what we're building on-demand charters with sports teams and high-wealth individuals and corporations and those types of flying, we'll continue to do the hiring and we need to fill that demand separately from SkyWest Airlines.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that's perfect. Thank you.\nChip Childs: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon, everybody. It's Matt covering for Savi here. First, on the block hour guide, you gave - can you give me, what you expect the quarterly progression to look like over the next several quarters?\nWade Steel: Yes. So, Mike, great. So, Matt. So listen, this is Wade. Yes, sorry about that. So, yes, so from Q4 to Q1, we said it was down 3% and then going from Q1 to Q2, we're up 2% and then for the entire year of 2023 compared to 2022. We anticipate being up 14% and so or down, sorry, excuse me, down 14%. So we - that's what we gave in my script. And you can kind of fill in the blanks from there comparing what's out there publicly.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, perfect. Thanks for clarifying that. And then could you talk about the - I think there was 20 CRJ 200s that shifted and maybe one CRJ 700 reduction. Was I looking at that correctly? And is that a short-term reduction or related to pilot availability or a permanent or any color there on the fleet could be helpful?\nWade Steel: Yes, so that's in the fleet numbers and the release. Those are primarily airplanes that would just do some heavy maintenance and some of the prorate stuff that has expired, that have gone away and we've parked those airplanes at this point.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. Do you still expect to get to a 100, 700 American at some point?\nWade Steel: Currently our agreement right now calls for 90.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for the clarification. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for the time. Maybe my first one just a quick follow-up to Mike's question. So on the fourth partner agreeing to the reimbursement on pilot costs which congratulations by the way. So last quarter, I believe you told us that the agreements with your three other partners got you to about 60% to 70% covered on the increase in pilot costs. With this fourth partner now, are you now closing in on like a 100% being pass through?\nWade Steel: Yes, we are close to the vast majority of our pilot increases now covered off.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great. Okay. And then maybe just - can you just help us flush out the changes to the 2023 outlook. Last quarter, you had said modestly profitable excluding the $240 million in deferred revenues. I guess like GAAP pretax loss was somewhere in the $200 million range. We also expect results to be down from the GAAP $73 million profit last year, can you help us think about how much the pilot pass-through and greater block hours swing us between the two onset range? Thanks so much.\nRobert Simmons: Yes, thanks Cathy. Look, I think that as we talked about in the script, there are a number of different elements that play into that our '23 outlook that we've got. Part of that was the block hour outlook improving from what we originally last quarter expected to be 19% down to 14% down. The completion of the final partner agreement amendment that's part of this. The transaction with the early lease buyout as we've talked about is very good from a cash perspective and also contributes approximately $10 million in P&L benefit over the next four quarters. So from 90 days ago, there are a lot of things that have evolved and a lot of elements of our model that have improved, we're pleased with that, but we are far from declaring victory still at this point.\nCatherine O'Brien: I'm trying to tabulate all the pauses in my head as we go here, but could we be looking at a GAAP breakeven result this year or that's too aggressive?\nRobert Simmons: Well, look, we're not going to give GAAP guidance to that level of granularity, but I can say that, in the last 90 days, we've seen material improvement in our own outlook.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. Had to try. And maybe just one last quick one on the New York City and DCA slot waivers, is that impacting your operations at all? Do you have to move any capacity around? And I guess like, so long as you get a decent amount of notice, is there any cost to SkyWest to move capacity around for your partners or is that just to give it in the business? Thanks so much for all the time.\nChip Childs: Thanks Cathy. Yes, this is Chip. Yes relative to the northeast corridor in the slots, we just don't do enough flying up there that has a big impact on what our operation is, we're clearly mostly Detroit to Chicago West. And from that perspective, we do work very well with our partners to make sure that we're flying in the right bases and locations because you still have even other their airplanes and they fly all over you still have to have a very strong supportive infrastructure for that. So, anytime they want us to move, it usually involves a pretty sophisticated conversation about that. So from our perspective, look, we just don't do a lot of flying up there, so it doesn't have a lot of an impact, so.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Chip Childs for closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Lisa, and everyone thank you for your interest on the call today. I think that this has been a great sort of a pivotal moment in our - and what we're trying to do long-term here. We think we're making some of the right strategic decisions to take care of all of our stakeholders. Again, I can't say enough about our teams and how well the first quarter and the winter months went relative to reliability and what we were able to accomplish for our partners. We will end the call today. We appreciate you joining, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: And that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2023-02-02 19:56:03", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Devin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SkyWest, Inc. Fourth Quarter and Annual 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your patience. Mr. Rob Simmons, you may begin the conference.\nRobert Simmons: Thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. And as the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; and Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer. I'd like to start today by asking Eric to read the Safe Harbor, then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results, then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2021 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us on the call here today. Today, SkyWest reported a pretax loss of $62 million or $0.93 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Reflecting in those results were $69 million of deferred revenue related to successfully amending the majority of our flying contracts, $36 million noncash impairment on 10 CRJ700 aircraft and an $11 million accelerated lease expense. We expect moving forward, we will be discussing deferred revenue regularly until the fleet utilization normalizes. Despite the noise in the fourth quarter, I want to point out that over the past year we have set ourselves up to be a fundamentally different and better company. We have done this by focusing on the core areas of our business that will help us set up for growth in 2024 and beyond and ensure we have a solid sustainable future. These fundamentals include: enhancing our partnerships and arrangements to adapt to a new industry and ensure we continue to deliver on our partner's needs; two, shoring up our operating processes and IT systems; three, effectively and efficiently utilize our industry leading fleet flexibility today and in the future. Four, maintaining a healthy and strong balance sheet, which is a key SkyWest differentiator; and last and most importantly continuing to ensure that we take care of our people and create value for our shareholders. We are confident our ongoing execute of these fundamentals will ensure we're able to deliver value for all of SkyWest stakeholders. As we discussed last quarter, we invested heavily in our people throughout 2022, including increased pay for nearly every work group when finalizing a pilot agreement in the third quarter. While this pilot agreement represents a significant cost increase, we are pleased to have worked with the majority of our partners to amend our contracts to help offset these higher crew costs. We continue to strengthen our partnerships and we appreciate their continued support and deep engagement in our efforts in the new environment. We remain committed to working with our partners to evolve, adapt and provide strong solutions to their needs. Our focus on dual class flying continues to deliver with 83% of our flying now dual class. We took four E175 aircraft in the fourth quarter and are expecting three more by the middle of 2024. Additionally, as we near the end of this fleet transition CapEx cycle, this leaves us capacity for growth and drives free cash flow within the existing fleet. The pandemic fundamentally changed our industry and our ongoing environment. We have spent the past couple of years identifying vulnerabilities and refining and reinforcing our operation and systems. Post pandemic realities have had an impact on every aspect of our operation from fuel supply and airport staff to lodging and accommodations for our crews, We spent a large part of 2022 ensuring that we have the resources, processes and systems in place to run the most reliable operation and to mitigate negative impacts on our people and our customers. We also remain transparent with our partners about our constraints and are disciplined in ensuring we deliver on our commitments. As we've seen throughout the industry, over commitment without the ability to execute is a recipe for disaster. As a result of our continued focus, I can proudly say our teams delivered some of the strongest operating performance in 2022 with over 99.9%% adjusted completion for the fourth quarter. This performance included the peak Christmas holiday travel period during which we experienced severe winter weather. In fact, SkyWest experienced severe weather disruptions in every key location across this geography. But we were able to proactively manage through this challenge with extensive planning and resources and as a result of our teams -- as a result of our teams delivered exceptionally well to get 2 million passengers safely to their destinations between December 16 and January 2. I also want to commend SkyWest people for over 180 days of 100% adjusted completion for the full year in 2022. Our teams have done a tremendous job as we develop the new normal and continue to provide the best product in the regional industry. Thanks again to all of our amazing people. We're making good headway in our captain imbalance and we're cautiously optimistic as we plan for the years ahead. We continue to fill our new hire pilot classes and are maximizing our training resources with priority on upgrades as we work to rebalance our crews. SkyWest is clearly recognized as one of the most desired career destinations. We continue to believe it will take some time over the next couple of years to rebalance our cruise and restore production and full utilization of our highly accretive fleet. As we rebalance, our ability to restore even a portion of production becomes accretive within our existing fleet mix. We've made great progress with our SkyWest charter entity and once operationally ready, we expect to conduct charter flights in the second quarter. SkyWest looks forward to raising the bar in the Part 135 space with the implementation of several proven safety programs not required within Part -- existing Part 135 operations. This entity represents another strong opportunity to utilize existing assets and deliver critical service in small and underserved communities. Overall demand for our products remains stronger than ever. As we execute on our business fundamentals, we remain laser focused on executing reliably for the long game and ensuring we are best positioned to respond to opportunities and the exceptionally strong demand for our products. Rob will now take us through the financial data.\nRobert Simmons: Today, we reported a fourth quarter GAAP net loss of $47 million or $0.93 loss per share. Q4 pretax loss was $62 million. Our weighted average share count for Q4 was $50.6 million and our effective tax rate was 24%. First revenue, total Q4 revenue of $681 million is down 14% sequentially from Q3 2022 and down 12% from Q4 2021. Q4 revenue breaks down with contract revenue down 14% from Q3 and down 11% from Q4 2021. Prorate revenue was $81 million in Q4, down 15% from Q3 and down 26% from Q4 2021. Leasing and other revenue is up 3% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. These GAAP results include the effect of an increase of $69 million of deferred revenue this quarter compared to $13 million released in Q3 and $23 million that was released in Q4 2021. As of the end of Q4, we have $125 million of cumulative deferred revenue that will be recognized in future periods. Let me move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of a little over $1 billion, up slightly from last quarter. Our CapEx during the fourth quarter was $111 million for four new E175 aircraft and other fixed assets. Total 2022 CapEx was $645 million including the purchase of 25 new E175 aircraft compared to $556 million in CapEx for 2021. We ended Q4 with debt of $3.4 billion up from $3.1 billion as of year-end 2021, with this increase driven by the 25 new 175s delivered and financed in 2022. Just a reminder that the only government debt we have on our balance sheet is a total of $201 million in PSP 10 year unsecured no amortization low coupon loans. Let me say a couple of things about liquidity. As of December 31, 2022 our cash position of $1 billion included the effect this quarter of repaying $110 million of aircraft debt. Additionally, we added $78 million of debt financing the four new E175s delivered during the quarter. We also have over $1 billion of unpledged collateral that could be deployed for additional liquidity if ever needed. Additional flexibility comes from the fact that including partner owned aircraft 50% of our fleet in service has no financing obligation. Consistent with our policy and practice, we are not giving any specific EPS guidance at this time, but let me give you a little color. Last quarter, I stated that we expected Q4 earnings to be down from Q3 levels, but still be slightly profitable. Q4 actual results of a pretax loss of $62 million included the following items not factored into last quarter's comment. Number one, $69 million of revenue deferred in Q4 related to the successful amendment of the majority of our flying contracts. Number two, a $36 million impairment charge on 10 CRJ700s that were placed into a held for sale arrangement during the quarter. And number three, $11 million in accelerated lease expense on 21 CRJ aircraft being stored prior to lease expiration. Consistent with last quarter's comments, we currently expect total 2023 results to be down from 2022, but remain modestly profitable before the effect of roughly $60 million per quarter in deferred revenue in 2023. This new deferred revenue expectation in 2023 comes from future variability in the fixed monthly reimbursement component of our newly revised flying contracts, the future shift to a partially variable model for fixed month reimbursements is causing this timing difference for GAAP where cash is received before the revenue is recognized. The revenue deferred will be fully collected in cash in the quarter deferred with performance obligations fully met and the cash is not refundable. Excluding the effect of this estimated $240 million in deferred revenue in 2023, we expect a modest GAAP profit in 2023. We expect this deferred revenue balance will reverse by approximately $10 million to $15 million per quarter in 2024 with $240 million of this balance expected to reverse by the end of 2026. In spite of the GAAP loss expected in 2023, there are seven points would like to call out. The fleet in place today can accommodate large future growth without more capital investment. Wade will give more quantification around this in a minute. We expect CapEx to be down over $400 million year-over-year in 2023. We expect cash at the end of 2023 to still be near $1 billion including expected debt repayment in 2023 of $450 million. We expect debt at the end of 2023 to be below 2019 levels with ongoing annual principal reductions expected to be over $400 million. Our leverage at the end of 2023 could be the lowest in the last five years. Debt net of cash at the end of 2023 could be $500 million lower than at the end of 2019. This CapEx reduction could drive the best free cash flow in the last five years. We believe that our strong cash position and the actions we are taking now to prepare the way over the next couple of years for incremental utilization of our fleet to work through the pilot imbalance affecting the industry and to preserve the optionality of monetizing strong demand opportunities over time will position us well to drive total shareholder returns. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I'll provide a fleet and production status update as well as an update on our charter, prorate and leasing businesses. As we've discussed, we are nearing completion of our strong delivery schedule. We previously announced an agreement with Delta for 16 new E175s. During the quarter, we took delivery of four aircraft for Delta, bringing us to 13 of those 16 aircraft. We anticipate taking delivery of the last three Delta aircraft at the end of 2023 and the middle of 2024. After we receive these aircraft, we will have 87 E175s under long term contracts with Delta. We have an agreement with Alaska to add 11 E175s to our contract, of which we have received 10. We anticipate taking delivery of Alaska -- the last Alaska delivery in the middle of 2025. We currently have 42 aircraft under long term contracts with Alaska. Following delivery of the remaining four currently on order, our E175 fleet will be 240 aircraft. As we discussed last quarter, we came to an agreement with our pilots on a new pay package during the third quarter, which is a significant cost. During the fourth quarter, we came to an agreement with most of our mainline partners on addressing these new costs. We appreciate their support in this additional cost reimbursement. As Rob mentioned, we anticipate differing $60 million per quarter of revenue during 2023. This is primarily related to turning the fixed reimbursement to a variable rate towards the end of some of the contracts. The fixed rate does not turn variable for several more years. The cash will be fully collected. There will be no additional performance obligations after the flight is completed and we will have reconciled the monthly invoices with our partner. We put the emphasis on optimizing economics, cash flow and risk mitigation. We chose cash flow and risk mitigation over a better account, Let me review our production. The fourth quarter block hours were down by approximately 12% as compared to the third quarter. Based on the current schedules we have from our major partners, we anticipate that our block hours will be down approximately 3% to 4% in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. As we look to the full year of 2023, we anticipate that our 2023 block hours will be down 19% as compared to 2022. As we look to 2024 and beyond, we can add approximately 30% more block hours to our ERJ fleet without any additional aircraft. This same number is over 40% for our CRJ fleet and makes each additional block hour very accretive to the model. Given our conversations with our partners, they are very engaged in supporting our efforts to restore production. Let me give a brief update about the status of SkyWest Charter, our new charter business. In June, we purchased a Part 135 aircraft carrier. Shortly thereafter, we applied to the DOT for commuter authority to operate scheduled public charters as permitted by both the DOT and FAA. The commuter authority application primarily is meant to demonstrate the fitness of the carrier in terms of financial, managerial and operational matters among other things. We believe SkyWest Charter is a well-capitalized entity and has some of the best operational leaders in the industry. We have provided the DOT with all the information they requested and are waiting for them to approve and issue the commuter authority. Regardless of the status of our commuter application, we are moving forward with our plans for SkyWest Charter to operate on demand charters under its existing DOT authority once we are operational -- operationally ready. We anticipate that our first revenue flights will be in March or April of 2023. As far as our prorate business, the demand has been extremely strong just like the rest of the industry. We have seen very strong yields and great community support. We will continue to work with the communities on the best way to continue our service. Shifting gears to our leasing business. We have a total of 40 CRJ700s and 900s under long term leases with third parties. This line of business has very good cash flow and strong margin characteristics. Demand for our engine leasing business is returning. We placed a few more engines under third party leases last year and anticipate placing several more engines under leases during 2023. The demand for our engine leasing business will not fully be realized until the flying levels for the regional industry start to rebound. During the quarter, we also made the decision to part 21 CRJ aircraft prior to lease expiration, resulted -- resulting in an accelerated lease expense of $11 million. We also are having success in selling some of our excess CRJ assets. During 2022, we sold over $7 million of assets and we currently have signed letters of intent to sell approximately $20 million of assets. We anticipate these transactions will close during the first and second quarter. We have spent the last several years reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility to ensure we're well positioned. We are committed to continuing our work with each of our major partners to provide creative solutions to the continued exceptional demand for our products.\nRobert Simmons: Okay, operator, we're ready now for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I'm just kind of curious on the pilot front that you said kind of cautiously optimistic. I wonder if you can help provide a little bit more color. It seems like -- I know you said it's going to probably take a couple of years to kind of get back to kind of full operations that you saw before, but just curious if you can provide a little bit more color on the cadence there and what level you think you might exit 2023 with?\nChip Childs: Yes. Thanks, Savi. This is Chip. That's a great question. And when we -- we spent most of our time evaluating like we've done in the past, particularly through 2022, we didn't give any specific numbers, but we can kind of give you how we feel about what's out on the horizon. We are, I would say, growing in optimism, yet not ready to do a wholesale change in our data or models going forward. But I think that there's some things within the tone of our existing pilots. What's happening in the environment out there that we're gaining -- being cautiously optimistic about how we can do it. I think that the big thing is that, 2022 is a big year, we lost a lot of pilots, specifically cabins and it just takes a lot of time to mathematically get back to the math that where we can increase our utilization 30% to 40% compared to where we are today. So I would say, that's about as much as we can say today. I think we're -- certainly when we've got with the new pay package that's helped quite a bit, but until we get some more data closer to summertime. We're not ready to really make a big modification in our models.\nSavanthi Syth: That's helpful color and especially around the timing of when you might have a better idea. Thanks, Chip. And then just on the asset sales, I was curious what type of assets you're kind of taking off the books right now? And just any general kind of thoughts on where you want the fleet to be over the next couple of years? Obviously, the E175 fleet is what it is and will get to 250. But just curious on the CRJ fleet, what are the moves that you'd like to do and how you'd like to size that?\nWade Steel: Yes. Savi, this is Wade. So as we said there, we did have some excess and we do have some excess CRJ assets. They are primarily CRJ200 assets that we are selling right now. There's good demand right now in the market for those assets. They -- people like assets that have been well maintained and have good engine time on them. And so we are able to monetize some of the assets out there. There is some demand also for some of our CRJ700s as well, but primarily what we have sold and what is under letters of intent are CRJ200 assets.\nSavanthi Syth: Got it. All right. I'll get back on the queue. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes. Hey, Good afternoon. Just a couple here. Just the 21 airplanes that were parked, the lease CRJs, what's the model?\nWade Steel: Yes. Mike, this is Wade. There's a combination of assets in there. We have one big lease structure that's remaining. And these are primarily CRJ200 and CRJ700 assets.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. And just given the fact that I always was under the impression that the CRJ200s would be the first to go and the fact that you have some 700s there and then you have another 10 that are available for sale. What's going on? Is it just they're getting pushed out by the better E1 70, E175? Is it CRJ900s? What -- I figured that these would be valuable assets you'd want to hold on to them.\nWade Steel: Yes. The majority of what we are getting -- what we are selling right now are CRJ200s for sure. There are some pockets of some CRJ700s. We -- right before COVID, we purchased some CRJ700s for some extremely good prices and we are able to flip those at good values. And so we are going to be in the marketplace if there are good assets that we can trade where we have some excess CRJ700s, we will look at those and we'll start trading some of those.\nChip Childs: Mike, this is Chip as well. I think it did not get too lost in what's hitting the for sale block we still have a tremendously large base of both CRJ700s and CRJ200s and not only a large base of it, but a large buffer of aircraft we can still fly before we get to these. So I think from our perspective, as we manage the assets, these are assets that I think it\u2019s good for us to put in a for sale scenario because we don't see that we have so many still leftover that we can utilize over the next two to three years. I think it's just smart asset management to kind of see what other people can do with this stuff and the response has been pretty good. So it's good cash flow as well, particularly if we don't likely think we're going to get back to flying them many times soon.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more before I get back in the queue. Just to talk about the deferred, so it's $240 million deferred, right? $60 million per quarter, and then it releases $10 million to $15 million, so let's call it $10 million, that's your two years 2024, 2025 or 2025, 2026. Just trying to think. I guess it maybe [indiscernible] slower rate?\nRobert Simmons: Yes. Mike, let me help you with that, Mike. So yes, for 2023 we're expecting a deferred -- revenue deferred of about $240 million that's the $60 million per quarter. Over the years 2024 through 2026, we expect $240 million to be reversed.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. What about -- so we had $69 million in the fourth quarter, which I think, Rob, you said that brought the previous deferred amount up to $125 million, does that also bleed out? So does that -- that no longer builds. Right? Does that offset the $240 million. I'm just trying to figure that other component there?\nRobert Simmons: Yes. So the $125 million is the ending deferred balance as of the end of year. 2023, we're saying that there's going to be another incremental approximately $240 million. And then starting in 2024, it starts to reverse and bleed off. [Multiple Speakers]\nMichael Linenberg: It\u2019s $10 million to $15 million over, you know, 36 months instead of 24 months, that makes sense. Okay. Now I have that -- I have that figured out. That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dwayne Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDwayne Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Rather than the accounting treatment, can you just expand a little bit on why this variable versus fixed component of your contracts makes sense. What drives a higher reimbursement versus a lower reimbursement in the future or I guess revenue rec in the future?\nWade Steel: Yes, this is Wade. So a great question. So what we tried to do in all these agreements with our partners. We tried to optimize cash flow and risk mitigation, right? And so what we focused on was the next several years, there's not really much of a change, but as we get into some of the back end of some of these contracts, some of the fixed rates will turn more variable, right? And at that point in time there is some anticipation that the utilization will be back to normal. So really the way the economics are working on this, the cash flow is going to be good and reimburses for the costs that we're incurring now. But there is some anticipation that the utilization will go up in the future. And just the shape of the recovery is really bringing in the revenue that's how the block hours -- it is based on the block hours that we fly is how the revenue gets brought back in.\nDwayne Pfennigwerth: Okay. So effectively removing minimums towards the back end of the contract, but the expectation that you're going to well exceed those minimums at some point down the road.\nWade Steel: Yes. Yes, you got it.\nDwayne Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then on the down 19% on block hours next year, can you just speak a little bit, is that kind of base case or is that conservatism? Is this your upper limit? Is that what your staff to support? Or are there kind of staffing events that could unfold over the course of the year that could take -- that could give you a higher level than that down 2019?\nChip Childs: Yes. So I would say that 19% is a very good predictor of where we think attrition is going to be combined with development of cabins in 2023. If the attrition levels, like I said earlier, go to last year's attrition levels, then it would be less than 19%. If we gain some -- like I said, we're going to have to see how this plays out closer to summer, but we're optimistic of what the ratios are today. And if those continue to hold, which I don't know that they're going to hold perfectly, then there could be some upside of that 19% by the end of the year. But I think the factor is when we're sitting here in January and February, these are not great predictive, these were lower than last year -- these were lower than last year's January and February by a fair amount, but we want to see what's happening in the springtime going in through summer and see what that is. But again, look, the mood of pilots, the horizon of what we can kind of see out there. It feels a lot different this year than last year, but we're not ready to do a wholesale model and that's kind of how we got to the 19% but there's -- it's probably a number that we're not going to hit one way or the other. We just don't know which way perfectly how that's going to go until we get closer to summer.\nDwayne Pfennigwerth: All very fair. Thanks for the thoughts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time. So just two questions. One, can you actually be more specific on attrition? What was attrition last year and what does it look like currently?\nChip Childs: Yes, Helane, this is Chip. I'm sorry, I can't, those are kind of some things that we've decided to make sure that we keep kind of with us and our partners and we have some confidence, we have relative to a lot of our contract. But I will say that, like I indicated to Dwayne earlier, so far, December, January and February are less than they were last year. And when we have the pay package that we have this year, we see tremendous demand for folks to come to SkyWest. And there's a lot of things we hear anecdotally about pilots that have left and want to come back, a lot of pilots that have had commitments to leave and turn them down and stay. So look, the only thing that we can say is that attrition is not quite as bad as it was last year and we're growing in some optimism. But again, we have to see more on the meaty side of what happens this spring or before summer before we can really make a wholesale model assessment.\nHelane Becker: Great. That's really fair. Thanks. And then just for my follow-up question. So when you negotiated these contracts with your pilots, did you get input from your partners or I mean, obviously, they had to sign off that they were okay with you raising pay as much as you did and willing to reimburse some portion of it. So when you are having those conversation, was there a lot of pushback, where they thinking maybe they would reduce their reliance on your aircraft and move to other operators, how did that go?\nChip Childs: Now, this is Chip again, you're going to take us through a dark period of our lives, honestly.\nHelane Becker: Oh my God, I'm sorry.\nChip Childs: I think that, to go back to what we do at SkyWest, and that is to be able to evolve, take care of our people and take care of our partners is I think what SkyWest has done better than anybody else in the regional industry for the last 50 years. So admittingly, I will say that it is a very stressful time, I think that as you go through -- and it's not just pilots, we've had conversation with all of our work groups. This was one of the first ones where we certainly have to coordinate with some of our partners, some of our partners quite candidly, started this process. I mean we were down the road with some things and we had one of the wholly owned carriers do some things that caused us to completely rethink it. So to the extent that it's a fluid market relative to what happened -- what happened in 2022 with regional pay was an understatement. Did we have to commit to the pay before we got the complete commitment from our partners? Yeah, we did because that's the way labor negotiations work and I think it's hats off to the team of us -- we had to bridge some of the gaps to connect with what's best for our people and what's best for our partners and I'll go back and say, what I said in my script before. Candidly, our operational credibility and the quality of team that we have here at SkyWest from all of our 14,000 professionals, I can tell you it comes down to the credibility that we have with our partners, it comes down with a very efficient ability to work with our work groups and it comes down to how stable and solid an operation that we've had throughout our history and when you combine all those long-term investments and long-term approaches, it makes a difficult situation a lot easier and we're happy -- we're really happy about the outcome. And it has. I would say the desired effect for all the parties involved\nHelane Becker: That's very helpful, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien, with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey gentlemen, good afternoon. Great to see you guys again this quarter. Maybe, my first one's for Rob. Can you just help us think about some of the puts and takes on costs. Underlying the commentary on roughly breakeven ex deferred revenue for this year, should we think about the fourth quarter being a good run rate for salaries and benefits given has the full quarter of the new pilot agreement. And then I know maintenance has been a bit lumpy last couple of years, how do you think about that trending forward just to touch on a couple of the large line items. Thanks.\nRobert Simmons: Yeah, I mean obviously if you look at each of the line items, we were up a little bit and labor in Q4, where the pilots deal was struck in Q3 and some of these reimbursements covered part of the quarter. So I mean Q4 was a little bit of a noisy quarter, obviously, with impairment the lease acceleration and the deferred revenue. But all in all, the net -- the net sort of operating results of the company, we were pleased with.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, got it. Understood. And then great news on getting these contract amendment done and being able to pass through a portion of the higher pilot wage rates, can you just help us think like really high level about how much of the pilot costs we passed through? And then on the portion that's not being passed through today, how far are we out from negotiations on those contracts. I know we're approaching like the 10 or 12-year mark the first E175 delivery. So maybe some of it is coming up. Thanks again.\nWade Steel: Yeah, this is wade. So a great question. So as far as the pilot reimbursement as we said, we worked with each of our major partners, our four major partners, most of them have reimbursed us there. We're still working with one of the partners on the additional reimbursement. So we are well above 60%, 70% right now covered where we're at. So we feel pretty good about where we're at. We're working with the other partners going forward -- on the other partner going forward to get the additional cost reimbursements.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great. I need to sneak one more in on the charter business, there's been an update. Can you just remind us on about how many planes are you thinking that this business ultimately comprises of or maybe you haven't shared that before. Just wondering like to think about pricing it? And then how is hiring going there on the pilot front, couple of months out, I think you can tap into some additional pilot pool versus like your traditional in the main business. So any additional color will be great. Thank you again for the time.\nChip Childs: Chip this is. Cathy, welcome back. It's great to have you back, hope everything is well with your family. Just going back to that charter side, I think that if you look at the scope that we could make this, I would suggest you look at a couple of numbers in the fleet. I think we have about 120 CRJ200s available that we could put into Charter maximum for now. I think that if you look at what our historical prorate model was like back in 2019, we had about 50 CRJ200s within a 50-seat model that would work within our prorate operation. And then I think if you pay for it from there, I think that demand since 2019 has become significantly stronger. So I think that hopefully, gives you a couple of benchmark to think about, I can't tell you exactly where we're going to be, certainly, as we discussed about Charter, we will be flying on-demand charter flights starting in March, we anticipate that the demand for non-scheduled service chart on-demand charter business model is extremely strong right now as well. So there's a lot of options here. And then you get back to what we've what we've talked about, the pilot situation is extremely good for an operation like this mostly because of -- it's a new seniority list. I don't know that we're going to operate this significantly differently with a different circumstance pilots and what we do with SkyWest but there certainly is some different availability and some compelling reasons to do some things within a separate certificate and a separate seniority list just because it seems like these days specific with pilots, people want to get on a new seniority list and be an early participant in that. I think that's why we lost a lot of pilots this last year because the seniority list throughout the country opened up and that's what we're doing here. And so, in a nutshell, the pilot demand to come to the charter operation is extremely good, not just for new first officer entrants, but also for direct entry captain is extremely good. So look, we're going to be patient. We're going to make sure we do it right as we usually do and we're going to continue to work forward and give probably another good update after we start to operating some revenue flights in the May timeframe when we call you again, and hopefully have some more visibility on it. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of -- a little bit of an idea high level of what some of the opportunities and capacity may be.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great. Thanks so much for the time everyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Just first one just on the -- to follow up on Cathy's question, just on the charter how -- is that the significant portion of the breakeven earnings outlook or are you just not really including it until you have a better idea of how that ramps up?\nWade Steel: Yes, Savi. This is Wade. So for 2023, we do not anticipate significant profitability as we are growing that entity. We are going to be doing maintenance events to get airplanes ready, training pilots and so that is not a major driver in the overall breakeven for our for SkyWest Inc.\nSavanthi Syth: Got it. And then if I just might ask a bit of a slightly longer-term question, just based on the kind of the revised contracts that you've gotten, the fact that you have more E175s than you had in 2019, I was just wondering if you can kind of compare it to your level of profitability in 2019 and kind of once we get back to -- if you're able to kind of fully utilize your fleet, could you just talk about like maybe the things that are positive or negative versus your 2019 earnings? Really like what's going to be better than and what's going to be maybe a little not-so-great?\nChip Childs: Yeah, I think -- Savi, this is Chip, just real quick, I think there is some comparability on the 175 fleet on a unit basis once we get the utilization levels that we want, that could be very comparable from a profitability perspective. I think that we continue to have -- we continue to manage the fleet in a way that I think is going to be very good from a cost perspective, and I think, again, we just -- on the CRJ fleet we have a 30% gap we got to overcome, which is purely non capital investment very accretive block hours that we just have to start to get to the point where we can fly. So I don't doubt that that is going to be that different from 2019. The other element relative to what else was contributing to that as the CRJ fleet, particularly on the prorate side as well. Obviously we pulled out a significant amount of prorate relative to what's happened in 2022. I will be very clear on the call that that was higher margin than what our contract margins were, despite with some entities in the United States think that we're not making money in small towns and are pulling out, that's absolutely false. These flying prorate an essential air service was very good profitability. So to the extent that we compare where we were in 2019, I would have to say, it depends on what we can do relative to the non-ERJ and dual class CRJ fleet relative to Charter and/or other essential air service models. Now, the flip side of that also Savi, and you don't hear the big guys talking much about this, so we will certainly talk about it, is the fact that throughout the pandemic since 2019, small city demand has -- travel has just exploded. We get a lot of calls. It's not us calling somebody else, we get a tremendous amount of calls from local cities and states and everywhere that are also nonessential service flying, wanting us to find ways to serve their cities. So certainly the deurbanization throughout the pandemic has gone -- put demand back in our favor, even in a pre-2019 level. So from our perspective, like I say, we've got a great balance sheet, we've got great assets. We're just going to continue to be patient and deliberate about taking care of our people in a way in which we can get our utilization on our fleet back up and then be more strategic about what we can do with partners and additional aircraft or shifting some of that stuff around later, but we got a lot of -- we got a lot of runway left to get utilization -- accretive utilization back up before we get to that time. So hopefully that's a helpful perspective.\nSavanthi Syth: That is. Thanks. Chip\nOperator: Our final question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Yeah, hey, I just actually two here. Thanks for giving me the follow-up. I just want to go back to the fact that you haven't been able to -- you kind of closed deals with, I guess you said the majority of your partners. I don't know if that's one or two, you said 60% to 70% covered, Chip, is there anything that we should read into that or is it just timing that it just takes time to do each of these deals or is there some read through here?\nChip Childs: I think I think mostly just timing, honestly, Michael, I think that we continue to have great dialog with all of our partners. That's the fun part about our job is collaborating and finding ways that works to do business with both of us or all of us, all four of us and some are more aggressive than others and some are more patients than others, and I don't think there's anything to be read into it. I think if there is we will probably be updating in the next quarter or the quarter after. But we're optimistic that they're all thinking of the same lines, the fact that we can offer incredibly good product that is predictable and reliable, and stable and we try to do all we can to make their lives easy and they I think recognize that very clearly. And as we work toward long-term sustainability, I think that we're very optimistic about all of our partnerships.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, that's great. And then just my second. Thanks for giving us kind of a sense of your capacity to grow without adding shells. I think you mentioned by 2024, that you could add 30% block hour increase on the ERJ fleet without adding any additional shells and 40% on the CRJs, you only have a few airplanes coming over the next few years, is the right way to think about it that you're really not planning to take delivery of anything beyond what you have order for the next several years. Is that how we should think about like -- is that the planning for the next 2 to 3 years, it's just a few units, it's all about stabilization\nChip Childs: Yeah, this is Chip again. I would agree with that Michael, only from the perspective that it's going to take a lot to get that utilization back. I would reiterate, we are having conversations with manufacturers and certainly creative conversations about long-term ESG and fleets and so there's a lot of conversations about fleet. There's a lot of that conversation with our partners, but there's just too much opportunity until we close off that gap of that utilization before we get serious about it. The other thing is, I mean, you've got a couple of other things running against this. You've got higher interest rates, airplanes are expensive. And so from our perspective, it's not that we're not looking down the road of continuing to grow the fleet. It's more like, let's be focused on making sure we get the accretion without unnecessary investment first and then which by today if we're talking the timeframe that we've talked about over the last little bit. We should we need to pay attention to adding additional fleet because it takes a while to make aircraft. So I think it's rather fluid and we'll keep you up to speed in the upcoming quarters about that, but we haven't put the conversation on ice, we're continuing the conversation. We just, it's more important to get the utilization up.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. Thanks, Chip. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to CEO Mr. Chip Childs thanks\nChip Childs : Thanks, Devin. We appreciate your help with the call today. It's been a -- 2022 is a very exciting and eventful year. I will reiterate what said in the script and throughout the call, I think that we're in a fantastic position to continue to capitalize on what SkyWest is about, what things we have going for us and we're going to continue to be disciplined and work towards making sure that we take care of all the stakeholders at SkyWest. Again, one more thanks out to the amazing people at SkyWest and all the work that they do every single day to provide this reliability and we look forward to talking to next quarter. Thank you."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-10-27 22:51:02", "content": "Operator: Okay. Good afternoon. My name is Emma and I will be your conference operator today.

Demand for SkyWest product during the third quarter remained exceptionally high, with our main constraint being our crew imbalance. Despite the challenge to production inhibiting our ability to fully monetize this demand, we reported a pretax income of $57 million and a net income of $48 million.  Operationally, our teams delivered outstanding performance to accomplish 99.9% adjusted completion and to be a top three on-time performer on the DoT's list for several months of the year.  I want to thank our people for their teamwork and efforts to deliver strong operating performance.  We received nine E175s during the third quarter and we received four more this year. We've modified some timelines on future deliveries to better manage resources and continue to expect a total of 240 E175s planned in service once our current orders are complete.  Our refleeting continues to be a priority in our long-term strategy. During the quarter, 80% of our block hours were flown utilizing our dual class fleet.  We were able to secure a new pilot agreement during the quarter, including large pay increases and enhancements for our pilots. This four year agreement is a significant investment in our pilots and became effective in mid-September. While it is still early, we expect the agreement to help manage attrition and encourage career progression into the left seat. We're proud of our ability to work directly with our people to provide more stable and rewarding long term pilot careers here at SkyWest, as well as career opportunities with a choice of our four major partners. We are uniquely positioned to provide more stability, opportunity and options for pilots than any other regional carrier.  We remain fortunate to continue attracting a high level of talent and have built our new hire pilot classes well into 2023. We have a large number of upgrades scheduled over the next few months to help address our captain imbalance and continue to expect and plan for ongoing high demand for pilots. We have long been investing in tuition reimbursements incentives and various other partnerships and methods to reduce barriers to entry and clear the path to help increase equality in the pilot profession.  While these strategies are producing results and demand for our product has never been stronger, we continue to expect that the timing required for training and upgrades will likely constraint production into late 2023 to early 2024.  We continue to work with our people to aggressively manage this challenge. And we believe there's a solid upside potential as we mitigate attrition and rebalance our crew staffing.  We continued making progress on operationalizing our SkyWest Charter entity during the third quarter. As we shared earlier this year, we plan to enter this strong business with standard on-demand charter service as well as scheduled charter service under additional commuter authority, all within existing regulations and requirements.  We've been working with the Department of Transportation on our commuter authorization and we appreciate the strong support from many communities and airports who are very interested in the service.  The DoT process is essentially a fitness review of the entity and we believe SkyWest Charter exceeded all measures of fitness regarding commuter authority. We undoubtedly have the asset base, high standards and expertise to execute this operation well and hold SkyWest Charter to exceptionally high standards of safety and service. We're making steady progress and plan to begin on-demand charter service as early as Q1 2023.  We we're moving a number of strategic pieces into place to ensure we are well positioned for 2024. First, we anticipate that, as we initiate our new pilot agreement, we will stabilize attrition and our crew balance. Second, we're in productive conversations with our partners regarding agreements to align with these labor investments. Finally, within our operating entities, we continue to work through our fleet optimization at SkyWest Airlines and are on track to operationalize SkyWest Charter by year-end.  Our execution of these initiatives will help ensure we're best positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace. Although we continue to expect the recovery to remain choppy as we've worked through some headwinds, particularly over the next year, we remain aggressive and deliberate in the steps we're taking to ensure we are well positioned for 2024 and beyond.  Rob will now take us through the financial data.\nRobert Simmons : Today, we reported third quarter GAAP net income of $48 million or $0.96 diluted earnings per share. Q3 pretax income was $57 million. Our diluted share count for Q3 was 50.6 million and our effective tax rate was 15%, which included a $7 million benefit from the release of an uncertain tax position liability.  First revenue. Total Q3 revenue of $789 million is down 1% sequentially from Q2 2022 and up 6% from Q3 2021. Q3 revenue breaks down with contract revenue down 2% from Q2 and at 13% from Q3 2021. Prorate revenue was $95 million in Q3, flat with Q2 and down 26% from Q3 2021. Leasing and other revenue was up 2% sequentially and year-over-year.  These GAAP results include the effect of a release of $13 million of deferred revenue this quarter compared to $16 million released in Q2 and $19 million that was released in Q3 2021. As of the end of Q3, we had $55 million of cumulative deferred revenue that will be recognized in future periods.  Let me move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $1 billion, up from $979 million last quarter. Our CapEx during the third quarter was $224 million for nine new E175 aircraft and other fixed assets. Total 2022 CapEx is expected to be a little under $700 million, including the purchase of 25 new E175 aircraft compared to $556 million in CapEx for 2021.  We ended Q3 with debt of $3.4 billion, up from $3.1 billion as of year-end 2021. Just a reminder that the only government debt we have on our balance sheet is a total of $201 million in PSP, ten-year, unsecured, no amortization, low coupon loans.  Let me say a couple of things about liquidity. As of September 30, 2022, our cash position of $1 billion included the effect this quarter of repaying $100 million of aircraft debt and adding $40 million in engine financing. Additionally, we added $182 million of debt, financing the nine new E175s delivered during Q3. We also have over $1 billion of unpledged collateral that could be deployed for additional liquidity if ever needed.  Additional flexibility comes from the fact that, including partner-owned aircraft, 50% of our fleet in service has no financing obligation.  Consistent with our policy and practice, we are not giving any specific EPS guidance at this time. But let me give you a little directional color. We expect Q4 earnings to be down from Q3 levels, but still be slightly profitable. Q1 2023 may look seasonally similar to Q4 2022 as usual. We expect total 2023 earnings to be down significantly from 2022, but remain modestly profitable as we continue to put the pieces together for a successful 2024 and beyond.  In spite of only modest profits expected in 2023, there are six notable expectations for 2023 that I would like to call out. Number one, we expect CapEx to be down over $400 million year-over-year in 2023. Number two, this CapEx reduction could drive the best free cash flow in the last five years. Number three, we expect cash at the end of 2023 to still be near $1 billion. Number four, we expect debt at the end of 2023 to be below 2019 levels. Number five, our end of 2023 leverage could be the lowest in the last five years. And number six, debt net of cash could be $400 million lower than at the end of 2019.  We believe that the actions we're taking now to prepare the way over the next year or so for incremental utilization of our fleet, to work through the pilot imbalance affecting the industry and to preserve the optionality of monetizing strong demand opportunities over time will position us well for a successful 2024 and beyond. Wade?\nWade Steel : Thank you, Rob. I'll provide a fleet and production status update as well as an update on our charter, prorate and leasing businesses. As we've discussed, we are nearing completion of our strong delivery schedule this year. We previously announced an agreement with delta for 16 new E175s to replace 16 older SkyWest CRJ900 aircraft. During the quarter, we took delivery of seven aircraft for Delta, bringing us to 9 of those 16 aircraft. We anticipate taking delivery of four E175s during the fourth quarter.  We also came to an agreement with Embraer and Delta to extend the timeline of our last three Delta deliveries until the end of 2023 and the middle of 2024 as we work to resolve our captain imbalance. After we receive these aircraft, we will have 87 E175s under long-term contracts with Delta.  We have an agreement with Alaska to add 11 E175s to our contract, of which we have received 10 this year. We came to an agreement with Alaska and Embraer to extend the delivery of the last E175 until the middle of 2025. We currently have 42 aircraft under long term contracts with Alaska. Following delivery of the remaining eight currently on order, our E175 fleet will be 240 aircraft.  As Chip discussed, during the quarter, we came to an agreement with our pilots on a new pay package. The cost of the package is significant. As you can imagine, we have been working with our major partners on addressing these new costs. We anticipate that we will have come to an agreement with the majority of our partners on reimbursement of the new pilot rates prior to year-end.  Let me review our current 2022 production. Based on the current schedules we have from our major partners for the fourth quarter, we anticipate that our block hours will be down by approximately 13% to 14% in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. As we look to 2023, we anticipate that our 2023 block hours will be down by 20% as compared to 2022.  Let me give a brief update about the status of SkyWest Charter. In June, we purchased a Part 135 air carrier. Shortly thereafter, we applied to the DoT for commuter authority to operate scheduled public charters as permitted by both DoT and FAA. The commuter authority application primarily is meant to demonstrate the fitness of the carrier in terms of financial, managerial and operational matters.  We believe SkyWest Charter is a well-capitalized entity and has some of the best operational leaders in the industry. We have provided the DoT with all the information they requested and are waiting for them to approve and issue the commuter authority.  Regardless of the status of our commuter authority, we are moving forward with our plans for SkyWest Charter to operate on-demand charters under its existing DoT authority once we are operationally ready.  As far as our prorate business, the demand has been extremely strong. Just like the rest of the industry, we have seen very strong yields and great community support. We will continue to work with the communities on the best way to continue our service.  Shifting gears to our leasing business. We have a total of 40 CRJ700s and 900s under long-term leases with third parties. This line of business has very good cash flow and strong margin characteristics.  Demand for our engine leasing business is returning, and we have placed a few more engines under third-party leases during the year and anticipate placing several more engines under leases during 2023. Demand for our engine leasing business will not fully be realized until flying levels for the regional industry start to rebound.  We have spent the last several years reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility to ensure we're well positioned. The flexibility will continue to be a differentiator for us and we are committed to continuing our work with each of the major partners to provide creative solutions for our products.  Okay. Emma, we're ready for the Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Wade, I just want to go back on the numbers. So if I heard you right, it looks like there's eight E175s left to deliver. So, four in the fourth quarter. And then I guess four over the next, I guess, two, three years? What, 2023, 2024, 2025? Is that currently what's on the books? \nWade Steel: This is Wade. So, you're right, we have eight E175s left to deliver. Four will be in the fourth quarter. Two will be in 2023. One in 2024 and one in 2025.\nMichael Linenberg: When I think about the block hour total that you gave us for 2023 down 20%, assuming no additional deliveries, it seems like that's probably a pretty good steady state for the next few years. Is that fair? There's probably a few tweaks here and there. For the main operation, not the charter piece.\nWade Steel: Mike, this is Wade again. So, the 20%, there's definitely \u2013 in 2024 and 2025, as we look out, there are opportunities to increase the utilization of our current fleets and get back to higher levels of block hours. \nMichael Linenberg: And you also made the comment that this pilot \u2013 I guess, an agreement with your major partners about higher labor costs, you'll get something by the end of this year, and so that will start flowing through the P&L in 2023. And just based on Rob's sort of characterization of your earnings trajectory for next year, which is low, how much of the labor cost increase do you think you will be able to recapture through the negotiations with your four partners? Is it good chunk of it? Is it a small piece of it? Because the earnings depression next year may have a lot to do with training and transition and a slowing of growth, and it sounds like an underutilization of the current fleet. I'm trying to sort of parse out what are the pain points that take down profitability next year. And I'm trying to figure out how much of it is just labor and being able to pass on those higher costs. I realize it's a multi-pronged question. It will be my last question. So however you and Rob want to answer it, maybe even Chip too. \nChip Childs: Mike, this is Chip. It's an exceptional question. A couple of layers there. But I think that your overall thinking is right. Given the circumstances for 2023, I will start by saying that our major partners are very engaged in regional pilots. They're very engaged in making sure that stability is paramount that we achieve in 2023. And yet, at the same time, making sure that they are the ones that are being able to provide exceptional careers for the pilots at SkyWest that want to move on.  Relative to the profitability conversation, you're exactly right. There's some pain points relative to training and infrastructure that we're going to work hard on, given the fact that the block hours are coming down. We're very, very focused on the dual class fleet, particularly the 175s. But I will say that, after 2023, as you stabilize the labor force that there's tremendous non capital upside, just an increased utilization back to getting the 175 fleet and the other CRJ dual class fleet back up into the high utilization numbers that we're accustomed to seeing back pre-pandemic.  That also being said, back with our partners, we fundamentally \u2013 our conversation with them are extremely positive. We have the most in-demand pilot group there is, mostly because of our ability to recruit, our ability to train, and they're just exceptional professionals. So, we want to make sure that we're taking care of them and their career needs that they want. But at the same time, we used to be a carrier that would say we can't afford to pay the rates that the majors or the discount carriers can pay. And right now, we don't have to have that argument.  Our objective is to be a destination airline. Also have our folks flow to our partners. And we're going to continue in the upcoming months to make sure that part of the stabilizing what we want to do is we're collaborating with both our pilots and our major carriers and closing that gap. But we're confident that there's still a tremendous amount of infrastructure and training that we have to get behind us in 2023. But our partners are deeply engaged in making sure that they're participating in these challenges.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. \nSavanthi Syth: If I might pick up and ask a follow-up question to Mike's last one here. It's a bit of a two part. Clearly, the industry is changing a little bit here somewhat structurally by being, as you say, the victim of being the destination airline for pilots. I wonder if you could talk about like, one, what that means for your kind of value proposition to majors, if that changes at all, and the type of markets that you can serve?  And then two, I was curious, because it seems like you go from losing pilots to low cost carriers and ultra-low cost carriers to not doing that, but then on the other side, you're going to start have to compete with low cost and ultra-low cost carriers in sourcing pilots directly because it seems like a lot of the ULCCs at least are going and kind of building relationships with flight schools and colleges and starting their own programs. So there might be some kind of competition on the front end. I wonder if you could talk about those two dynamics.\nChip Childs: Savi, those are two great questions as well. On your first one relative to the value proposition of SkyWest, look, we just barely passed pilot package about a month ago. We're evaluating the impact on attrition. So far, the recent \u2013 we thought it would take six weeks to two months before you really saw the impact on it. And we're already seeing some good benefits, particularly on the captain side. And I think from our perspective, that's the first step.  We're going to execute some additional steps here internally at SkyWest to do some things with pilots to make sure were that they understand what their value. All of our employees are valuable. But it's been an interesting dynamic over the past several years at SkyWest. And the evolution, where we are today is, we have a conversation with many of our senior pilots and senior employees that honestly have helped be the backbone of the operation. And they've given us good reasons of why we should be a destination airline.  To your second point, destination airline with tremendous opportunities if they want to go to our major partners, and there'll be more programs, I believe, that will enhance those vertical pathways that will be a benefit to all of us, particularly our pilots.  Second of all, relative to the sourcing of that, our sourcing is extraordinarily strong right now. We have seen that some of the low cost carriers may go directly to schools. And to be candid, given where we are with the imbalance of our pilots, I think that we would certainly applaud and understand wherever you want to be a destination pilot to. The pathway to get there is probably shorter than ever. And if you want to go fly for a discount carrier, you may have the opportunity to do it right out of school. We're not afraid, particularly with this pay package, in competing with that approach, combined with the fact that you still have optionality to go to one of the four best airlines in the world.  So I still fundamentally believe that if it came down to a sourcing issue from schools and the pipeline, we're very comfortable with what's happening with schools and the pipeline. It's as robust as we've ever seen it.  That having been said, we still fundamentally believe that \u2013 we applaud on a shorter pathway to the destination where pilots want to go. But we know we still will be the most promising option for pilots as we continue to work to our culture and become a destination airline as well as be able to have the option to go to the four best airlines in the world. \nSavanthi Syth: I suspect that SkyWest probably stands out amongst the regionals on that front, too. If I might, just on the block hour production kind of commentary, which is super helpful, when do you see kind of the Q-over-Q levels kind of stabilizing within that outlook? I know there's probably still \u2013 it maybe can come in better if attritions are better or maybe gets a little moved around. But when do things stabilize on the block hour production front because I'm guessing \u2013 go ahead.\nWade Steel: Sorry, go ahead.\nSavanthi Syth: That was my question, Wade.\nWade Steel: Savi, this is Wade. So when we start to stabilize, we think 2023 is still going to be a little choppy. We think we'll start to see the stabilization starting in 2024. And so, that's how our models are built right now. And that's how we're looking at it. And so, we look towards 2024 to see that.\nSavanthi Syth: So, you've seen kind of Q-over-Q declines into the fourth quarter.\nWade Steel: When you look at a little bit, Q4, there's definitely \u2013 I gave 13% to 14% decrease between Q3 and Q4. Q1, we start to find a little bit of stability. And there may be some small decreases as you go along throughout the year. And some of it depends on operationalizing Charter and some other things that are out there. But that's what we see right now.\nChip Childs: Savi, this is Chip. I would add that the numbers that we're referring to is basically \u2013 I don't want to get too detailed on the numbers. But we're evaluating our numbers based upon current trends with modest impact from the pay package on attrition. We do see some upside in this. At the same time, there's a lot of variables. This crew imbalance is a situation where we'd love to see some long term data that shows some things, but there are some things that could have a relatively strong impact on it. I'm not saying that we're pessimistic in our approach, but I would say we're pretty conservative in our approach, and there are various other factors that could have an impact. There could be an impending recession that is always good for regionals and staffing and those types of items that could happen.  But at this point, we're not comfortable giving any more long term feedback and just providing some very, what we think is, solid, conservative estimates of what's going to happen relative to block hours in the future.  But if it does change, we do have four partners that would gobble up block hours like crazy, that's for sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dwayne Pfennigwerth with Evercore. \nDwayne Pfennigwerth: Just with respect to your down 20%, you guys have been pretty good at starting with a conservative view and then maybe ratcheting it higher. So I wonder how confident you are in that down 20%? Outside of industry factors, is it just a compensation consideration where maybe that down 20% could be something better, something closer to flat?  And then, if you're down 20%, how would you mark the regional industry broadly? Would it be down 30%, down 40%, down 50%? How would you mark your share within that down 20%?\nChip Childs: Those are good questions, Dwayne. I think down 20%, for us, is something that we're strategically very well prepared for. But we're also very well prepared for upside. Upside is easy. Down 20% means we still have a tremendous amount of pilots and flight attendant and mechanic training. It does require some infrastructure changes within the organization. And those types of things is what we're mostly focused on. And I think, to your point, I think we have been pretty good about being conservative and planning for with some good operational upside.  So, look, I think that that's what we know today. Like I said, it's hard to predict what would happen. I would say, if I was betting over under, I'd probably bet a little bit over. But at the same time, when you take a look at the regional and where the rest of the regional world is going to be if we're down 20, I couldn't necessarily speak to it because I don't know exactly what their specific crew imbalance challenges are compared to ours.  I know as much as we \u2013 and this is probably \u2013 not a bragging point, but an interesting point. I know that through the reductions over the past two years and coming out of the pandemic, just naturally, we have gained a tremendous amount of market share in the regional industry. And given the fact that we've gained a tremendous amount of market share in the regional industry, and when we can rebound if we have the capital, aircraft, and things to be able to respond, we could respond very, very quickly.  But I really couldn't speak to the rest of the industry. I'm assuming that it's probably \u2013 I'm not hoping for anyone to have it tougher than we are. But I think that we typically do weather these things better than the others do. \nDwayne Pfennigwerth: If it's possible, can we put some numbers to the pilots that you'll need to hit that down 20%? Like, what would be the assumption on attrition from here? And what would be the assumption on hiring from here? And where would you expect to get those folks from? You probably have a pretty thoughtful view into the pipeline. And is this going to be dependent upon getting pilots from other airlines? Or do you feel like there's enough just sort of organic de novo pilots in the pipeline to kind of hit that down 20%? \nChip Childs: Dwayne, I would say this. I would say that our assumptions are consistent, attrition assumptions of what we've seen so far this year, with organic timing and patience with upgrades. We don't have to go get predatorial with other pilots for the numbers that we've talked about.  I think we've said even on the last call, when you don't hire pilots until 2021 and it roughly takes two years to get a lot of your FOs into an upgradable captain scenario, that's when it starts to \u2013 given various levels of attrition, that's when it starts to turn around in 2023 organically.  So, by and large, our assumption is relatively consistent, maybe a little more optimistic attrition than what we've seen in the past, given our pay package, with time and patience to get the captains into an upgradable position organically, not dependent upon hiring from outside sources.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. \nSavanthi Syth: Can you talk a little bit about prorate? That's hung up well. Any thoughts on how that kind of progresses here in the fourth quarter and as you look into 2023 because the demand and the fares are there?\nWade Steel: This is Wade. So, prorate, I said in my script, it's been extremely strong. Just like the rest of the industry, we've seen very good yields. A lot of these communities that we have prorates in, it's small communities. The communities are extremely, extremely supportive of SkyWest and what we're trying to do from both SkyWest Airlines and SkyWest Charter. There's just tremendous support there.  I believe what we will be able to do is continue to serve the vast majority of the communities that we have today. And one of the entities that will be is SkyWest, right? That is our goal. And we're going to continue to do that. And we're going to work with the communities on what that service looks like and how we'll do it and under what agreements. But we're still very optimistic about prorate, the yields and the flying has been very good for us.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to Chip Childs.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Emma. Appreciate it. We really appreciate everybody's interest in SkyWest. Thank you for listening to the data points that we have. And for joining us. Again, I wanted to thank all of our professionals here at SkyWest. They've just done outstanding work. Our operational performance is leading the industry and we continue to have just an outstanding product that is safe, reliable and among the top in the industry as far as levels of service. And I appreciate all of our people for the work that they've done.  With that, we will circle back at the end of the next quarter to do the year-end summary and we appreciate your interest. Thank you. \nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.

SkyWest celebrates 50 years in 2022 commemorating our first departure in June of 1972. With the past five decades, SkyWest has weathered many storms it continues to adapt and evolve to lead the regional industry. That\u2019s a testament to our more than 14,000 people who are truly unparalleled. We wouldn\u2019t be where we are today without the outstanding work of our people and I\u2019m humbled and grateful that I get to work alongside them. Demand for SkyWest product during the second quarter remain exceptionally high with our main constraint being crew imbalance as we discussed last quarter. We made good headway during the quarter to realign our schedules and resources, producing results that were slightly better than we anticipated. We reported pre-tax income of 73 million and net income of 54 million. Improvement in our second quarter results from the first quarter was largely driven by outstanding operational performance, including a 99.9% adjusted flight completion rate during the quarter, as well as the block our production increase of 13% on our E175 fleet and an increase in prorate revenue. I want to thank our people for their teamwork and efforts to deliver strong operating performance as we launched a very busy summer travel season. We received eight E175 during the second quarter and will receive 16 more this year with a total of 240 E175 planned in service by early next year. Our re-fleeting that has been in progress for the last several years continues to be a priority as we execute on our long term strategy. During the second quarter, nearly 80% of our block hours were flown utilizing our dual class fleet. While demand is solid clearly our largest constraint is captain availability. SkyWest is fortunate to maintain a robust hiring pipeline and strategy for all workgroups, and to have new hire classes filled through year end. We expect that the ongoing high demand for pilots will continue to result in SkyWest pilots being the most sought after in the industry and are planning our models accordingly. We have long been investing in tuition reimbursements, incentives, and various other partnerships and methods to reduce barriers to entry and clear the path to help increase equality among the pilots profession. Notably of those who have joined our pilot pathway program this year, over 40% are women or people of color. As we discussed last quarter, we\u2019ve taken a number of steps to address our new crew imbalance including managing schedules with our partners, working with our pilot group to implement upgrade and captain retention centers and offering sustainable career pathways including guarantee pilot interview programs for our captains. While these disciplines strategies are producing results, the timing required for training and upgrades will likely constrained production into late 2023 and early 2024. We will continue to work with our people to ensure we remain best positioned to aggressively manage this challenge. We are currently in pay conversations with our pilots and expect to increase our pilot investment going forward to ensure we continue to provide more stability, opportunity and options than any other regional carrier can provide. During the second quarter we formed SkyWest charter as an additional entity of SkyWest Inc. Our intent is to enter the strong charter business within existing regulations. And we have applied for commuter authority with the department of transportation. We appreciate the strong support from many communities and airports as well as the efforts of the DOT, and FAA to enable this service that would provide essential connections that many small airports rely on. We undoubtedly have the asset base, best fleet, high standards and expertise to execute this operation well, and intend to hold SkyWest charter to the exceptional high standards of safety and service associated with the SkyWest name. While demand for our products has never been stronger, the current staffing imbalance and ongoing re-fleeting doesn\u2019t allow us to monetize that demand in the short term. We continue to expect 2022 production to be reduced by about 5% from 2021 production. We also continue to expect production the second half of the year to be lower than the first half due to the crew imbalance. However, there are three components in the environment today that gives us great confidence in SkyWest as an investment. First, there\u2019s undoubtedly significant unmet demand for regional flying. Second our strong pipeline and our ability to attract train and retain captains is far greater than our competitors, and third SkyWest asset value is unparalleled in the market. Our disciplined approach over the last decade in acquiring profitable assets at strong economics will enhance our ability to meet our objectives in this new economy. Although we continue to expect the recovery will remain choppy as we work through some headwinds over the next couple of years we remain aggressive and deliberate in the steps we\u2019re taking now to ensure we are well-positioned for 2024 and beyond. Rob will now take us through the financial data.\nRob Simmons: Today we reported second quarter GAAP net income of $54 million or $1.07, diluted earnings per share. Q2 pre-tax income was $72.7 million. Our diluted share count for Q2 was 50.6 million shares and our effective tax rate in Q2 was 26%. First let\u2019s talk about revenue. Total Q2 revenue of $799 million is up 9% sequentially from Q1, 2022 and at 22% from Q2, 2021. Q2 revenue breaks down with contract revenue up 8% from Q1, 2022 and 28% from Q2 a year ago. Prorate revenue was $95 million in Q2 up 20% from Q1, 2022 and down 8% from Q2, 2021. Leasing and other revenue is down 7% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. These GAAP results include the effect of a release of $16 million of deferred revenue this quarter, compared to $11 million released in Q1 and 6 million that was deferred during Q2, 2021. As of the end of Q2, we have $69 million of cumulative deferred revenue that will be recognized in future periods. This quarter\u2019s results also include two items I wanted to note. The first is a $15 million impairment charge we took this quarter on four of our older CRJ-700 that were part of our Express Jeff fleet and are held for sell. This impairment is in the line item other operating expense. The second is a $10 million mark to market gain on our investment in Eve as it started trading publicly during the second quarter. This gain is recorded below the line in other income. Let me move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $979 million up from 856 million last quarter. Our CapEx during the second quarter was 197 million for eight new E175 aircraft and other fixed assets. Total 2022 CapEx is expected to be approximately $775 million, including the purchase of 28 new E175 aircraft compared to $556 million in 2021. We ended Q2 with debt of 3.3 billion up slightly from 3.1 billion as of yearend 2021. Just a reminder that the only government debt we have on our balance sheet is a total of $201 million in PSP 10 year unsecured no amortization low coupon loans. Let me say a couple things about liquidity. As of June 30, 2022 our cash position of $975 million included the effect this quarter of having repaid an incremental $103 million of debt before adding $191 million of debt financing for eight new E175 and $25 million in engine financing. We also have over $1 billion of unpledged collateral that could be deployed for additional liquidity if ever needed. Additional flexibility comes from the fact that including partner owned aircraft 50% of our fleet and service has no financing obligation. Consistent with our policy and practice, we are not in a position to give any specific EPS guidance at this time. But let me give you a little directional color. Q2 results were slightly better than expected for a variety of reasons referenced earlier by Chip, including optimizing our schedules by aircraft type, strong demand that we monetized opportunistically, and benefits from our evolving fleet mix. We expect Q3 results, however, to be slightly down from Q2 due to labor constraints and costs. The second half of 2022 will likely be worse than the first half of 2022 for similar reasons with the second half of 22 modestly profitable. We don\u2019t expect to rebuild production from this pilot imbalance challenge until the end of 2023. Second, we won\u2019t see the full year impact of the 47 accretive new E175 going into service in 2022 and early 2023 until 2024. Our actions today are setting us up for success in 2024. Third, we will continue to focus on liquidity and expect to end 2022 with a strong cash position in spite of the investment we\u2019re making in 28, accretive new E175 this year. We believe that the actions we are taking now to invest in the growth of our ERJ fleet work through the pilot imbalance affecting the industry and preserve the optionality of monetizing strong demand opportunities over time will position us well for 2024.  Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I\u2019ll provide a fleet and production status update as well as an update on our prorate and leasing businesses. We continue a strong delivery schedule this year as we\u2019ve discussed in recent quarters. We previously announced an agreement with Delta for 16 new E175 to replace 16 older Sky West owned CRJ-900 aircraft. During the quarter we took delivery of two of the 16 aircraft. We anticipate taking delivery of the remaining 14 E175 during the second half of the year, and will be placed into service beginning in the third quarter of this year through the first part of 2023. After we received these aircraft, we will have 87 E175 under long term contracts with Delta. Under our American contract we have 20 New E175 scheduled for service throughout this year. We received 18 of those aircraft during the third and fourth quarters of 2021 and will receive two in the third quarter of this year. We have an agreement with Alaska to add 11 E175 short contracts. During the second quarter we took delivery of six and had already taken four during the first quarter of 2022. We expect to take delivery of the last E175 during 2023 for a total of 43 aircraft under long term contracts with Alaska. Demand for our E175 product remains very strong. Following delivery of those currently on order our E175 fleet will be 240 aircraft. Let me review our current production in 2022. Based on the current schedules we have from our major partners for the third quarter, we anticipate that our block hours will be down by approximately 3% to 5% in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. As we look to Q4 we anticipate our Q4 block hours will be down 13% to 17% as compared to the second quarter. Let me talk a little bit about our prorate business. As we\u2019ve discussed, we are experiencing a crew imbalance that is impacting our ability to fully meet the strong demand for our product. As a result of this imbalance during the first quarter, we filed a 90 day notice with the DOT to discontinue service to 29 essential air service communities. This was a very difficult decision and one we would have preferred not to make. We have been serving most of these communities for several years. It appears nine of these 29 communities will transition to another airline by year end. We continue working through this challenge and remain committed to help find good solution for these and other underserved communities. Shifting gears to our leasing business. During the quarter, we entered into one long term lease for CR-700. This brings our total CRJ-700 and 900 under long term leases with third parties to 40. This line of business has very good cash flow and strong margin characteristics. Demand for our engine leasing business is returning. And we have placed a few more engines under third party leases during the second quarter and anticipate placing more engines under leases by the end of the year. We have a strong delivery schedule this year and will continue to and we\u2019ll continue working efficiently and effectively allocating our resources as we optimize our fleet mix. We have spent the last several years reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility to ensure we\u2019re well positioned. This flexibility will continue to be a differentiator for us and we are committed to continuing our work with each of our major partners to provide creative solutions. Okay, Lisa, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A now. \nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. \nSavi Syth: Good afternoon. I was just kind of curious American, passed a pilot contract for their in house subsidiaries which the base pay is quite a big increase, but when you include the bonus that supposedly is temporary, a pretty significant jump up. I was curious as to if you have seen any impact in terms of kind of retention or ability to attract since those tasks that or what do you think the kind of the read-through to the industry from that contract there?\nChip Childs: Well, Savi this is Chip, thanks for the question. It\u2019s a good question. And candidly, I think when we look at what America has done with some of their wholly owned, there\u2019s a couple of things that we can some ideas about it that we can embrace and some that we don\u2019t embrace. I think one of the things that for our perspective, is that we want to long term find a solution for pilots over the long term, and not just for the next year or two. That package is very heavily, heavily weighted for the next 24 months. I said in my script, that we\u2019re investing in our pilots, and we\u2019re getting close to having some good things to work out with our pilots, but I think that there\u2019s a little different color. From our perspective, there\u2019s no doubt in the economy that we\u2019re living today that labor costs are a big issue for everybody. It\u2019s not even just our industry, by the way. So I think the most important thing for us to do is to come together as we work with our pilot group and have that evaluation for what\u2019s the most meaningful process for our pilots and our group and we\u2019re getting some very good traction and having some good conversations with them. As it relates to the industry obviously, there\u2019s some things that some of our partners have done with wholly owned carriers that are very close to this, and we\u2019re having good conversations with them as well as far as long term partnering ideas surrounding various labor shortages, especially with pilots. So, look I think we\u2019ve got some very good momentum and some good direction. And think we\u2019ve got some good solutions to help get us back on track, like we\u2019ve said, close to the 2024 timeframe.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s helpful. How should I think about clearly the department is well aware of these hiring constraints and needing to drive pay raises? How quickly do you think you\u2019ll be able to pass that through across your contract like, there\u2019s going to be kind of a five year process a two year process? How or could it be faster? How should we think about when once you pass that pilot pay agreement the hits and how long it would take to them to get back to kind of a normalized margin?\nChip Childs: Well, I don\u2019t want to get into too many of the strategies that we have, but I will give you some assurances. One, we have a very good fleet renewal timeline from starting in 2023 through the next five or six years, and obviously, when you come up with that type of contract expiration and people want to renew, that\u2019s the ultimate reset of some of these things. We also see some opportunity relative to the sooner that we can fix the turnaround relative to our captain issue, the faster we can go back at capacity. I said in my script, that the demand for our product is extremely high. You can see not just us but most other regional are pulling down significant capacity, which means there\u2019s a tremendous amount of scope, we think in the next year or two, that\u2019s going to be left out there that we could get pretty aggressive with. So I would suggest that this is not going to happen overnight. We don\u2019t have any partner that\u2019s going to just wonderfully write out a check for all of these costs, but it is a gradual process. And the more that we can deliver, the easier those conversations go because of the strong demand for flying, particularly in small and midsized communities today, so that\u2019s kind of the way we\u2019re looking at it without getting into any of the nuts and bolts.\nSavi Syth: Last one, just following up on that, before I get back on the queue. It seems like you\u2019re kind of into service timeline at American and Delta a little bit faster than you were thinking earlier this year. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a function of the operations have been good. It seems like you\u2019re gaining more confidence. I\u2019m kind of surprised to see that sequential drop from 3Q to 4 Q on block hours it seems like more than seasonal. So is there something that I\u2019m missing in that forecast? Or is there a lot of conservatism in there?\nWade Steel: Yes Savi this is Wade. So the first part of your question about our timelines with American and Delta, those have been very consistent for the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve been saying that. There is really been no differences in the timeline of the one seven fives coming in. As far as the guidance coming forward, as we talked about, in our script, there is a crew imbalance that we\u2019re working through right now. We\u2019re obviously we are modeling it conservative as we\u2019re looking at it. We\u2019re trying to do the best we can to sure up and stabilize the fleet going forward. But there is that crew imbalance that we are working through over the next several quarters.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Good afternoon, guys. I want to go back just on Savi\u2019s question on the pilot, since I know you don\u2019t have a union contract but that said, you still have kind of agreement? Is there a structure in place where rates are set for several years? And then you sort of negotiate and then they\u2019re replaced by new rates? Like what\u2019s the timing? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of, if in fact, over the next year or two, we do see a meaningful bump up in pilot pay rates that we\u2019re frankly, we\u2019re seeing across the entire industry. And I just want to know whether or not it\u2019s not going to show up until you guys renew some of your agreements, like Chip, you said, I think \u201823, \u201824, \u201825 things renew, and it\u2019s, that\u2019s usually a good time to kind of go back and discuss kind of where things are on the class side, etc.\nChip Childs: Yes, Mike, this is Chip again. Just to be clear, we have a very clear collective bargaining agreement with our pilots that is structured like any other contract with pilots. But our current agreement expires at the end of this year. We have been in conversation with our pilots over the last several months, it\u2019s a long process. There is a lot going on in the world, a lot of concerns about various aspects of the industry. And the focus of our package is clearly on the captain side and retention and those types of things. So, but we intend, I mean, look, we\u2019re pretty close. We intend to have something probably coming out of agreement here within the next month or so. And even if we were not bound by an expiration of our pilot contract this year, we probably would, given the market circumstances we\u2019ve always open things up if we feel like we\u2019ve needed to, as we\u2019ve done in the past, and would be here anyway. So the timing of the contract is what it is. But more importantly, we\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019ve always utilized some market opportunities to take care of our people and do it in a way that\u2019s going to benefit them long term. And I think that\u2019s the, I think that\u2019s the element that we want to emphasize of what our strategy is, is we want to a long perm element of our pilot contract that\u2019s going to make sure that we can continue to achieve what we\u2019ve achieved over the last several decades at SkyWest, and the conversations are going well, and we continue to go down that pathway.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then back to maybe it was Rob or Wade who talked about just on the prorate revenue. 95 million is pretty good. I know it was down, I think 8% versus a year ago, but it was up 20% versus March quarter. I was kind of working under the assumption that that was really going to start to come down as you reduce block hours. And I guess, presumably, you may be benefiting from a strong pricing environment, strong revenue environment. So can you give us the block hours maybe that\u2019s going to tell me that you did drop your prorate flying by a lot more than what the revenue suggests?\nWade Steel: Yes, Mike, this is Wade.  So we are on the prorate side, the block hours have definitely gone down quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. Really the strong revenue is, our prorate is very similar to what the major partners are seeing right now. The yields are very strong. The demand is very good. And in a lot of these small communities, people are working with us to stay in there and do what we need to do. So the revenue environment on our prorate is very good. And so it\u2019s really a yield. We\u2019ve just seen the yields very strong and a lot of these communities over the last couple of quarters. And as we look forward into Q3 it looks pretty good as well.\nMichael Linenberg : And then just lastly, I know you\u2019ve been making all sorts of interesting investments. You highlighted the Eve gain. Maybe I dreamed this or not, but southern airways express? Did you? Did you guys make a deal on a piece of that company? I can\u2019t remember if you own another piece of another regional carrier.\nWade Steel: Mike, this is Wade again. So yes, we\u2019ve made an investment in southern and [Indiscernible] that whole combination several years ago, and they\u2019re a good partner, they\u2019re growing, they\u2019re doing a lot of good things. And we\u2019re helping them with their strategic plans and how they\u2019re moving forward. So yes, we do own them.\nMichael Linenberg : And Wade are they 135 carrier?\nWade Steel: They are there, they primarily operate caravans under 135 certificate. That\u2019s right.\nMichael Linenberg : Would it ever make sense to use them to be the backbone of this charter operation? Or you want it makes maybe more sense on the mainland to do a de novo operation?\nChip Childs: Michael, this is Chip, I think it\u2019s primarily relative to the fleet that we want to utilize relative to this, which we have a significant amount of assets in the CRJ-200. Look, there\u2019s no doubt that as we strategically look, and make sure that we take care of the communities that we\u2019re serving today want to serve, and some that we have to back out of. It\u2019s all part of a bigger conversation with the communities. I mean, we were deeply invested in these communities. We\u2019ve invested in them for years. Sometimes it may make sense and southern backfills, some makes sense that we utilize a commuter authority to have a 30 seat CRJ-200 to do it. So what the best part about it is, is we\u2019ve got a tremendous amount of assets, tremendous amount of expertise, relative to the situation with most importantly, a lot of flexibility with our other business relationships, including our partners to try to work some of these things out and given the current environment.\nMichael Linenberg : Thanks, Chip. Thanks Wade. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time. Can you say if there\u2019s been any update on the application with the FAA on the part 135 carrier?\nWade Steel: Helane, this is Wade. We filed for commuter authority in the middle of June on the application and we had many communities that put letters of support in there. Right now we\u2019re working through the application with the DOT. They\u2019re currently reviewing it. So hopefully in the next couple of months, we\u2019ll get this all sorted out the commuter authority and we\u2019ll be able to start buying some flights.\nHelane Becker: Yes. Is there a way we should it\u2019s just like fourth quarter first quarter event. Is that how we should think about it?\nWade Steel: We\u2019re still working through the exact timing I will tell you that we are going to operate this as a charter this is a charter as well as on demand charters. And we believe, we will start flying that on demand charters, definitely during some time during this year. As far as the commuter authority, we\u2019re still working through with the DOT on some things on that. So I don\u2019t know if I necessarily want to give an exact timeframe. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll drag on too long. But we are working through it, but we will be flying on demand charters here, hopefully, shortly.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Can I just shift gears and ask Rob one question on that on a cash position, like, how are you thinking about the right number for cash and liquidity going forward, because it seems cash exceeds revenue? And I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the right level of cash to have, or maybe it is.\nRob Simmons: Yes, Helane, I look, I think, as we think of our liquidity position obviously I think the way that we have thought about it has evolved over the last couple of years through COVID, and whatnot. But I think that given what the next 18 months is likely going to look like for the industry, we\u2019re happy having a higher than usual level of liquidity. And we think that it\u2019s one of frankly, it\u2019s one of our real competitive advantages that we\u2019ve got out there the strength of our balance sheet, the fact that should other opportunities arise that we\u2019ve got the ability to finance additional airplanes given the strength of our balance sheet. As you know that it\u2019s like our debt net of cash really hasn\u2019t budged through all of COVID. And I think it\u2019s frankly, one of our competitive advantages that really helps us.\nOperator: We have a follow up question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead. \nSavi Syth: Thanks for the follow up here. I just kind of curious, I know, United on their call mentioned the current situation probably accelerating where they thought they would get to from a regional mix, which is a lot smaller. I think they\u2019ve talked about it being maybe half the size. Clearly still, I think big fans of the large orgies that you do have, I think 70 CRJs-200 flying with United. And I wonder if you\u2019ve had any conversations about kind of the interest on continuing with those CRJ-200 or if you expect that to kind of wind down and over the next kind of couple of years here.\nChip Childs: Yes Savi I think that fleet mix and strategies are going to be very dynamic over the next couple of years. And I think I would also just take two seconds to at least reiterate what our strategy as a regional carrier is. I think there\u2019s a lot of news in the world is talking about less regional flying. And I think it\u2019s not because of the demand for regional flying is going away, because we see it being the exact opposite. I think that the supply of regional flying is going to be a constraint. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be aggressive and making sure we can fill that demand. So when it comes to CRJ-200, there\u2019s a lot of conversations about 200. Certainly, the dual class, 175 and the larger CRJs are the priority relative to the capacity that they can carry, particularly with our major partners. CRJ-200 fit very well within the charter operation, and what we want to do flying charters. And so look, it\u2019s sort of a dynamic conversation about fleet all the way around and is going to continue to stay that way. We have been more than surprised at the interest in our charter operation since we\u2019ve had some more development of it. And we\u2019ve been more public about this last quarter. We are surprised about pilot interest in it. We are surprised about community interest in it. And we\u2019re surprised also that there\u2019s a lot of parties that want this thing to work and we\u2019re excited about it now. Doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to move all the 200 over. But it certainly gives us an opportunity to be flexible and prioritize the dual class fleet at SkyWest.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s a good segue to my next question. So it kind of follow up on I think Helane was asking but the part 135 and starting that, like what would you I mean, it seems like you have the systems in place to be able to start selling those fairs and I\u2019m guessing in our lining, perhaps with majors or how should we think about if that opportunity becomes feasible or when that opportunity becomes feasible, how much infrastructure you have in place today that you can just leverage off of, versus maybe there needs to be some investment to get that operation off the ground?\nChip Childs: Well, let me give you some perspective of what we\u2019re trying to do. This is not, let\u2019s remember, we\u2019re not pioneering this business model. This is not a business model that needs to be invented. There are other carriers today with the authority that we\u2019re seeking that are doing the exact same thing relative to scheduled charter service. There\u2019s a lot of charter operators out there that we don\u2019t need anything from the DOT to do this with. And when you talk about flying charters in a 135, our perspective of this is to operate it at the exact same level of safety as SkyWest airlines and to leverage all of the expertise that SkyWest has developed over the past 50 years, and apply it to an existing business model that other people have the authority to do this with. So from our perspective, when we talk about leveraging, usually the most difficult thing when you start an airline or transition is the intellectual property that you don\u2019t have or the pilot pipelines that you don\u2019t have or the connections or the relationships that you don\u2019t have to get it up off the ground. We will knock that out of the park. We have all of those things in place. We have very strong assets and very strong expertise, many of our expertise is up SkyWest and is coming back and deeply interested in this stuff. And again, we\u2019re amazed at the outside interest in this business model. And so from our perspective, we\u2019re not going to let this model ever be the baseline model is what we do. But it certainly is a great opportunity for us to capitalize on some assets and some expertise that we have. So from a timeline perspective, I think Wade basically said it, we expect in Q4 we\u2019ll do some chartering of on demand charter operations. Like I said, employee interest and this is very, very high. And we\u2019ll continue to work with the DOT to get the other authorities that we\u2019re looking forward to, to continue to develop this business model.\nSavi Syth: And just a follow up, probably a little bit of a dumb question in there. So if I think about how, what a great opportunity this is to kind of help bridge the gap for pilots coming out with that 250 hour and needing to build up. Like, how do you see kind of pilots moving through here and into SkyWest? Like, what would they be? What kind of hours will they get? And how will this help you address the captain supply side of things?\nWade Steel: I would suggest Savi, that 95% of this relative to pilots is captain supply. I\u2019m going to go backwards and say, look, there are a lot of pilots available that we see in our pipeline that have 1500 hours. The captain supply is what becomes most intriguing to us because of the applications and the interest that we\u2019ve seen from existing experienced captains in the industry. And it\u2019s been SkyWest that want to participate in this in this operation. So to the extent that how the pilots supply thing works with this I think it does help out on the captain side because you need captains to create captains. And I think that we have got a lot of work to do still to figure out exactly the flow of how pilots would work in and out of this. But I would assure you of something that\u2019s important about how we run this charter operation. We intend to run it just like we run the commercial side of SkyWest as a 121 operator. We fundamentally will have SMS systems. We will have ASAP systems, voluntary systems, we will continue to have accountability to the board. It\u2019s important to note that over every single year SkyWest airlines, we actually fail several 100 pilots out of our initial training courses. And they have 1500 hours. They\u2019re very well qualified by FAA standards, but they don\u2019t meet the SkyWest standard. And that standard for this charter operation will be the exact same standard. So from our perspective, this is a prime opportunity, particularly as communities are facing other forms of service that may replace this as SkyWest airlines comes out. A great alternative to what I think these communities are looking for. That having been said, we\u2019re also extremely excited about some of the feedback we\u2019re getting as an on demand charter operator.\nOperator: We will take a follow up question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. \nMichael Linenberg: Chip, just back on the charter operation. I know you mentioned that a lot of parties want it to work, it would seem that first and foremost, one of those parties would be the DOT given the fact that you\u2019re out there looking to discontinue service to 29 small cities, and you got nine takers, but you still have 20 small cities. And then there\u2019s a lot of other major carriers with their regional partners, also pulling down small city services as well. So we\u2019re looking at lots of airports that could be losing service. Do they see it the same way number one? Number two, the charter operation is envisioned are you looking to go back into some of those other cities that you\u2019re pulling out of that you would backfill with this charter operation?\nChip Childs: Yes, Michael, I can\u2019t speak for the DOT. I can just tell you what\u2019s out there within the marketplace. And the nine that we\u2019re coming out of there are some that are this exact same model with a different carrier and the same authority going back in. So from our perspective, I don\u2019t know that you ever get an opinion, particularly from a government agency, but the data points were favorable, I would say. Second I mean, secondarily, we\u2019re not too concerned about what you could look at from an upside from the charter operation yet, because we\u2019ve gotten so much work to just get the first 10 to 20 aircraft up and going and seeing how that works. But there certainly can be some opportunities, but that having been said, I will be candid a CRJ-200 with 50 seats is still a lot better than a CRJ-200 with 30 seats. So the priority is still going to be making sure that SkyWest Airlines is maximizing their capacity and doing what we can in these communities that can withstand an economically supportive 50 seat CRJs, as we continue to work through the crew imbalance issue.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes, no, it just it seems like from a policy perspective, that this is a good solution. And I just read your filing, and you look at all the exhibits that are from chambers of commerce and Mayors and various cities that are going to lose all service and or that have lost service, and that are out there pushing for this and you start looking at the number of Americans who are potentially going to lose regional services. It\u2019s a lot of people, a lot of voters, it may be 50, 60, I saw a number that I think it was 70 million people are at risk of losing a good portion or all of their air service. So this seems like a no brainer, but whatever. I\u2019m just the pining here.\nWade Steel: Michael, the other thing from our perspective, and there is some resistance to this ironically, the other thing from our perspective, either you may lose service, you may in the very slim chance get service from another operator that seeking the same authority that we are or you may end up with service in a nine seat, single engine turboprop in an a completely different set of rules than we would ever consider in their service. So from our perspective I think that we\u2019re you know, we\u2019re in a good position relative to what our application processes.\nMichael Linenberg: Well, thanks. Thanks for answering all the questions. \nOperator: That does conclude today\u2019s question and answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Chip Childs for closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Thank you all again for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your interest in SkyWest. Look, I mean, in conclusion, we want to reiterate, there\u2019s a tremendous need for regional product in small and midsized and underserved communities. Reliable quality or service is unquestionable positive economic impact for any community. And we\u2019re focused on ensuring we\u2019re strategically positioned to respond to all of that demand. With significant available scope and incredibly strong demand we\u2019re bullish on the long term future of SkyWest. Also, as we celebrate 50 years, I want to again congratulate and thank our people for their work, and great continued support and flexibility. With that we\u2019ll end the call and reconnect with you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: And that does conclude today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-04-28 22:46:06", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SkyWest Incorporated First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Robert Simmons, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.\nRob Simmons: Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; and Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer. I'd like to start today by asking Eric to read the safe harbor, then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results, then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2021 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Demand for SkyWest product during the first quarter remained exceptionally high with our main constraint being the crew imbalance we discussed last quarter. Following our efforts to stabilize after the -- stabilize after the industry-wide challenges of Omicron at the beginning of the year, the first quarter results were slightly better than we anticipated. We reported pre-tax income of $25 million and net income of $18 million. The improvement was in part due to stronger March production and maintenance costs better than anticipated. We expect to place 46 new E175s into service within the next 12 months, putting us at 240 E175s in service by early next year. Our refleeting that has been in progress for the last several years continues to be a priority, as we execute on our long-term strategy. During the first quarter, 78% of our block hours were flown utilizing our dual-class fleet. While demand is solid, we're facing headwinds, as the pandemic transitions to endemic. SkyWest is fortunate to maintain a robust hiring pipeline and strategy for all work groups and to have new higher pilot classes filled through the summer. We have long been preparing for an increase in mainline pilot retirements. However, the 6,000 early retirements taken at the majors during COVID and the steep demand recovery has resulted in a new much higher demand for experienced SkyWest pilots, particularly captains. This demand has created imbalance of pilots here and across the regional industry. Of course, pilot attrition was anticipated and planned for in our models and strategies. However, rapid increase in captain attrition was not. With the return to travel and the new industry-wide demand has resulted in SkyWest pilots being the most sought after in the industry. As we discussed briefly last quarter, we've taken a number of steps to address this imbalance. First and foremost, we continue working with our major partners to manage and reduce schedules to ensure we're able to deliver a solid and reliable product. We have worked with our pilot group to implement upgrade and captain retention incentives. We're also offering our pilots sustainable career pathways, including guaranteed pilot interview programs for our cabins. Altogether, these programs provide more stability, opportunity and options than any other regional carrier can provide. Overall, these disciplined strategies work with both our partners and our pilot group have already begun producing results. But given the timing required for training and upgrades, this imbalance will likely constrain production into late 2023 to early 2024. We will make continued improvements and investments in our captains and working together with our people to ensure we remain in the best position to manage this imbalance aggressively. With 46 new E175s going into service by early next year, we continue to play the long game. We've embedded flexibility within our prorate model to allow for the flex up and down of our prorate flying and are utilizing that flexibility going forward to significantly reduce prorate, so that we can continue to deliver the highest reliability across our operations. We made the very difficult decision to file a 90-day termination notice with the Department of Transportation for 29 communities, as we work through our staffing imbalance. We're also evaluating the various other options to ensure these markets maintain connectivity to the broader national transportation infrastructure. With an investment -- with an existing investment in Southern Airways, we expect to explore more ways, including other Part 135 options to help maintain the strong and reliable air service that so many small and medium-sized markets rely on. We are honored to be one of Forbe's Best Large Employers for the second year running in 2022. The past couple of years have been incredibly challenging for all of our teams, and our ability to work together with our people is the reason for our success. I want to thank our nearly 15,000 employees for their dedication and teamwork. While demand for our product has never been stronger, the current staffing imbalance and ongoing refleeting doesn't allow us to monetize that demand in the short term. While the environment is similar to what we discussed a couple of months ago, we've made progress in finding new ways to improve our outlook. We expect 2022 production to be reduced by about 5% from 2021 production, slightly better than we previously thought. We expect the second quarter will be better than the first quarter, with the second half of the year lower than the first half due to the crew imbalance. There are three components in the environment today that give us great confidence in SkyWest, as an investment. First, there is undoubtedly massive demand for regional flying, as people migrated away from urban areas to small and medium-sized communities during the pandemic. These communities have an even greater need for connection to global networks. Second, our strong pilot pipeline and our ability to attract, train and retain captains is far greater than our competitors and we will continue to get better. And third, SkyWest asset value is unparalleled in the market. Our disciplined approach over the last decade in acquiring profitable assets at strong economics will enhance our ability to meet our objectives in this new economy. Although, we expect the recovery will remain choppy, as we work through some headwinds over the next couple of years, we remain aggressive and deliberate in the steps we're taking now to ensure we are well positioned for 2024 and beyond. Rob will now take us through the financial data.\nRob Simmons: Today, we reported first quarter GAAP net income of $17.7 million or $0.35 diluted earnings per share. Q1 pre-tax income was $24.8 million. Our diluted share count for Q1 was 50.7 million shares, and our effective tax rate in Q1 was 28%. First, let's talk about revenue. Total Q1 revenue of $735 million is down 5% sequentially from Q4, '21 and up 38% from Q1, 2021. Q1 revenue breaks down with contract revenue down 2% from Q4, 2021 and up 42% from Q1. Prorate revenue was $79 million in Q1, down 28% from Q4, '21 and up 15% from Q1, 2021. Leasing and other revenue is up 7% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. These GAAP results include the effect of a release of $11 million of deferred revenue this quarter compared to $23 million released in Q4 and $21 million that was deferred during Q1, 2021. As of the end of Q1, we have $84 million of cumulative deferred revenue that will be recognized in future periods. As discussed last quarter, the timing and amount of future deferrals or reversals into revenue depends on the shape and cadence of the recovery of our flying. All deferred revenue will be reversed into revenue by the end of the various contract periods. Let me move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $856 million, essentially flat from $860 million last quarter. Our CapEx during the first quarter was $114 million for four new E175 aircraft and other fixed assets. Total 2022 CapEx is expected to be approximately $800 million, including the purchase of 28 new E175 aircraft compared to $556 million in 2021. We ended Q1 with debt of $3.2 billion, up slightly from $3.1 billion, as of year-end 2021. Just a reminder that the only government debt we have on our balance sheet is a total of $201 million in PSP 10-year unsecured no amortization, low coupon loans. Let me say a couple of things about liquidity. As of March 31st, 2022, our cash position of $856 million included the effect this quarter of having repaid an incremental $94 million of debt before adding $83 million of debt financing for four new E175s and $103 million in engine financing. We also have over $1 billion of unpledged collateral that could be deployed for additional liquidity, if ever needed. As of the end of Q1, 2022, our debt net of cash balance is lower than it was pre-COVID at the end of 2019. Additional flexibility comes from the fact that including partner-owned aircraft, over 50% of our fleet in service now has no financing obligation, especially in volatile times like this and consistent with our policy and practice, we are not in a position to give any specific EPS guidance at this time, but let me give you a little color. First, at this time, we expect 2022 to be better than we thought last quarter. Last quarter, we thought that 2022 could show breakeven profitability. We now expect to be profitable this year. Q1 results were slightly better than expected for a variety of reasons referenced earlier by Chip, including optimizing our schedules by aircraft type and strong demand that we monetized opportunistically. The Q2 schedules currently in place would indicate that Q2 earnings and production will likely be better than Q1. The second half of '22, however, will likely be worse than the first half of '22 with the second half of 2022, approximately breakeven to slightly profitable because of projected captain attrition. We don't expect to have this pilot imbalance challenge mitigated until the back half of 2023. Second, we expect block hour production in 2022 to be down less than we thought last quarter compared to 2021 production, while still being limited by the pilot staffing imbalance. Last quarter, we estimated that 2022 block hours would be down 10% to 15% compared to 2021. We now believe that number could be closer to 5% down for 2022. We continue to expect to focus on growing our ERJ fleet and pulling down some of our CRJ fleet. Third, we won't see the full year impact of the 47 accretive new E175 aircraft going into service in 2022 and early '23 until 2024. Fourth, we will continue to focus on liquidity and expect to end 2022 with a strong cash balance in spite of a strong delivery pipeline of 28 accretive new E175s this year. We believe that the actions we are taking now to invest in the growth of our ERJ fleet, work through the pilot imbalance affecting the industry and preserve the optionality of monetizing strong demand opportunities over time will position us strongly in the regional sector. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I'll provide a fleet and production status update, as well as an update on our prorate and leasing businesses. We continue a strong delivery schedule this year, as we discussed in recent quarters. We previously announced an agreement with Delta for 16 new E175s to replace 16 older SkyWest-owned CRJ900s. We anticipate these E175s will be placed into service beginning in the middle of this year through the first part of 2023. After we receive these aircraft, we will have 87 E175s under long-term contracts with Delta. Under our American contract, we have 20 new E175 scheduled for service throughout this year. We have received 18 of those aircraft during the third and fourth quarter of 2021, and will receive two in the middle of this year. We have an agreement with Alaska to add 11 E175 to our contract. We expect to place 10 of those aircraft into service this year and one more during the first half of 2023 for a total of 43 aircraft under long-term contracts with Alaska. Clearly, demand for our E175 product remains very strong. Following delivery of those currently on order, our E175 fleet will be 240 aircraft. Let me review our current production. Based on the current schedules we have from our major partners for the second quarter of 2022, we anticipate that our block hours and revenue will be up slightly from the first quarter. As we look to Q3, we anticipate that our second half block hours will be down from the first half of this year. Let me talk a little about our prorate business. As we've discussed, we are experiencing a crew imbalance that is impacting our ability to fully meet the strong demand for our product, and we have intentionally built flexibility into our prorate model to flex up and down with our operating resources. As a result of this imbalance during the first quarter, we filed a 90-day notice with the DOT to discontinue service to 29 essential air service communities. This was a very difficult decision and one we would have preferred not to make. We have been serving most of these communities for several years. We continue working through this challenge and remain committed to helping find a good solution for these communities. Additionally, as Chip said, we own part of Southern Airways, a Part 135 airline, and we expect to explore ways to work with additional airlines flying under Part 135 towards a viable solution for these communities. Shifting gears to our leasing business, we currently have 39 CRJ700s and 900s under long-term leases with third parties. This line of business has very good cash flow and strong margin characteristics. Demand for our engine leasing business is returning, and we anticipate placing several engines under long-term leases this year. We have a strong delivery schedule this year, and we'll continue working efficiently to allocate our resources, as we optimize our fleet mix. We have spent the last several years reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility to ensure we're well positioned. This flexibility will continue to be a differentiator for us, and we are committed to continuing our work with each of our major partners to provide creative solutions.\nRob Simmons: Okay. Operator, we're ready for our Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Just going off of the block hour, you kind of outlook looking better, is that because your pilot hiring turned out or pilot kind of the training and things turned out better than when you were sitting kind of three months ago or a few months ago? Or it was there for some other reason that the production was better? And along those lines, I was wondering, if you could just give an update on if kind of versus earlier this year, if attrition rates are getting better or worse? Or how are you thinking about it from that perspective?\nWade Steel: Savi, this is Wade. I'll answer the block hour question. As we kind of went through this quarter and did lots of allocations of block hours and how we're going to do some flying, we're able to optimize it based on some fleet mix changes that we anticipated. We've also found some -- a little bit of stabilization in some of our model. And so it's been helpful for us to be able to predict our block hours a little bit more accurately.\nChip Childs: And Savi, this is Chip. To your second question relative to attrition, I would only -- we don't talk a ton about it, but I would say that we're basically flat ever since we talked about it last quarter. Each of the months we are running relatively consistently. We anticipate this summer will be a bit lighter, and then it will pick up again strong in the fall. So that's just some general direction of where we are. All of that being said, we continue to be able to outpace it through our pipeline. And so at this point, the imbalance continues to be something that we are aggressive about addressing, but it's -- a lot of is mathematics about making sure we get enough flight time for the FOs to become captains.\nSavi Syth: Can I follow up on that, Chip. Just so is the -- do you need to kind of invest in the training footprint to make it larger? Or -- and -- or are you getting enough kind of FOs in the door? And it really is about just a timing issue, as you have to kind of spend time to then kind of build that captain pipeline?\nChip Childs: Yes. Savi, the major thing is time. If you go back to when we were not doing a lot of flying, I mean, this is pandemic generated combined with just massive demand at the major carriers. And like I said, the 6,000 retirement. All of that's creating a bit of a perfect storm. But the major component of this is going to be time to make sure that we can get the time and experience for these first officers to upgrade. We do have a strong complement of first officers that could upgrade to captain. We're working on some programs to enhance how we take care of our captains. There is -- I will say it will be a good day to be a captain at SkyWest, as we continue to work through that for the rest of this year. And we've got a lot of opportunities to move the dial here, but we need to continue to be extremely aggressive in our approach.\nSavi Syth: Just one follow-up to that, Chip. Just as the kind of costs go higher on that, is that a -- are partners sharing in that cost? Or is that something that in the near term, you do kind of see that in the expense and over time, as kind of contracts get negotiated that will eventually be a pass through?\nChip Childs: I would suggest that as demand is strong, we are certainly not going to have immediate recovery for some of the things that we would like to do with captains. It is going to be short-term pain in nature, but we have a strong strategy of how we will manage the contract. And our partners are very engaged in this process as well. And so we're going to do it for long-term sustainability and look for the long games we usually do. Back to your previous question, also I wanted to also emphasize this is not a training capacity problem. We have -- relative to what our outlook is, is we're not going to be constrained in any of the SIMs or facilities or any of that nature. This is just mostly making sure we get the experience for the first officers to upgrade.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Catherine O'Brien. Sorry. Your next question comes from -- again from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Just on the Part 135 options, is that something that you are kind of looking to just partner with? And I guess I did realize that you had a stake in kind of Southern areas. But just is that a view to just partner with? Or is there an option to kind of bring in more Part 131 -- 35 flying within SkyWest?\nChip Childs: So fundamentally, we're a 121 certificate. We do not have a 135 certificate. So we have -- we actually have been working with a lot of 135 operators and utilize them very strong within our existing pipeline. As Wade mentioned, when we unfortunately had to -- had to notify the Department of Transportation, the 29 cities that we needed to pull out of, these were profitable cities, some of our strong profitability, these are great markets. It's just impossible to serve those with the other contractual obligations that we had. So to be candid, when we went through the process, our emphasis is going to be to make sure these communities are well served at the same level of safety and quality that we have because we've invested tens of millions of dollars in all of these cities, and we hate leaving these markets. So to the extent that we've been working with some 135 operators to help backfill and have a smooth transition, it continues to enhance some of our of existing thinking with CRJ200s, and we have plenty of those that are not doing anything today. And there's a lot of 135 operators that are certified to fly the CRJ200. And at this time, we don't anticipate supplying it with pilots, but there are some good opportunities with 135 operators to help utilize that asset and product to backfill some of the things that we've been doing. And we -- as you know, for several decades, we've been the leader with the CRJ200 product. We've got great engine builds. They're paid for assets, and there could be some opportunity here. But it's still -- it's still relatively early, and we'll update you more probably next quarter on some of the things we can do here.\nSavi Syth: Chip, just taking a step back, the industry has kind of gone through several shifts that kind of last time was 2012, 2013, '14 time frame when some of the rules changed. And do you see any kind of longer-term kind of implications of what you're seeing today? It does seem like it's kind of a near-term issue, as you mentioned, as a result of the pandemic, and we will kind of normalize at some point. But does this -- does this cause for kind of maybe for -- it does -- are partners thinking about consolidation more? Or are there any kind of longer-term implications? And is there a chance that, like how many -- how many CRJs will be flying in 2024 coming out of -- coming out of this?\nChip Childs: Well, look there's a lot -- there's a lot of questions in there, so I'll try to -- I'll try to address as many as I possibly can. I think to the latter part of what you asked, how many CRJ200s could be flying in 2024 remains to be seen. 135 operators certainly have a different level of flexibility than what we do. Back to some of your earlier points, we're actually not looking to modify any law, particularly with 1,500 hours is a component that's out there. We think it's a terrible way to train pilots, but we don't think that the reality of what's happening in D.C. is going to necessarily make a move in that area. But it also in certain -- that rules probably put us, where we are with captains because if we didn't have that rule, we would probably have more captains and better trained captains by now. But at the same time, I think that given the situation that we're in, we're going to be aggressive in a multitude of other areas to address this. And like I said earlier, the CRJ200 with some potential 135 operators is one of those, but there's a lot of 135 operators that don't. But CRJ200, they are going to be exceptional in servicing some of these existing cities. So I think yes -- I mean, I think there's a lot to be -- remain to be seen with a single class aircraft in the near future. Going back to my main point, though, the demand for small cities is extraordinarily strong and probably is going to get stronger by 2024.\nSavi Syth: And then if I might just ask one last question on the maintenance side. We were expecting maintenance to come down. It looks like maybe it came down a little bit faster. Was that a timing issue? Or are you seeing any kind of improvements on how you're thinking about the maintenance trend? And maybe some of it is just as you fly less as well, that's helping.\nWade Steel: Save, this is Wade. So yes, we've been talking about our maintenance expense coming down for the last several quarters. And we've made very large investments over the past couple of years in our fleet, both in engines and airframes, and we're starting to see the dividends of that. We've also -- as part of what we've been doing, we optimize -- we've been optimizing our engine -- our maintenance expense to what we think will be flying in our fleet for the rest of the year. And so yes, we will continue to see maintenance approximately at these levels throughout the rest of the year.\nSavi Syth: And then, just I apologize one last question and maybe for Rob. Just CapEx seems to have come down a little bit of the expectations, but maybe I have that wrong. Any kind of revised thoughts on kind of capital use and just cash flow given that it might take longer here for things to recover.\nRob Simmons: No real changes, Savi. I mean we've got these 28 new E175s that are the bulk of the $800 plus million of CapEx that we expect to do this year. Obviously, given the number of new deliveries, which we're obviously very excited about, CapEx is a little heavier than normal this year, but for great reasons.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catie O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatie O'Brien: Good afternoon, everyone. Sorry about that. I pressed -- I was anxious and pressed star one again and accidentally took myself out of the queue, but I'll ask one, but I got quite a few here. So I'll get started. So I guess, pilot shortage major theme on every call this season. I guess, first, just a follow-up to Savi's question. Can you just give us some more details on like what exactly were you able to optimize in terms of like your aircraft allocation, you able to reduce -- there's like a been a 10-point improvement in your block hour production for this year, that, that just feels pretty significant. So I guess that's the first one.\nWade Steel: Yes. So Catie, this is Wade. So the biggest thing we did was just looked at our training footprint and how we're training folks, what we're doing, what aircraft we're putting them in, making sure that it's the most efficient training footprints that we can, and we've made some very good progress during this quarter on optimizing both our training footprint and where we are going to be -- what airplanes we are going to be flying and made some decisions to say these are the levels we're going to be flying and I helped out on some other aircraft types. And so a lot of it is just with the training footprint, which airplanes we're going to be prioritizing and really getting our pilot professionals through the training footprint as quickly as we can.\nCatie O'Brien: Okay. And then I know there are going to be a lot of puts and takes, but given the trends you're seeing now on attrition and your training footprint and then an ability to build your pipeline, when do you think you'll have the pilot roughly to get back to 2019 block hour production? Or is there a chance you're going to be a smaller company on a fairly longer-term basis?\nChip Childs: So Catie, that's a great question. This is Chip. And I think that our perspective is to be prepared for a wide range of outcomes. I think that when you look at what we're focused on, we've kind of indicated in the script, the way the math works under existing attrition models as well as what we have from a comfort level within the hiring pipeline and the data around first officer upgrades particularly coming out of a pandemic, the data is pointing that we can recover and get the pilots we need starting in late 2023 and going into 2024. So at that point, also, Catie, you can imagine that our fleet looks entirely different in 2024 than it did in 2019, a lot more dual-class aircraft, a lot less single class aircraft. So again, I think the main element here is, we're looking at a wide range of opportunities. Demand is driving us from a business perspective to take a look at our assets that are particularly in this economy, well priced, well financed and it's given us some good flexibility to determine what we want to do through some of these challenges. And I think that from our perspective, we are tooled and have the right things on our side to make sure that we can capitalize on some very good strong things, as long as we're disciplined and aggressive by the time we get to 2024.\nCatie O'Brien: Okay. And so maybe there's a rule -- a rule hereon coming out from the shortage of shared chip. I know you've given us some color on earnings per share trajectory for this year, but as we see theoretically about what it takes to get back to 2019 margins, what are the puts and takes? Do we need to wait till the end of 2023 to get closer back to block hour production? Or given the fact that some of the hindrances that your labor force is smaller, right, so the costs that have come out of the system and some other adjustments you've made in addition to deferred revenue recognition and to your point, like higher concentration, more profitable dual-class aircraft like could we get back to 2019 margins before we get back to 2019 black hour production? I know that's a packed question but we love your thoughts.\nRob Simmons: Well, hey, Catie, this is Rob. So I would say that just a reminder that the biggest tailwind we've got right now, again, is the strong demand that we keep referencing. So it's not a demand-driven shortfall at this point. It's a constraint of resources. So again, as we talked about, the next few years, we're going to have sort of different cost structures from a labor standpoint, there's no question about that. But I think there are a lot of good things happening. We're investing for the long term. The airplanes that we're putting into service over the next year or two are going to start reading through to our margin and our results starting in 2024. So I mean, look, I can't tell you when or if our margins will be back to 2019 levels. But I can tell you that there's a lot of good things that we're seeing out there, and we're in a position to be able to invest for that long game in a way that maybe others aren't able to do.\nCatie O'Brien: And then one more, if I could. I think for Wade probably. Just speaking to another one of Chip's points on well-priced assets, can you just give us an update on where you see opportunities to for your leasing business if you do think there are growth opportunities, I know you mentioned some incremental engine opportunities during the prepared remarks. But what is the potential pool of aircraft and engines, you're looking to lease over the next year or two look like? I'm just trying to think through like aircraft supply is also a bit tight right now, so there's more demand, but then you've got maybe some offset on pilot availability driving some decisions with some of the third-parties you look to do this with. So just any color here would be great.\nWade Steel: Yes. Catie, this is Wade. So there's a couple of new and interesting kind of opportunities. As we've kind of started to explore different opportunities out there, a of these 135 carriers are definitely reaching out to us about our existing asset base, right? As Chip said, we have over 200 -- CRJ200s that are extremely well priced. They've been maintained by the best airline in the country for 25 years. We have the best engine agreement. And so there's been very good demand from a lot of a -- lot of small airlines associated with our CRJ platforms. And I'll tell you, the engine interest in that fleet is also extremely strong, right? They -- we have a very good engine agreement with our OEM. And a lot of these smaller airlines just don't have the size and the buying power that we have associated with that fleet. And so those are probably -- those are two very good opportunities right there for us. And then as you look at the engines that are on the 700s, the 900s, there is a very large wave of engine events coming for the industry in the next couple of years. And SkyWest has invested heavily in those engines during 2019, during 2020, during 2021, we made very large investments in those, and we are very well prepared for that. And we've had a lot of interest from other airlines in potentially helping them through their wave and their model, hopefully, that they could avoid engine events by leasing from us. And so there are some pretty good opportunities out there, both on our CRJ200 and then the engines associated with the 700 to 900.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Chip Childs.\nChip Childs: Thanks, Brent. Thank you all for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate your interest in SkyWest. I'll close by saying that despite the headwinds we're facing, demand, again, is strong, and we have the resources and strategy to navigate the long game. And again, I want to thank our people for their great work and continued flexibility. With that, we'll end the call, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 4, "year": 2021, "date": "2022-02-03 21:46:06", "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SkyWest Inc. Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Mr. Rob Simmons, SkyWest Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nRob Simmons: Thanks, everyone for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer and Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer.  I'd like to start today by asking Eric to read the safe harbor. Then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results, then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2020 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. We continue to see very strong demand for our product during the fourth quarter and beyond, while we're facing new headwinds as the industry prepares to operate in a post-pandemic environment, we remain focused on delivering an exceptional product as we enter the next phase of the recovery. Recapping our fourth quarter results, we reported pretax income of $5 million and net income of $4 million. As expected and previously communicated, Q4 results are absent any PSP grants or concessions, which concluded in the third quarter. The holiday travel period was disrupted by the rapid surge in the Omicron variant that began the last week in December and through the month of January. The combination of Winter weather and the surge in COVID cases over the final peak travel period over the year led to a lengthy irregular operation even as we began the New Year and well into January. There were countless accounts of employees who went above and beyond during this challenge and I want to thank our people for their flexibility and good work during this difficult period. I want to address the current environment and where we are today. We continue to experience very strong demand for our flying in all fleet types. We expect to place 46 new E175s into service this year and one more in 2023, putting us at 240 E175s in service by early next year. Our refleeting that has been in progress for the last several years continues to be a priority as we execute on our long-term strategy. While demand is solid, we are facing new headwinds as the industry prepares to operate in a post-pandemic environment. SkyWest is fortunate to enjoy the ability to attract and retain exceptional professionals across our operation. We maintain a robust hiring pipeline and strategy for all work groups and have new hire pilot classes field well into summer. We have long been preparing for an increase in the mainline pilot retirements, however, the 6,000 early retirements taken at the majors during COVID and the steep demand recovery has resulted in a new much higher demand for experienced SkyWest pilots, particularly captains. This demand has created an imbalance of pilots here and across the regional industry. Of course, pilot attrition was anticipated and planned for in our models and strategies. However, the rapid increase in captain attrition was not. So while our pipeline for new pilots is strong, we expect that upgrade timing creates an imbalance and production constraint for the next year or so. To help correct this imbalance, we're working with our major partners to notably reduce schedules for the foreseeable future and have worked with our pilot group to implement upgrade and retention incentives. We have also worked with our partners to offer our pilot sustainable pathways, including guaranteed pilot interview programs for captains. Overall, these disciplined strategies to work with both our partners and our pilot group have already begun producing results. But given the timing we acquired for training and upgrade, this imbalance will likely constrain production into early 2023. This pilot imbalance is an industry-wide challenge as services in various ways and we are working together with our people to ensure that we remain in the best position to manage it aggressively. With 46 new E175 going into service in 2022, we continue to play the long game. We had embedded flexibility in our prorate model to allow for the flex up and down of our prorate flying. And we are utilizing that flexibility going forward to significantly reduce prorate so that we can continue to deliver the highest reliability across our operation. In short, we are aggressively reducing our prorate flying now with the option to flex back up as resources allow. Against this backdrop, we're very honored and humbled to have been named one of Forbes' best large employers for the second year running in 2022. The past couple of years have been incredibly challenging for all of our teams and our ability to work together with our people is the reason for our success. I want to thank our nearly 15,000 employees for their dedication and teamwork. In summary, 2022 looks to be the next phase of our COVID recovery and while demand for our product has never been stronger, the current staffing imbalance and ongoing refleeting doesn't allow us to monetize that demand in the short-term. As a result, we expect block hour production in 2022 to be down 10% to 15% from the 2021 production. We expect this will be another transition year with breakeven profit similar to 2021, excluding government grant income. Our strong balance sheet and cash position remain key differentiators for SkyWest. We are focused on rebalancing our pilot staffing and ensuring our resources are well allocated to deliver a solid and reliable product. We remain aggressive and deliberate in the steps we're taking now to ensure we are well positioned for 2024 and beyond. Rob will now take us through the financial data.\nRob Simmons: Today, we reported fourth quarter GAAP net income of $4 million or $0.09 diluted earnings per share. Q4 pretax income was $5 million. Our diluted share count for Q4 was 50.8 million shares and our effective tax rate in Q4 was 14%. First, let's talk about revenue. Total Q4 revenue of $777 million is up 32% from Q4 2020, consistent with our year-over-year block hour production increase of 30% and Q4 revenue is up 4% from Q3. As discussed last quarter, our Q3 revenue included certain revenue concessions to our partners related to government COVID support. Q4 revenue breaks down with contract revenue up 29% from Q4 2020 and up 9% from Q3. Prorate revenue was $109 million in Q4, up 53% year-over-year and down 15% from last quarter. Leasing and other revenue is up 28% year-over-year and flat sequentially. These GAAP results include the effect of a release of $23 million of deferred revenue this quarter, compared to $19 million released in Q3 and $21 million that was deferred during Q4 2020. As of the end of Q4, we have $104 million of cumulative deferred revenue, that will be recognized in future periods. As discussed last quarter, the timing and amount of future deferrals or reversals into revenue depends on the shape and cadence of the recovery of our flying. All deferred revenue will be reversed into revenue by the end of the various contract periods. As expected, we did not have any additional grant income recognized in Q4. Let me move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $860 million, down from $913 million last quarter. Our CapEx during the fourth quarter was $322 million for 12 new E175 aircraft, four used CRJ700 aircraft and other fixed assets. Total 2021 CapEx was $556 million, including the purchase of 18 new E175 aircraft, 11 used CRJ700's and other fixed assets. This compares to $438 million in CapEx in 2020. We ended Q4 with debt of $3.1 billion, down from $3.2 billion as of year-end 2020. The only government debt we have on our balance sheet is a total of $201 million in PSP 10-year unsecured no amortization, low coupon loans. Let me say a couple of things about liquidity. As of December 31st, '21, our cash position of $860 million included the effect this quarter of having repaid an incremental $92 million of debt before adding $237 million of debt financing for the 12 new E175s. We also have approximately $1.5 billion of unpledged collateral that could be deployed for additional liquidity if ever needed. As of 12/31, 2021, our debt net of cash balance is actually $224 million lower than it was pre-COVID at the end of 2019. Additional flexibility comes from the fact that including partner-owned aircraft, over 50% of our fleet in service now has no financing obligation. Especially in times of great uncertainty like this and consistent with our policy and practice, we are not in a position to give any specific EPS guidance at this time, but let me give you a little color. First, at this time, we expect 2022 to be roughly breakeven for earnings, flat with 2021, excluding over $200 million of government grants, net of partner revenue concessions that were recognized in 2021. Similarly, we expect EBITDA in 2022 to be in the neighborhood of $500 million, also similar to 2021 adjusted for the net grant benefit. Second, we expect block hour production in 2022 to be down 10% to 15% from 2021 production related to the staffing imbalance as we focus on growing our ERJ fleet and pulling down some of our CRJ fleet. The staffing challenges related to COVID, mix and attrition have extended our COVID transition for another year or two. Third, we won't see the full-year impact of the 47 accretive new E175 aircraft going into service in 2022 and early 2023 until 2024. 31 of these are growth aircraft, 16 are replacing other CRJ900 flying. Fourth, we will continue to focus on liquidity and expect to end 2022 with a strong cash position in spite of having a strong delivery pipeline of 28 accretive new E175s this year. 2022 being flat with 2021 with breakeven profitability is caused primarily by lower expected year-over-year production from the labor imbalance, higher investments in labor and training to go after the imbalance, offset partially by lower maintenance expense in 2022. We believe that the actions we are taking now to focus on the growth of our ERJ fleet work through the pilot imbalance affecting the industry and preserve the optionality of bringing back CRJ opportunities over time will position us strongly in the regional sector. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I'll provide a fleet and production status update, as well as an update on our prorate and leasing businesses. To update by partner, last quarter, we announced an agreement with Delta to add 16 new E175s. We anticipate these aircraft will be placed into service beginning in the middle of this year through the first part of 2023. These aircraft will replace 16 older SkyWest-owned CRJ900 aircraft currently operating under contract with Delta. After we take delivery of these aircraft, we will have 87 E175s under long-term contracts with Delta. Under our American contract, we currently have 90 CRJ700s under contract and in service. We placed 25 CRJ700 into service during 2021. We also have 20 new E175 scheduled for service throughout this year. We have received 18 of those during the third and fourth quarter of 2021 and will receive two in the second quarter of this year. Together, these E175s and CRJ700s will bring our total American fleet to 110 by the end of 2022. We have an agreement with Alaska to add 11 E175s to our contract. We expect to place 10 of those aircraft into service this year and one more during the first half of 2023, for a total of 43 aircraft under long-term contracts with Alaska. After we take delivery of the E175s currently on order, our fleet will be 240 E175s. The demand for our E175 remain very strong and is becoming the backbone of our flying. Let me review our current production. Based on the current schedules we have from our major partners for the first quarter of 2022, we anticipate that our block hours will decrease by approximately 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. As we look to Q2 2022, we anticipate that our Q2 block hours will be 11% lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. Let me talk a little bit about our prorate business. We anticipate that our prorate model will continue to decrease during 2022 and 2023, as we expect to reallocate most of these block hours to our contract fleet. We have intentionally built flexibility into our prorate model and will preserve that flexibility to return this flying once we are comfortable with our staffing balance. Shifting gears to our leasing business, we currently have 39 CRJ700s and 900s under long-term leases with third parties. This line of business has very good cash flow and strong margin characteristics. Demand for our engine leasing business is returning and we anticipate placing several engines under long-term leases this year. Next year, we'll have 16 CRJ900s that come out of the Delta contract and are not currently placed. We anticipate placing these aircraft in our leasing entity after removal from the Delta contract, where we may pursue leasing opportunities for the aircraft or engines. We have spent the last several years reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility to ensure we're well positioned. This flexibility will continue to be a differentiator for us and we are committed to continuing our work with each of our major partners to provide solutions.\nRob Simmons: Okay, operator, we're ready for our Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Simmons. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Could you provide maybe Wade, appreciate the block hour kind of cadence a little bit as well through the year. But I was curious is that mostly then coming out of safety prorate and CPA stays a little bit more steady? Or could you provide a little color as to kind of where that reduction is coming from in terms of segment and maybe kind of aircraft type? And the -- and how this has maybe changed versus how you were thinking about it during the last earnings call?\nWade Steel: Yes, Savi, this is Wade. Yeah, so as I said in my script, we expect Q1 to be down about 5% compared to Q4 2021 and Q2 to be down 11% compared to Q4, 2021. The majority of that as I talked about, we are reallocating several of the block hours from our prorate model into our contract models. We have also seen kind of an overall decrease in utilization and primarily in our CRJ fleet, but we've seen a little bit of reduction also in our E175 daily utilization as well.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And then if would -- and Rob, maybe this is for you, just as you talk about kind of breakeven profit for the year, is that fair to assume that kind of making money over the summer and losing in one losing income in 1Q, 4Q? Or is there something about this year where the normal seasonality would not play out?\nRob Simmons: Yeah, I mean the breakeven guidance is obviously meant for the full-year. But yeah, there will be some of the usual cadence throughout the seasons.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And if I might ask one last kind of longer-term question. Chip, you mentioned that a lot of this, hopefully, kind of gets resolved as we get into 2023. I'm just kind of curious, is there anything that you're seeing today that's a little bit more kind of a permanent change where maybe certain aspects of your kind of business model that worked in kind of the prior business cycle maybe does not come back in kind of when things recover.\nChip Childs: Savi that's -- again, this is Chip, that's a great question because I think back to a couple of your questions, there is something that's foundationally changed in our business model relative to this. I would honestly say that as we made our way through particularly the month of January on the backdrop that we have incredible recruiting of pilot, attrition is certainly higher and we're adapting to higher attrition. We also have adapted to higher hiring, so for the record our overall hiring continues to outpace attrition. But I think that one of the things that we've experienced just recently is the pressure on the captain seat relative to specifically our major partners, hiring primarily Captains. Probably the paradigm has been in the past, our attrition was like 50-50 first officer to Captain and it's probably moved to 75-25. So look, I think that as you can understand the sensitivity in some of these models, we certainly have relooked at the way we are going to allocate resources and do the things we think are good for the long-term to invest in the right level at the right place within our business model, with Captain upgrades and those types of things that are going to get us to where we need to be in the long-term. So there's a bit of conservatism and caution in the breakeven analysis and the block hour reductions. But again, everything is making sure that we pivot in the right timing and in the right way to be positioned really, really well for the long-term.\nSavi Syth: Appreciate that, thanks.\nOperator: Next we have Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Just, I guess, a quick question here, Wade. What is the fleet count, the total fleet count at the end of 2022 versus the end of 2021? Do you have those numbers handy?\nWade Steel: So at the end of 2021, you can look in our release today. As of today, we have for out the end of the year, we have 509 aircraft. A couple of things that we'll be working on as I talked in my script, after we take delivery of all of our current E175s, we will have 240 E175s under long-term contracts. The CRJ side is more -- especially the CRJ200 is more of a flexible fleet, right? And so we are going to have a lot of flexibility around our CRJ200 fleet if we continue to have good hiring, get caught back up on our balance. We will be opportunistic and be able to put some of those back in there. So we're going to have a lot of flexibility going forward on what we do. So right now, it's probably a little too early to say what we will be at the end of 2022, but we do know we will have 240 E175s under long-term contracts.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. And then when you lose a Captain to a major, and I guess more specifically a major who happens to be one of your partners. As a consequence, we're seeing all airlines being forced to take rates up. And so, what sort of protection do you have under the CTA that as you take up your pay rates for first officers and Captains so that you can continue to get a healthy flow of feedstock that that's not going to undermine your margins in your CPAs? Are you protected especially when some of this is being driven by your partners, some of this wage inflation?\nChip Childs: So, Mike, this is Chip, that's an exceptional question that we certainly have been dealing with in last for decades. The idea of raise new sets and the strategies around all of that, we've anticipated some of that when we knew about the pilot shortage five years ago, six years ago, 10 years ago. And from our perspective, there's a couple of dynamics that we have as you look at the -- our fleet and the length of contract, we have a lot of rate renewals coming up starting at the end of 2023. They get heavier in 2024 and 2025. To give color, our strategy is always with a fleet like our CRJ fleet that is very unencumbered, yet very valuable. We typically enter into short-term contracts for those shorter-term two to three years. Certainly, when we're going to go and put this type of capital outlay for 175, those are longer-term. But the way we handle those in the contract, there's a couple of opportunities to look at it. But back to your question, as we've evaluated this issue and what we have to do to make sure that we get good aviation professionals into our system, retain them, train them and do the things that provide the value that they do for us. We contemplated those economics and that's -- we can't fix it in a year, but as we move forward with our partners, there's a good dialogue and conversation about the long-term business plan in this situation.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Great. And just if I can squeeze in one last one. When I think about your fleet and the fact that the E175 as you said it is the backbone and you do fly into a lot of smaller cities. And you can see the some of the issues, the 5G issues that carriers are facing, especially those who operate some of these smaller jets, the Embraer aircraft in and around airports, say, like a Key West, for example, which is a market that you may go in and out of or other markets. What are you seeing on that front? And what -- do you have a good sense of timing when this will actually get resolved, these alternative sort of methods to deal with this, the alternative methods of compliance? Are we going to get something very soon with the Embraer planes, are we going to still be dealing with this problem three to six months from now? And obviously, that will have some impact on your ability to dispatch and operate and obviously, consequently take costs higher. Just any sort of light at the end of the tunnel on this? Thank you.\nChip Childs: Yeah, look I think from our fleet specific, look, we got [Amax] out there for our fleet. We have not seen a major amount of disruption on this issue like maybe other regional carriers have.\nMike Linenberg: Great.\nChip Childs: That's your bigger question, do we think that there is something going to happen in the near-term to fix this? I'm not optimistic about that. This is a big issue between the aviation industry and the cellular carriers. And so look I think that this is something from our perspective first and foremost, we're going to be safe in our approach to this. We're going to be very transparent in collaborating with the FAA and those and our manufacturers. So we're all over the issue. It's a big enough issue, I wouldn't assume that we're going to be rid of [Amax] anytime soon and have a permanent solution.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Thanks, Chip. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Next, we have Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you. Appreciate the time. Can you help us frame the gap between demand and your ability to execute? So for example, obviously, the 1Q is a little squirrely, but if you think about the June quarter relative to that block hour guidance that you gave us, how much higher would that be if you didn't have these constraints? And is it all prorate flying that you're cutting? Or is there some CPA flying that you just can't really deliver in this environment?\nWade Steel: Yeah, Duane, this is Wade. So we've been working with all of our major partners on our schedules as we talked about. The demand is extremely strong. It would -- we'd probably 10% to 15% higher if we were able to fix our imbalance and our staffing issues. And it's been a mix of both. We've pulled down both prorate and we've reduced utilization on our contract fleet as well. So the demand is extremely strong out there. We're going to continue to work with our partners, but we are going to have a balanced approach on how we do this between prorate and decreasing contract utilization.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. That's super helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up to one of Mike's questions. Can you speak to this from a network perspective, what is the profile of markets that are losing service here? Is this all about frequency, kind of any anecdotes you could share about the markets that are losing as a result of these constraints would be great.\nWade Steel: Yeah, so Duane, this is Wade again. So it's a combination once again of both. We've looked at frequency. There may have been a market pre-pandemic that we're having three to four flights a day into that market. Now we're down to one or two something like that. There are certain markets that are going to go dark, right, that just won't have service going forward from SkyWest. So it's going to be a combination of both frequency and there'll be certain markets as you've probably seen that just aren't going to have service.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then maybe just for my last on this Eve partnership, I know it's very early, but when do you think you'd be in a position to take delivery of some of these new aircraft types? And then just conceptually, how are you thinking about utilizing these? Would you be flying them on behalf of majors? Would it be your own service? And any thoughts on the type of pilot that would be required to operate that. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Really appreciate it.\nWade Steel: Yeah, Duane, this is Wade again. So as far as the good partnership with them and the Eve entity, we think it's a great thing for our sustainability initiatives as well. As far as delivery of these, these are going to be more in the back half of the decade for sure. We're still working on potential commercial solution for this. We don't have those quite yet. We're still developing an operating plan. So this is still very much a work in progress, but we want to get out in front of it and start working with Embraer and some potential solutions here.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. I'm so sorry to be persistent there, but again, super long range conceptually, would this potentially replace some of the flying that you've done historically on like 50-seat CRJs? Or is it just a totally different network thought?\nWade Steel: Yeah, it's a totally different network thought. The 50 seaters have a average stage length of 350 miles to 400 miles, this aircraft or this vehicle will not have near that range. So -- and it's something, it's more in urban-type setting than it is in the regional historical markets.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we have Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Oh, thanks very much. Hi, everybody and thank you very much for your time. Just maybe a couple of questions. The one question I had was one of the issues you guys talked about last year with maintenance and the ability to get spare parts to getting aircraft out of maintenance, is that an issue that's now behind you?\nWade Steel: Yeah, Helane, this is Wade. So we made a very large investment during 2021 in getting our fleet prepared. And generally from a C check perspective, I think at the end of the year, we had approximately 30 lines of C checks or heavy maintenance going on. And that issue is resolving itself right now and we're getting in a very good position. And it will -- and our maintenance expense as we look forward into 2022, we do see a decrease in our maintenance expense going forward.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Wade. And then my other question is with respect to the cancellations or I don't know how you want to classify them, but flying the fewer block hours. Is it a -- is it -- do you have to pay penalties? Or are you able to negotiate that away?\nWade Steel: Yeah, so Helane, this is Wade again. So we've been working with our major partners on these issues and many other issues during the pandemic. Now as we emerge from the pandemic, we've been dealing with utilization issues for a while. And we've been able to work with them very collaborative on solving these issues. And so that that's something that we're working very, very much hand-in-hand with our partners right now. And we've got great relationships with all of our major partners. And so that's something that we're working through as we speak.\nHelane Becker: Okay. So are there penalties included in the -- as a deduction to revenue then for last year? Or I know -- maybe you can walk me through how the revenue comes in offset by the revenue you were or whatever you want to call it, credits. You were giving them for the government financing offset by the penalties for not being able to live up to the commitments you made because of the staffing issues that are caused by them hiring your people away, okay?\nWade Steel: Yeah, and that's the complexity with this issue, Helane, is they've -- a lot of this is on the industry issues. And in our forecast, we definitely have a reduction in our block hours and the associated revenue associated with that.\nHelane Becker: Okay. All right. I will be less persistent than my colleagues and let you go. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we have Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. My first question I think is a bit of a follow-up to something along lines Helene and Duane are both asking you, so forgive me. But I understand staffing is what's driving the lower block outlook for this year. But could you like walk us through how that decision gets made between you and your partners? Like for 2022 specifically is that you're going to them to say, you only have crew to fly x number of block hours? Or is some of that decision also your partner is coming to you to say they need you to fly less than you're technically capable of because they don't have ground staff and some other workers, they need to run a full regional operation.\nChip Childs: Yeah, so Katy, this is Chip. Just relative to the process on that, it's actually a very seamless process. It's one thing I think that we have demonstrated, we're probably one of the best at in the entire industry, where we foundationally feel that, that communication and transparency is absolutely critical, primarily because of the demand that our partners want us to fly today. Back to a previous question, I mean, our reduction in block hours that we're talking about is based upon what we thought we were going to likely be able to provide three months ago. I can tell you that the actual demand for that what we thought we were going to produce three months ago is even much higher than that. So to go back to your point, who says what? I mean right now, they are asking us to fly a tremendous amount of flying more than we have even contracts for. Our perspective is, we are very transparent with them about our staffing needs. Given the fact that they're hiring our people, they know exactly what is happening to the model as well. And in the spirit of three main things, one, we want to provide an outstanding opportunity for all of our aviation professionals to go directly through these partners that we fly for. That's an outstanding model that our partners have absolutely embraced. And two, we are typically the ones that are saying that here's our staffing models. We want to make sure that we deliver for you, we know we can, particularly in the most sensitive times. And we give them what our estimate is and they digest it and work through it and it can even be domicile and location specific, but also in general we do this long ways out. So to get to the plan that we've presented to you guys so far, there's been a lot of thought going into it, there's been a lot of assumptions going into it. And there's been some caution this year quite candidly with all of our partners and they all have worked really well with that dialogue. And goes to the fact that they value the product that we produce on a daily basis and yet also value our employees, which is also outstanding from our view.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Great. That's really helpful to understand the puts and takes between demand and staffing. Maybe we could -- it would be great to get some stats on the attrition, low-cost carrier, call it yesterday, attrition for them usually 5% or 6%, now it's low double digit based on commentary from other airlines on where they're hiring their pilots from, I'm guessing that might be a bit more acute than you. Any figures you can give us on attrition lately versus where you're running at in '18 or '19?\nChip Childs: Yeah, I mean given the sensitivity that we have four partners and not our own brand compared to what others have, we're going to probably keep those statistics internal. But I would tell you that the statistics of us pulling down flying in 2022 by 10% to 15%, probably that's relatively well with what the attrition is. So I think that's about as far as -- given the nature of our relationship with our partners, we're probably best and I'll leave at that.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Got it. I won't [indiscernible]. Maybe just one more quick modeling one if I can. With block hours down 10% to 15% for next year, do you expect to book deferred revenue from prior periods? Just trying to get a sense of what like the threshold is for that as you did book deferred revenue in the last two quarters, the block hours down a bit, the relative compare was a little bit closer to '19 than what you're expecting over the course of next year. Thanks.\nRob Simmons: Hey, Katy, this is Rob. So on the topic of deferred revenue going into the New Year, we've got around $100 million of deferred revenue sitting on the books. Again, the timing of how that will be unwound will -- is still little bit up in the air. It depends on sort of what the cadence of our recovery looks like, but the key to that is that that's revenue that for which we've collected the cash already. So -- but I don't know that we're going to spend too many calories on modeling that to perfection. But again, it will all be reversed by the time the individual contracts that represented that $100 million of deferred revenue by the time those expire, all that revenue will eventually flow through for sure.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Do you think it's like really going to come back to you on that one, Rob?\nRob Simmons: Sure.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Because I think in the past that you've guided to is that as you approach '19 levels of block hours, that's when we should start to see that come back online and that's held like down 5, 10 block hours in the fourth quarter, we saw some of that revenue show back up. I guess just like looking back historically in a quarter where you maybe even down 10%, 15%, have you been able to book that deferred revenue or no? Thanks so much for all the time.\nRob Simmons: Sure, Katy. No, that's fine. So look, I think if you go back and look at 2021 as an analog, some of the early quarters of the year, which were still sort of in recovery mode. We did book a little more revenue in the first half of the year. And then in wound $19 million in Q3 and then wound $23 million in Q4. So you've got the cadence of how the block hours work there. So I think as you go forward, it will unwind slowly over the next few years as those contracts again approach their expiration point. And again, if things get stronger than we expected in '23 or '24 that will be likely wiped out by the end of that window.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Thank you very much. And to get to you 111 CRJ700s with American by mid-2023 or because of the current issues, is that getting deferred? And it also seemed like there were maybe a couple more with the last seven we had heard before. Wondering if what the changes were there?\nWade Steel: Yeah, Savi, this is Wade. So just on the American side, we are working with them on the timing of that. I do not anticipate that the 700s will come in the first half. Right now, we have the ability to work with them and push them out into the second half and we'll continue to work with those guys on our staffing models as we get better clarity. And yes, on the Alaska question, that is correct they were two more added, so...\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, great. Thank you. And I don't know if this is for Chip. I know they're kind of conceptual industry question. Just I realize maybe M&A is unlikely for SkyWest given your size, but do you think from a regional airline industry perspective, the whole industry might benefit from further consolidation so that you're not wasting resources in terms of recruiting and training pilots and fly defendants and mechanics. And more importantly, what's your sense of with your partners have the appetite to see kind of further consolidation in the regional airline industry.\nChip Childs: Yeah, Savi, this is Chip. I don't know exactly how our partners would view that. I know we are so anti-M&A at this point as our history has proven that it has not worked out great for us. I think that from our perspective, we still -- even under the current situation prefer an organic process to grow and to recover and all the things we want to do. We have the ability and reputation to attract outstanding aviation professionals and like we said earlier, that's not the headwind we're talking about right now and that continues to be strong. So that data point being strong really does take the M&A side out of the equation for us.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Thanks. All right, thanks.\nOperator: Next we have Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks for the follow-up. I just wondered if there was any movement on the 1,500-hour rule. I mean, if you look what used to be here in the US and clearly much, much lower requirements in other geographies in Europe, et cetera. Do you think there's any chance for kind of movement just given the constraints we're seeing across the industry?\nChip Childs: Duane, this is Chip. It's a great question and I fundamentally, as you know, we have been working on this issue for a decade. And I think that is -- I think to your previous question, as we continue to get out of various flying in smaller communities, some cities will lose service altogether, some will drastically reduce frequency. I can tell you is we've had those conversations with the small communities, we were having politicians finally engaged after more than a decade of this talk. So I guess my point is, do we think there will be a movement in 1,500 hours. I will tell you, I don't know the answer, but there is more engagement than ever before in that dialogue. I think certainly even things like ESG and those types of things, why we are having people fly a 172 for that much time where we know the data points are very clear, they are much more efficient and safer ways to get it done. That data is extraordinarily compelling. We are very much in a mindset that if somebody wants to continue particularly politicians have this dialogue. We have the data, we have real life now as we talked about on the phone call today, that's going to show what we've been saying for over 10 years. So I'm hopeful, the data points point to something like this, but again, it's a very interesting political environment that we're at. We fundamentally believe that the FAA also has the ability to do some things with this that would be extraordinarily helpful and we hope that, that dialogue continues to take place because at the end of the day there are plans in place to make a safer and more efficient process for people to become aviation professionals and we love the prospects. We've been talking about it for a long time and hopefully we can get more traction now than ever.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the thoughts.\nOperator: Next we have again Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Yeah, you know I just chip, I was thinking on Duane's question also with [Avi's] question about, one, how do you address this? And obviously, you said that you rather kind of grow organically. But there are some sizable Part 135 carriers out there with a lot of pilots, I don't know maybe it brings on another airplane type, but it does bring on a lot of capable pilots, many with hours that probably aren't that far away from 1,500. And maybe some of the communities that you've pulled out of, those are markets that maybe would work with some of these smaller airplanes. Again, I -- that may be the beauty of like investing in these either mobility that, that becomes sort of your pipeline because you don't have to worry about the 1,500-hour rule, but unfortunately we're not going to get that platform for, I don't know five years, eight years, 10 years. So I don't know, I don't know if you've looked at a 135 carrier because there are several out there, and there's some that...\nChip Childs: Michael, this is Chip. You cut off, but I will -- I think I know what your question is going to be and I will answer it. Just relative to what you're talking about for 135 operators, we do have a different view of that. And we have a lot of relationships with some outstanding 135 operators. And from the perspective that we may be engaged in some partnerships or additional flying relative to that, we would be very much engaged in looking at those opportunities. But going back to the previous question, 121 operator, any consolidation there we would not be interested in.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Chip Childs for closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Eli and thanks to everyone for joining us again on the call today. We appreciate your interest in SkyWest. I'll just close by saying a couple of things. Despite some of the headwinds we're facing, the demand for our product has really never been stronger. We will continue to work with our partners and our people to navigate the next phase of the recovery and we're confident in a very strong hiring pipeline as we work through this current staffing and balance. Again, I want to thank you and thank our people for the great work that they do and the continued flexibility that they have and their ability to look at the things that we need to accomplish long-term. With that, we'll end the call and talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 3, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-10-29 00:21:09", "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SkyWest, Inc. Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Robert Simmons, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nRobert Simmons: Thanks, Tina and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As Tina indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; and Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer. I'd like to start today by asking Eric to read the safe harbor. Then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results, then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2020 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. The third quarter is typically our busiest flying season and this year is no exception despite what continues to be a somewhat bumpy recovery for our industry. While we continue to navigate the evolving COVID-19 situation and its impacts, our fleet remains critical to the industry recovery and demand for our product is very strong. Throughout this challenging period, we've remained focused on several key priorities. First, to take care of our people. Second, to remain agile to deliver on our partners' needs. And third, to provide a solid product while minimizing the risk and preserving our liquidity. Recapping our third quarter results, we reported pretax income of $14 million in net income of $10 million. These results include our financial -- these results include our final quarter of payroll support program grants and partner revenue concessions. We took delivery of six new E175s for our American operation during the quarter. These are the first of this fleet type that we will operate for American and we look forward to placing them into contract flying early next year. As previously announced, we have secured an agreement with Delta for 16 additional E175s which will also be arriving next year along with nine E175s for Alaska. This will be a combined total of 45 new E175s going into service over the next 1.5 years. These agreements reflect the current work we're doing to help lead the recovery as well as the importance of the dual-class fleet in that effort. Overall, these new E175s help us make meaningful progress toward our fleet transition by adding dual-class aircraft, enhancing fleet flexibility and mitigating risk over the next couple of years. We continue to prepare and invest for the long term and this includes building reliability into our existing fleet. Maintenance costs associated with investment remain elevated and the volume and duration of maintenance events are much higher than they've been historically. We expect these costs -- we expect these costs to plateau this year and will settle back to a new level next year. We've also strategically embedded flexibility into our prorate model to allow for the flex up and down of our prorate flying relative to the demand and partner need. While prorate is slightly profitable in the quarter, we continue to exercise flexibility in that model to ensure that our resources are allocated toward the best economic opportunity. Our strong balance sheet and cash position remain key differentiators for SkyWest. We are working across all areas of the operation to ensure we're continually adapting to the changing climate and responding to what our partners need from us and operational performance remains a focus. Despite the clear difficulties associated with an uneven recovery, we achieved a 99.8% adjusted completion for the third quarter with nearly 73,000 more scheduled fly from the same quarter last year. I again want to thank our incredible team of professionals who continue to demonstrate flexibility, teamwork and dedication to delivering a solid product in any situation. Last Thursday, we experienced an IT server disrupted that affected our operations. Its impact was compounded by the size of our operation and [Phonetic] the currents during one of our busiest banks of the day. Our analysis of this event is extensive and ongoing to make sure we prevent a reoccurrence in the future. After the system was restored, it took us some time to get crews and planes back in place through [Phonetic]. This was an inexcusable event and I want to thank our many teams across the operation, who sprang into action the moment the system was restored to reposition aircraft and crews and to help re-accommodate customers following the outage. There are many reports of SkyWest people from all work groups going above and beyond. I want to extend a huge thank you to our remarkable team of 14,000 professionals on the front lines who stepped up in a big way to take care of customers and each other. Working together with our people to successfully navigate this dynamic environment remains a top priority at SkyWest. We have several programs in place to minimize the impacts of COVID-19 and to strongly encourage vaccination without implementing what has been a device of mandate nationwide. This includes paid time off incentive for employees who report full vaccination. We've also been providing COVID testing programs in certain areas of the operation for well over a year now. We also required daily health assessments and masks across the operation and are procuring additional kits for testing. With this approach, we enjoy the highest vaccination rate in the regional industry. We are evaluating how the executive order on vaccination may affect us and we are committed to working with our people to support their ability to choose as well as to protect their health and the health of our colleagues and customers. SkyWest is fortunate to enjoy and attract and retain exceptional professionals across our operation. While we maintain a robust hiring pipeline and strategy for all work groups, we have pilot classes filled well into 2022. We are focused on staying proactive and continuing to attract the best professionals as we navigate through the end of this pandemic and beyond. In summary, while there is clearly work ahead and 2022 looks to be a pandemic transition year, demand for our product remains strong and we are confident our fleet will continue to fill a critical role in the return to travel. We are focused on remaining aggressive and deliberate to take care of our people and our customers as we preserve our liquidity and execute on the recovery to emerge as a better, stronger business. Rob will now take us through the financial data.\nRobert Simmons: Today, we reported third quarter GAAP net income of $10 million or $0.19 diluted earnings per share. Adjusted net income for the third quarter was $74 million or $1.45 diluted earnings per share. Q3 pretax income was $14 million on a GAAP basis and $99 million on an adjusted basis. As outlined in the release, our adjusted income excludes a noncash impairment charge of $85 million before tax on our CRJ900 fleet that I will discuss further momentarily. Our diluted share count for Q3 was 50.7 million shares and our effective tax rate in Q3 was 31.9%. First, let's talk about revenue. Total Q3 revenue of $745 million is up 63% from Q3 2020 and is up 13% from last quarter. Q3 2021 revenue is only down 2% from Q3 2019 as the recovery continues. Our Q3 block hour production was up 14% sequentially from Q2 compared to the 13% sequential increase in revenue. Q3 revenue breaks down with contract revenue up 54% from Q3 2020 and up 12% from Q2. We have temporary partner revenue concessions impacting Q1, Q2 and Q3 of 2021 and in Q3 2020 for comparative purposes. Q3 was likely the last quarter with temporary revenue concessions. Prorate revenue was $128 million in Q3, up 111% year-over-year and up 24% from last quarter. Leasing and other revenue is up 107% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. These GAAP results include the effect of the release of $19 million of deferred revenue this quarter compared to $6 million deferred during Q2 and $30 million deferred in Q3 in '20. As of the end of Q3, we have $118 million of cumulative deferred revenue that will be recognized in future periods. As discussed last quarter, the timing and amount of future deferrals or reversals into revenue depends on the shape and cadence of the recovery of our flying. All deferred revenue will be reversed into revenue by the end of the various contract periods. Transitioning to our operating expenses. During Q3 $115 million in PSP grants was recognized as income in the form of a contra expense in our P&L. This compares to grant income of $193 million recognized in Q1 and $114 million in Q2. We do not expect any additional grant income in Q4 absent any PSP3 top-up amounts. As previously announced in August and highlighted in today's release, we reached an agreement with Delta to place 16 new E175 aircraft under a long-term contract. These E175 aircraft will replace 16 older SkyWest and CRJ900 aircraft we currently operate for Delta. Under this fleet transition, we are scheduled to have 16 displaced CRJ900s in 2022. Given the uncertainty of redeploying these displaced 900s, we reevaluated them for impairment which resulted in a noncash impairment charge of $85 million during the quarter. We expect depreciation expense on these aircraft will continue until the aircraft are removed from the Delta contract. The aggregate remaining debt and lease payment obligations on our finance of CRJ900s following the removal from the Delta contract are scheduled to be only $6 million. Let me move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $913 million, down from $956 million last quarter. Our CapEx during the third quarter was $162 million for six new E175 aircraft, one used CRJ700 aircraft, spare engines and other fixed assets. Our expectation for total 2021 CapEx is approximately $600 million to $620 million, including the purchase of 12 new E175s in the fourth quarter of this year under our previously announced contract with American. This compares to a $438 million in CapEx in 2020. We ended Q3 with debt of $3 billion, down from $3.2 billion as of year-end 2020. The only government debt we have on our balance sheet is a total of 201 million in PSP, 10 year unsecured, no amortization, low coupon loans. Let me say a couple of things about liquidity. As of September 30, 2021, our cash position of $913 million included the effect this quarter of having repaid an incremental $107 million of debt before adding $119 million of debt financing for the six new E175s. We also have approximately $1.5 billion of unpledged collateral that could be deployed for additional liquidity if ever needed. As of 9/30/2021, our debt net of cash balance is actually $421 million lower than it was pre-COVID at the end of 2019. Additional flexibility comes from the fact that including partner owned aircraft, over 50% of our fleet in service now has no financing obligation. Especially in times of great uncertainty like this and consistent with our policy and practice, we are not in a position to give any specific EPS guidance at this time. But let me give you a little color. First, we expect Q4 earnings to be roughly breakeven to slightly negative. The profit reduction from $99 million in Q3 adjusted pretax earnings to Q4 is comprised of several elements. Q4 is not expected to have any net PSP benefit, no grant income and no partner concessions. Although our block hour production in Q3 was in a couple of percentage points of Q3 2019 levels, we anticipate some softening in production schedules in Q4. Normal seasonality is expected to lower Q4 results from Q3, similar to pre-COVID patterns. Our prorate business is expected to also soften sequentially from Q3 to Q4. Prorate was only slightly profitable in Q3. Wade will talk more about this in a minute. Cancellations related to our server outage last week could end up costing us $15 million to $20 million in Q4. Second, we expect to return to 2019 production levels in 2022. 2022 maintenance expense is expected to be lower than 2021 but higher than 2019 but with some positive offsets in revenue. We won't see the full year impact of the 45 accretive new E175 aircraft until 2023, some impact in 2022. The impact in 2021 of the PSP grants net of partner concessions was a little over $200 million for the year. We're hoping to offset that in 2022 with normal operations. As a result, 2022 earnings may look similar to 2021, excluding the 2021 impairment charge. We believe that the actions we are taking now and expect to take over the next few quarters are setting us up nicely for the new normal in the future. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I'll provide a fleet and production status update as well as an update on our prorate and leasing businesses. To update by partner, during the quarter, we announced an agreement with Delta to add 16 new E175s. We anticipate these aircrafts will be placed into service beginning mid-2022 through the first part of 2023. These aircraft will replace 16 older SkyWest owned CRJ900 aircraft currently operating under contract with Delta. After we take delivery of these aircrafts, we will have 87 E175s under long-term contracts with delta. During the first nine months of 2021, we put 17 CRJ700s into service with American. We still have 19 more CRJ700s to add to our contract, eight during Q4 2021 and 11 during 2023, bringing our American CRJ700 fleet total to 101 by the middle of 2023. The majority of these CRJ700s have been in long-term storage for the past few years and require extensive maintenance work to return to surface. Also with American, we have 20 new E175s scheduled for service next year. We received six of those during the third quarter and anticipate receiving 12 more during Q4 and two in the first quarter of next year. Together, these E175s and CRJ700s will bring our total American fleet to 121 by the middle of 2023. Last quarter, we announced an agreement with Alaska to add nine more E175s to our contract. We expect to place eight of those aircrafts into service during 2022 and one aircraft during the first half of 2023 for a total of 41 under long-term contracts with Alaska. We've also extended the current fleet of 32 E175s which puts all of these aircrafts under contract with Alaska for the rest of this decade. During the second quarter we worked with all of our major partners on a third round of contract concessions which included temporary rate reductions. These concessions are reflected in our third quarter results. All concessions expired at the end of the third quarter. Let me review our current production. During the third quarter, our completed block hours were down by less than 2% compared to the same quarter in 2019. Based on the current schedules we have from our major partners for the fourth quarter of 2021, we anticipate that our block hours will decrease by approximately 5% compared to the third quarter of 2021. As we look forward to 2022, we anticipate that our block hours will be slightly higher than 2019. Let me talk a little about our prorate business which was slightly profitable in Q3. Prorate revenue for the quarter decreased by 12% or approximately $18 million compared to Q3 2019. For Q4, we anticipate our prorate revenue to decrease by 25% as compared to Q3 2021. This decrease is primarily related to service reductions in several of our prorate cities as higher yield business travel has been slower to return. We have reallocated these block hours to our contract line with higher-margin characteristics. We anticipate that our prorate model will continue to decrease during 2022 as we continue to grow and reallocate block hours to our contract fleet. Shifting gears to our leasing business, we currently have 39 CRJ700s and 900s under long-term leases with third parties. This line of business has very good cash flow and strong margin characteristics. Demand for our engine leasing business is returning and we anticipate placing several engines under long-term leases next year. Next year, we will have 16 CRJ900s that come out of the Delta contract and are currently not placed. We anticipate placing these aircrafts in our leasing entity after removal from the Delta contract, where we may pursue leasing opportunities for aircraft or engines. Let me talk briefly about our current maintenance expense which continues to run above historical norms. This is primarily due to the recovery of our flying and bringing the aircraft for American agreement out of long-term storage. We currently have over 30 lines of heavy maintenance at our third-party providers and the ramp-up of these suppliers remain slower than anticipated. We anticipate that we will continue maintenance at roughly these levels during the fourth quarter and expect to trend down starting next year to settle at a new normal. As a result of our improved fleet mix, we do not anticipate returning to 2019 maintenance cost levels. For example, we are responsible for engine maintenance on all of our E175s and have placed them under a power by the hour agreement. The engine maintenance expense on the E175s is also reimbursed in our revenue model. We have spent the last several years reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility to ensure we're well positioned. We are committed to continue our work with each of our major partners to provide creative solutions as we work towards full demand recovery.\nRobert Simmons: Okay. Operator, we're ready for our Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Savanthi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just on -- first, a little bit on pilot levels. I was just curious what you're seeing on attrition levels. I know last quarter, you said still kind of below historical but you were planning on that moving higher. Kind of curious what you're seeing there. And along the same lines, we've heard from a couple of your partners that they're having issues with staffing in-house -- their in-house regionals and wondering if you're kind of seeing the opportunity to help out there.\nChip Childs: Savi, this is Chip. I appreciate the question. First and foremost, I think that with the models that we have been looking at over the past several months, we anticipated higher attrition here in the fall and that has happened. It's been about at the levels that we had thought. Understand our entire process is spending a lot of time and effort on making sure we evaluate what to project out into the future as well as make sure we've got a very strong pipeline. So look, from our perspective, as we said in the script, we've got good full classes, probably as bigger robust training pipeline as we've ever had at SkyWest. We're getting good strong professional candidates. But you're right, there's a lot of attractions to the SkyWest pilots. We think we hire the best and we have the best training program in the world. And so that certainly goes into our calculation. Relative to the second part of your question, we are just focused on our own business. We continue to work with our partners on what their needs are. From our perspective, it's a lot about making sure we have the best pilots. We take care of them and give them the good experience that they need here and try to hang on to them. And we'd love to hang on to all of them but we understand how sometimes the math of that model works. So we're optimistic but this is something that we spend a tremendous amount of time watching and predicting nine months out to 18 months as best we can.\nSavanthi Syth: And then, a little bit on the prorate segment. Just -- I'm trying to understand how kind of those aircraft are reallocated because -- are they kind of getting on CPAs? Or are they being used as kind of backup spares when you need it? So I'm just trying to understand kind of the reallocation there. And it sounds like the assumption in the 2022 earnings outlook is that prorate doesn't really come back or is even lower than 2021. So I'm just trying to understand a little bit more, if you can provide some color on how you're thinking about that business?\nWade Steel: Hello, Savi, this is Wade. So just to add a little bit more color to that. So number one, our prorate model has a lot of flexibility to it, right? So right now, as I said in my script, we've seen the business demand decrease over the last while and it just has not returned a 100% yet. So what we've been able to do is reallocate some of those pilots and other things to contract models. So the airplanes just go in and they support the contract fleet and we're able to fly additional block hours under contract. But as business demand returns, we're going to have the flexibility to go back to what we want to and what we need to. And so we're just -- we're going to maintain as much flexibility as we can going forward.\nSavanthi Syth: And is there kind of a general -- any kind of general color on the -- Rob, kind of the EPS kind of the thinking that you've provided or earnings -- color you provided, like what's assumed for prorate in there?\nRobert Simmons: Well, I think as Wade said, Savi, as we think of next year and as we said, it's likely fairly similar to the results of this year. That includes recapturing somewhere in the neighborhood of a couple of hundred million dollars of net grant benefits that goes away. I think to Wade's point is that our expectations for prorate, I think, are modest next year.\nSavanthi Syth: Makes sense. I appreciate the answers. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to just go back to the disruption that you had. It looks like in the release, you talked about it being related to, I guess, the consequences of dealing with the cyberattack and malware. So number one, is there any sort of insurance coverage that you get as a result of this? Or is this a mistake that you made? And then just trying to -- as this was ongoing, there was a lot of information, at least out on the blogs, as you can imagine and trying to get the right story here. Did this happen during the day that this migration occurred? Or was it through the night? It seemed like when it was happening, it was right during the part of the day. Was there any way to kind of get around this and do it to minimize the operational impact? I'm just -- and maybe sort of as a follow-up, like, did you learn from this and you know what not to do next time? Or maybe it was just outside of your hands given the technology?\nRobert Simmons: Yes. Thanks, Mike. This is Rob. So let me clarify a couple of things. The cyberattack that occurred was a couple of weeks ago. It was from a known hacking entity. And the malware that was associated with the attack was quickly identified and quickly quarantined and did not have any operational impact. The outage that we had that was a week ago today was not related directly to the malware but it was related from trying to purge the remnants of the quarantine software that was part of that. So the server outage that we had, what was part of repairing our system from the earlier attack. It was not caused by the malware.\nMike Linenberg: And anything that you learned from this? Or was this -- I mean, I just -- you can see on the blogs that this was done intra-day and should it have been done at night? Or maybe you can clarify on that. I'm just curious, I mean, because it was a big impact.\nChip Childs: Yes, Mike, this is Chip. I would certainly say that this is, as you can see, what we've disclosed, this may have cost us. We have a very expensive and valuable lesson book of things to learn. I will also add a couple of things. I mean, the impact was not just related to the fact that it happened during the day as well as a very, very unfortunate large bank. But I would also add, it's so much further complicated given our level of technology. We have electronic maintenance logs which were probably the only airline in the United States that has that. We have probably one of the most technologically robust operations in United States. And from that perspective, we can go through a lot of the elements of redundancy, the timing of when we did this. But I can assure you that given the level of expertise that we have on this collaboration with our partners, internal things that we've learned. We still fundamentally have a lot of confidence in the systems that we use. But there's a lot of new processes that we're going to deploy and strategies to make sure this absolutely never happens again. So without getting into too many specifics, there's a lot of good news, bad news, mostly bad news but we're very confident in some of the challenges that IT departments have these days relative to cyberattacks. That's a success story. Some of the -- clearly unfortunate part is how we went about repairing it and maintaining the reliability which we've learned tremendous lessons about that.\nMike Linenberg: And then just a second question, Rob, when you were talking about the partner concessions, you sort of said, we believe that this is the last of them. And then I think Wade also sort of indicated that we're not going to see them again but it -- you said it in such a way that maybe you left open the door that we could see more. And I just didn't know if you were pointing to the fact that we have had some true-ups with respect to the PSP. And so maybe there's a true-up for something along those lines where maybe there would be a small payment and you were just covering your bases on that? Or maybe I just misinterpreted or reading between the lines too much?\nRobert Simmons: No, Mike. Look, the only point I was making is that associated with PSP1 and PSP2, there were sort of late days true-ups at the -- sort of at the end of the process. We've not heard anything about -- anything similar for PSP3 at this point. So if there's not, we're done but I would just say it's maybe not impossible that we could be surprised by an additional true-up amount but we're not aware of any.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Your next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thank you. I wanted to go back to Savi's question on the attrition. I wonder if you could put any numbers to kind of the current environment, kind of how was attrition running maybe six months ago and where is that today? The reason I think we're asking the question is some of the announcements that came out over the course of the quarter from some wholly owned, I think, over at American, where there were some kind of eye-popping bonuses around flow agreements and things of that sort? And maybe you could just help put your level of attrition in context and why you would or would not be impacted by some of those announcements that we saw?\nChip Childs: Yes. So Duane, this is Chip again. Thanks for the question. We're not going to get into specifics about the number of attrition. I would say that it is clearly double digits plus more than it was six months ago. I would emphasize it as expected. And I would also suggest that our hiring and training is outpacing our increased attrition numbers. So I think those are the key variables that you would look to from us. And as we looked at our classes that go out almost nine months from now, the announcement from those particular wholly owned carriers that you mentioned does not appear to have had any impact or at least meaningful impact on that. Like we really didn't see anything. So look, that having been said, I think that's as much detail as we can give. It's higher by double-digit increases but also our hiring is outpacing what the increase is. And we're extremely focused on targeting this over the next couple of years.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And I guess if it -- my guess is your operational reliability is a lot better historically and today. And if this increases your cost to serve for a period of time, do you ultimately believe you'll be compensated for that?\nChip Childs: I think you have to look at the broader view of the economy. I think that there's probably not just our industry but many industries that are grappling with labor shortages, supply chain shortages, raw material price increases, increases in fuel. And when you look at all of those variables, I would suggest that as we move forward, there will be upward pressure on our revenue models too as we renew and as we renegotiate to encapsulate that. So the industry needs yields, obviously, in business travel and international travel to help recover what's happening on the internal domestic model. But I think that there's a lot of factors beyond just pilot supply that give us pause relative to recovering some of our cost increases.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Very fair. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the time. So historically, we've seen 50-seater capacity negatively impacted by higher fuel prices. Your fleet is much, much less exposed to this aircraft type than historically. But can you just walk us through how the higher fuel environment is impacting your remaining 50-seater fleet? Like I know for a time, you're actually seeing unexpected short-term extensions on 50-seaters. When do those start to roll off? And like what are the conversations around the 50-seaters look like?\nWade Steel: Yes, Catherine, this is Wade. So we -- as you know, we probably have around 140 to 150 50-seaters in our fleet. Today, the demand for the 50 seaters with all -- with the major partners that we fly those for, is still very good. There's every -- both of the partners we fly those for are definitely interested in more 50-seat lift. I will tell you that. We're working with them on the demand and being able to fill those opportunities. The fuel side will definitely be a bit of a headwind for us in our prorate business, right? So that is something that we will look at very closely. And we have the flexibility to allocate those block hours in other ways if we're not feeling that it's going in a good direction for us. So we do have lots of flexibility with our fleet but the demand continues to be very good for the partners we fly 50 seaters for right now. And the contract term with the 50 seaters that we have, they go into 2024 and 2025.\nCatherine O'Brien: And maybe just a very quick follow-up to that question and then I have one more. But what's the RFP environment like more generally? Obviously, there's been quite a few announcements on the 75 seaters recently. Do you think we're starting to bump up against scope on that aircraft type? Or do you think there's appetite for more?\nChip Childs: We work with all of our major partners, Catherine, on their demand. Right now, it's probably not as much about historical RFPs. We're always reviewing the fleet plan with them. That's what we like to say. And there's just always opportunities that we're creatively working with them on getting more and more 76 seaters into our fleet. As you've seen what we've been able to do with Delta, American, Alaska, we've been very creative with each of our partners to review their fleet needs and work with them proactively on their fleet and how we can accommodate and help them through these difficult times. And so we've just been more proactive than anything and we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to work with our partners on their demands and their needs and what they're trying to accomplish.\nCatherine O'Brien: I might just sneak one more in here. I appreciate it all the time. I know you still have a decent amount of CapEx next year, although quite a bit lower than it's been over the last several years. If nothing changes in terms of incremental aircraft getting added to your fleet, do you think your balance sheet would be in a position to start returning cash to shareholders right around October 1, 2022 and that's for Cares Act restrictions [indecipherable]?\nRobert Simmons: Hello, Katie, it's Rob here. So I think in terms of CapEx, we're going to do close to $600 million, maybe a little more this year in CapEx. Next year, including the effect of 26 additional 175s that we're going to take delivery on. Our CapEx next year, it looks likely in the $800 million range or so. So we're still really happy that we've got great projects against which we can deploy some of -- deploy our cash and deploy our capital. With respect to your question about Cares Act restrictions, obviously, it's coming up next September when those restrictions fall away. But we're going to look carefully at our liquidity and our balance sheet situation. And right now, we're, again, really pleased with the fact that we've been able to emerge from COVID with less debt net of cash than we had going in. And we're going to continue to remain focused on preserving liquidity for a while here.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. That's my bad. I was looking at the last 10-Q, didn't include the new agreement which is Delta. So, thanks guys for the time.\nRobert Simmons: Okay. Thanks, Katie.\nOperator: Your next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thank you very much, Operator. Hi team, thanks for the time. Last quarter, you guys, I think, mentioned some stuff about supply chain issues on your maintenance. And I'm just kind of wondering how that is now, if that's caught up or where you stand?\nWade Steel: Yes, Helane, this is Wade. As -- and it's -- I talked about a little bit in my script and we talked about it last quarter. Right now, we have over 30 lines of heavy maintenance going on with our third-party providers. And the ramp-up continues to be slower than what we would anticipate. We have done some things internally to help mitigate a lot of this. We've actually started doing some of these inspections internally. And we've had very good success on that. So it still is a challenge but we are navigating through that, I would say, very, very well. We've been able to work with our third-party providers. We've been able to provide some flexibility with some airplanes that are coming early from the manufacturer to kind of help through some of these challenges. So we're getting through it. It continues to be a struggle but I think it's something that our team has navigated extremely well.\nHelane Becker: And then my other question, my follow-up question. So this is like totally out of our field. I saw the other day on TV that St. George, Utah is one of the fastest growing, if not the fastest-growing city in the country right now. And it's really a lot bigger than it was when I visited last time. So is that changing the travel patterns of the folks who are moving in? And are you seeing increased demand for air transportation out of St. George that would mean you have more to do with your prorate aircraft than maybe you think you do? Or do people just drive over to Las Vegas and catch up a mainline flight?\nChip Childs: So Helane, this is Chip. It's a great observation. And we use St. George as the example, mostly because this is where we are and our headquarters are. But St. George is a very good case study for what's happening in a lot of more rural Midwestern cities throughout the United States. As you can imagine, what's happened in the pandemic, there is certainly a tremendous amount of movement out of big cities, larger cities and that towards smaller cities where they can -- people can work from home. And it's just the evolution of the way people work. We're seeing the same things in other states, even Nevada, Idaho, Colorado. All smaller to midsized cities are growing. St. Georgia is growing for some good reasons. But a lot of other cities have that real estate market that's just going crazy because the demand for people who live outside the coast a little bit and we're seeing that. Now does it translate into our prorate operation? As we've said on the call, there's a lot of demand for our products. Some is going into these small and midsized cities, some is going to help support larger point-to-point flying with our major partners. So I would just suggest that we are well optimized between prorate and contract with our partners. And there is very good, strong demand for what we're providing right now.\nHelane Becker: That's great color. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thanks. Glad to hear back on. Just one quick modeling one. So on the deferred revenue you're booking now. I know you caveat as to how that gets booked depends on block hours which sounds like they're going to be down a little bit just seasonally in the fourth quarter. But how do we -- I guess, how do we think about that booking going forward? Like is $19 million a good run rate? Or was that only partial quarter? You were hitting the right amount of blockers? I'm just trying to think of like the best way for us to model that, if there is one.\nRobert Simmons: Thanks, Katie. Yes. I mean, again, as we mentioned, there's about $118 million cumulatively sitting out there in deferred revenue. The bulk of that is going to reverse likely over the next couple of years. The pattern, it's tough to predict because, again, it's going to depend on the pattern of the recovery, the cadence of the recovery and it's hard to predict that with a lot of precision at this point. But I can tell you that of that $118 million, most of that is going to be recognized over the next couple of years.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. Thank you very much for the extra time.\nOperator: And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Chip Childs for closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Great. Thank you, Tina. Again, we want to thank you for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate your interest in SkyWest. I again want to thank our people for the great work that they are doing. We still fundamentally believe that you are essential to the industry and to our company. And with that, we will talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you again for joining us today. This does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 2, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-07-30 00:15:43", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. Thank you for standing by and welcome to the SkyWest, Inc. Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to hand the conference to your speaker today Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nRobert Simmons: Thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; and Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer. I'd like to start today by asking Eric to read the safe harbor, then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results. Then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts only. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2020 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us on the call. Today we announced agreements for 12 additional aircrafts including 11 more CRJ700s for American and one more E175 for Alaska. That E175 is an addition to the eight others for Alaska, that we announced last quarter. These agreements reflect the current work we're doing to help lead the recovery as well as the importance of the dual class fleet in that effort. We play six CRJ700s into service during the second quarter, while securing extensions on over 50 aircrafts with various partners to minimize our risk. Overall, we continue to make meaningful progress on our fleet transition during the quarter by adding dual class aircrafts, enhancing fleet flexibility and mitigating risk. During the second quarter, we reported pre-tax income of $81 million, and net income of $62 million. The pre-tax results include a $114 million in payroll support program grants as reflected in our operating results. This improvement is a result of significant increase in production since last year, and a 17% increase over the first quarter. While we continue watching the COVID-19 data closely. We believe our fleet will remain critical in recovery, even if that recovery slows. Our strong balance sheet and cash position remain key differentiators for SkyWest. Based on what we're seeing today, we expect demand for our product will continue to increase currently - and currently anticipate reaching pre-pandemic levels by early 2022. The quarter's revenue was up 23% from last quarter, and up 88% compared to the same quarter last year. As we witnessed, demand is returned first domestically, and particularly in the size of markets that we serve. We continue to prepare for and invest for the long-term. And this includes significant investments in maintenance and building reliability into our fleet. Maintenance costs associated with that investment and with bringing used aircraft in the service remain elevated and the volume and duration of these maintenance events are much higher than they've been historically. We expect these costs to plateau this year before training back down next year. We continue our efforts to lead the recovery by working to provide the best possible product for our partners and customers. This has not been a simple task as operations across the industry have increased against a nationwide backdrop of fuel supply issues, MRO provider delays and general infrastructure challenges from hotel staff to ground transportation. These issues have affected the entire industry and are certainly not immune to those challenges. Operational performance remains the focus and despite the clear difficulties associated with an uneven recovery, we achieve 99.96% adjusted completion for the quarter with nearly 100,000 more scheduled flights than the same quarter last year. We're working across all areas of the operation to ensure we're continually adapting to the changing climate, and responding to what our partners need from us. I want to thank our incredible team of professionals who continue to demonstrate flexibility, teamwork, and dedication to delivering an exceptional product in any situation. Taking care of our people remains a priority and at Sky - priority at SkyWest. We have never furloughed a pilot, flight attendant, mechanic, or dispatcher in our nearly 50 years. Acclaim we're especially proud of after the most difficult year on our industry's history. Additionally, we have fully resumed our hiring and our pilot pathway and mechanic apprentice programs and are again accepting new participants, which is great news for the many aspiring aviation professionals across the nation as well as for the industry. We're very focused on staying proactive and continuing to attract the best professionals as we navigate through the end of this pandemic and beyond. In summary, while we are still below 2019 levels. We remain optimistic about the shape of the recovery so far, and we are confident our fleet will continue to fill a critical role in the return to travel. We're focused on remaining aggressive and deliberate to take care of our people and our customers as we preserve our liquidity and execute on the recovery to emerge as a better stronger business. Rob will now take us through the financial data.\nRobert Simmons: Today we reported second quarter net income of $62 million, or $1.22 of diluted earnings per share. Q2 pre-tax income was $81 million. Our diluted share count for Q2 was 50.7 million shares, and our effective tax rate in Q2 was 23.8%. First let's talk about revenue. Total Q2 revenue up $657 million is up 88% from Q2 2020 and is up 23% from last quarter. Q2 2021 revenue is only down 12% from Q2 2019 as the recovery continues. Our Q2 block hour production was up 17% sequentially from Q1 compared to the 23% sequential increase in revenue. Q2 revenue breaks down with contract revenue up 76% from Q2 2020 and up 20% from Q1. We have temporary partner revenue concessions impacting Q1 and Q2 of 2021. And in Q2 2020 for comparative purposes. Q3 will likely be the last quarter with temporary revenue concessions. Prorate revenue was a $103 million in Q2 up a 185% year-over-year, and up 50% from last quarter due to seasonality and the recovery of the industry. As we have previously said, prorate revenue is nicely levered to a demand recovery. Leasing and other revenue was up 76% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. These GAAP results include the effect of a deferral of $6 million of revenue this quarter, compared to $21 million deferred during Q1. As of the end of Q2 we have a $138 million of cumulative deferred revenue that will be recognized in future periods. As discussed last quarter, the timing and amount of future deferrals and the reversal thereof into revenue depends on the shape and cadence of the recovery of our flight. All deferred revenue will be reversed into revenue by the end of the various contract periods. At this point, it appears likely that we will begin reversing some deferred revenue in the second half of 2021. Let me move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $956 million up from $836 million last quarter. Our CapEx during the second quarter was $16 million for two used aircrafts, spare engines, and other fixed assets. Our expectation for 2021 CapEx is approximately $600 million to $650 million including the purchase of 18 new E175 later this year under our previously announced contract with American. This compares to $438 million in CapEx in all of 2020. We ended Q2 with debt of $3 billion, down from $3.2 billion as of year-end 2020. Our debt net of cash is lower as of June 30th, than it has been since Q4 of 2017. Let's talk about liquidity. As of June 30, '21 our cash position was $956 million, including the effect of having repaid fully with $60 million outstanding under our CARES Act secured loan. We made the decision to cancel that $725 million government loan facility, which released $1.5 billion of pledged collateral back to us. We also have approximately $40 million available on our bank revolving line of credit. During Q2 a $114 million in PSP three grants was recognized as income in the form of a contract expense laid out clearly as its own line item in our P&L. This is a change from grant income of a $193 million recognized in Q1. We would expect a similar grant P&L benefit in Q3 as in Q2 absent any PSP three top up amounts. $45 million of the funding of PSP three this quarter was in the form of a low interest 10-year unsecured no amortization loan. We now have a total of $201 million in PSP loans. In total, we have issued 785,000 warrants to Treasury with exercise prices ranging from $28.38 to $57.47. At the beginning of the year with cash of $826 million, we estimated that we would burn cash in the first half of 2021 at a rate of about $250,000 per day or $7 million per month. Based on June ending cash of $956 million we are pleased to have achieved better than our target for the first half. As previously discussed, we completely repaid the $60 million CARES Act secured loans during the quarter. We also placed another $60 million in deposits during the first half towards future aircraft deliveries. During Q2, we received $285 million in PSP funding from the government before the payment of related temporary concessions to our partners. Depending on the pace of the recovery, we expect to generate meaningful cash from operations and EBITDA in the second half of 2021. If the economic effects turn out to be worse than the recovery slower than we currently expect. We have additional liquidity tools we can call on including our cash balances, our revolver and the $1.5 billion of unpledged collateral that we have now freed up from the decision to let the CARES Act facility expire. In addition to our strong core liquidity position, we are expecting '21 and '22 to be years where we continue to focus on our balance sheet. As of 06/30/21, our debt net of cash balance is actually $416 million lower than it was as of 12/31/19. In 2021, we expect to repay over $400 million in principal debt balances related to existing aircraft financing. Of course, we continue to expect to take delivery of additional aircraft in '21 and '22 that as usual will be financed with long-term debt financing. But over the next couple of years, we expect to reduce both our absolute debt balance along with our calculated leverage while maintaining strong liquidity including partner owned aircraft over 50% of our fleet in-service now has no financing obligation, especially in times of great uncertainty like this and consistent with our policy and practice, we're not in a position to give any specific EPS guidance at this time. But let me give you a little color, on a GAAP basis including the net benefit from PSP grant income, less temporary partner concessions, we expect Q3 to be similar to our Q2 GAAP results, Q4 is not expected to have any net PSP benefit, and will likely be much lower than Q3, but still EPS and cash flow positive. Continued headwinds to our model include several factors, I'd like to call out. Number one, our Prorate business was still slightly unprofitable in Q2, Wade will talk more about this in a minute. Number two, maintenance expense was down $13 million from Q1 as we continue to prepare our fleet for ongoing and future customer demand, maintenance expense for '20 - the rest of 2021 will likely continue at approximately $200 million per quarter, before finding a lower new normal level in 2022. Number three, deferred revenue was $6 million in Q2 2021, and is now accumulated $138 million and number four COVID is still creating some uncertainty about the shape and timing of the recovery and now some tailwinds. Number one, deliveries of new growth aircraft are not far out with 20 American 175s, nine Alaska 175s and 21 additional 700s getting into service with American, number two deferred revenue may begin reversing later in 2021 pending the timing of the recovery. We're excited that the actions we're taking now and expect to take over the next few quarters are setting us up nicely for the new normal in the future, Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I'll provide a fleet and production status update as well as an update on our Prorate and leasing businesses. To update by partner, today we announced an agreement to add 11 CRJ700s with American. We anticipate these aircrafts will be placed into service beginning late 2022 through the middle of 2023. We also extended 22 CRJ700s with American for another three years. Those 22 aircraft were beginning to expire in the back half of 2022. During the first half of 2021, we put 15 CRJ700s into service with American, including those announced today, we still have 21 more CRJ700s to add to our contract, bringing our American CRJ700 fleet total to 101 by the middle of 2023. The majority of these CRJ700s have been in long-term storage for the past few years and require extensive maintenance work to return to service. Also with American, we have 20 new E175 scheduled for service next year, with delivery scheduled from Q3 of this year to the fourth quarter of 2022. Together these E175s and CRJ700s will bring our total American fleet to 121 by the middle of 2023. We also announced an agreement with Alaska to add one more E175 in addition to the eight we announced last quarter. We expect to place eight of those aircrafts into service during 2022 and one aircraft during the first half of 2023 bringing 41 total aircraft under long-term contract with Alaska. We have also extended the current fleet of 32 E175s which put all of these aircraft under contract with Alaska for the rest of this decade. Let me talk briefly about our United agreement. As of June 30 2021, we have 179 aircraft under contract with the United, this includes 90 E175s, 19 CRJ700s and 70 CRJ200s, our CRJ200 start to expire towards the end of 2024. We have no debt left on these aircrafts and we believe the book value of these assets approximates the part out value of the aircraft. During the quarter, we worked with all of our major partners on a third round of contract concessions, that included temporary rate reductions. These concessions are reflected in our second quarter results, and will also be reflected in our third quarter results, all concessions will expire at the end of the third quarter. Let me review our current production. During the second quarter, our completed block ours were down by approximately 13% compared to the same quarter in 2019. Based on the current schedules we have from our major partners for the third quarter of 2021, we anticipate that our block hours will increase by approximately 13% compared to the previous quarter. As we look at the fourth quarter, we anticipate that our block hours will be approximately 3% lower than Q4 2019 pending continued improvement in the recovery curve. That E175 fleet continues to fill an important need for our major partners. While the majority of the reduction in block hours have been on the CRJ200 fleet, our Q2 E175 block hours were up by 12% compared to Q2 2019. While our Q2 CRJ200 block hours were down by 44%. Let me talk a little bit about our Prorate business, during the second quarter, our Prorate revenue decreased by 24% or approximately $33 million compared to Q2 2019. As we see demand continuing to recovery, we anticipate our Prorate revenue to increase by 20% as compared to Q2 2021. Our Prorate model is nicely levered to the recovery, with Prorate revenue down 24% as compared to Q2 2019, we continue to expect that incremental revenue coming back to the Prorate business will have attractive margin characteristics. Let me shift gears to our leasing business. We have previously announced that we signed a purchase agreement to acquire 13 additional used CRJ700s, as of today, we have closed on eight of the 13 aircrafts and expect to close on the others throughout 2021. With the contract announced with American today, all of our CRJ700s are either under long-term flying agreements, or long-term leases to a third-party. Following the purchase of these 13 aircrafts, we'll own or control 169 CRJ700 aircraft, the CRJ700 is an exceptional asset that will continue to set SkyWest apart with strong demand from our major partners. Let me talk briefly about our current maintenance expense, which continues to run higher than our historical norms, this increase is primarily due to the recovery of our flying and bringing the aircraft for American for the American agreement out of long-term storage. We currently have over 30 lines of heavy maintenance at our third-party providers and the ramp-up of these suppliers have been slower than anticipated. To provide some context, this level of maintenance is unprecedented in our history. We anticipate that we'll continue maintenance or roughly these levels through the end of this year and expect to trend down starting next year. We have spent the last several years reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility to ensure we're well positioned, we're committed to continue our work with each of our major partners to provide creative solutions as we work toward full demand recovery. Okay, operator, we're ready for our Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your lines no open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon everyone. I guess on the CRJ side, there were news reports that possibly SkyWest was talking to Bombardier about starting up building this new CRJ700s, and I know you've been collecting a lot of them here. Just your view on kind of the outlook for the CRJ700 and what more you'd like to do in that area?\nChip Childs: Well, Savi this is Chip. Thanks for your question. It's a good question. I think that there's a fair amount of - always a fair amount of information floating around, given what we would like to see are some things that we would like to continue to pursue, as you know, we're deeply invested in the CRJ fleet, I can tell you from our strategic perspective, we're doing a lot of things trying to anticipate what we can do long-term to shore up this fleet. Right now, we're in a big process of taking a lot of 175 aircraft, we love that aircraft. But in the event that we continue to see strong demand across the board for the regional space, which we do believe post-pandemic, we'll be talking to a lot of people about ways in which we can re-fleet. So I wouldn't say there's a tremendous amount to substantiate, but certainly some of the rumors are consistent with what our strategy is, is to find ways in which we continue to provide great service to our partners and the flying public.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful, Chip. And then if I might ask them on the pilot side. Just curious, I know you've talked about bringing the training back, starting hiring, what are you seeing in terms of attrition with the legacy partner starting to hire here again, and your expectations into what might need to be done over the kind of the next year or two to make sure you have the right staffing levels?\nChip Childs: Well, I think, so that's a good question as well. This is Chip. I think back to the point that I think that we've talked about the last couple of quarters, we're blessed to have a great culture at SkyWest, we're very deliberate, pre-pandemic and the pipeline that we developed relative to identify and recruit the best recruits in the entire industry. And from our perspective, we are full set on moving forward at levels that are as strong, if not even stronger than in the 2019 level in pre-pandemic. We said a couple of quarters ago, I think last quarter specifically, we're amazed at the interest in SkyWest, our pipeline is extraordinarily full. With that being said, we certainly do anticipate some different levels of attrition that we've seen in the past, primarily because of the circumstances of coming out of a pandemic and some of the things that the major carriers have done. But at this point, we're going to lean on a tremendous culture. Some of the comments that I've mentioned in my script about how we feel about good strong professionals here at SkyWest, and then our priority of taking care of them, which is a big part of what we're trying to do during this busy season and very strong pipeline and an interest out there. We feel very confident in the things that we can do in the next couple of years and maybe even capitalizing the industry.\nSavi Syth: Okay, just to follow-up Chip on that. Is it fair to say that your attrition rates aren't any different right now, if you haven't really seen it step-up?\nChip Childs: No, we've seen a step up certainly since the last, since last fall, we've seen sort of a steady increase in attrition, but the starting point last fall was relatively low. So, our anticipation is going to be consistent with what we've been working on with our pipeline in the 2019 levels. We're certainly not there yet. But we anticipate that we may very well need to plan for that. But again, the focus is still making sure that we're identifying a very good strong pool of candidates today.\nSavi Syth: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Just a couple questions here. Wade, I want to just talk about on the Prorate business, you talked about it having attractive margin characteristics as it ramped back up. I guess this last quarter revenue was down 24% versus 19%. And then I think you got into the third quarter being up 20% versus to 2Q 2021. So we're getting back there, but with that type of improvement is will prorate be profitable or do you still, is it another quarter or two of improvement get back to these attractive margins that you mentioned? What's the timing there?\nWade Steel: Yes, Mike. So this is Wade. Yes, so as we said, you've got those numbers right on. We are down 24% compared to Q2 2019. As we're not profitable this quarter in Q2 2021 in prorate. I think Rob said that in his script, but as it continues to improve all the costs, and the reason why we say that it has attractive margin characteristics, because all of the costs are essentially in our model right now. And as the revenue comes back, it's just - it's revenue without any cost. And so that's why it has attractive margin characteristics. And so we will get a little price. There'll be a couple more quarters, but will - we're still need some very good bookings. And it's trending in a very good direction so.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, that's and can you remind me how many airplanes are there now? What is it like 50, 60 airplanes that were in prorate?\nWade Steel: Yes, somewhere in that range. It's probably a little above 60 right now.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the deferred revenue, Rob, you indicated that we could see a turn in the second half. And I guess, presumably, since this deferred revenue is tied to multiple contracts, I guess we could see some reverse before others. And so I guess in the back half of the year - you're going to give us a net number. Is that how we should think about it, because not every single contract is structured the same way?\nRobert Simmons: Yes, that's right. When we record that deferred revenue, you'll see that as a single net number. But yes, we do expect that in the second half of the year. We'll likely see - start to see the reversal of that $138 million of cumulative deferred that we put on our books during this COVID window.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And then, just lastly on the extensions. Congrats on getting lots of different extensions there 175 CRJ700s. How do you seek out now with respect to tail risk? Previously, where were you with respect to like coverage, was it - as I recall, you always were in a very good position, lining up, the liabilities on the aircraft, when they came due with when the contracts ended. And now that you've been able to extend some of these contracts, I suspect that your tail risk situation is even better. Is there any way that you can just give us some color on maybe how that shifted, because of some of these recent wins on extending on current airplanes? Thanks. Thanks for answering my question.\nWade Steel: Yes, Mike, this is Wade. I think last quarter we talked about tail risk a little bit and said we had approximately about a $100 million in tail risk on our fleet. And that number obviously got better this quarter, right. So it's gone down. We still have some very small pockets of tail risk that are out there. But we are very optimistic that we'll be able to work with our partners to extend those airplanes and continue to fly those with our partners. So I think we've got a lot of that covered off.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. Very good. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. So the theme of this earnings season for the U.S. airline industry seems to be that demand is coming back faster than expected. And airlines are just ramping up capacity more quickly than even planned several months ago. I know you had these additional 10 aircrafts announced today, but just thinking to the puts and takes going forward. Some of these legacy carriers retired, meaningful portions of their fleets. Right now there's a kind of backfill of stuff aircrafts that might be typically use international, but maybe that changes next year as international demand comes back like. Do you kind of give us some color on the conversations you might may or may not be having on an incremental list for next year to maybe help plug some of these capacity shortfalls? Thanks.\nChip Childs: Yes, Catie, this is Chip. That's a very good question. I can tell you right now, the dialogue that we're having with all four of our partners is extremely positive. There is some, I don't want to call it confusion, but we're certainly with the strong demand of the summer and with some of the things that we've outlined in the script, the challenges that we have just kind of from an infrastructure basis. We're looking at all the opportunities with our eyes wide open, making sure that we are doing the things we need to with people inside and outside of the SkyWest to be able to deliver what our partners want. I can tell you right now that some of these external challenges are having an impact on what we feel like we can do in the near-term. But we're optimistic in 2022 that we can work through some of these things the fuel shortages, some of the hotel issues and that type of stuffs, where we can get back to having a really, really solid product, because we get a little bit. I don't want to say we get nervous, but we get cautious when we don't have all things running in a very fluid and efficient manner. That's why we're spending so much time and effort relative to a reliable fleet and making sure that we've got everything moving in the right direction. We also have interesting conversations, if we would have seen this world 12 months ago, we probably would have done a couple of things different. We probably would have done some different things with maintaining aircrafts. But in summary, Catie the overall conversation with our all of our partners is very positive, about lift. And we're focused internally to make sure that we have the processes that are stronger than what they even were back in 2019. And we're performing so well to get back to that performance in 2022. So I think that there's some good color on all these conversations with the foreigners. There's good strong demand that we're cautious about making sure that we're delivering what we've always been able to deliver.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. And then maybe last quarter you noted that concessions would largely offset PSP funds, and that nothing needs to impact with results close to breakeven June quarter results. You obviously did better than that. I guess first, what drove that? And then going forward, do you still expect concessions to largely match PSP, because you noted earlier that you expect fourth quarter EPS to decline versus third as PSP rolls off, but if your concessions match the PSP, why would that be so over the complicated question? I hope that explainable.\nRobert Simmons: Hi, Catie, it's Rob here. So yes, let me just say like, we're not going to get into the details of partner concessions. But what I can say is that what you see in the GAAP results in Q2 will be very, very similar to what you see in Q3, the GAAP grant income that was recognized this quarter was about a $114 million, it'll be very similar next quarter and as well as the partner concessions will be similar quarter-to-quarter. So, I think like that's really, well, all we can say about that by the time we get to the fourth quarter, some of this noise will be behind us. And it'll be - a little more straightforward in the fourth quarter.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, can you think of a sneak one quick last one. In your current liquidity balance is running higher than normal like much of the rest of the industry just given COVID uncertainty? In the release you note a number of deliveries over the next year or two plan to debt finance? Would you consider paying for these in cash to speed up deleveraging given your current cash balances or are those very positive conversations with your partners we just talked about leading you to want more dry powder for other growth opportunities? Thanks so much.\nRobert Simmons: Yes, Catie, we're obviously - one of our big jobs is to make sure that we're deploying capital on the most effective way possible. We were pleased, that again our balance sheet is looking very nice with our debt net of cash down $400 million from our pre-COVID level going into that. So look, I think that we will look at opportunities to deploy our cash in a way that's very shareholder friendly, and consider all of our opportunities there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Just a follow-up on Catie's question, because I think it's a good one in trying to get to like what the earnings power of the business here, if we just peel back PSP and concessions and deferred revenue and all these moving parts, with block hours down 13% in the 2Q and maybe having a shot of being close to flat in the fourth quarter. What is the underlying kind of core operating earnings here?\nChip Childs: Well, one thing I can say, Duane is that if you look at our results for the quarter, if you strip out the noise from PSP and partner concessions, we were still profitable. And as we indicated in the prepared remarks that, we are anticipating that Q4, while it won't have obviously the benefit of some of that grant income. We do expect Q4 to be profitable and cashflow positive. So, I think we're emerging at this point with the model that looks pretty good. As Wade mentioned a little bit in his prepared remarks, maintenance will likely continue to run a little hot through the rest of the year, and then begin to find a new lower level in 2022. So as some of these things start to normalize again, as our prorate business sort of comes back to a new normal level as maintenance expense finds a new lower level were we feel like we're nicely set up going into 2022.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, and then on the comment about, if everything goes right, and we're not asking you to predict the future here. But if everything goes right, and you're sort of back to \u201cnormal\u201d in early '22. Based on what you booked in terms of growth, what sort of block our growth would we be looking at in '22 just kind of big picture?\nWade Steel: Duane, this is Wade. Yes, obviously, we've talked about some of the things that we have on our books right now. We have the 21 CRJ700 for American. And 10 of those are going to come in the fourth quarter, then we also have some 175s. We're not going to give specific guidance right now. But there will be some improvement from where we're at today and where we anticipate in the fourth quarter. But we'll continue to update you as we see the demand recovery continues it's still a pretty fluid market out there.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, that's fair. And then maybe just lastly, can you help us understand what is it that drives - sorry, the deferred revenue, kind of flipping from deferred to recognize. What is the event that causes that to happen, just practically speaking? And what sort of pacing, what's the range of pacing on that $138 million in the back half of the year. What could that be on a quarterly basis if it looks?\nWade Steel: Yes, Duane. So that $138 million that we've that has that we've deferred cumulatively, that will unwind by the end of each individual contract that's part of that, and there are many contracts that make up that $138 million. So the timing of the unwind, again depends on the underlying contract and the volumes and block hours that were flying under those contracts. The original point of the deferral was that, our original volumes were so much below what was originally expected. As those volumes come back that's what's going to create the reversal point, and then eventually that complete unwind of that, but under no circumstances will that revenue not be unwound by the end of the contract period. It's just - so in other words, it'll be unwound over the next sort of two to three years.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator and hi, everybody. Thank you very much for the time. Probably a long dated question. But as you think about and this maybe was sort of asked in a different ways, if you think about capital allocation, how do you think about, I think in the short term, you can't necessarily restart the share repurchase program, but how do you think about getting back to returning capital to shareholders and say 2022 second half, or even 2023?\nRobert Simmons: Hi, Helane, it's Rob. So listen, I mean as you know, we're limited as to anything share repurchase or dividend wise until over a year from now, under our PSP agreement with the government, but again like we did this quarter, we found nice opportunities to sort of tactically repay certain debt. And so that was something that we found attractive. So, we're going to look at a capital allocation very carefully on a risk adjusted basis, we're going to look at other opportunities to deploy that capital. But again over time, I would say all options are sort of back on the table.\nHelane Becker: That's fair. Thank you, Rob. And then the other question, I think I think it was in Chip's prepared remarks, you talked about the pilot and mechanic training programs, and you're accepting new applicants? Can you just talk about the quality of those applicants and how you're thinking about bringing them on and then I just have one more little question?\nChip Childs: Perfect, Helane. This is Chip. Yes, we did discuss that in the prepared remarks, I think overall, it's an interesting situation, because it's coming out of a pandemic, you got a lot of applicants. From a pilot perspective, we've got our classes full clear through March of 2022. That's a tremendous, and these are big classes. And from our perspective, we're excited about the number of people that want to come to work for SkyWest, and we think that they're good candidates, as you know and we talked about in the past, we have a very strong, strong training program for pilots. And certainly is a bar that you have to meet to fly at SkyWest, and our training program, I would argue is the best in the industry. And so look, I think that from our perspective, we've also gone further and deeper into the pipeline to evaluate the candidacy and the qualifications of each student. I mean, we do assess them along the way, even before they come to SkyWest. And I think that's an outstanding opportunity for us to be involved in the 300 schools that we're involved with to help make sure we're getting the curriculum associated with those schools in a way where they can come to SkyWest and make the cut. So from that perspective, there's a such a strong volume that we're seeing that as we continue to work through it, we're going to keep the bar high, and we're comfortable with how we're going to provide pilots for the airline. Same thing goes for mechanics, I think from our perspective, it's a completely different way of recruiting, a completely different way of training. We do see exceptional candidates out there that we're excited to have workforce. Also from our perspective, we may increase the scope of some of those things that we do, we relied a lot on outside providers to do various things with maintenance that candidly as of today are not quite, cutting the bar where we would like to see. And so we're probably going to expand some things that we do internally for a bit to make sure that we can get the right level of work done with relative to our fleet. So that's probably a long answer as well. But I think that we're really excited about the energy of everyone who wants to come to work here at SkyWest, and we're ready to train them and then get them on a great career.\nHelane Becker: No, that's actually very helpful. Thank you for that. And then my other little question is on, I guess the [indiscernible] when it's going down that path, and I'm just kind of wondering, it's not a short-term thing, because it's like not even big aircraft, right. We're talking about up to seven passengers. So I don't know how you're thinking about getting involved or if you are, but I have to ask the question.\nChip Childs: No, it's a great question. And I get the question quite a bit, but I would present it at a high level like this Helane, at this point in time with SkyWest, I can tell you as we sit here as management, we're evaluating, I don't know of a time in our history where we have evaluated stronger opportunities within our core business model, as well as strong opportunities outside of our core business model. So I would tell you that given obviously, our 50 year reputation, what we've been able to do with just amazing people, that that reputation is translating into some things outside of what we normally do. And some we have lots of people knocking on the door wanting us to get involved in multitude of different opportunities. That having been said, it is imperative today at this point in the world, that we remain absolutely positively focused on our people and on our partners and our passengers. We fundamentally believe that that burning most, if not all of our calories in that effort is the right thing to do at this time. And as we continue to make our progress through that and get life back to normal in airline, we're certainly going to continue to entertain some of these other concepts that we think we have tremendous credibility in the sector to capitalize on.\nHelane Becker: That's great. Thanks for that detail. I really appreciate it. And have a great afternoon.\nChip Childs: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks, good afternoon. Wade, just following up on a comment you made earlier on the maintenance side, just given how much is maintenance, you all have in front of you. Can you talk about a little bit more about what you're seeing in that market maybe how much of that you're looking to bring back in-house and then what are some of the challenges you're facing with your third-party providers are?\nWade Steel: Yes, Joseph, this is Wade. I said in my script, we have right now it's, we have over 30 lines of heavy maintenance going on right now. And yes, we have great partners in these areas, right, we do a lot of work with several different people in these areas, what we talk about when we want to - we want to de risk the model a little bit here and bring some of that work in-house, so that we're not so reliant on the third parties. Obviously, we've got a great reputation, as Chip has talked about bringing people into SkyWest and we think we can take advantage of some of those situations and do some of that heavy maintenance in-house. So there will be some of that, that will start to come in in-house and we'll take that, we think they're ramping up as fast as they can, they're hiring our third-party providers, they're going to start getting to a normal level, we hope in the back half of this year, and we start to see a lot of progress. So, we're going to work hard with them, and we're going to work hard internally, and we'll get through this one.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, okay and then Rob, I was hoping maybe you could be a little bit more specific with some of the qualitative guidance you provided like is Q4, thinly profitable, or something better than that, and then the maintenance expense decline you're expecting in '22, can you frame that the magnitude of that, just given what Wade referenced in terms of bringing more in-house? Thank you.\nRobert Simmons: Yes, so on the guidance, I mean we were intentional about not being specific, given the caveats that I laid out in my prepared remarks, but again, I think we're pleased that, we're on a good recovery track, Q4 will almost certainly be a drop off from what we see in Q2, and Q3 because of the noise from the government programs and the partner concessions going away. But we're comfortable with the color that we expect to be both EPS positive and cash flow positive in the fourth quarter, sort of on a standalone basis without some of this other noise we've got. Sorry, what was your other question?\nJoseph DeNardi: If you could maybe frame the magnitude of the maintenance expense decline you're expecting in '22?\nRobert Simmons: Yes, look, I'm not going to go beyond sort of what Wade went on his script to say that, we're going to run hard the rest of the year in the neighborhood of probably a couple $100 million a quarter in maintenance expense. And then starting in 2022, those numbers are going to, we believe will start trailing off and find a new normal level as we get through some of this backlog as Wade mentioned.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey guys, thanks for extra one here. Maybe just one more actually now I just generated a second follow-up, two quick follow-ups, so I know you talked a lot about the reversal of this deferred revenue. I think you said earlier, it's over the next two to three years, could that be more front end loaded, if you start to fly at above 2019 levels, maybe faster than anticipated like I'm just trying to kind of get my mind around, is that straight line of remaining contract or is that really tied to how quickly you can make up block hour production and then I have just one more quick one on maintenance after that? Thanks.\nRobert Simmons: Yes, sure, Katie. So look the model for that deferred revenue is based on volumes on block hours over the - expected over the remaining contracts. So, again the timing of that reversal is contingent upon the timing, as you mentioned of volumes sort of coming back that again, it's a contract by contract basis, that we look at it and we believe that, that all or most of that should be reversed over the next two to three years.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, and then maybe just one really quick one to Joe's question, when we're talking about a new normal maintenance expense, without being too specific like, does that fall somewhere between '19 and we're running into 2021 or it's like closer to '21 or closer to '19 just like any really broad strokes on what that new normal looks like? Thanks again for all the extra time.\nWade Steel: So Catherine, this is Wade. So I'll try to give you a little more specifics on that, it will not be down to 2019 levels, it'll be somewhere between 2019 levels and 2021. And the reason why, it won't be all the way down to 2019 levels, the mix of some of our contracts have changed, as you've heard over the call today, right? Some of all of our contracts that we're adding today or the E175 contract responsible for all the engine maintenance, and all of that, some of the contracts that have gone away, we're not responsible for some of the engine maintenance. So it's a different model that we have going forward. And so it will be at a higher level than 2019. But the revenue model that we have will also reflect the increased maintenance expense going forward. And so we're going to find that normal level here in 2022, but it won't be all the way down to 2019 levels, but it will be somewhere in between. And the biggest reason is just the mix of the flying contracts and how each of those flying contracts are different on how we handle primarily engine maintenance expense or so.\nCatherine O'Brien: Really appreciate that. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nChip Childs: Thank you, appreciate it. We want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today and your interest in SkyWest. We're appreciative of the opportunity to which we have and we've got a lot of challenges in front of us over the next quarter and a lot of opportunity as well, but we're certainly proud of our airline and our teams and the great work they're doing in light of all the challenges and opportunities that we have and with that, we'll talk with you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-05-02 07:52:15", "content": "Operator: Hello. And welcome to the SkyWest, Inc. First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn over the conference to Rob Simmons, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Simmons, please go ahead.\nRob Simmons: Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; and Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer. I\u2019d like to start today by asking Eric to read the Safe Harbor, then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results. Then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2020 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. One year ago at this time, we were only beginning to feel the massive impact of COVID-19 around the world and across our industry. We\u2019ve learned much over this past year and we continue to make good progress on our strategy to emerge from this crisis of better, stronger company. I want to thank our outstanding team of professionals for their continued teamwork, flexibility and dedication in order to deliver an exceptional product in any situation. We made some good headway toward recovery in the first quarter and while there\u2019s still ground to cover, we are seeing strong demand improvement. We are working across all areas of the operation to ensure we\u2019re quick and responsive to what our partners need from us to lead the recovery. Under previously announced agreements, we took delivery of one new CRJ900 for Delta and placed nine used CRJ700s into our American system. We still have 16 more aircraft to transition into our American network this year and we\u2019re making maintenance investments with those aircraft as we bring them out of storage and get them ready for profitable operations. As I just mentioned, we are seeing significant demand for all of our products. These maintenance investments are a critical part of our long-term strategy to build reliability into our fleet, as well as preparing for what we expect will be a busy summer ahead. Wade will talk more about our maintenance programs and associated costs in a minute. During the quarter, we also began hiring mechanics, flight attendants and just recently accepting pilot applications once again. We continue to advance our commitment to diversity through important partnerships with organizations across the industry to ensure we continue attracting the best professionals to join our team. In addition to receiving a Glass Door Employees\u2019 Choice Award for the second year in a row as previously announced, we\u2019re also named to Forbes America\u2019s Best Employers 2021 list during the first quarter, once again the only regional airline on the list. We\u2019re always working to set SkyWest apart as a leader in the industry and as an exceptional employer. I am incredibly proud of our outstanding team of professionals for their network that helps us continue to advance. Thank you. As vaccinations across the U.S. increase, it\u2019s clear, people are anxious to resume a sense of normalcy including travel. We\u2019re seeing more leisure travels on board all aircraft and there is some reason for optimism in terms of demand, especially for SkyWest fleet and product. We believe our ability to deliver a solid product is more important than ever as we work with our partners to support the return to travel. Our operational performance for the quarter improved year-over-year with a 99.97% completion adjusted for weather and nearly 81% of our flights departing on time. Our teams worked hard through severe weather events impacting our operations across Texas and Colorado, and I want to thank them for their teamwork and diligence through these challenges. During the first quarter, we reported net income of $36 million, driven by a slight improvement in production over Q4 and the extension of the payroll support program. Revenue was $535 million, down from the fourth quarter, mainly due to prorate seasonality and temporary PSP2 related partner concessions. These concessions are temporary ways we can support our partners through the current challenges. In terms of liquidity, we had $836 million cash at quarter end and while we have until the end of May to decide further participation, we do not expect to draw additional funds under the CARES Act secured loan facility. Rob will discuss more about this in a minute. Over the past several months, SkyWest has seen strong utilization compared to our competitors. The first quarter is seasonally the weakest for our industry, but in Q1 we did see an increase from the fourth quarter of 2020. While the second and third quarters will still have lower production than 2019 levels, we anticipate the fourth quarter of 2021 will be similar to the fourth quarter 2019 production levels pending continued recovery. Ensuring we\u2019re a solid partner is critical to our business and our ongoing agility remains a key component to our recovery strategy. While we are still below 2019 levels, we remain optimistic about the shape of the recovery so far. As demand returns, we\u2019re confident our fleet will continue to feel a critical role in the country\u2019s return to travel. We are focused on remaining aggressive and deliberate in taking care of our people and our customers as we preserve our liquidity and plan for recovery to ensure we emerge as a better stronger company. Rob will now take us through the financial data.\nRob Simmons: Today, we reported first quarter net income of $36 million or $0.71 diluted earnings per share. Q1 pretax income was $50 million. Our diluted share count for Q1 was 50.7 million shares and our effective tax rate in Q1 was 28.2%. First, let\u2019s talk about revenue. Total Q1 revenue of $535 million is down 27% from Q1 2020 and is down 9% from last quarter. Although, our Q1 block hour production was up 3% sequentially from Q4, as Chip mentioned, the sequential reduction in revenue was primarily driven by PSP2 related temporary partner revenue concessions and prorate seasonality. This breaks down with contract revenue down 27% from Q1 2020 and down 11% from Q4. In both of these comparatives, we have temporary partner revenue concessions in Q1 2021, but not in Q4 2020 or Q1 2020. Prorate revenue is still down 32% year-over-year and was down 4% from last quarter due to seasonality. As we\u2019ve previously said, prorate revenue is nicely levered to a demand recovery. Leasing and other revenue is up 14% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. These GAAP results include the effect of the deferral of $21 million of revenue this quarter, compared to $111 million during 2020. As of the end of Q1, we have $132 million of cumulative deferred revenue that will be recognized in future periods. As discussed last quarter, the timing and amount of future deferrals and the reversal thereof into revenue depends on the shape and cadence of the recovery of our flying. All deferred revenue will be reversed into revenue by the end of the various contract periods. We may continue to defer some revenue into later 2021 when it could begin to reverse. Let\u2019s move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $836 million, up from $826 million last quarter. Our CapEx during the first quarter was $56 million for four used aircraft spare engines and other fixed assets. Our expectation for 2021 CapEx is approximately $650 million to $700 million, including the purchase of 18 new E175s later this year under our previously announced contract with American. This compares to $438 million in CapEx in 2020. We ended Q1 with debt of $3.1 billion, down from $3.2 billion as of year-end 2020. Let\u2019s talk about liquidity, as of March 31, 2020, our cash position was $836 million in addition to availability of $665 million undrawn in our CARES Act loan and approximately $40 million available on our revolving line of credit. We have until later in May 2021 to decide how much additional draws we will make under the CARE Act secured loan facility, if any. Based on the high cost of warrant coverage of any additional draws on that facility, it is likely that we will not draw any additional amounts and may choose to also repay the $60 million outstanding currently on that facility and let that additional availability go. This would release $1.5 billion of pledged collateral under this government facility. During Q1, $193 million in PSP2 grants was recognized as income in the form of a contra expense laid out clearly as its own line item in our P&L. This is a change from grant income of only $3 million recognized in Q4. Subsequent to quarter end, SkyWest entered into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury for approximately $250 million in funding under the PSP3 program for airlines. $45 million of this amount represents a low interest, no amortization 10 year loan, $205 million of the $250 million is the payroll grant, expected to be recorded as income largely in Q2 and Q3 2021. Under PSP3, SkyWest will issue the U.S. Treasury Department warrants to purchase approximately 78,317 shares of SkyWest common stock at a strike price of $57.47. Also, subsequent to quarter end, SkyWest received an additional $35 million top-up to PSP2. This top-up breaks down as $10 million in debt and $25 million in grants with warrants to purchase 25,958 shares of SkyWest common stock at a strike price of $40.41. Last quarter, we estimated that we would burn cash in the first half of 2021 at a rate of about $250,000 per day or $7 million per month. Based on March ending cash of $836 million, we are running a bit better than our forecast. We expect to be slightly cash positive in the first half of 2021 before the possible voluntary repayment of the $60 million outstanding under our CARES Act secured loan. Depending on the pace of the recovery, we could be cash positive in the second half of 2021. If the economic effects turn out to be worse and the recovery is slower than we currently expect, we have additional liquidity tools that we can call on, including our cash balances, our revolver and either $665 million of undrawn availability under our secured CARE Act loan facility or the $1.5 billion of collateral that freeze up if we decide to let that facility expire next month. In addition to our strong core liquidity position, we are expecting 2021 and 2022 to be years, where we continue to focus on our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2021, our debt net of cash balance is actually $200 million lower than it was as of the end of the year 2019. In 2021, we expect to repay over $400 million in principal debt balances related to existing aircraft financing. Of course, we continue to expect to take delivery of additional aircraft in 2021 debt, as usual will be financed with long-term debt financing. But over the next couple of years, we expect to reduce our absolute debt balance, while maintaining strong liquidity. During Q1, the debt on another 24 used aircraft was fully repaid. Including partner-owned aircraft, over 50% of our fleet in service now has no financing obligation. We also continue to have minimal tail risk of around $100 million, the dollar delta between financing term and contract term on our fleet. Our next pocket of tail risk is now out to late 2022. Especially in times of great uncertainty like this and consistent with our policy and practice, we are not in a position to give any specific EPS guidance at this time. But let me give you a little color. Ignoring the effect of PSP3, net of related temporary partner concessions, we expect Q2 earnings to be close to breakeven. With the second half of 2021, likely positive both in earnings and cash flow. Continued headwinds to our model include several factors I\u2019d like to call out. Number one, our prorate business was still unprofitable in Q1. Wade will talk more about this in a minute. Number two, maintenance expense was up $17 million from Q4 as we continue to prepare our fleet for a busy summer. Maintenance expense for 2021 will likely continue at the current run rate before finding a new lower normal level later in 2022. And number three, deferred revenue was $21 million in Q1 2021 and now it\u2019s a cumulative $132 million. We expect to defer additional revenue until later in 2021 when it could start to reverse. And now some tailwinds, number one, production is trending higher into the summer with good demand for our product. Number two, new PSP3 program brings us $205 million in grant income to be recognized in Q2 and Q3 before any new temporary partner concessions. And number three, deferred revenue may begin reversing later in 2021, pending the timing of the recovery. We are excited that the actions we are taking now and expect to take over the next few quarters are setting us up nicely for the new normal in the future. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I\u2019ll provide a fleet and production status update, as well as an update on our prorate and leasing businesses. To update by partner, during the quarter, we put nine CRJ700S into service with American, bringing our total CRJ700S under contract with American to 74. We anticipate placing 16 additional CRJ700S into service from our existing fleet throughout the remainder of the year, bringing our American CRJ700 fleet total to 90 by year-end. These 25 aircraft have been in long-term storage for the past few years and have required a lot of maintenance to return to service. We also have 20 new E175 scheduled for American service in 2022, with deliveries scheduled from Q3 of this year to the first quarter of 2022. This will bring our total American fleet to 110 in 2022. Let me briefly talk about our Delta agreement. During the first quarter, we took delivery of one new CRJ900 under our Delta agreement. The aircraft is owned and financed by Delta. As of March 31, 2021, we have 116 aircraft under our Delta -- under contract with Delta. During the quarter, we worked with all of our major partners on a second round of contract concessions that included temporary rate reductions. These concessions are reflected in our first quarter results. We expect to bring -- we expect to work with our major partners during the second and third quarters for a third round of concessions. Let me review our current production. During the first quarter, our completed block hours were down by approximately 23% compared to the same quarter last year. Based on the current schedules we have from our major partners for the second quarter of 2021, we anticipate that our block hours will be up by approximately 10% compared to the first quarter of 2021. And we -- and as we look at the third quarter, we anticipate that our block hours will be down by approximately 5% compared to Q3 2019 and the fourth quarter will be approximately the same as the fourth quarter of 2019, pending continued improvement in the recovery curve. The E175 fleet continues to fill an important need for our major partners. While the majority of the reductions in block hours have been on the CRJ200 fleet, our Q1 E175 block hours were down by 3% compared to Q1 last year. While our Q1 CRJ200 block hours were down by 53%. Let me talk a little bit about our prorate business. During the first quarter, we reduced our prorate block hours by 6% and revenue decreased by 32% or approximately $32 million compared to Q1 2020. We anticipate our prorate block hours for Q2 to be up by approximately 14% and the prorate revenue to increase by 30% as compared to Q1 2021 as we see demand beginning to recover. Our prorate model is nicely levered to the recovery. With prorate revenue down 32%, we expect the incremental revenue coming back to the prorate business will have attractive margin characteristics. Let me shift gears to our leasing business. Last quarter, we announced that we signed a purchase agreement to acquire 13 additional used CRJ700. As of today, we have closed on five of the 13 aircraft and expect to close on the others throughout 2021. We are working with several parties for SkyWest to either operate or lease these aircraft. Following the purchase of these 13 aircraft, we will own or control 169 CRJ700 aircraft. We are fortunate to be in a unique position to purchase these aircraft as we believe the CRJ700 is an exceptional asset that will continue to set SkyWest apart with strong demand from our major partners. Let me talk briefly about our current maintenance expense, which is up $44 million or 27% from Q1 2020. The increase is primarily due to anticipated recovery of our flying and bringing the 25 aircraft from the American agreement out of long-term storage. We currently have 30 lines of heavy maintenance at our third-party providers and the ramp-up of these suppliers have been slower than anticipated. To provide some context, this level of maintenance unprecedented in our history, we anticipate that we will continue maintenance at roughly these levels through this year and expect to return to more normal levels during the second half of 2022. We have spent the last several years, reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility to ensure we\u2019re well positioned. We are committed to continuing our work with each of our major partners to provide creative solutions as we work toward full demand recovery. Okay. Operator, we\u2019re ready for our sell side Q&A.\nOperator: Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Hey. Just a couple here, if I compare the temporary rate reductions. So if I heard you correctly, Rob, the second phase was obviously this March quarter, right? And there was nothing in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter. So the first phase, I think, covered the second quarter and third quarter of 2020 and I think we have a third phase that will be in the second quarter and third quarter of 2021. Is that the timing on these temporary rate reductions, the concessions?\nRob Simmons: Yes. That\u2019s correct.\nMike Linenberg: Have you called out the magnitude of those reductions in your Qs or can you give us a feel or how do they tie to when we look at deferred revenue. Is that a good guide as that builds up to give us a sense of what these reductions are? I am just -- I am trying to get a sense here for the magnitude, I don\u2019t want to double count on a couple of items here.\nWade Steel: Yeah. Michael, this is Wade. So on the\u2026\nMike Linenberg: Hi, Wade.\nWade Steel: On the temporary rate -- hi. So on the temporary rate reductions, we\u2019ve been working with our partners for several quarters. As you said, during the second quarter and third quarter of last year, there were temporary rate reductions this quarter. We\u2019re not going to get into the magnitude of these, but they are significant. We\u2019ve worked with them. We want to make sure we\u2019re a good partner. We\u2019re proactively helping them with their businesses and their recovery as well.\nMike Linenberg: So, Wade, as I think about modeling for, though, because these are temporary, when they come back, as well as a reversal in deferred revenue as we go out to 2022,2023, there will be a meaningful bump up, right, is that...\nChip Childs: Yeah. Mike, look, as we talked about for the rest of the year, where we expect Q2 to be in the breakeven neighborhood and then positive earnings in Q3 and Q4, that is ignoring the effect of -- the net effect of the PSP grant income that will come in over Q2 and Q3 and the partner concessions related to that, that will also come in over\u2026\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nChip Childs: \u2026 Q2 and Q3.\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nA - Chip Childs: So that guidance, just to be clear, was before any PSP3 noise in those numbers.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Then, Wade, I\u2019ll probably hit you on this question as it relates to the 18 American airplanes. So they\u2019re coming -- I guess, 18 are going to come in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Two are going to come in 2022. You\u2019re going to incur the CapEx this year. It\u2019s pretty sizable. But it looks like they\u2019re not going to go into service until the March quarter of 2022. So are you just going to deliver them to American and get some sort of compensation or not? I am just -- it seems like there\u2019s like a two quarter, three quarter mismatch between when the planes come in, when they actually go into productive service. I am curious about the timing on that.\nWade Steel: Yeah. So you\u2019re right, we have 20 new 175 coming in, and as you said, the majority of those are coming in in Q3 and Q4 of this year. And we\u2019ve worked with either the OEM or the partner to cover the\u2026\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nWade Steel: \u2026 costs associated with carrying those for a little bit.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, Okay. That\u2019s great. And then just my last one, this is just on pilots. Hard to believe, we obviously, were dealing with a pilot shortage and then, I think, at one point, we thought we all of a sudden went from a deficit to surf it, and now all of a sudden, everybody\u2019s hiring again, including yourselves, as well as new entrants, Avello, Breeze and even carriers like ExpressJet, it looks like that they\u2019re going to be reincarnated as a prorate operator. So I am curious sort of where your pipeline is tie into either flight schools? And are we going to go from a situation where we thought we were going to have a lot of pilots out because of the PSP and new entrants coming into the market, that it\u2019s actually going to get pretty tight, pretty quickly, combined with the fact that we have a slew of retirements across the industry. I mean, you\u2019ve got a pretty great workforce. So it\u2019s a broad question there, but I am just curious if we\u2019re going to start running into pilot problems over the next six months to 12 months? Thanks.\nChip Childs: So, Mike, it\u2019s Chip.\nMike Linenberg: Hi, Chip.\nChip Childs: That\u2019s a great question. And I think that it teed us up really, really well and it\u2019s almost like we want to go back to where we were over a year ago. You remember the conversation we had on previous pre-COVID earnings calls that we are built for a pilot shortage. We have 300\u2026\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nChip Childs: W have 300 schools that we work with and we had a very strong machine going and tremendous demand to come fly at SkyWest. Now I will say this, as we open the doors back a couple of weeks ago to start hiring again, bringing guys back to class, getting the pipeline up. We were astonished at the response and\u2026\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nChip Childs: \u2026 we knew it would be strong because of how we\u2019ve managed through the pandemic. We\u2019ve had a lot of credible awards and things happen to us as we\u2019ve tried to manage through what\u2019s happened this last year and I think it goes to show the demand to come with SkyWest. So I would say, honestly, we\u2019ve been overwhelmed with the demand to come here. We\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised. I don\u2019t think that SkyWest is going to have a problem anytime in the next foreseeable future. Long-term, is it going to get tight, possibly, but so far there\u2019s still very strong supply and there\u2019s a lot of new entrants, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re SkyWest and I think a lot of people feel the same way. So we\u2019re excited about the opportunity. It\u2019s never been -- there\u2019s never been a better time to come to SkyWest. I will say that, and we\u2019re excited to do some things with the schools to enhance the professionalism and diversity that we want to -- the type of company that we want to be.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Great. Thanks, Chip. Thank everyone.\nChip Childs: Thank you.\nWade Steel: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Thanks. On your 4Q block hours back to flat. I wonder if you could just outline what the fleet changes year-over-year and does that imply higher or lower utilization? And for my follow-up, if we assume kind of keeping that more normalized utilization into 2022, plus your booked growth, what sort of topline -- high level topline should we be looking at into 2022?\nWade Steel: Hi, Duane. This is Wade. I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the production. So the production mix, if you compare Q4 of 2019 to Q4 of 2021, we are going to see a pretty sizable production mix difference, right? As I said in my script, even this quarter, the E175 are only down 3% compared to where they were a year ago, and as we continue to bring on airplanes and continue to put them in service, that mix is going to change. And our 50-seat mix, the CRJ200, we\u2019re down about 53% and so the mix will definitely change quite significantly. The revenue side of this should -- net of -- if you exclude the concessions, once those get out, you should be very consistent to -- the revenue side should be very consistent with where we were at in 2019.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And I guess, just to extend that, right, if we keep that more normalized level of production, combined with the booked growth that you have, what is sort of baseline production growth into 2022, if we just sort of run rate that forward?\nWade Steel: Yeah. So, at this point, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared to quite talk about 2022, but we will see continued growth. As I talked about, the American E175, we have 20 of those coming into service in basically Q1 and Q2. And so we will continue to see growth there and so we will have additional growth on top of that, but at this point, we\u2019re not prepared to give guidance on where it will be in 2022.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then just to follow-up on Mike\u2019s question and maybe you answered it in your response to him, but should we be thinking about the consent -- concessions very similarly to the amount of PSP grant funding that you\u2019re receiving?\nWade Steel: Yeah. So directionally it will be very close. It\u2019s directionally the same amount, yes. Some of it can\u2026\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay.\nWade Steel: \u2026 stick a little bit with us, but not all of it, but directionally, yeah.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. I think the plan for the E175 fleet is pretty clear. But I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about what your other fleet types would look like kind of exiting this year from fleet count standpoint?\nWade Steel: Yeah. Savi, this is Wade. So the CRJ700s, we have a lot of movement in our CRJ700s right now. As of today, as of the end of the quarter, we had 74 CRJ700s under contract with American. By the end of the year, we will have 90 with those guys. So there\u2019s 16 airplanes that we are going to put into service with American through the back half of 2021. So that is the primary fleet growth on the other ones. The CRJ200s are very consistent with where they are at. We shrunk the Delta fleet a few quarters ago on the CRJ200s and then on the CRJ900, it\u2019s a very stable fleet at this point. So that\u2019s -- the primary growth on the CRJ side is going to be in the CRJ700.\nSavi Syth: Got it. But the other, like, if I look at -- you had 74 CRJ700s with American and 98 in total, just the other 24 kind of stick around or should I just assume 90 plus 24? What does that total go to?\nWade Steel: Yeah. So -- yeah. So that\u2019s a great question. So we have 19 under contract with United and they -- we anticipate leaving those with those guys and then the rest of them are with Delta and they are also under contract with Delta and we anticipate them staying there.\nSavi Syth: Make sense. And thanks for that Wade. And then on just on the 1Q quarter, it seemed a little bit stronger than anticipated, is that fair? Did that come from block hours, is there anywhere else that may be came in better or it may be came in line with what you were thinking?\nWade Steel: Yeah. No. As we talked about, Savi, I mean, production was up sequentially. And I guess, net-net, we\u2019re pleased with the level of demand that we\u2019re seeing for our product and we\u2019re obviously investing right now in that product in the form of maintenance and getting ready for a busy summer.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Make sense. So this is -- and is it fair to say the surprise came out on the CPA side more so than the prorate side?\nWade Steel: Yeah. I would say, yes, demand continued -- was strong on the CPA side. Again, we continue to -- on the prorate side. Again, prorate was not profitable in the first quarter. But again, as we see volumes coming back in general that, that\u2019s going to -- that will benefit that prorate side of the business during the summer and beyond.\nSavi Syth: Make sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the time. So I\u2019ve got a similar one to Mike\u2019s first question as well. Just as we think forward to back when you\u2019re fully up and running, you\u2019re full schedule with your partners again at a minimum contract -- contractual minimum, it sounds like more like back to pre-COVID levels. How should we think about your margin profile? I can think of a couple of tailwinds. So higher percentage of E175 flying, probably, the pre-COVID, you take some of these new deliveries? And then the probably the positive impact of that deferred revenue coming back on, as you talked about earlier. So if we put those things together, should we just think about margins probably being higher post COVID or are there some tailwinds, I am not giving enough do? Thanks.\nRob Simmons: Hey. Thanks for the question, Catie. It\u2019s Rob. So, look, I think that, I mean, as we sort of indicated that there are some gives and takes in the margin question. I think in the near-term, as we indicated that things like maintenance are going to continue to run hot, as we bring new airplanes back into service again, as we prepare for what\u2019s looking -- what\u2019s shaping up to be a pretty busy summer. I think there\u2019s some puts and takes in there and they\u2019re. Obviously prorate is another area that\u2019s a drag currently on our overall margins as prorates not profitable, but obviously, we\u2019re going to -- we\u2019re hoping that, as we said that, that business is nicely levered to the recovery and those will come back. You mentioned deferred revenue, that\u2019s another one, that -- again in the next quarter or so we could have some modest amounts of incremental deferred revenue. Again, depending on how quickly things come back. But, obviously, when that starts to reverse, that reversal will be 100% margin in that deferred revenue. So as things -- again, as -- it\u2019s sort of a long-winded answer to your question, but I think near-term again, we\u2019ve got those headwinds on the expense side. Longer term, we hope that the combination of demand and the reversal of some of these other items will be positive.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then yesterday we had one of the big global lessors talking about airlines starting to make -- starting to take action to plan for the future and lock in additional aircraft, hopefully, will we get back through the recovery and back to growth perhaps versus 2019. Not asking about your leasing business, but just more in general, are you starting to have conversations with your partners potential incremental regional flying over the next couple of years? I imagine they were mostly just concerned with semi cash burn throughout 2020. So would love just to hear if the long-term growth planning conversations are back on the table or if it\u2019s still really flat? Thanks.\nChip Childs: Hey, Catie. This is Chip. That\u2019s a great question. Thanks for asking that because I think it has good perspective as our strategy. First thing that we\u2019re still focused on through the rest of this year is out executing everybody relative to helping our partners recover. But in all candidness, we\u2019ve been having those conversations even through the pandemic, because we also thought that, that was a big part of how they could recover. And certainly, today is big demand for a regional lift and we think as the economy post-COVID continues to evolve, the smaller locations and midsized cities are going to have more travel demand. And so we\u2019re having a lot of conversations with the partners about this long-term aircraft orders. We\u2019re also having a lot of conversations with manufacturers about evolutionary ways that we can meet the needs of the environmental footprint that we\u2019re trying to achieve with our partners and all of those things. So in quick answer to your question, we\u2019re having a lot of dialogue with both partners and manufacturers. But it\u2019s secondary to making sure we continue to recover from the pandemic, but those conversations are alive and well.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. And maybe I\u2019ll just sneak one more in since you brought it up. But I guess any thoughts on like what the future aircraft for growth will be for SkyWest? I am pretty sure the EQ is still not scope compliant. Not sure what other options there are out there in terms of new -- next-generation aircraft, so would just love to hear what your thoughts are? Thanks.\nChip Childs: Yeah. Thanks, Catie. That goes to an entirely different conversation as well. I mean, I can tell you very, very clearly that we -- part of our long-term approach for the last almost 50 years of SkyWest is to out execute the competition and continue to make sure that we\u2019re strategically in a strong spot and we\u2019re evaluating a lot of opportunities. One thing I will say is that the world is recognized this as an excellent performer, a dispatcher of aircraft and we do have a lot of conversation about the future of aviation with several entities. We are not going to get into more detailed conversation or announcements about anything of that nature until we are comfortable with that. But again, I\u2019ll go back to the original premise of your other question as we need to get ourselves out of this pandemic and we need to get recovery. We need to take care of our people, take care of our partners and our customers. But again, we\u2019re also not oblivious to the needs of what the flying public is going to want and we stand to be -- our strategy to be at the forefront of all those things. So, hopefully, that helps kind of give you the perspective of where we are.\nCatherine O'Brien: Yeah. All right. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, Operator. Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for the time. So two questions, one is pre-pandemic was the prorate business ever profitable in the first quarter or is that just normally a seasonally weak quarter?\nWade Steel: Yeah. Helane, this is Wade. We\u2019re very consistent with the rest of the industry. Q1 is always -- even pre-pandemic was definitely weaker. But, historically, we did make a little bit of money in Q1 but not a lot on the prorate side.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then my other question is, I think, last year, some of the airports we\u2019re working with the airlines to mitigate landing fees and other airport facility charges using their care spending, right, to help you guys. So is the decline in year-over-year expense net line item more related to -- is that the run rate or is that the -- should we think about that as being coming back is flying some stock?\nWade Steel: Yeah. Helane, this is Wade again. So, on the landing fee side, the majority of those, the partners take care of directly and are not reflected in our financial statements. The other line item on our expenses is primarily just volume related and the decreases associated with volume.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Thanks. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one quick question for me, I think, I just want to understand, Wade, on the maintenance challenges you\u2019re facing with your third-party providers. Is that just a byproduct of the tight labor market or are you kind of displeased with the performance of those providers?\nWade Steel: That\u2019s a great question. There\u2019s a lot going on obviously. As we said, there\u2019s 30 -- we have over 30 lines of C check going on, a lot of it is just the ramp-up, right? So we never really stock during the pandemic, but we definitely have increased as we anticipate the flying come back and as we got some of these American contracts. Our third-party providers there are great partners of ours. They do a lot of things. They\u2019re just bringing back their workforces. They\u2019re getting them trained. They\u2019re getting them back up to speed. So I anticipate that they\u2019ll be able to execute at a very high level for us going forward. SkyWest is very uniquely positioned with the size of our fleet and the strength of our own internal maintenance capabilities that we can -- we should be able to navigate through any challenges that are in front of us, so.\nJoseph DeNardi: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chip Childs for any closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Keith. Thanks to everyone for joining us again on the call today. We really appreciate your support and interest in SkyWest. I especially, again, want to thank our people. I am proud of our airline and our team and the great work they\u2019re doing to support each other in the long-term success of SkyWest. I couldn\u2019t be more proud and fortunate to be involved with such a great team. Thanks again and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 4, "year": 2020, "date": "2021-02-05 22:30:05", "content": "Operator: Good day. Welcome to SkyWest Inc. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Results Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Simmons, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nRobert Simmons: Thanks, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; and Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer. I'd like to start today by asking Eric to read the safe harbor, then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results. Then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2019 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'll turn the call over to Chip.\nRussell Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I want to begin by saying how proud I am of the SkyWest teams and how they have pulled together to confront this incredibly challenging and unpredictable environment. This past year has tested the metal of our industry, our business and our people in every possible way. We know we're still a long way from returning to our 2019 demand levels, and we also know our industry will never be the same. Despite the ongoing volatility, our teams continue to demonstrate remarkable flexibility. We've stayed proactive to maintain our focus and learned invaluable lessons to adapt to this new environment and keep our people, passengers and business safe. During the quarter, we reported a net loss of $46 million, and for the full year 2020, we reported a net loss of $9 million. While we are still clearly in the midst of the crisis, we appreciate Congress' continued recognition of the critical nature of our employees and the industry with the extension of the payroll support program through the 2021 Appropriations Act. We have received half of that $233 million funding and expect to receive the rest this month. Rob will discuss more about this in just a minute. As we anticipated, we did see an uptick in fourth quarter production compared to third quarter, although it is still down by almost 30% from what we saw a year ago. Based on the current forecast, we believe - we continue to expect a choppy recovery period and maintain and remain prepared to respond as necessary. Our ongoing agility will remain a critical component of our recovery strategy. We are working closely and collaboratively with each of our partners to ensure we're best positioned to meet their needs. Very early in the pandemic, we set key priorities to ensure we successfully emerge from the crisis and ensure we play a key role in the recovery. First, the personal health and well-being of our people and passengers; second, maintaining strong cash and liquidity; and third, remaining strong and agile and working with our partners. As we'll discuss today, we've held firm to those priorities and are fortunate to maintain a strong balance sheet and product and to have successfully avoided furloughing any crew member or mechanic. During the most difficult year in our industry's history, we're honored to be named a Glassdoor Employees' Choice award for the second year in a row. This year, being named the top 50% and the only regional airline company on the list. This type of recognition is something we work together with our people to earn every single day, and I'm incredibly proud of our outstanding team of professionals. Well done. Against the challenging backdrop of 2020, we maintained our focus to successfully execute on our agreements and ensure we are prepared to play a central role in responding to demand recovery. Throughout the year, we maintained our strong delivery schedule while remaining flexible with our partners and their needs. We received 37 E175 for United and Delta and removed 62 50-seat aircraft from service in our Delta and American operations. We also acquired additional aircraft within our leasing entity and have ensured that business is focused on assets within our operating footprint. We successfully resumed continued qualification training with expanded COVID testing across the operation and maintain stringent requirements and processes for social distancing, cleaning and face base covering. We've stayed ahead of the latest industry in federal health guidance, and our teams are successfully achieving things we couldn't have imagined a year ago. I want to thank them for their outstanding work. This year, we're scheduled to take delivery of 18 new E175s for American. As we announced last quarter, we'll place 25 additional CRJ700 into American service. Ensuring we're a solid partner is important to our business, and we've maintained tremendous flexibility and support to ensure we work with our partners toward demand recovery. We continue to invest in our fleet and maintenance programs as part of our long-term strategy to build reliability into our fleet. Undoubtedly, the next several months will be turbulent, but we're optimistic about the shape of the recovery so far. As demand returns, we are confident our fleet will continue to fill a critical role in the return to travel. We are focused on maintaining aggressive and - remaining aggressive and deliberate to take care of our people and our customers as we preserve our liquidity and plan for recovery to ensure we emerge as a better, stronger business. Rob will now take us through the financial data.\nRobert Simmons: Today, we reported fourth quarter net loss of $46 million or $0.93 loss per share. Q4 pre-tax loss was $59 million. Our basic share count for Q4 was 50.2 million, and our effective tax rate in Q4 was 21.8%. First, let's talk about revenue. Total revenue was down 21% from Q4 2019 but is up 29% from last quarter. This breaks down with contract revenue down 16% from Q4 '19 and up 30% from Q3. Prorate revenue is still down 47% year-over-year but was up 18% from last quarter. As we've previously said, prorate revenue is nicely levered to a demand recovery. Full year 2020 revenue is down 28% from 2019. These GAAP results include the effect of a deferral of $12 million of revenue this quarter, down from $30 million deferred in Q3 and $69 million in Q2. As discussed last quarter, the timing and amount of future deferrals and the reversal thereof into revenue depends on the shape and cadence of the recovery of our flight. All deferred revenue will be reversed into revenue by the end of the various contract periods. We currently expect to continue to defer some revenue into later 2021 when it may begin to reverse. Let me move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $826 million, up from $822 million last quarter. Our CapEx during the fourth quarter was $258 million, comprised of $230 million for four E175s and 22 CRJ700s with $28 million in aircraft engines and other parts. This puts us at $438 million in CapEx for the full year 2020. Our expectation for 2021 CapEx is approximately $650 million to $700 million, including the purchase of 18 new E175s under our contract with American. We ended the year with debt of $3.2 billion, up slightly from $3 billion as of year-end 2019. The increase in debt from year-end 2019 through year-end 2020 is driven primarily by the CARES Act funding from the government, including $60 million of five-year CARES Act secured debt and $105 million of 10-year unsecured low-cost PSP debt. We expect to make a gross pay down of $400 million in aircraft debt principal next year before the financing of new aircraft acquired next year or other draws on our CARES Act facility. Let's talk about liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, our cash position was $826 million in addition to availability of $665 million undrawn in our CARES Act loan and $40 million on our revolving line of credit. We have until May 2021 to decide how much in additional draws we will make under the CARES Act secured loan facility, if any. During Q4, $3 million in PSP grants was recognized as income in the form of a contract expense laid out clearly as its own line item in our P&L. This is down from grant income of $190 million recognized in Q3. Subsequent to year-end, SkyWest entered into an agreement with the U.S. treasury for $233 million in funding under the PSP two funding program for airlines. $40 million of this amount represents a low interest, no amortization 10-year loan, and $193 million of the $233 million is a payroll grant expected to be recorded as income largely in Q1 2021. Last quarter, we estimated that we would burn cash through the end of 2020 at a rate of about $250,000 per day or $7 million per month. Based on December ending cash of $826 million, we actually did a little bit better than our forecast. We expect to continue to burn cash at a modest rate through the first half of the year at a rate similar to our Q4 expectation, again, of $250,000 per day or $7 million per month. Depending on the pace of the recovery, we could reach cash burn breakeven by mid-year 2021. If the economic effects turn out to be worse and the recovery is slower than we currently expect, we have additional liquidity tools we can call on, including our cash balances, our revolver, and the $665 million undrawn availability under our secured CARES Act loan facility. In addition to our strong core liquidity position, we are expecting 2021 and 2022 to be years when we continue to focus on the balance sheet as of 12/31/2020. Our debt net of cash balance is actually lower than it was at 12/31/2019. In 2021, we expect to repay at least $400 million in principal debt balances related to existing aircraft financing. Of course, we continue to expect to take delivery of additional aircraft in 2021 that will be financed with long-term debt financing. But over the next couple of years, we expect to reduce our absolute debt balance while maintaining strong liquidity. We love the flexibility that having a strong balance sheet gives us. We continue to enjoy the position where approximately 33% of our fleet has no financing on it. This number goes to 45% when you include partner-owned aircraft that we operate. We also continue to have minimal tail risk of around $100 million, the dollar delta between financing term and contract term on our fleet. Our next pocket of tail risk is now out to late 2022. Especially in times of great uncertainty like this and consistent with our policy and practice, we are not in a position to give any specific EPS guidance at this time, but let me give you a little color. First, I will say that including the recognition of approximately $193 million of PSP two grant incomes in Q1, we expect to report GAAP profit in Q1. At this point, we would expect Q2 2021 to be less than breakeven. Continued headwinds to our model include several factors I'd like to call out. Number one, prorate revenue is still weak, down 47% or $63 million from Q4 of last year. Number two, maintenance expense is up $37 million from Q3 or 25%, consistent with a 29% increase in revenue. Maintenance expense will likely plateau in 2021 compared to Q4 2020. Number three, deferred revenue was $69 million in Q2, $30 million in Q3 and $12 million in Q4. We expect to defer additional revenue until later in 2021 when it could start to reverse. And number four, next quarter, Q1 is seasonally one of the weakest of the year. And now some tailwinds. Number one, production should continue to trend slightly higher. Number two, the new PSP two programs brings us $193 million in grant income in Q1 before any new partner concessions. Number three, the discrete increase to our credit loss reserve in the second half of 2020 is not expected to recur. Number four, depreciation is trending lower coming out of 2020 and should be similar in 2021 to the Q4 2020 run rate. And number five, deferred revenue is trending lower and again, may begin reversing later in 2021, pending the timing of the recovery. We are excited that the actions we are taking now and expect to take over the next few quarters are setting us up nicely for the new normal in the future. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I'll provide a fleet and production status update as well as an update on our prorate and leasing businesses. To update by partner, as of today, we have 65 CRJ700s under contract with American and 25 additional CRJ700s to be placed into service from our existing fleet throughout the year, bringing the American CRJ700 fleet total to 90 by year-end 2021. These 25 aircraft have been in long-term storage for the past few years. We also have 20 new E175 scheduled to go into service in 2022 in the American system, with deliveries scheduled for Q3 of this year to the first quarter of 2022, bringing our total American fleet to 110 aircraft in 2022. Let me talk briefly about our Delta agreement. During the fourth quarter, we took delivery of four new E175s under our Delta agreement. This brings our E175 fleet total to Delta to 71. We plan to take delivery of our final Delta finance CRJ900 during the first half of 2021. You may recall that we had 55 CRJ200 scheduled to expire under our Delta agreement at the end of 2020. We've returned the 19 Delta-owned aircraft to Delta. The remaining 36 aircraft are SkyWest owned with no remaining financing obligations and are fully depreciated. These assets will be ready and available to respond to support the return of demand. Under our United partnership, we have signed - we signed an extension for 70 CRJ200 in early 2020. We also took delivery of 25 used E175 aircraft during the year. All of which are currently under contract and flying. This brings our current United E175 fleet total to 90. We are currently working with all of our major partners on a second round of contract concessions that could include temporarily waiving contract minimums and a temporary rate reduction. We anticipate the majority of these concessions will be completed in Q1. We are working proactively with each partner to provide creative solution to the industry's current challenges. Let me review our current production. During the fourth quarter, our completed block hours were down by approximately 27% compared to the same quarter last year. Based on the current schedules we have from our major partners for the first quarter of 2021, we anticipate that our block hours will be up by approximately 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The E175 fleet continues to fill an important need for our major partners. While the majority of the reduction in block hours has been on the CRJ200 fleet, our Q4 E175 block hours were down by 7% compared to Q4 last year, while our Q4 CRJ200 block hours were down by 50%. As of December 31, 2019, we had 156 E175s under contract with our major partners. By the middle of 2022, we expect to have 213 E175s under contract with our partners. Let me talk a little bit about our prorate business. During the fourth quarter, we reduced our prorate block hours by approximately 24%, and revenue decreased by 47% or approximately $63 million compared to Q4 2019. We anticipate our prorate block hours for Q1 to be up by approximately 3%, and the prorate revenue will be seasonally down compared to last year - last quarter. Our prorate model is nicely levered to the recovery. With prorate revenue down 47%, we expect the incremental revenue coming back to the prorate business will have attractive margin characteristics. Let me shift gears to our leasing business. Last quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire 21 used CRJ700s and a 50-seat configuration and lease the aircraft under a multiyear term to another regional operator. We closed on the purchase of all 21 aircraft during Q4, including the related lease agreement. Today, we are also announcing that we signed a purchase agreement to acquire 13 new CRJ700. As of today, we have closed on four of the 13 aircraft and expect to close on the others throughout 2021. We are working with several parties for SkyWest to either operate or lease these aircraft. Following the purchase of these 13 aircraft, we will own or control 169 CRJ700 aircraft. We are fortunate to be in a unique position to purchase these aircraft as we believe the CRJ700 is an exceptional asset that will continue to set SkyWest apart with strong demand from our major partners. Let me talk briefly about our current and forecast maintenance expense over 2021. Maintenance expense is up $50 million from Q4 2019 or 36%, and we expect our fourth - our first quarter maintenance expense to be up slightly from the same quarter last year. This increase is primarily due to anticipated recovery of our flying and bringing the 25 aircraft for the American agreement out of long-term storage. We have spent the last several years reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility to ensure we're well positioned. We are committed to continuing our work with each of our major partners to provide creative solutions through this difficult time in our industry.\nRobert Simmons: Okay. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A now, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Helane Becker from Cowen.\nHelaneBecker: Thank you very much for answering my question. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the time. I was actually going to ask a question about maintenance on the 25 aircraft that have been in storage. One, which you kind of answered in your prepared remarks way. But once those aircraft comes back, what is the cadence for maintenance beyond that for 2021?\nWadeSteel: So Helane, I think the question is, so our maintenance expense, what we said in our prepared remarks, is our maintenance expense is up $50 million from Q4 to Q4. We anticipate Q1 to be fairly consistent. The rest of 2021, it will - we are going to continue to bring aircraft out of long-term storage throughout the remainder of 2021. The levels that we had in Q4 will probably be fairly consistent for Q2, Q3 and Q4 as well of - during 2021. That's what we currently anticipate to bring those airplanes out of storage and get them reliably back up into the fleet.\nHelaneBecker: Got you. Okay. And then my follow-on question is with respect to your partners and spring break, we're in February, is there any indication that maybe not the beginning of March, but the end of March, is starting to see signs of improved traffic numbers?\nRussellChilds: Helane, this is Chip. That's a great question. There are a couple of challenges in predicting that stuff. We certainly would probably - given the nature of our business and our relationship with our partners, lean more from what they've reported and what they're seeing. From our perspective, the fight levels that we've kind of discussed in the script are kind of predictable where we are, we don't see a terrific change from kind of what the levels that we have anticipated for March. There's no scrambling for March. But again, remember, the one thing that pandemic has done is has created a situation where the predictability of this stuff is very, very volatile. Bookings are much shorter out than what they've been in the past. So look, we are prepared for a reasonably strong March, but we're not - I mean outside of that, we haven't done anything in a desperate fashion to try to find more lift, no.\nOperator: Our next question is from Duane Pfenningwerth from Evercore. Go ahead.\nRaymondWong: Hey guys. This is actually Ray on for Duane. Appreciate the commentary regarding the current conversations on the additional concessions. As we look for potential recovery on the table driven by the exact scenes, when do you think you could get back to the contractual minimums? And what - or maybe what historical levels should we be looking at as a good idea of what that level could be?\nWadeSteel: Yes. So we talked about in - this is Wade. So in my script, I talked a little bit about some of the concessions, one of them would be potentially waiving some of our contract minimums. The majority of our fleet is currently very close to or at the contractual minimums. There are a couple of contracts that are slightly below us, but the majority of our fleet is at - or will be at the contractual minimums during Q1.\nOperator: Our next question is from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Go ahead.\nSaviSyth: Hey. Good afternoon everyone. One just on the prorate side of the business, can I - how many aircraft do you have flying today with United and Delta each? And just kind of wondering what you're seeing there from a trend perspective. It sounded, if I understood the guidance. It sounds like block coverage will be up in 1Q but revenue down. I'm just curious what's driving that and what you're thinking about that business going out. If you're still thinking that will be a smaller business, I think the last call is that maybe 17% normal at some point. But just curious what your thoughts on that business?\nWadeSteel: Yes. Savi, this is Wade. So yes, so during Q4, we were down about 24% in block hours, and our revenue was down about 47%. And what we said is that we anticipate that our block hours will be up maybe 2% to 3% in Q1, but revenue would be seasonally down. Just with January and February, they are seasonally weaker than what we typically see in Q4, but it will be fairly consistent with Q4, maybe slightly down. The overall fleet in prorate is fairly small compared to our - what we've got going on. We're less than 50 airplanes in our pro-rate model and that's split fairly consistently between each of our major partners, Delta and United. So going forward, we're - we'll be - we'll continue to evaluate opportunities as they come our way and just make sure that we're being very selective in what we have in front of us and make sure we think it will be good and accretive and profitable for us as we go forward.\nRussellChilds: Yes. Savi, this is Chip. Just to add just a little bit to that. As far as modeling that going forward, it's very closely tied to what the yields are with our partners. So obviously, the yields are way, way down on prorate. And even as activity in that side of the business model comes back with more volume, I think you can see what's out there in the industry, the yields got to come back, and that's going to take quite some time.\nSaviSyth: That makes sense. I appreciate that. And just - I think I saw a headline about maybe looking to convert some aircraft to also carry cargo in the passenger compartment, I think you've seen some of the other scheduled service airlines do that last year. Wondering what's - if that is a correct headline and what's behind that move now.\nRussellChilds: Yes. Savi, it's interesting that it even was a headline. Let me - I mean our approach is always that we - our job, particularly in a pandemic, just try to find any business models that we think are going to work, and our take rate is probably about 5%, one in 20. And when we saw this extension or we saw this open up at the beginning of the pandemic, I myself wondered why you'd ever close it. So, this is a great door to open. I will be candid and say there's nothing on the other side of the door right now, but we don't think it's a door that should ever close relative to a passenger fleet. These airplanes should be easy to go back and forth from cargo to passenger. We fundamentally believe that. So I mean, for the record, there are absolutely no current plans in place to do anything with cargo, but understand we have a very large fleet with which we love fleet flexibility to do multiple things with, and that's where we filed a very small extension with the FAA, but it's certainly, in our view, is something that we do every single day, trying to make sure that we're providing flexibility within this big fleet that we have. But there are no current plans for us to jump into that anytime soon.\nOperator: Our next question is from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.\nCatherineO'Brien: Thank you. A quick question on the CRJ200s that came out of the Delta agreement. I saw in the release, you noted that you're Delta CRJ200 prorate agreement hadn't ended. Are you planning to hold on to some of those aircraft potentially to fly in that program? Or what else is the plan? I mean I know that they're fully depreciated, no financing. So are there any costs that hold those just in these opportunities come down the line?\nWadeSteel: Yes. So Catherine, this is Wade. So as we said, we have 55 airplanes under our Delta agreement. 19 of those were actually owned by Delta, and we returned those - or we have returned those to Delta. So there are 36 remaining airplanes. Those are not flying in prorate right now. There's no current thought to fly those in prorate right now. They're in temporary storage. As I said in my script, if demand and yields come back as we think, we do have some flexibility to bring some airplanes back up, up into service. But currently, there are no current plans for those airplanes.\nCatherineO'Brien: Okay. And so as a long term for now, just in case, got it. And then on one of your partners on one of their calls this season, they called out cost savings from consolidating regional partners. I guess two questions on that for you. First, based on your current conversations, are you optimistic that you could gain some share as demand rebounds with your partners, hopefully, later this year? And then second, on the cost savings they referenced. We should just be assuming that's less operational complexity for them. And it wasn't meant to imply that if SkyWest, for example, was to win some share, there's some kind of discount given to get that share, right?\nRussellChilds: Yes. This is Chip. I mean, I think philosophically, for us, there certainly is a fair amount of rumors about industry consolidation, all over the place through the industry, both mainline, regional, all that other kind of stuff. And to our focus, we are very much - there are certain elements that we can provide for our major partners at any given time. Today, there's a tremendous amount of value we can provide with opportunities with our partners. We have a very strong balance sheet. We can provide a lot of capital if there's any type of way in which they want to consolidate. We are not interested, as we've said on previous calls in acquiring an airline, but we can certainly utilize our balance sheet to provide value and cost savings to our partners. And like I said earlier, I mean, we're having a lot of conversations with them on that. I think a lot of those conversations are still - we're waiting to let the recovery plan play out. But to the extent of what we can control, the value that we provide for partners is the best professionals in the industry, strong balance sheet and the best performance in the industry as well. So along all those lines, I think they're always evaluating value from that perspective, and that's what our job is to do to help enhance these partnerships and relationships and help get them out of the issues relative to the pandemic that we're all trying to work our way through.\nCatherineO'Brien: Got it. Maybe if I can just sneak a really quick one in here. On the second round of concessions, can you just remind us how those agreements work? Is there any payback of the temporary rate reductions once the concession term is over? Or is that it's extraordinary times, and so you're willing to just forgive some of that rate/minimum hour for a short period.\nWadeSteel: Yes, Cate, we've been proactively working with all of our major partners on concessions, right? We've - our partners, we've got great partners; we've got a lot of flying for all of those guys. The concessions will look a couple of different ways. They could be temporary waivers of minimum utilizations, some temporary rate reductions that probably wouldn't - they're just rate reductions for a period of time, no give back. But we're working with them on a lot of creative solutions. We've got very creative solutions in a lot of different ways in front of our partners. We're working with them, and we'll see how they ultimately end up doing. We hope that we can get most of these done during the first quarter and get these behind us.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMikeLinenberg: Hey. Good afternoon guys. Just a couple here. Back on the partner concessions, Wade, and should be sort of ran through I guess, some of the more qualitative elements of it. And I just - Rob, when you talked about receiving the PSP of $193 million, you sort of then went on to say that, that was before new partner concessions. And I'm not sure if you were implicitly indicating that some portion of that is going to be passed on to your major partners. Is that what you were sort of alluding to? Or am I just reading too much into it?\nRobertSimmons: Yes. Mike thanks for joining today. I think what we - at this point, what we expect is that there will be of the $233 million in funding that we expect to get under PSP 2, $193 million of that will be in the form of a grant, and most of that will run through the P&L in Q1. So - and what Wade said in his script is that at this point, we would expect that there will also be additional partner concessions, a second round of partner concessions that will also, for the most part, run through in Q1.\nMikeLinenberg: Okay. Great. And then just Rob, you mentioned that net debt year-end 2020, I guess, I believe you said it was lower than 2019. I think you said in 2021, your absolute debt will decline. Care to give us a sense of what the net debt will look like at year-end 2021? Will it be less than 2020 or slightly higher?\nRobertSimmons: Look, at this point, it's hard to say with a lot of precision. But I will say that over the next couple of years, we would expect that our absolute level of debt that currently sits at about $3.2 million that over the next couple of years, that will that should continue to come down on an absolute basis. Obviously, what we're looking at right now is part of that, that could be - that's just related to the normal amortization that's built into a lot of our aircraft financings that are fully amortizing financing. So as we mentioned, like every year, for the next several years, we'll have about $400 million in debt principal reduction before any new financing comes in at this point. So again, the answer to the debt question ultimately is going to depend both on a combination of sort of the cadence of that - of the pay down, but also what the opportunities are for us to continue to grow our fleet and potentially bring new aircraft into service. So as we said earlier, we're obviously going to take over the next two years, another 20 delivery of another 20 E175. Those will all be financed with similar long-term fully amortizing mortgage-style debt as we have in the past. So - but again, longer term, over the next maybe two to three years, we do expect, Michael, that, that absolute debt number will continue to come down.\nMikeLinenberg: Great. And then, Rob, if I could just squeeze in one more, I apologize. I just - with respect to the NOLs, I'm just - the losses this last year, where your NOL position may now be? And I know historically, you were not a cash taxpayer. Based on the NOL position, do you have a sense of - as you look out over the next few years, all likelihood that you're probably not going to be paying cash taxes until, I don't know, fill in the line, 2023, 2024? Any guidance there? I'm curious. Because --.\nRobertSimmons: Well, yes, obviously, it's going to be dependent on what that recovery cadence looks like for us and for the industry. And so it's hard to know. But right now, I would say that we're still at least a couple of years out from being a cash taxpayer.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Go ahead.\nJosephDeNardi: Thank you. Good afternoon. Rob, talked about getting to cash flow breakeven by mid-'21, I think, if recovery continues to progress. Can you just kind of quantify what sort of block hour production maybe relative to pre-COVID you think you need to get to in order to get to breakeven? Just trying to get a sense for how you all are kind of looking at the various recovery scenarios and maybe what the baseline is.\nRobertSimmons: Yes. Joe thanks for joining today. Look, I think we're not in a place to be able to start forecasting the second half of the year, either in revenue or block hours or anything else. There's obviously a lot of uncertainty out there. But based on the recovery curve so far, we're pleased that the first half of 2021, looks like it's going to continue to be very, very modest burn. And then just depending on how things play out, that could flip to be positive in the second half or maybe it won't, depending on what the recovery looks like. But at this point, we're really not in a place to sort of forecast out there or do some pro forma modeling. But I think we do feel very good about our liquidity. We feel very good about the strength of our model at this point and the fact that we're burning or expecting to burn just a very modest amount in the - over the next six months.\nJosephDeNardi: Okay. Chip, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you think air travel demand has changed forever. I'm wondering if you could just expound on that. And then what that means for your business model and kind of what you're doing to the business model to adapt to that view?\nRussellChilds: Yes. Thanks, Joe. It's a great question, and it's something that we contemplate every single day. I mean the important part of our business model is to evolve quicker than anybody else. And I think we've seen some strong evolution in the last year, I don't know. Depending upon how the recovery process takes this year, you're probably - we're probably always and fever going to see a high level of mass on airplanes, and we're going to certainly be more cautious and adapt to the potential of a pandemic, which means that we're always going to evaluate our processes that we have in place today. I think the number one thing is the things that are that we see that we're optimistic about is we do like what we appear to have some good strong domestic travel demand and the fact that we have the right fleet and the right professionals in place to help within that recovery process. We also fundamentally do still have some more concern about the effectiveness of the vaccines. And although we're seeing a good trend downward in infection rates, we're always going to be watching that as an industry and being willing to respond. Certainly, each state has their own objectives in containing the virus, and I think we're always going to be more cognizant of the destinations in which we fly and the sensitivities in all of those destinations. But more importantly, I think for all of us that we're fortunate to have the philosophy before the pandemic is this evolution context that you have just got to be able to be flexible and change and be able to adapt to whatever comes your way. And I think that's what's going to forever change our industry. And luckily for us, we've got - like I've said, we've got a great fleet. We've got a great balance sheet, and we have the best professionals in the industry to help us be flexible to no matter what comes our way on into the future. So I think that's our primary take is to expect many variables that may, our way in the future.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve O'Hara here from Sidoti. Go ahead.\nSteveO'Hara: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just talk about the - you talked about the concessions? When you say additional concessions or maybe you didn't say that, but are we talking about concessions on top of what are already in place or are we talking about replacing kind of the concessions that are maybe running out due to the time frame of the agreement originally?\nWadeSteel: Yes, Steve, this is Wade. So we gave concessions to our major partners during Q2 and Q3 of 2020. And the majority of those concessions, they expired at that point in time. And now with, as Rob said, we're getting another $193 million in grant. There is some level of kind of renewed concessions that we're reviewing with our partners right now that would be - like I said in my script, temporary rate reductions, waving contract minimums, those are the kind of things that we're working with them right now on.\nSteveO'Hara: Okay. All right. And then the - I mean just the deferred revenue that you guys have, that is - that is nothing to do with the concessions or that's just partners flying below the minimums and that's more or less okay given the agreements you have with them currently?\nRobertSimmons: Yes. That's nothing to do with any concessions. That just has to do with the structure of our revenue and the part of it that has to do with sort of fixed reimbursements being matched against the variable flying that happens. And so as we said, we expect - we've been deferring revenue each of the last three quarters. The amount of future deferrals and when it sort of flips to start to come back into the P&L will really depend on how much and the timing of the demand recovery for the industry. But right now, we would expect to continue to defer revenue into 2021. And again, with the possibility that it could start to reverse sometime later in 2021.\nSteveO'Hara: Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just lastly, can you just talk about - I mean it seems like leisure is much stronger than business, the outer.\nRobertSimmons: Sorry, we lost you for a second there. Can you go back to the start of your next - your year follow-up?\nSteveO'Hara: Yes, sure. Sorry. So just in terms of your - the passenger demand that you guys are levered to. I mean if we think about major - mainly leisure recovery through maybe at least the first half of the year, maybe you start to get some business traffic back in the latter half of the year. Is that better or worse for SkyWest? Are you guys kind of agnostic? Or does business matter more for you guys? And I know it's not a yield issue, but I mean, I'm just wondering maybe about the utilization for you guys if it was all leisure recovery versus all business or somewhere in between?\nRussellChilds: Yes. Steve, this is Chip. So to your question relative to the - what I'd say, the type of demand as it comes back, if it's good for us or not. At this point, for us, any kind of volume is good volume given the nature of our flying. And - but that doesn't mean we're agnostic. We - trust me, we care a lot about the kind of demand and we love the demand that helps our partners. And if business demand or international demand is better for our partners, it's long term better for us. So the pure tactical Xs and Os math of the beneficial thing to us. It doesn't matter if it's leisure travel or if it's business travel right now. That may come into play with yields on our prorate model later, but that - we see that as being a long way off. But look, we - I think we're fortunate as a regional carrier today to be flying more than almost anybody that's traveling in this space compared to where we were a year ago. And that's very good for us. I think it speaks to our operating credibility and our ability to execute. But overall, the main answer to your question is any type of volume is good for us, but we're also not agnostic. We do want the right kind of demand to help our partners out of this pandemic as well.\nOperator: Our next question again is from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Go ahead.\nSaviSyth: Thanks for the follow up. Just a couple. First, I think there was some confusion when you talked about concessions, but I think it's pretty clear because it's tied to kind of getting that PSP two and what we've done - what you've done in 2Q, 3Q coming up here in 1Q. But I was kind of curious, as contracts come up for renewal that I'm guessing, not a lot have, do you expect those to look different than kind of pre-COVID contracts? Has there been any discussion around that? And tied to that, do you have - I mean you went into this with a strong kind of balance sheet position and having taken a lot of risk off versus kind of the historical model, but anything that changes your view on how the business should be managed going forward outside of just being nimble?\nWadeSteel: Yes. Yes. Savi, this is Wade. So the first part of your question there on - as contracts expire and we have renewals, do we expect the contracts to be different? Our major partners, we're working with them very proactively on things like that right now. I think one thing is they do like us owning airplanes, right? So we're working with them on those kinds of things. And so we do take a lot of that risk off from them, and we put it on our balance sheet. That's one of our big competitive advantages that we have out there. And I think those will continue to go forward in the future, and we can continue to help our partners in that way.\nRussellChilds: Yes. I think, Savi, this is Chip. I think there's no question as we move forward post-pandemic that the contracts will be different. It doesn't mean that they're going to be better or worse. We like different. We like to evolve. We like to find ways to add value with our partners. And particularly in times like this, SkyWest has never been in a position like we are today to add a multiple variable of value to our partners. And that's - it's more than just flying an airplane from point A to point B. There are a lot of things and a lot of creative solutions that we're striving to provide for our partners. So the contracts will likely look different. But in our view, that's a good thing for everybody. This is just a model that we need to continue to work on long-term that can survive a lot of different things. And still take care of these amazing employees of ours as well as our shareholders. So yes, they'll probably look slightly different as they expire and get renewed, but that's not necessarily a bad thing for any of us.\nSaviSyth: That's helpful. And then just a clarification, Rob, on the cash burn outlook that you provided for the first half. Does the 1Q outlook include PSP 2? Or you kind of exclude it because you're not sure about like how the concessions will play out?\nRobertSimmons: No. Look, our outlook for the cash burn is all in. It doesn't leave anything out. So yes, it would include both the concessions as well as the funding from the government.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chip Childs for closing remarks.\nRussell Childs: Thank you, Kate. Appreciate it. Look, I want to thank everyone for joining us again on the call today. We really appreciate your interest in SkyWest. I especially want to again thank our people. I'm so proud of our airline and our teams and the great work we're all doing to support each other and the long-term success of SkyWest, and we appreciate it, and we will talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 3, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-10-29 20:34:07", "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the SkyWest Inc. Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Simmons, Chief Financial Officer. Go ahead.\nRob Simmons: Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As the Operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; and Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer. I'd like to start today by asking Eric to read the Safe Harbor, then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results. Then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2019 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you again for joining us on the call today. I want to begin by saying how proud I am with the way our teams have pulled together to confront this incredibly challenging and unpredictable environment. Eight months into the pandemic, our industry has dramatically changed. Our teams are working nonstop to stay focused on the health and safety of both our people and our passengers, and we remain flexible in responding quickly to deliver on our partners' network and schedule changes. We have successfully resumed continued qualification training with pre-attendance COVID testing, as well as stringent requirements for social distancing, cleaning, and face coverings. We continue working to stay ahead of the latest CDC guidance, and our teams are successfully achieving things we couldn't have imagined a year ago. I want to thank them again for their outstanding work. Early on in this pandemic, we said keep priorities to ensure we were able to successfully emerge from the crisis and play a key role in the recovery. Our first priority was the personal health and wellbeing of our people and passengers. Second priority was maintaining strong cash and liquidity, and the third priority is remaining strong and agile as we work with our partners. We remain focused on these three priorities and on ensuring we're able to evolve with the changing industry landscape. Some of that evolution was announced earlier this week when we shared changes in our senior leadership. Greg Wooley was named Executive Vice President of Operations, stepping into his role with a tremendous background leading almost every aspect of regional airline operations over his 25-year career, and most recently overseeing our ground handling operation. He has wholeheartedly embraced the SkyWest culture and commitment to excellence, and I'm confident he is the right person for this position particularly in this uniquely challenging landscape. We have also transitioned some of our other leaders into senior vice president roles and streamlined our overall management and administrative staff. These changes better reflect our current operation and will provide the focus needed to deliver a stronger-then-ever operating product, and will also help ensure we remain agile in responding to our partners. We are focused on the long game, and we're lucky to have the best leadership team in the business. I believe this team will be the difference between SkyWest and our competition in the coming months as we prepare for recovery. Today, we announced an agreement with American for 20 used CRJ700s to enter service throughout next year. These are in addition to the 70 CRJ700s already under agreement with American. We are maintaining a strong delivery schedule, and are working with each of our partners on their fleet and network needs. Our dual-class fleet is playing a strong role in the recovery, and our ability to deliver for our partners will remain a key differentiator for us. We continue to invest in our fleet and maintenance programs as part of our long-term strategy to build reliability into our fleet and creating flying opportunities, just like this one we just announced. During the third quarter we reported net income of $34 million. This includes the $190 million in payroll support program funding under CARES Act that we recognized as income during the quarter. Without a new extension this nearly marks the completion of our CARES payroll support grant funding. Rob will talk more about liquidity in a minute. We are working closely with our people to take steps to manage costs in this environment, and we are fortunate to have very positive relationships with all of our employee workgroups. They work productively with us to minimize the negative impacts to our people as much as possible, while ensuring that we remain flexible and ready to provide critical support to our partners. This positive relationship with our labor groups will help ensure our long-term viability and success. Our third quarter production was an improvement over the second quarter, but what is usually our peak quarter was about 60% of what we flew a year ago, with about 1,600 daily departures. As of today, we are expecting a slight uptick in production in the fourth quarter. However we are prepared to respond if the climate deteriorates. Our ongoing agility will remain a key component of our recovery strategy, and while we're clearly focused on working with our partners, our contracting sessions are mostly complete. We are working closely and collaboratively with each of our partners to ensure we're the best positioned to meet their needs. This COVID environment shines a spotlight on the importance of how we've been de-risking our business model over the past five years. While no one in our industry is immune to the economic effects of the COVID crisis, we feel good about how we are positioned to weather this storm. Undoubtedly, the next several months will be turbulent, but we're pleased with the shape of the recovery so far. As demand returns, we are confident that our fleet will continue to fuel a critical role in the return to travel. We are focused on navigating this crisis aggressively and deliberately to take care of our people, our customers as we preserve our liquidity, and plan for recovery to ensure we emerge as a better, stronger business. Rob will now take us through the financial information.\nRob Simmons: Today, we reported third quarter net income of $34 million or $0.66 per share. Our diluted share count for Q3 was 50.6 million, and our effective tax rate in Q3 was 27%. These GAAP results include the effect of a deferral of $30 million of revenue this quarter, down from $69 million deferred in Q2. As discussed last quarter, the timing and amount of future deferrals and the reversal thereof into revenue depends on the shape and cadence of the recovery of our flying. All deferred revenue will be reversed into revenue by the end of the various contract periods. We currently expect to continue to defer some revenue into late 2021 or 2022 when it may begin to reverse. First, let's talk about revenue. Total revenue is down 40% from Q3 2019, but it's up 31% from last quarter. This breaks down with contract revenue down 35% from Q3 2019, and up 28% from Q2. Pro-rate revenue is still down 58% year-over-year, but was up 69% from last quarter. As we have previously said, pro-rate revenue is nicely levered to a recovery as you can see in these numbers. Let me move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $822 million, up from $762 million last quarter. Our CapEx during the third quarter was $10 million comprised of aircraft engines and parts. At this point, our expectation is to pull back our CapEx for the year from $636 million last year to approximately $430 million this year, including the acquisition of four new E175s, and 21 CRJ700s in a 50-seat configuration coming up in Q4. We ended the quarter with debt of $3.1 billion, up slightly from $3.0 billion as of year-end. The increase in debt from year-end through the end of September is driven primarily by the CARES Act funding from the government including $60 million of five-year CARES Act secured debt, and $105 million of 10-year unsecured low-cost PSP debt. We expect to make a gross pay-down of $400 million in aircraft debt financing next year before the financing of new aircraft acquired next year or other draws on our CARES Act facility. Let's talk about liquidity. As of September 30th, our cash position was $822 million in addition to availability of $513 million undrawn in our CARES Act loan, and $40 million on our revolving line of credit. During Q3, we received $144 million in Payroll Support Program funding under the CARES Act, of which $101 million is a grant, and $43 million is a low interest loan. This number includes a $12 million top-up from treasury near the end of the quarter. At the end of Q3, we closed on our CARES Act secured loan in the amount of $573 million. In October, the US Treasury increased that amount by $152 million to $725 million. Coincident with the initial closing of the secured debt facility, we drew the required minimum of $60 million, leaving undrawn availability of $665 million as of today. This debt is secured by aircraft engines and spare parts. We have until March 2021 to decide how much in additional draws we will make under the secured loan facility, if any. During Q3, $190 million in PSP grants was recognized as income in the form of a contra-expense laid out clearly as its own line item in our P&L. $3 million remains to be recognized in the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we estimated that we would burn cash through the end of the year at a rate of about $500,000 per day. Based on September ending cash of $822 million, estimated year-end cash of $800 million, we are now estimating cash burn on average through the end of the year to be approximately $250,000 per day. This year-end cash forecast does not assume any incremental Q4 draws against either our CARES Act secured loan facility or our revolver. If the economic effects turn out to be worse and the recovery slower than we currently expect, we have additional liquidity tools we can call on, including that revolver and the $665 million in undrawn availability under our secured CARES Act loan facility. In addition to our core liquidity position, I'm going to remind you of a couple things that are nice to have during this time of uncertainty and give us more flexibility than others in our space. First, approximately a third of our fleet has no financing remaining on it. This number goes to 45% when you include partner owned aircraft that we operate, and second, we have minimal tail risk of around $100 million, the dollar delta between financing term and contract term. Our next pocket of tail risk is now out to 2023 and zero on the Delta 200s expiring by year-end. Especially in times of great uncertainty like this, and consistent with our policy and practice, we're not in a position to give any specific EPS guidance at this time. I will say that we expect to report GAAP losses over at least the next two to three quarters driven by the following and other factors including the recovery curve. Let me start with some headwinds. Number one, pro-rate revenue is still weak down 58% or $85 million from Q3 of last year. Number two, maintenance expense is up $29 million from Q2 or 24% consistent with a 31% increase in revenue and will likely be higher in Q4 coinciding with anticipated Q4 production increases and then will likely plateau in 2021. Number three, deferred revenue was $69 million in Q2, $30 million in Q3, and it's expected to still reduce recognize revenue for the next few quarters until it starts to reverse based on production levels. Number four, PSP income from grants received has been recorded as contra expense with $190 million in Q3, going down to $3 million in Q4 absent a new PSP out of the government. Number five, the next two quarters Q4 and Q1 are seasonally the weakest of the year, and now some tailwinds. Number one production should continue to trend slightly higher. Number two, partner concessions from Q2 and Q3 have mostly ended. Number three, the discrete increase to our credit loss reserve in Q3 is not expected to recur. Number four, depreciation is trending down and number five deferred revenue is trending lower and may begin reversing in late 2021 or 2022 depending on the timing of the recovery. Obviously, there are many moving parts impacting the earnings calculus as we continue to operate in this COVID environment. To boil down the net impact of the anticipated headwinds and tailwinds going into Q4, we're hopeful that we can offset in Q4, almost half of the $190 million PSP income that will essentially go away in Q4, driven by higher expected production and the offsets just enumerated. Assuming no meaningful improvement to our schedules by Q1, 2021, we anticipate Q1 2021 results may look fairly similar to Q4 2020. The modest cash burn of $250,000 per day we're currently expecting in Q4 should turn neutral or positive mid-next year. We're excited that the actions we're taking now and expect to take over the next few quarters are setting us up nicely for the new normal in the future. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I'll provide a fleet and production status update as well as an update on our pro-rate and leasing businesses. To update by partner, today we announced an agreement to place 20 used CRJ700s under a multiyear flying contract with American. These aircraft will be sourced from our current fleet of aircraft that have been in long-term storage for the last couple of years. As of today, we have 61 CRJ700s under contract with American. As a reminder, we still have nine more CRJ700s that will be placed into service under previously announced agreement. By the end of 2021, we are scheduled to have 90 CRJ700s under contract with American. Of the 29 undelivered CRJ700s four CRJ700s are anticipated to go into service during Q4 2020, and the other 25 ratably through 2021. As we shared last quarter, we worked with American to modify the timing of our 20 E175 deliveries. We now expect to receive a handful of these aircraft during the fourth quarter of 2021, and the rest through the middle of 2022. Let me talk briefly about our Delta agreement. We currently have four new E175 on order under our Delta agreement, which are scheduled for delivery during the fourth quarter, we plan to take delivery of our final Delta finance CRJ900 during the first half of next year. You may recall that we have 55 CRJ200s scheduled to expire under our Delta agreement by the end of this year. We have returned the 19 Delta-owned aircraft to Delta. The remaining 36 aircraft are SkyWest owned with no remaining financing obligations and will be fully depreciated by the end of the year. All of our current partner contract concessions expired in either September or October. The largest concession during the quarter was deferring payment due from our partners related to certain aircraft ownership costs of approximately $90 million. For GAAP purposes, we still recognize the revenue associated with the deferred payment related to aircraft ownership during the third quarter. We expect the deferred ownership amount to be paid back over the remaining CPA contract term. Let me review our current production. During the third quarter our completed block ours were down by approximately 40%, compared to the same quarter last year. Based on the current schedules we have from our major partners for the fourth quarter, we anticipate that our block hours will be down by approximately 30% to 35% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The E175 fleet continues to fill an important need for major partners. While the majority of the reduction in block hours have been on the CRJ200 fleet. We anticipate that our Q4 E175 block hours will be down by approximately 10% as compared to Q4 last year. While our Q4 CRJ200 block hours will be down by approximately 50%. As of December 31, 2019, we had 156 E175s under contract with our major partners. By the middle of 2020, we expect to have 213 E175s under contract with our partners. Let me talk a bit about our pro-rate business. During the third quarter, we reduced our pro-rate block hours by approximately 38% and revenue decreased by 58% or approximately $85 million. We anticipate our pro-rate block ours to be reduced by approximately 25% during the fourth quarter, compared to last year. We currently expect that 20% of our block hours will be removed for the foreseeable future. We expect our pro-rate revenue will be approximately $75 million less during the fourth quarter 2020, compared to last year. Our pro-rate business model is nicely levered to the recovery, while pro-rate revenue down 58% incremental revenue coming back to the pro-rate with business will have attractive margin characteristics. Specific to our CRJ200 fleet, we had over 200 of them flying in our system prior to the onset of COVID in the United States. With the reductions at Delta and to our pro-rate fleet, we estimate reducing our CRJ200 fleet by approximately 70 aircraft by year-end. As I said earlier, we have returned 19 CRJ200s to Delta. We're also in the process of returning 10 aircraft to a third party less or we currently anticipate having 40 excess CRJ200s by the end of this year, and expect to sell or part out several of these aircraft. We will also evaluate additional flying opportunities if the flying demand begins to recover. Let me shift gears to our leasing business. Today, we announced an agreement to acquire 21 used CRJ700 in a 50 seat configuration and lease the aircraft under in multi-year term to another regional operator. The aircraft purchases and leases are expected to be completed in Q4 of this year. We are fortunate to be in a unique position to purchase these aircraft. We believe the CRJ700 is an exceptional asset that will continue to set SkyWest apart with very strong demand from our major partners. After the completion of this transaction, we will have 34 CRJ700s under lease to a third party. We are starting to see demand return for our engine leasing business. During the quarter, we signed 12 [eight-seat] [ph] engines under short-term lease agreements. Between the 20 aircraft we signed up with American, the 34 aircraft under lease with the third party, and the 12 engine leases, the vast majority of our eight-seat fleet, our eight-seat engines will be in productive, revenue-producing agreements by the end of next year. Let me talk briefly about our current and forecasted maintenance expense over the next year. Maintenance expense is up $29 million from Q2, or 24%, and will likely be higher in Q4 and next year. The increase is primarily due to anticipated recovery of our flying and bringing the 20 aircraft for the American agreement out of long-term storage. We have spent the last several years reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility to ensure we're positioned to navigate this challenging environment. We are committed to continuing our work with each of our major partners to provide creative solutions through this difficult time in our industry.\nRob Simmons: Okay, operator, we're ready for Q&A now.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everybody, and this is a question for Wade, I think. Your CRJ700s have had so many dance partners, and you've been [buying some aircrafts] [ph] as well. I was wondering if you could help me out by kind of detailing how many you have with each partner today, and how many are sitting without partners because you talked about some in storage, and then what you expect that to be by year-end '21?\nWade Steel: Yes, Savi, this is Wade. So our CRJ700 fleet, I'll first talk about American. So American, we have 61 today. We have nine more that are going to be delivered, and then the 20 we just announced will also be delivered. All of those, so we'll have 90 under contract with American, all of those will be in service by the end of 2021. We have 19 under contract with United, and those are under long-term agreements, and then we also have five with Delta that are under long-term agreements, and so after these 20 go in with American we will have no additional CRJ700s -- any excess CRJ700s. All of our CRJ700s will be under CPA contracts.\nSavi Syth: Okay, that's helpful, and then just the United partner you're subleasing to, is that different than the partner before, because I just want to make sure that -- to get comfortable that this isn't like the 29 aircraft that you had and then you only placed 13?\nWade Steel: So it is -- they're different airplanes. We did buy those, but it's to the same United Express regional partner.\nSavi Syth: So you're comfortable that they can take it this time?\nWade Steel: These aircraft are already flying there, and have already been converted, and in the 550 configuration, and they're already operating in their system today.\nSavi Syth: Okay, that makes sense. I'll hop back on the queue. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Good afternoon. Rob or Wade, can you just maybe frame for us, if we assume 20% reduction in block hours and as many of the 200s coming out, as you talked about, can you just frame for us what sort of CPA revenue that that environment would produce?\nWade Steel: So, this is Wade. So the 20 -- so the Delta contract, it has 55 airplanes that are coming out. Delta owned 19 of those, and we were just leasing those for a nominal amount, and so the revenue associated with those are very minimal. Those airplanes have not had a lot of utilization on them over the past couple of quarters, Q2 and Q3. So there is an impact. There's not a -- it's not a major impact to contract revenue, and as we've talked about, with these CRJ200s, there's no book exposure. Well, these will all be completed depreciated by the end of the year. There's no financing obligations on any of these aircraft as well.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, and then, Rob, can you just walk through some of the structural initiatives that you've taken to, I guess, adapt the cost structure to a lower block hour environment going forward?\nRob Simmons: Yes. Well, first of all, thanks, Joe, for your questions. I think that as we look at this environment, obviously we are trying to position ourselves with as much liquidity as possible and flexibility so that we can meet the needs of our partners going forward. As we mentioned in the script, we have started taking some actions, but again, we don't have any intention to go deeper than we said in the script at this time, and so, I think that everyone in this environment is looking for opportunities to be more efficient, and I think you heard us enumerate a lot of those actions that we've been taking to get more efficient.\nJoseph DeNardi: And just so I understand the commentary around the 20% reduction in block hours. Is there where you think you'll be once the additional American aircraft come in, like net of the Delta aircraft that are going out or you just see a 20% reduction in kind of overall demand for your service?\nChip Childs: Joe, this is Chip. Just real quick, I think that there's a lot of moving pieces that it's difficult to speculate on because a lot of what we're talking with aircraft coming in come in throughout the rest of 2021, and when we talk about 20% reduction, it's what we know today relative to the 200s and the things that we know today. The big outlier for us, when we get to the end of 2021, is what did this virus do? We are clearly looking at the next four months of November, December, January, and February, and are extremely cautious because it's winter. We don't have a vaccine yet. We're taking a look at the infection rates these days, but there's still the number one thing that we feel is important is to stand ready for the things that may happen in March and the summer months. So from that perspective there's a delicate balance between making sure that we have an absolute lean cost structure for what we know today, but again, most importantly, make sure that we stand ready for what may happen in March, in the summer months to be ready to resume what could be some impressive demand, particularly with the smaller sized aircraft we have and where we fly. So, again, I think that hopefully gives you some color, but there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty still that we're trying to understand, starting in March of '21 through the end of '21.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you for the time. So a couple here, just based on your expectation that you'll deferring some level of revenue to the end of next year or maybe even early 2022, should we assume that means it will take into those periods, get back into pre-COVID levels of block hour production, and then can you just remind us what the bar is for you to stop being required to defer revenue? Is it block hours recovering to 100% of pre-COVID levels or can you start booking some back before then, and then last one on this topic, before I have another follow-up is, is some of this tied to concessions? I wasn't sure if Wade alluded to that in his remarks. I might have been misunderstanding. I know there's a couple there, so thank you for the time.\nRob Simmons: Hi, Katy, thanks. This is Rob. I -- look, and let me talk about deferred revenue conceptually. First of all, one thing to remember is 100% of the revenue that's differed -- that was deferred last quarter that has been deferred this quarter, and will be deferred possibly over the next several quarters. All of that will be reversed into revenue by the time that each of those individual contracts expire. So under no circumstances will we not recapture that. We've received the cash. There's ongoing performance obligation under those. So we will -- that all of that deferred revenue will reverse. Now, the timing of when [technical difficulty] starts to reverse again is hard to guess at this point. It is going to depend on getting back to something -- some semblance of \"Normal,\" whatever that means in this environment, but look, our best guess right now is that as you saw, deferred revenue came down pretty significantly from Q2 to Q3. We think that there will be some modest deferred revenue deferred over -- for at least several more quarters, and then, again, potentially start to reverse depending on what this recovery turns out to look like, but then in no circumstances will that revenue not be fully recognized by the time that each of the individual contract periods ends.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, got it. So just -- so there is a little bit of an assumption that through next year you don't completely recover to pre-COVID block hour production, is that right?\nRob Simmons: Yes, that's right.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, got it, understood, perfectly clear, thanks, and then given that your major -- just on the deals you announced today. Given that your major partners are, for the most part, taking actions to shrink their fleet. Can you just help us think through like what the new American and United fields you announced are stemming from? Are partners seeing a need for a net increase in regional list over the next couple of years or are you winning share by locking these deals? Thanks.\nChip Childs: Yes, thanks. This is Chip. Again, I think that -- I mean so some of your questions are probably better suited to our partners, to be candid, and it's probably better for them to answer. A couple of things that we do look at, there's certainly our some limitations given everybody's reduced schedules relative to -- and they had some impact on the regional -- their regional fleets, respectively. Our job is not to get too tied up into that stuff, because that's more of their business, and as we continue to press forward with this we feel like we've got good economics on a good product that helps in recoveries. We've been in the industry for a long time. We've seen things like the financial crisis, and 9/11, and certainly with what we're facing today is somewhat similar, where smaller aircraft have a good niche presence to not only maintain market share but make sure you're delivering the type of service to their entire market, and it gives them good flexibility. That having been said though, our job is to mostly work really, really closely with them, communicate frequently, and stand, as we've said several times, agile for the long game, and make sure that we're their partner of choice not only when times are good but also when times can be difficult, like we're in today, and that's our focus.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it, understood. I was just impressed to see new aircraft coming on in the middle of everything going on right now. If I could maybe just sneak one quick into Rob, appreciate the time. How are you guys thinking about what level you will draw under your CARES Act secured loan? Is that just depending on where demand goes, and then are you trying to minimize the amount drawn through that loan by potentially looking to other capital sources or you're happy with the terms, and that will be your first choice if there was a need for additional liquidity? Thank you very much.\nRob Simmons: Yes, thanks, Katy. So, look, I think that, number one, we're grateful to the work that treasury and the government has gone through to make that available to us. Again, we drew the minimal amount required under that facility, and again, we have $665 million outstanding that right now is a very inexpensive liquidity option for us. So we're going to wait and see, I mean we've got until late March of 2021 to make a final decision on what, if any, we might want to draw on that facility, and I think it's pretty likely that we'll just wait till then and see what the recovery looks like, see what the situation is, and then make that call. Obviously this is impacted by whether or not there's another round of PSP and a number of things, but for now, we think of it as an inexpensive liquidity option and we're grateful to have it.\nCatherine O'Brien: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Just a follow-up on Cathy's line of questioning there, so I think in the fourth quarter here, the plan for American is to be down call it 50% in capacity, all else equal, and so, can you just speak to who you're replacing because that would be the most obvious explanation? Is it a Compass that's no longer flying? Is it one of their wholly owns that they're having concerns about? Like why would they be adding shelves with you?\nWade Steel: Yes, Duane, this is Wade. First of all, just say American, we've been working on this agreement with them for the past couple of months. This is something that's uniquely came up, they have some unique scope as you know, they have a small RJ, and a large RJ scope, the small RJ scope has 65 seats. The CRJ700 is very much a very good aircraft to fill that scope. We were able to fill it very economically for them. I'm not in a position to comment on who it's replacing, or what it is doing. I would ask you to follow-up with them on that, but we have an airplane that very, very uniquely fits their scope, and they seem to like it.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, that's fair, I don't mean to certainly put you on the spot, I guess you can speak to the regional industry and a number of these smaller players that have fallen by the wayside. Can you speak to the number of RJs that have kind of permanently left the industry at this point, since the pandemic started?\nChip Childs: This is Chip, Duane. Not really, I think that there's a lot of information out there that we're candidly not privy to, and to be candid, we really don't care. What we're mostly focused on is what we can provide to our partners, and we don't necessarily try to target certain things within the industry. We're just delighted we're in a position, and as Wade said in his script, we've worked on our position for the last five years to reduce risk, to have the capital and have the outstanding professionals at our company that we have that enable us to be agile and aggressive with capital, and I think that, from my perspective and for all of our strategies perspective is, it's about working with partners, not working against competitors, and that's the key to our strategy, and that will be the key for a very, very long time.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, appreciate that, and then maybe just lastly in terms of, kind of guaranteed minimums in the existing contracts, can you speak to kind of maybe in the fourth quarter or the third quarter, and obviously, the third quarter is a little noisy with the PSP, but how much below your guarantees are you operating, and is that essentially what this deferred revenue is to kind of make you whole for that investment at some point in the future, and appreciate guys taking the questions.\nWade Steel: Yes, this is Wade. So, as far as the contract minimums, every contract is a little bit unique. There some of and each of our partners are flying each aircraft a little bit separately, little bit differently. I will tell you, there are some of our contracts that are at the contract minimum, some of them are slightly below it, and so, it's kind of a variety of where we will be in the fourth quarter, and as far as the deferred revenue, the deferred revenue is a little bit different than the contract minimum. It's really deferring the fixed rate portion of our contract to match the block hour, the completed block hours over the remaining contract term. So it's a little bit different.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, appreciate the thoughts.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.\nMike Linenberg: Yes, hey, good afternoon. Hey, Rob, on the 21 airplanes that were acquired the 700s, is that a third quarter acquisition or fourth quarter acquisition, and can you just give us the rough CapEx hit?\nRob Simmons: Yes, sure. So in the fourth quarter, we expect CapEx to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $250 million that's just the math of what was in my script. So the 21 new airplanes represent a little over $100 million of that, and then, we've got the four E175s coming in the fourth quarter, that's roughly $100 million dollars of CapEx and then just some other roadable unusual spare parts.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, that's helpful, and then just, Wade, I know, you said you had said you have 156 E175 now, and then I know, I heard middle of 2020, you're going to have 213 that's obviously not right. What was it the middle of what year are you going to have 213 E175s?\nRob Simmons: So the 156 number was at the end of 2019.\nMike Linenberg: Oh, okay.\nRob Simmons: And then the 213 is the middle of 2022.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. That's actually very helpful. Rob, the deferred revenue with your partners, is that with all four major partners, that you're actually deferring the revenue? Is that with the math and block hours?\nRob Simmons: Yes, it's again, as Wade said, it applies to all four of our partners, and it applies to the fixed rate component of those CPAs, that, under 606 needs to be accounted for, sort of consistent with the variable the block hour production component of that.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, that makes sense, and then just one last one here, you know, on your parade flying, you did indicate that 20% of that is a guest going away permanently, and yet, when I think about the world of demand for air travel today versus previously, and your gauge and what you have available, it would almost seem that there would maybe be more pro-rate opportunities for you as margins have been resized, smaller, not larger. So I'm just -- is it the planes are so old, and you just want to put them out to pasture or maybe you have a full plate, but I would think that there would be more opportunities for markets where the big guys would just back away from because they don't make sense today, because the volumes aren't there. Is my thinking wrong on that or what?\nWade Steel: So Michael, this is Wade. Yes, so as we said in the script, we probably have close to excess of 40 CRJ200s, and we're going to be a little bit patient with those airplanes right now.\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nWade Steel: Okay. We obviously can utilize engines, we can utilize some of the parts, what we will do is we will monitor the demand and the recovery very closely, and as we see things coming back, and we work with our major partners on the demand and things they want to do themselves versus what we want to do. You know, we will do that, and just as a reminder, those airplanes are the financing obligations are completely done, and they are fully depreciated. So there is not a lot of financial risk, and so we can be patient with this model a little bit, and we will monitor it. The 20% number that I gave is just what we are seeing right now, and so we'll continue to monitor that very, very closely.\nMike Linenberg: Yes, and Wade, I would just add to throw in as a last point, I do believe that as best as I can tell you may be one of the last viable operators of the CRJ200 in the world, so take advantage of it. Anyway, thanks for answering my questions.\nChip Childs: Michael, this is Chip, one more thing on that. We recognize your last point, and I want to emphasize that's going to continue to be a very strong strategic point for us. We don't anticipate that these airplanes are going to sit idle for very long, but it is the times we live in relative to visibility of demand.\nMike Linenberg: Yes.\nChip Childs: We're really not too worried about deploying them. We think that there is good economics. So to your first question, you're thinking about this perfectly. We just need to the -- whole world needs clarity on this pandemic right now, and we think that comes these will get used.\nMike Linenberg: Great, very good. Okay. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Our next question is from Helane Becker from Cowen. Go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the time, and also thanks for all the information this afternoon. So a couple of questions, first, were there any transition costs in the quarter, and can you just talk a little -- I know this is kind of a boring modeling question, but can you talk about D&A relative to the changes in the fleet?\nRob Simmons: Yes, let me talk about depreciation first, Helane, this is Rob, and thanks for your -- jumping on the call and asking your question today. From a depreciation standpoint, as you have noted, it's been running a little hot the last couple of quarters partially as a result of some of these 200s being expected to come out of service by the end of the year, and so, we wanted to match up the depreciation schedule there. So, year-over-year, you can see the depreciation is up, but sequentially, from Q2, it's down and it will likely continue to trend down for a bit now that we've sort of got some of these 200s behind us.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that's very helpful, and then, the other thing -- I don't know, maybe this is what Mike was asking, you're growing in a market that's declining, and then, as you think about that, over the next few years, are there deals out there that you think you could still pick up that might be attractive, and also, as part of that question, why shouldn't we expect you to be more profitable coming out of the pandemic and the slow-growth period than you were before? It just seems like with -- E175s and the larger 70-seaters being a bigger part of your portfolio, you would be in a position in fact to see your growth and your revenue growth accelerate when things turned around. No?\nChip Childs: Helane, how are you? Thanks so much. This is Chip, and those are two really good questions. Let me go back to the first question that talks about -- we continue to see some opportunities for growth in a market that's declined -- I'd kind of remind you, as of today, the decline is still significantly stronger than what our growth is. We still -- technically, our fleet is still going to be down from what we anticipated it being at the beginning of the year, but from that perspective, again, we have outstanding partners, we have outstanding relationships with them, and we do fundamentally see some opportunities to help them. As far as a deal out there, I can tell you that there is nothing that we see in the near future that would cause us to get overly interested. We want to stay in the lane that we've been in for the last five or so years, and continue to do things organically and strategically through our operating entity and our leasing companies, but from a transactional perspective, we don't see anything out there, and we've looked quite candidly, but it has to -- for us to go back into that role, there has to be an incredibly unique situation. And then, lastly about post-pandemic profitability, I hope your question certainly comes true, there's a lot of runway between here and there, and a lot of things that have to happen. There's no doubt that we're living in a pandemic and political climate today that it's hard to see what that could mean, but our job is to continue to work on the fundamentals to make that a possibility to the extent that we can control that, but that's still in our view way down the road, and candidly, our partners have some recovery to do in that process that we're going to continue to assist them with, because again, we said it a couple of times today and in scripts that we want to play this for the long game, and we think that if we do some things right today, that long game is very positive, but in comparison to the past, it's still too early to be able to predict that, but it's an outstanding question, thank you.\nHelane Becker: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: A little bit along the line of Mike's question, I'm just kind of curious, I think of kind of regional airline business primarily more focused on business markets just given your high unit cost, and just wondering in this current climate where business demand hasn't really picked up, and I know this is not what you planned, but where do you see that your partners -- are your partners putting kind of SkyWest like in different types of markets, or -- just kind of curious what type of passengers that you are flying today, and does your kind of recovery outlook and maybe even looking at pro-rate and thinking maybe 20% doesn't come back, is that based on kind of a business outlook?\nChip Childs: Yes, Savi, that's a terrific question, this is Chip again. I would say that we do have some geographical shifts within our fleet. So, that's mostly due to some of the consolidation happening, some of the efficiencies that our partners are gaining and some preferential places in which we are trying to schedule flights, they quite candidly are being scheduled completely different than they were a year ago. I would also advise that given the data that we see about travel today, it's probably going to look 180 degrees different probably a year from now when we make our way through the pandemic a little bit better. So, what we're seeing today is not a tremendous amount of market-based shift, more of a schedule-based shift, and certainly volumes are down pretty much everywhere we are flying outside of some of the consolidation I referred to earlier, but to the extent that you see what's in the industry about speculation, about what travel is going to look like down the road, there's some things that could be very compelling to the regional model. We know that there's a lot of movement out of larger cities into smaller cities, off the coast more into the Midwest and those types of things, all those things certainly bode well for us, the commuter aspect of it, the business travel aspect of it, all these things are kind of crossed up right now as you've probably seen from some of the other calls that we are -- we are certainly paying very close attention to all of it, and are generally optimistic about the fleet that we fly, how we can execute, and how we can provide value to our partners, and I think that's probably as close to a solid answer to your question that we're comfortable giving right now.\nSavi Syth: No, that's helpful, appreciate the follow-up.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Yes, I have a quick follow-up. There's obviously a lot of volatility in terms of how much your partners mainline scheduled are able to fly. I'm wondering if you all have more visibility into your schedule over the next several months. So, when we look at scheduled capacity for you all -- is that firmer just because of the contractual nature of that or is that still in as much flux as the mainline flying. Thank you.\nWade Steel: Yes, Joseph, this is Wade. So, we obviously work very closely with our partners on our schedule. Pre-pandemic, we were probably getting visibility to our schedule six, nine months in advance. Now, we're trying to give our partners as much flexibility as they need to match capacity with the demand that they're staying in. So, it's a lot closer in right now. We have very good visibility to obviously our November, and we're starting to get a lot more clarity on December as well. So, that's about where we're at. There's not a lot more clarity from our schedules at this point.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Chip Childs for closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Kate, and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. Again, we really appreciate your interest in SkyWest. Once again, I want to thank our people. I'm so proud of our airline and our teams for the great work they're doing to support each other for the long-term success of SkyWest, and we look forward to talking to you all next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 2, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-08-01 00:10:09", "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the SkyWest Inc. Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Simmons, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nRob Simmons: Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; and Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer. I\u2019d like to start today by asking Eric to read the Safe Harbor, then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results. Then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2019 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I know you\u2019re all well aware that the aviation industry is currently navigating the largest demand downturn in its history, and no airline is immune to its impact. However, despite the obvious challenges facing our industry, I\u2019m proud of our SkyWest people who have responded quickly to take care of each other, our passengers and our airline. We\u2019re still very focused on our key priorities to get us through this to the other side of this pandemic. First, the personal health and well-being of our people and passengers remains our top focus. Second, we\u2019re focused on maintaining the cash and liquidity necessary to work through this crisis. And third, our continued flexibility in working with our partners to meet their needs will remain a key differentiator and ensure we are well positioned for recovery. During Q2, we received $307 million of the $438 million total we expect to receive in payroll support funding under the CARES Act. This relief, combined with our work in the marketplace and aggressive cost management, will help our cash position as we work to navigate this crisis and ensure we\u2019re positioned for a recovery. Rob will talk more about our liquidity in a minute. We continue working closely with our major airline partners as well as the health and industry officials to stay ahead of the latest CDC guidance and ensure the health and well-being of our people and passengers. We have implemented robust cleaning and disinfectant measures onboard aircraft and in all SkyWest facilities, reduced customer touch points and implemented face-covering policies company-wide. We expect many of these changes will remain in place indefinitely, and we appreciate the rapid response and partnership with our people. We are pleased to resume continued qualification training with stringent requirements for social distancing, cleaning and face coverings with success during the quarter. I\u2019m proud of our teams who have demonstrated remarkable grace and professionalism in adapting to this new environment. All of this has been accomplished against a very challenging social backdrop. We have been appalled at the racism and violence at our country in many of our cities, hubs and bases at risk. Humanity and respect begins with each of us individually and collectively. As an organization, we stand with our Black employees against racism, and we remain committed to serving each of our diverse employees and customers. We also continue working closely with our people to take steps to manage costs in this environment. As of today, just over 4,000 employees have elected to take voluntary time off or early retirement. A large portion of our non-operational teams are working on reduced and flexible schedules. We expect it will be quite some time before demand fully returns, and it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll need to streamline and resize our airline, including reducing our management and administrative positions before year-end. However, we continue working with our labor work groups toward creative solutions to avoid crew member furloughs. These are very difficult decisions, and we do not take them lightly. However, taking important cost measures in the near term will ensure our long-term viability and success. During the quarter, overall fleet utilization remained less efficient with block hours at about 1/3 of what we flew a year ago. To provide some perspective on that, we should have \u2013 we would have expected to fly about 2,600 daily departures during the quarter. In May, that number was approximately 800. In June, it increased slightly to 900, and in July, we saw a modest increase to 1,300 daily departures. With the recent resurgence in the virus, we expect that departures will likely flatten or drop off in the fall. As we have previously discussed, we are prepared to respond as necessary if the climate continues to deteriorate. Our continued agility will remain a key component of this recovery. A nice silver lining in this crisis is that it has resulted in an accelerated improvement of our fleet mix. We received 26 E175s during the quarter, most of them which began service at quarter end. At the same time, we removed several 50-seat aircraft from contract during the quarter and expect to remove more from our Delta agreement with their natural expirations at year-end. In June of 2019, our fleet mix was 60% dual-class. In June of this year, it was 66% and will continue to increase. As we\u2019ve shared previously, we have little to no tail risk and the most flexible fleet in the regional space. As we shared last quarter, we provided flexibility and support to our partners through the quarter, including temporary rate reductions and contract minimum waivers. This temporary contract provision will expire in September and October. We continue working closely and collaboratively with each of our partners to ensure we\u2019re best positioned to meet their needs. Undoubtedly, the next several months will be turbulent. But as demand returns, we are confident our fleet will continue to fill a critical role in the return to travel. We are focused on navigating this crisis aggressively and deliberately to take care of our people and our customers as we preserve our liquidity and plan for recovery. We will continue to work together with our people and our partners to ensure we emerge as a better, stronger business. Rob will now take us through the financial data.\nRob Simmons: Today, we reported a second quarter net loss of $26 million or $0.51 per share. Our share count for Q2 was 50.1 million, and our effective tax rate in Q2 was 23%. These GAAP results include the effect of a deferral of $69 million of revenue with no associated deferred expense. Our partners have already paid us in cash for this revenue as part of the fixed rate component of our contracts, and it does not represent an ongoing obligation for us to our partners. But as a result of the unusually large COVID-related disruption in the number of block hours we are flying, some of that fixed rate revenue will be deferred and recognized in the future based on anticipated flight schedules over the life of the various remaining contracts pursuant to the 606 accounting standard. We have never had to defer this fixed rate revenue historically. The cash flow and economics of our contracts are obviously unaffected by this accounting deferral. The timing and amount of future deferrals and the reversal thereof into revenue depends on the shape and timing of the recovery of our flying. All deferred revenue will be reversed into revenue by the end of the various contract periods. Let me move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $762; million, up from $578 million last quarter. Our CapEx during the second quarter was $93 million, including $43 million for two new E175s under our Delta contract, $42 million in spare engines and $8 million for other items. At this point, our expectation is to pull back our CapEx for the year from $636 million last year to $300 million to $400 million this year, including the acquisition of four new E175s by the end of the year. We ended the quarter with debt of $2.97 billion, down slightly from $3 billion as of year-end. Let\u2019s talk about liquidity. Our June 30 cash position was $762 million, in addition to availability of $66 million on our revolving line of credit. During Q2, we received $307 million in payroll support funding under the CARES Act, of which $245 million is a grant and $62 million is a loan. Another $131 million will come in Q3, of which $92 million is a grant and $39 million is a loan. As you see in the math, $101 million of the total $438 million in PSP funding is in the form of a 10-year term loan with a 1% interest rate for the first five years, with the remaining $337 million being a grant. At quarter end, we had unencumbered assets of over $1 billion, primarily in engines and aircraft. This unpledged collateral gives us access to additional liquidity alternatives, which we will evaluate, including $497 million in senior secured term financing under the loan program of the CARES Act. We have signed a non-binding LOI for this loan program through the U.S. Treasury and are currently in the weeds working on documentation and are still considering our level and the timing of our participation. Of the total $337 million we will receive in PSP grant money, $152 million was recognized in Q2 as income in the form of a contra expense laid out clearly as its own line item in our P&L. The remaining $185 million will be recognized in the second half of the year. The $93 million difference between the grant cash received in Q2 of $245 million and the $152 million recognized as income is sitting on the June 30 balance sheet as a current deferred income item, which will reverse in the second half. Last quarter, we estimated that we would burn cash through the end of the year at a rate of about $30 million per month or $1 million per day. Based on June ending cash of $762 million, estimated year-end cash of $700 million and additional PSP debt of $39, we are estimating cash burn on average through the end of the year to be $16 million per month or about $0.5 million per day. This cash and cash burn analysis ignores the effect of any incremental CARES Act loan program money and continues to assume no draw on our revolver. Our current modeling, subject to many uncertainties and with modest recovery in flying and incremental cost rationalization, is assumed by year-end as the cash burn improves in 2021. This demand disruption event shines a spotlight on the importance of how we have been derisking our business model over the last five years. While no one in our industry is immune to the economic effects of the COVID crisis, we continue to feel good about how we are positioned to weather the storm. If the economic effects turn out to be worse and the recovery is slower than we currently expect, we have additional liquidity tools we can call on, including our revolver, our $497 million allocation of secured CARES Act loans and other secured loan alternatives accessed by putting our over $1 billion in unpledged collateral to work. In addition to our core liquidity position, I\u2019m going to remind you of a couple of things that are nice to have during this time of uncertainty and give us more flexibility than others in our space. Number one, 33% of our fleet has no financing remaining on it. This number goes to 45% when you include partner-owned aircraft that we operate. Number two, minimal tail risk of around $100 million. This is the dollar delta between the financing term and contract term. Our next pocket of tail risk is now out to 2023 and is zero on the Delta 200s expiring later this year. Especially in times of great uncertainty like this and consistent with our policy and practice, we are not in a position to give any formal or informal EPS guidance at this time. It goes without saying that this COVID event has been a setback to our plans. But I would highlight that we have the remaining $185 million grant component of the PSP that is expected to be recorded as income in the second half, with most or all of that in Q3. A as I mentioned earlier, the amount and timing of additional deferred revenue and the future reversal thereof into revenue depends on the shape and timing of the recovery of our flying. Wade will now give you some details on fleet initiatives, fleet movements and other commercial opportunities. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I\u2019ll provide a fleet and production status update as well as an update on our prorate and leasing businesses. To update by partner. During the quarter, we took delivery of two new E175s for Delta. We financed these aircraft with long-term debt. We currently have four new E175s on order under our Delta agreement, which are scheduled to deliver during the fourth quarter. We are also scheduled to play six used E175s sourced from another operator into Delta service. All of these aircraft are on property and three are currently in service. The remaining three are scheduled to begin service early next year. We are also scheduled to take delivery of our final Delta-financed CRJ900 during Q4 of this year. You may recall that we have 55 CRJ200 scheduled to expire under our Delta agreement at the end of this year. During the quarter, we came to an agreement to terminate the 19 Delta-owned CRJ200s and have returned these aircraft to Delta. We do not anticipate the remaining 36 aircraft will be renewed. These aircraft are SkyWest-owned with no remaining financing obligations and will be fully depreciated by the end of the year. Under our United partnership, we took delivery of our remaining 25 used E175s, the majority of which began service in June and July. These aircraft are financed by United and were sourced from another United Express operator. As shared last quarter, we worked with American to modify the timing of our 20 new E175 deliveries. We now expect delivery of these aircraft during the fourth quarter of 2021 through the middle of 2022. Our 9 previously announced CRJ700s are now scheduled to be placed into service during Q4 2020 and the first half of 2021. Let me review our current production. During the second quarter, our completed block hours were down by 66% compared to the same quarter last year. Based on the current schedule we have from our major partners for the third quarter, we anticipate that our block hours will be down by approximately 40% to 45% compared to the third quarter of last year. The E175 fleet continues to fill an important need for our major partners. While the majority of the reduction in block hours have been on the CRJ200 fleet, we anticipate that our Q3 E175 block hours will be down approximately 10% as compared to Q3 last year, while our Q3 CRJ200 block hours will be down by approximately 65%. As of December 31, 2019, we had 156 E175s under contract with our major partners. By the middle of 2022, we expect to have 213 E175s under contract with our partners. During the quarter, we finalized our contract concessions with all of our major partners. These included temporarily waiving contract minimums, deferring the start of contracts, temporary rate reductions during Q2 and Q3 and passing through the benefit of deferring certain aircraft ownership charges that were negotiated with our primary creditors. The largest concession during the quarter was deferring payments due from our partners related to certain aircraft ownership costs of approximately $75 million. For GAAP purposes, we still recognize the revenue associated with the deferred payments related to aircraft ownership during the second quarter. We expect that the deferred ownership amounts will be paid back over the remaining CPA contract terms. All of these concessions expire in either September or October. Let me talk about our prorate business. During the second quarter, we reduced our prorate block hours by approximately 54% and the revenue decreased by 73% or approximately $98 million. We anticipate our prorate block hours to be reduced by approximately 30% during the quarter compared to last year. We currently expect 20% of our block hours will be removed for the foreseeable future. We expect our prorate revenue will be approximately $95 million less during the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Specific to our CRJ200 fleet, we had over 200 CRJ200 flying in our system prior to the onset of COVID in the United States. With the anticipated reductions at Delta and our prorate fleet, we estimate reducing our CRJ200 fleet by approximately 70 aircraft by year-end. As discussed previously, we have returned 19 CRJ200s to Delta. We are also in the process of returning 10 CRJ200s to third-party lessors. We currently anticipate having 40 excess CRJ200s by the end of 2020 and expect to sell or part out several of these aircraft. Given the age of our CRJ200 fleet and the number of upcoming removals from service, we have shortened the estimated useful lives of our CRJ200 aircraft for depreciation purposes to align with our anticipated contract removals with each applicable partner. This contributed to an increase of approximately $42 million of incremental depreciation expense during the second quarter. We anticipate we will incur approximately $30 million of additional depreciation expense in the second half of 2020 compared to the second half of 2019. Let me shift gears to our leasing business. We have 13 of 29 CRJ700s under lease to a third-party. However, we do not anticipate delivering the remaining six aircraft to the lessee. We are working with several parties to operate these 16 aircraft at SkyWest. We believe these aircraft will be placed under contract with a major partner during the second half of 2021. During Q4 last year, we had 15 engines under short-term lease agreements and commitment to lease 40 additional engines during 2021. As of today, the majority of these engines have been returned, and we are working with the lessee on the commitment for the 40 engines. In summary, we do not expect the demand to return for our leasing business during 2021. We also agreed to purchase two new CRJ700s from a third-party during the second quarter. We closed on the final two aircraft under this commitment. This crisis is unprecedented in our history, and we are committed to working with each of our major partners to provide creative solutions and respond quickly to their needs. We have spent the last several years reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility, which will ensure we\u2019re positioned to navigate this challenging environment.\nRob Simmons: Okay. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just on the concessions that you granted to the partner, I appreciate the detail you provided. Given the recent weakening, I wonder what your comfort level is that you wouldn\u2019t have to kind of go back and revisit these concessions and extend them beyond kind of how long you\u2019ve provided it for so far.\nChip Childs: Yes. Savi, this is Chip. I would \u2013 in relation to the concessions, we\u2019re certainly not going to get into too many details on the call. But I mean I would reiterate that we\u2019ve spent the last several years creatively finding solutions with our partners where we can add value over the long term. That has worked very well for us. Given some of the things we\u2019re facing this fall, we\u2019re going to continue to utilize that exact same strategy. I would emphasize that we\u2019re in this for the long game. We hope that this pandemic gets over quickly. That would be good for all of us. But relative to some of the things that we need to do with our partners, we need to stand ready to do whatever we need to provide for them given the dynamic environment that we\u2019re in, and we\u2019re going to continue to exercise that philosophy over the fall and into the winter months.\nSavi Syth: Helpful. And then just on the 29 CRJ700s that you were thinking of placing, I think it\u2019s at 13 now. I think last quarter you might have mentioned you had placed 16, so I\u2019m guessing some were returned. And you\u2019ve mentioned that you were looking to place that with another partner. Is that you expecting to place those CRJ700s where you\u2019ll be doing the flying? Or is that another sublease agreement?\nWade Steel: Yes. Savi, this is Wade. Thanks for the question. Yes, so as I said, the 13 \u2013 well, we did have 16 of the 29 delivered. We took three of those back during the quarter. So we have 16 undelivered. We will not \u2013 we do not anticipate delivering those to the lessee. They\u2019re not in a current financial position to take them. And so we are, at SkyWest Airlines, looking to fly those and operate those for another major partner. And we\u2019re working with all of our major partners on potential demand they have for that.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And if I might squeeze just one last question. I know previously, when we weren\u2019t in this current environment and maybe not having this outlook for demand, you wanted to focus on the core business. But I wonder, given the kind of slow demand recovery outlook and the kind of the pilot levels that you have, if you might consider kind of moving into the cargo side of the business.\nChip Childs: That\u2019s a good question. We\u2019ve certainly explored that. But I think as we continue to evaluate some of the things that we can do to meet the demands of our partners, we\u2019re not \u2013 candidly, not that energetic to jump into a high-risk, very low-margin business of that nature. Although we have a lot of airplanes, we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate what\u2019s out there in the market, but that is clearly not one of our key focuses at this time.\nSavi Syth: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the time.\nChip Childs: Hi, Catie.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey guys. So, I have just one more question on this, the third-party leased aircraft. So with some of those coming back and, obviously, the remaining aircraft that, that third-party is not able to take, is there any penalty that got paid to SkyWest for that or financial remuneration for that? Or that was \u2013 you worked it out?\nWade Steel: Yes, Catie, this is Wade. We won\u2019t get into the specifics of those. We were \u2013 we did receive some level of compensation for that. But I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics of the settlement with that lessee.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. That\u2019s definitely fair. And then maybe just on the retirement \u2013 or on the 40 CRJs that you\u2019re retiring or selling at the end of the year, will that accelerate the depreciation over the next couple of quarters? Do you expect that means we won\u2019t see any impairment charges on those? And then \u2013 yes, that\u2019s \u2013 and then one more after that.\nWade Steel: Yes. So on the fleet \u2013 so Catie, this is Wade. So on the 40 aircraft, the majority of those are at Delta right now, as I said in my script, we have accelerated the depreciation on those. Those aircraft will all be fully depreciated by year-end. And so as of right now, we do not anticipate taking any impairment charge on the CRJ200 fleet at this time.\nRob Simmons: Yes, Catie, as we said earlier, if you look at depreciation in Q2, it\u2019s up by a little over $40 million. That reflects some of that accelerated depreciation. In the second half of the year, it\u2019s going to continue to run a little hot compared to a year ago. And we think that will be about $30 million in the second half, above last year\u2019s second half depreciation.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Great. If I could maybe just sneak one more in on costs. So just on future cost-reduction opportunities, it sounds like you\u2019re alluding to potentially having some more efficiencies as we get into year-end. It looks like your ex CARES operating costs were down about 16%. Obviously, I\u2019m sure some of that was that accelerated depreciation putting upward pressure on that, but block hours were down 66%. Do you expect to see the gap close between operating costs year-over-year and block hours year-over-year? Or should we expect a similar relationship between the two into the third quarter and maybe the fourth quarter as well?\nChip Childs: Yes. I think \u2013 Catie, this is Chip. It\u2019s a great question and one that we evaluate more than almost anything today. And there\u2019s just a lot of factors and variables going into that answer, that it\u2019s a little bit too soon to answer that. Given the nature of our business, the size of our aircraft, the volume that we\u2019re flying, the things that we can do, as we are assisting our partners and helping with this recovery, there\u2019s a lot of variation. And schedules, even in the last four months, have changed significantly. So look, again, we\u2019ve got to stand ready to do what our partners want us to do. And from that perspective, I think we do things like we \u2013 like I mentioned in my script, we have a lot of employees taking voluntary time off. We\u2019re going to be very fluid with the communication with our people and our partners. More than anything, relative to cost, we\u2019re going to continue to work on ways to streamline, particularly overheads and those types of costs. But more than anything, it still goes back to a couple of things in our model where we want to be fluid with our partners and be ready to execute what they need in the recovery process. So it\u2019s a little too early at this point to still say exactly what that\u2019s going to do because the importance of us being ready to help our partners is paramount.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Understood. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Helane Becker of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks, operator. Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for the time. So, one question I have is, when you think about taking the second loan from the CARES Act, why \u2013 you\u2019re in a pretty good position. You have significant unencumbered assets. You\u2019re working through all of the issues with your partners. Why take the money? Why not put yourself in a position to kind of win the recovery and continue to be able to pay dividends and buy back stock when things turn around?\nRob Simmons: Yes, Helane, thanks for the question. Look, I think as we pointed out, we do feel very good about our core liquidity situation, and we view some of those, including the $497 million CARES Act loan, as a nice alternative for us. But again, we expect to be at $700 million or so at year-end without that continuing to have an undrawn revolver. So I think, though, in this environment, it\u2019s my job. It\u2019s our job to make sure that we have alternatives just in case that this recovery is slower and longer than anyone might anticipate right now. We\u2019re planning for a number of different scenarios, and so it\u2019s nice to have alternatives. And those alternatives are enabled by the fact that we went into this crisis with a very strong balance sheet that included over $1 billion of unpledged collateral that can become liquidity sources for us if it needs \u2013 if need be.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s very helpful. And then the other question I have is when you talked in your prepared remarks about \u2013 and I\u2019m not sure who actually said this. But you talked about third quarter block hours right now being down 40% to 45% compared to last year. Can you say how much time your partners are noticed \u2013 how much \u2013 I\u2019m going to say this completely wrong. But can you say the \u2013 how much in advance notice are your partners giving you in terms of changing those block hour forecast? And are you able to do so without significant penalty to your own income statement and balance sheet?\nChip Childs: Yes. I would \u2013 Helane, this is Chip. That is a great question. Back in March, it was \u2013 look, I think all of us know what March was like when this was unfolding. It was just one of the most terrific months that the industry had seen, and we adapted pretty well. It was hard on us. It\u2019s extraordinarily hard on us. It\u2019s extraordinarily hard on our people when you have something like March and into April. But through these types of experiences, we evolve and adapt. And today \u2013 there\u2019s very little of it today. There is some, but there\u2019s very little of it today. And with the notices, again, I may keep repeating myself, we just have to be ready to be prepared to help facilitate what our partners need in this recovery. And so you can see it\u2019s almost like all of us are becoming virologist or whatever to try to figure out what\u2019s happening with the infection rates and with travel and specifically throughout the country, all of these things are probably more dynamic than any of us have ever seen in the industry before. But that having been said, we\u2019re evolving toward that and see this as an opportunity. And if we can adapt quickly, then we\u2019re going to have a long-term competitive advantage because the level of uncertainty and variability within the schedules, we\u2019ve learned to accept. We want as much advanced notice as possible. And for another data point, in August, we\u2019re flying 1,700 block hour flights a day. And from that perspective, there\u2019s a wide range of things that we can do. So we, again, need to be ready to respond to what our partners need as the recovery happens and when it happens. So look, evolution is a good thing, and I think we\u2019re doing a good job of that even relative to flight schedules and geography, what we need to pay attention to going forward for our partners.\nHelane Becker: Thank you. That is very, very helpful. Thank you for your insight. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Rob, I just \u2013 in the way the numbers are portrayed, you made the decision, I guess, not to call out any special items or, call it, adjustments, whether it was the CARES Act, receipt of that money as the contract expense, I guess, the D&A upsizing the revenue deferral. In order to sort of look at you guys on an apples-to-apples basis with others, there are probably some adjustments that we would make. Are those the three main sort of, call it, special items, if you will? Or am I \u2013 are there others that I\u2019m missing?\nRob Simmons: No. Look, Mike, there were a number of sort of unusual items. And so we \u2013 it was a pretty easy decision to just present the GAAP numbers but then make sure we provided lots of visibility into what those other ones were. Obviously, we\u2019ve got a deferred revenue component that is new this quarter. We\u2019ve got a part of the PSP grant that was \u2013 where the cash was received, but the recognition will be deferred. We\u2019ve got depreciation running unusually high just because of some of the changes we\u2019ve made and the useful life assumptions on some of the \u2013 particularly the 200s. And we\u2019ve got maintenance expense that\u2019s running a little hot for a variety of reasons, some engine events. So take your pick. We\u2019ve given you lots of ingredients, you can bake whatever pro forma pie you\u2019d like.\nMike Linenberg: That\u2019s what I figured. Just some clarity, the D&A increase, how much \u2013 I mean you told us $30 million for the second half.\nRob Simmons: Yes.\nMike Linenberg: What would have D&A been? Or what was kind of the pickup in June quarter, call it, the extraordinary increase in D&A since you made the decision to get \u2013 you\u2019re getting out of those airplanes earlier?\nRob Simmons: Yes. Yes. So it was up a total of $42 million, and the bulk of that was related to the wind-down of some of the contracts early.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Okay. So like, the big picture items, it\u2019s $42 million plus the $67 million revenue less \u2013 whatever, I think it was $150 million on the CARES is kind of how I think about it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then my second question is, we talk about the secured loan program, and we learned yesterday, actually, that certain carriers of a certain credit quality may actually be able to do an unsecured for the loan program part of the CARES Act. And I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve actually looked into that. Do you actually \u2013 is it essential that you pledge collateral? Is there a way \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a higher interest cost, who knows? And then the other point that we heard yesterday from another company was that they\u2019ve also looked at the mainstream lending program, and they believe they qualify. They are a relatively smaller company, and you\u2019re a relatively smaller company as well. And I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s something that would work for you because one of the benefits of that is that there\u2019s no dilution hit or \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t say dilution, there\u2019s no warrant obligation. So I\u2019m not \u2013 curious if you looked into that and thoughts on that.\nRob Simmons: Yes. So look we\u2019re \u2013 yes, again, as I mentioned on the thing, we\u2019re in the middle of the documentation phase on the treasury loan program, and we would expect that that\u2019s going to close relatively soon. Again, we\u2019ve got quite a bit of flexibility under that program, which we like, where we have until next March to draw down the full amount of that, if we want. So we feel like we\u2019ve got \u2013 the government has made available a great program to us. And we continue to \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the timing and the amount of our involvement in that.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. And then just one quick last one. What we learned on the United call, they did take down their CapEx pretty meaningfully, and they went on to say that airplanes that they were originally going to take delivery of and put on their balance sheet are now going to one of their regional partners. As best as I can tell, looking across the landscape, I can only think of one, maybe, I don\u2019t know, 1.5 regional carriers out there that would even have the balance sheet to take on the CapEx reduction that United indicated on their call. And yet, I don\u2019t see anything in your release. Are there other airplanes that you\u2019re taking delivery on that are going to be flown on behalf of United down the road that you just \u2013 maybe you haven\u2019t finished up the documentation, and it\u2019s not signed, sealed and delivered? Anything on that front that we should be aware of?\nChip Childs: Yes. Mike, this is Chip. To the extent that we have new aircraft coming in, our business is that we absolutely will be the ones flying those if we were to finance those. So candidly speaking, there\u2019s nothing from our perspective that that\u2019s happening with. We have a lot of conversations with our partners. Clearly, nothing short-term unless something changes here soon, but the principle from our perspective is that if we\u2019re going to buy new airplanes, we\u2019re only going to finance them if we fly them.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, very good. Thanks, Chip. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hi, good evening guys. Good afternoon. I tried to follow the, I guess, the moving pieces from a fleet standpoint, but I\u2019m not \u2013 I wasn\u2019t smart enough to keep up. So can you just maybe kind of walk through over the next few quarters contractually what your fleet looks like? And then how realistic is it that, that actually plays out relative to, I don\u2019t know, scope and mainline fleet changes at some of your partners? Just contractually, what the fleet looks like over the next several quarters and then kind of, realistically, where you think you all emerge on the other side of this.\nWade Steel: Yes. Joe, this is Wade. That\u2019s a great question. There are a lot of fleet movement right now. We\u2019re working with all of our major partners. If you look in the release, as of the end of the second quarter, we had 471 airplanes that we are flying. There\u2019s definitely going to be some movement between now and the end of the year. We anticipate that our fleet will be somewhere around 450 airplanes by the end of the year. Primary \u2013 the biggest changes will be primarily the Delta 50-seaters coming out. And then we\u2019ll be adding in some new additional American flying on the 700s side and then some 175s on the Delta side. So those are kind of the big fleet movement. But at the end of the day, when you boil it all down, we\u2019ll be around 450 airplanes at SkyWest at the end of the year.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. So you think that SkyWest, it kind of emerges from this with a similar \u2013 roughly similar fleet size than you came into it, even though your partners are talking about \u2013 some of them talking about getting significantly \u2013 well, materially smaller. Is that right?\nWade Steel: So a couple of things that you can look at. We\u2019ve taken a lot of 175s that were financed by our major partners during the pandemic, right? We took the 25 United that were financed from those guys. We did not have those last year. Those are all on property today. And those are offsetting a lot of the CRJ200s that are going away. And so as we talked a lot in our script, we are \u2013 this has accelerated our fleet replacement. And it\u2019s \u2013 one bright spot of it is it has accelerated it, and we are going to have more and more 175s as we emerge of this. As I said in my script, by the middle of 2022, we\u2019re going to have 213 175s. At year-end, we had 156, right? And so there\u2019s been a very nice growth in our 175s. And the 175s, our block hours period-over-period in the third quarter, we think it\u2019s only going to be down around 10%. So we\u2019ve done a very nice job in our dual-class of growing that. Our 50-seaters will shrink. But net-net, it is down a little bit, but we\u2019re going to emerge with around 450 airplanes.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I wish I had paid for the soundproof doors in my house, I apologize for the background noise. But Chip, can you talk about maybe what you think some of this means in terms of how much regional flying your partners do in-house versus look to outsource to a third-party, kind of what your addressable market looks like on the other side of this?\nChip Childs: Yes. Just briefly, it\u2019s \u2013 like I said a couple of times in the call, there\u2019s a lot of variables associated with this. I mean \u2013 I will say, I think what we\u2019re trying to bring to the marketplace is a couple of things that other carriers may not be able to, and that is a significant amount of capital, if necessary, a lot of flexibility with what we can do with flight schedules as well as the ability to just execute. So relative to internal carriers, we\u2019re really not far enough down the pathway to see what that might look like. I think everybody is still trying to scramble. There\u2019s a lot of variables happening this fall. Is there going to be more CARES money? Or is there going to be a resurgence in the virus infection? Is it going to go away more? There\u2019s just so many variables that\u2019s hard to see. The only thing that we know that we can do is control what we can control. We feel like we\u2019ve got an exceptional strategy over the last several years with our partners. We kind of feel a little bit like we were built for today, to be honest with you. And what we want to accomplish in the long term is more important, I think, than what we can do in the short term. But that having been said, we think that by working with our people and partners, we\u2019re optimistic that we could emerge very, very strong when the domestic demand returns. So that\u2019s about all we can say to that right now given the amount of uncertainty.\nJoseph DeNardi: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve O\u2019Hara with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for the time.\nChip Childs: Hi, Steve.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Hi. Just curious, maybe just quickly on the deferred revenue, I thought you said you had received the cash from that flying or maybe I was wrong on that. But can you just explain to me what happened there with the deferred revenue and receipt of the cash? I guess if it was \u2013 if the cash wasn\u2019t received, I understand.\nRob Simmons: Yes. So we deferred recognition of $69 million of revenue during the quarter. This was revenue for which we have been completely paid. It is revenue for which we have no ongoing obligation. But under 606, we were required to defer a portion of the fixed rate component of our contracts because of the disruption in our production, our block hours being down so much.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. Okay. And then maybe if you think about \u2013 obviously, there\u2019s a lot of questions right now about the future, et cetera. But I mean my assumption is, as well, that you\u2019re not slashing costs in the effort to kind of maintain flexibility on the other side. And I mean \u2013 I guess can you just talk about how long it would take you to get your costs to the right place to kind of become profitable again at whatever that flying level is? I mean, obviously, if that\u2019s 20% of where you are today, that\u2019s going to be a lot different. But if you\u2019re talking about a reduced level of flying within a reasonable time, how long would it take you to get your cost structure to that level?\nChip Childs: So Steve, this is Chip. If we knew what the flight level was going to be, I would say we could do it as early as October 1, and we would do it as early as October 1 if we knew exactly what we were dealing with next summer. But that\u2019s why, from our perspective, it\u2019s a little too soon to give some answers on the overall structure of the airline. Outside of some of the management and overhead costs, we\u2019re going to go ahead and make some of those changes anyway because we need to. But relative to the broader picture, we really need to get a better volume in working with four separate partners how this is impacting them and how we can respond to them before we can adapt to those costs. Now to a certain extent, if the volumes are good next spring and summer, then it\u2019s easier. But if we see something different and this continues to deteriorate over the next six to nine months, depending upon your outlook of the virus, then we\u2019re going to have to make some extremely difficult decisions. But by the time we know what next summer looks like, that\u2019s kind of the finish line that we know we got to get to, and we don\u2019t quite have the data points on that yet. So the answer to your question is we can get there very quickly as soon as we know that answer as I think several other airlines are demonstrating the need given the volumes that they\u2019re going to be flying. So quickly, but we just \u2013 we need to know what spring and summer next year looks like before we go through a really significant process that may hit the frontline employees or domiciles and those types of things.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question today is a follow-up from Catherine O\u2019Brien of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Thank you so much for the time. I think \u2013 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a clear-cut answer to this. But prior to all of this, we were thinking about a glide path to either materially reducing your debt and intentionally growing earnings through share buybacks, et cetera, or adding additional CapEx for demand and growing EPS that way. I guess now, probably the path of growing on extra demand maybe seems a little further out at the very least. But on the path of reducing debt, I guess, like how much lost flying would you need to see to not be able to just like pay off those regularly recurring amortization payments? Like, is that \u2013 would have to be feeling really draconian, like a lot of early contract terminations? Or could it just be being reduced to the minimum for, I don\u2019t know, the next two years and having contracts roll off? So I know kind of a long-winded question, but I guess just, like, trying to get a sense of how bad things have to get for you guys to not be able to pay off that debt and, potentially, if you look at refinancing, just trying to get a sense like on the other side of this, what the balance sheet would look like.\nChip Childs: Yes. So I think, Catie, that\u2019s a really, really good question, but I would present it by fleet. The debt that we have is very specific to the ERJ 175 fleet, which is ironically the fleet that our partners are utilizing the most, particularly today, and we anticipate that they will utilize it the most as we go through more and more of this economic recovery. The Bombardier fleet, as Wade kind of pointed out, is our larger fleet, and it\u2019s largely paid off with very little tail risk as well as very little debt associated with the Bombardier fleet and also very little depreciation by the time we\u2019re done by the end of this year. So I think you have to look at it in those terms. Our most valuable fleet in the recovery is also the one that has the majority of the debt, if not all of the debt on it, which is providing that type of value to our partners. So it\u2019s not that how will you reduce your fleet so that you couldn\u2019t make those payments, we could reduce the Bombardier side of the house, if we had to, a lot, and it would never penetrate the need for what we will be recovering from the 175s and make those debt payments. So look, I think the story here is it\u2019s a great question, and we look at that a lot, but it\u2019s mostly about the fleet type, what the debt is attached to and the value that, that fleet is providing our partners in this recovery process that helps solidify and stabilize kind of what your general question is about the payment of debt.\nRob Simmons: And Catie, just one other thing. Just a reminder that of the $3 billion, close to $3 billion in debt we have, none of that, other than this little sliver of this new CARES Act piece, none of that debt is general purpose debt, corporate debt. That\u2019s all \u2013 all of our debt, other than that piece, is financing airplanes. And the bulk of those are in those fully amortizing structures where those \u2013 that deck is fully serviced by the end of the term. And that\u2019s something that we like very much in terms of the overall structure of our balance sheet that we\u2019ve got debt that\u2019s matched to the assets.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. That\u2019s great. Seems likely probably won\u2019t be running into that. Thank you very much for the time.\nRob Simmons: Thanks, Catie.\nOperator: The next question is another follow-up from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Just a question on the cash burn. Rob, I think you talked about maybe $15 million a month cash burn. That seems to be down from $30 million that you were talking about last quarter. I\u2019m wondering what was the drivers of that reduction and how you think about it as you head into the end of the year.\nRob Simmons: Yes. Sure. Well, obviously, as you can see, we generated good cash during the quarter. Cash is up $184 million quarter-over-quarter. Debt is up $71 million. So you can think of it as that we generated a little over $100 million during the quarter from a variety of different sources. So as we look at \u2013 as we model the last six months of the year, again, we assume we\u2019ll be somewhere in the neighborhood of $700 million at year-end, down from the $762 million where we are right now or where we were as of June 30. And then \u2013 but we\u2019ve got $39 million of new CARES Act debt that\u2019s part of that mix, so we\u2019re going to count that as burn, too. So if you look at cash reduction from $762 million down to $700 million and then count $39 million of that new CARES Act debt as burn as well, because that\u2019s also included in the cash forecast, that gets you to your burn that\u2019s about $16 million a month or just a little over $500,000 of burn a day, down from what was $1 million a day, we estimated, by the end of the year last quarter.\nSavi Syth: So I guess what I\u2019m not quite catching is what drove the difference, is it better cost execution? Is it maybe revenue not down as much as you had feared?\nRob Simmons: Some of it\u2019s just timing of the receipt of some of these programs. And we\u2019re also \u2013 we\u2019ve also been very successful, as Chip mentioned, in some of these initiatives where we\u2019ve got voluntary time-off programs that have worked very well for us as well.\nSavi Syth: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chip Childs for any closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Elisa, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your interest in SkyWest. I want to again thank our people. We have a solid foundation and simply the best team in the industry. I\u2019m proud of our airline and our teams and the great work they\u2019re doing to support each other in the long-term success of SkyWest. And with that, we will talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 1, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-05-09 23:59:05", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the SkyWest Incorporated First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Simmons, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nRobert Simmons: Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer; and Mike Thompson, SkyWest Airlines\u2019 Chief Operating Officer. I would like to start today by asking Eric to read the Safe Harbor. Then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results, then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2019 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chip.\nRussell Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. The first quarter of 2020 has been unlike anything we\u2019ve experienced in SkyWest\u2019s history. The speed and breadth of the coronavirus health and economic crisis could not have been anticipated, and our hearts go out to those who have lost loved ones to this disease. Our response has been focused on three critical areas, as we work to navigate within this unprecedented environment and take care of our airline, our people and our customers. First, the personal health and well-being of our people and passengers is our top priority; second, we\u2019re focused on maintaining the cash and liquidity necessary to work through this crisis; and third, ensuring we\u2019re flexible and well-positioned for recovery once the virus is contained. In early March, we mobilized very quickly to work with each of our partners to enhance cleaning and disinfecting measures onboard aircraft, reduce customer touch points and onboard service and implement CDC-recommended social distancing practices where possible. We expect many of these changes will remain in place indefinitely, and we appreciate the rapid response in partnership with our people as we work to implement these updates swiftly and thoroughly. Our people have demonstrated remarkable teamwork and support for each other and our customers throughout this event and I\u2019m humbled to be a part of this incredible team. Our leadership is working constantly to address these challenges, support our people and protect our company, and I want to thank them for their continued dedication and commitment. Our SkyWest professionals are simply the best in this industry, and I\u2019m proud of the outstanding work that they\u2019re doing to help maintain vital air service in these challenging times. The Payroll Support Program funding, as part of the CARES Act, is a critical acknowledgment of the important work our people are doing everyday. We certainly appreciate Congress and the administration for passing this legislation to support our people. In April, we received $219 million of the $438 million total we are expected to receive over the next several months, which includes $101 million in the form of a 10-year unsecured term loan. This relief, combined with our work in the marketplace and aggressive cost management, will help with our cash position as we work to navigate this crisis and ensure we\u2019re positioned for recovery. Rob will talk more about our liquidity in a minute. To provide some perspective on the dramatic demand change, we would have expected to fly about 2,500 daily departures this time of the year. Today, that number is between 800 and 900 departures each day. In some ways, that significant reduction can be more difficult to manage with a fleet of over 500 aircraft and fewer opportunities to get cruise and aircraft in position. Though we are hopeful this will not be the case indefinitely, we expect to see similar departure counts throughout May and June and are prepared to respond as necessary if the climate continues to deteriorate. We\u2019re working closely and collaborating with \u2013 and collaboratively with each of our partners to provide flexibility and options for their needs. As Wade will share, we\u2019re working with each of our partners to provide creative solutions and support, including temporarily waiving contract minimum provisions, temporary rate reduction and passing through the benefit of certain aircraft ownership payment deferrals, which we have negotiated with our primary credit providers. As we\u2019ve discussed many times over the past several years, we remain focused on ensuring we\u2019re the best positioned to meet our partners\u2019 needs. Across our operation, we\u2019ve also worked closely with our people to take steps to manage costs in this environment. This includes providing offerings for voluntary time off, early retirement opportunities and other reduced and flexible work schedules where possible. We deferred some of the heavy maintenance that was previously planned as we work with our partners to align fleet deployment with new schedules. We\u2019ve reduced our pro rate footprint of flying, while complying with the requirements under the CARES Act. We\u2019ve also suspended training and initiated a hiring freeze on all positions until further notice. As of today, nearly 5,000 employees have elected to take voluntary time off for one to six months. This is an important cost measure that also helps us better navigate the significantly reduced schedules we\u2019re currently operating. Following health, safety and liquidity, we\u2019re focused on positioning for recovery. Given the current environment and sharp reduction in travel, we expect it will be quite sometime before demand fully returns. It is likely we\u2019ll need to streamline and resize our airline in the near-term to ensure our long-term viability and success. There\u2019s a real possibility we\u2019ll be a smaller airline by year-end. Undoubtedly, the next several months will be turbulent. We are taking every possible step to ensure our foundation remains strong and we are best positioned for recovery when the time comes. We remain disciplined and flexible in our approach with our fleet and our partners. As demand returns, we are confident our fleet will continue to fill a critical role in return to travel. The core values at SkyWest have seen us through many challenges, and as most of you are aware, we\u2019ve spent the last several years focused on eliminating fleet tail risk, operating risk and contract risk. The focus on reducing our overall risk has helped to shore up our solid foundation for long-term sustainability. We are focused on navigating this crisis aggressively and deliberately to take care of our people and our customers, as we preserve our liquidity and plan for recovery. The environment just weeks ago was dramatically different than today. But our fundamental principles of agility, strength and discipline, as well as our objective to continue to meet our partners\u2019 needs remain unchanged. We have a track record of adapting quicker than anyone to our partners\u2019 needs and we\u2019re very focused on maintaining that capability. We will continue to work together with our people and our partners to ensure we emerge as a better, stronger business. I want to thank again our people, as well as the administration and our business partners, who are aiding in our long-term stability. I\u2019m proud of our airline and our teams and the great work they are doing to support each other and our long-term success. Rob will now take us through some of the financial data.\nRobert Simmons: Today, we reported first quarter net income of $30 million, or $0.59 per diluted share. Our diluted share count for Q1 was 50.6 million shares and our effective tax rate in Q1 was 23.3%. Let me start today with the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash of $578 million, up from $520 million last quarter. Our CapEx during the first quarter was $77 million, including $55 million in spare engines and $22 million for other roadables and used aircraft. At this point, our expectation is to pull back our CapEx for the year from $636 million last year to $300 million to $400 million this year, including the acquisition of six new E175s by the end of the year. We ended the quarter with debt of $2.9 billion, down from $3 billion as of year-end. Let\u2019s talk about liquidity. Our March 31 cash position was $578 million in addition to availability of $65 million on our revolving line of credit. During April, we received $219 million in payroll support funding under the CARES Act. Another $219 million will come in three additional payments this summer. As you will recall, $101 million of the $438 million in PSP funding is in the form of a 10-year term loan, with a 1% interest rate for the first five years with the remainder in a grant. At quarter end, we had unencumbered assets of over $1 billion, primarily in engines and aircraft. This unpledged collateral gives us additional liquidity alternatives, which we will evaluate, including $497 million in senior secured term financing under the loan program of the CARES Act. We have formally applied for this loan program through the U.S. Treasury, but we have until September 30, 2020, to decide on our participation level, if any. Based on ending March cash of $575 million and including the initial PSP funding of $219 million received in April, we ended the month of April with strong liquidity and a still undrawn revolver. Our current cash modeling over the next eight months indicates that without any additional debt draws other than the ordinary term debt to finance the six E175s expected to be delivered this year, we should end 2020 approximately $100 million lower in cash than where we stood at the end of April. This number assumes the full $101 million in PSP notes is outstanding at year-end, along with $34 million in payroll tax deferrals payable in 2021 and 2022. So cash burn through the rest of the year is the net $100 million reduction in cash from May to December, $101 million in the outstanding PSP notes and $34 million in payroll tax deferrals, a total of $235 million in total estimated cash burn over the remainder of the year. The math for the remaining eight months of the year, May through December, is $30 million burn per month on average, or $1 million burn per day. Our current modeling, subject to many uncertainties and with modest recovery in flying and incremental cost rationalizations assumed by year-end, is the cash burn improves in 2021. This demand disruption event shines a spotlight on the importance of how we have been derisking our business model over the last five years. While no one in our industry is immune to the economic effects of the COVID crisis, we appear to be reasonably positioned to weather the storm. If the economic effects turn out to be worse and the recovery is slower than we currently expect, we have additional liquidity tools we can call on, including our revolver, our $497 million allocation of secured CARES Act loans and other secured loan alternatives accessed by putting our $1 billion in unpledged collateral to work. In addition to our core liquidity position, you can quickly identify three things that are nice to have during this time of uncertainty that give us more flexibility than others in our space. Number one, 35% of our fleet has no financing remaining on it. This number goes to 45% when you include partner-owned aircraft that we operate. Number two, we have $1 billion in unencumbered assets in the form of engines and aircraft. This gives us the optionality for incremental liquidity in the form of secured borrowing, if needed. And number three, minimal tail risk of around $100 million, the dollar delta between financing term and contract term. Our next pocket of tail risk is now out to 2023 and is zero on the delta 200s expiring later this year. Let me address specifically the COVID impact on our Q1 results. Our $39 million in pre-tax income is roughly $45 million lower than what we would have hoped to generate in Q1. $25 million of that is primarily from lower pro rate revenue in March as demand evaporated, $15 million is from accelerated depreciation on upcoming contract expirations that are not expected to be renewed and $5 million is from the adoption of the new credit loss standard in Q1 and other items. Especially in times of great uncertainty like this and consistent with our policy and practice, we are not in a position to give any formal or informal EPS guidance at time. It goes without saying that this COVID event has been a setback to our plans. But I would highlight that the $337 million grant component of the PSP to be received over the course of the summer is expected to be recorded as income ratably in Q2 and Q3. We will obviously give additional color on our outlook as appropriate down the road. Wade will now give some details on fleet initiatives, fleet movements and other commercial opportunities. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I\u2019ll provide a fleet status update, as well as an update on our pro rate and leasing businesses. To recap some of our agreements at a high-level, we were scheduled to add 51 aircraft to our fleet in 2020 and 12 in 2021. This included 32 aircraft financed by our partners, as well as 26 new aircraft and five used aircraft financed by SkyWest. Taking the current travel environment into account, we still anticipate taking delivery of these aircraft. However, we are working closely with our partners and manufacturers to adjust the timing of these deliveries. To update by partner, we currently have six new E175s on order under our Delta agreement. We still anticipate taking delivery of all six aircraft this year and working through the schedule with Delta and Embraer. We are also scheduled to take six used E175s sourced from another operator into Delta service. We have received all six aircraft, three of which are currently in service. We anticipate the 3 other aircraft will begin service late this year. We expect that our final CRJ900s scheduled for this quarter will be delayed, and we are working with Delta and Bombardier on delivery timing. You may recall that we have 55 CRJ200s scheduled to expire under our Delta agreement at the end of this year. And we are working with Delta on their long-term 50-seat needs. In the event these aircraft are not renewed, we\u2019d return 19 of the aircraft back to Delta. The remaining 36 aircraft are SkyWest owned with no remaining financing obligations and will be fully depreciated by year-end. Under our United partnership, we signed an extension for our 70 CRJ200s in February, with an average extension term of three years. Both parties have early termination rights for a certain number of aircraft starting in the end of 2021. Our previously announced 25 used E175 aircraft will be placed into service ratably under 12 months beginning in the third quarter of this year. These aircraft are financed by United and will be sourced from another United Express operator. We are working with American to adapt aircraft deliveries and service schedules to the current environment. We have anticipated taking delivery of the first 10 of our 20 new E175s this year and the remaining 10 during the first-half of next. However, we do not expect these to arrive this year or in early 2021. We\u2019ll provide updates on the new delivery schedule as it is finalized. And while we originally planned for our 10 previously announced CRJ700s to be placed into American service this year, we now anticipate that time line will move to early next year. As Chip mentioned, we\u2019re working with all of our major partners on contract flexibility, including temporarily waiving contract minimums, deferring the start of contracts, temporary rate reductions during Q2 and Q3 and passing through the benefit of deferring certain aircraft ownership charges that we have negotiated with our primary creditors. We are working proactively with each partner to provide creative solutions to the current challenges. Let me talk a little bit about our pro rate business. We were working with our major partners to transition several pro rate markets to contract due to anticipated growth this year, with pro rate reductions scheduled this April. We now anticipate our pro rate block hours to be reduced by approximately 60% during the second quarter, while still providing service in compliance with the provisions of the CARES Act. During the month of March, our pro rate revenue was lower than our expectation by approximately $25 million. We now expect our pro rate revenue will be approximately $100 million less during the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Let me shift gears to our leasing business. We have delivered 16 of 29 CRJ700 aircraft under leases to a third-party. The lessee has requested that we pause delivery on the other 13 aircraft. The lessee has extraordinary financial issues, and we are evaluating all of our options under the lease. We have also agreed to purchase seven used CRJ700S from a third-party. At quarter-end, we have closed on five of the seven aircraft. We expect to close on the other two during Q3 of this year. These are unprecedented times. We are committed to working with each of our major partners to provide creative solutions and to respond quickly to their needs. We have spent the last several years reducing risk and enhancing fleet and financing flexibility, which will ensure we\u2019re positioned to navigate this challenging environment.\nRobert Simmons: Okay. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A section.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hey, good evening, everybody. Robert, can you just talk a little bit about \u2013 or Chip, the \u2013 maybe the size of the fleet as you see it kind of realistically on the other side of this? And I know there are a lot of moving parts and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re having negotiations. But can you just talk about, just given what\u2019s happened to the mainline fleet of your partners and obviously, less demand for your service, how you see the fleet shaking out? Thank you.\nRussell Childs: Thanks, Joe. This is Chip. I would certainly say that we\u2019re anticipating a smaller overall fleet. Part of what we also try to evaluate is how much that fleet is going to be flown. Today, we\u2019re flying a fair portion of our fleet. But when you move from 2,500 daily departures down to 700 or 800 departures, you don\u2019t have a ton of utilization relative to that fleet. So overall, look, the conversations are fluid. The entire industry is looking for additional demand data as we emerge out of the traditional lockdowns that we\u2019ve experienced the last several weeks. And within those data points, we continue to watch what our partners are asking us to do. We\u2019ll also say that we\u2019re in very fluid conversations. But I think it goes without saying that we\u2019ll likely be a fair bit smaller by the end of the year, potentially 10% smaller and we have a lot more data to pay attention to before we can get any more clarity beyond that at this time.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, Rob, can you just talk kind of at a high-level, since I\u2019m sure some of it\u2019s sensitive, but how do you ensure that you kind of balance being flexible for your partners without taking on too much of their risk on to your balance sheet?\nRobert Simmons: Yes. Well, let me start and maybe Wade can also chip in here. But I think that as far as our ability to be flexible, we\u2019re proud that we\u2019re in a position to be able to be helpful to our partners. We\u2019ve got relatively strong liquidity right now in addition to other liquidity options that are made possible to us by the fact that we went into this crisis with $1 billion of unpledged collateral that we can deploy if need be down the road. But obviously, we\u2019re trying to be collaborative and helpful to our partners, at the same time, make sure that we\u2019ve got adequate liquidity for ourselves.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavanthi Syth: Rob, I really appreciate the color on cash burn and liquidity and walking us through those numbers as well. But can I ask what you are assuming in the cash \u2013 that cash burn profile that you provided? Is it that just there\u2019s no change in the current flying, or like how are you kind of building that bridge?\nRobert Simmons: Yes. No, like I said, we\u2019re expecting some modest improvement by the end of the year. We\u2019re not trying to dial in a lot of detail over the next eight months. But over the next eight months, we see our burn on average being about $1 million a day, and we\u2019ve got more than adequate liquidity based on that projection to cover where we are. But we\u2019re also grateful that we\u2019ve got other options available to us for liquidity if things turn out to be worse than they appear right now.\nSavanthi Syth: And is the \u2013 I understand kind of working with partners on kind of entry of service on certain things. With the CRJ700s, both at American and GoJet, how do you handle that? Because I\u2019m guessing you have lease payments or debt payments on those. Is that something that\u2019s just part of this cash burn until you figure that out? And I\u2019m just trying to understand kind of what are the potential options there as you work with them.\nWade Steel: Yes. Obviously \u2013 Savi, this is Wade.\nSavanthi Syth: Hi, Wade.\nWade Steel: As we work with both the lessee and American, we\u2019re taking into mind the financing obligations that we do have. That\u2019s definitely included in Rob\u2019s numbers of $1 million of cash burn. So we\u2019re working with each one of them around those \u2013 the issues that we are going to have and we\u2019re finding creative solutions around those, so.\nSavanthi Syth: All right. And if I might just ask one last one on the resizing of the fleet. Just how should we think about your flexibility in terms of kind of taking out some of the fixed costs as we go through the year? And how long that might take to kind of match the new environment when you figure out what the new environment is?\nRussell Childs: Well, Savi, this is Chip. I mean, there\u2019s a couple of fixed costs, I think, you\u2019re probably referring to and then we have a unique set of circumstances by fleet. As Rob said in his script, we have a fair amount of unencumbered assets. I think, we\u2019ve also disclosed a lot of that is on our smaller fleet relative to the 200s, same as on a significant portion of our 700s and some 900s, but the large leverage point of debt is on our 175s. So we look at all of these in a unique way and what \u2013 we\u2019re working with our partners on how each of those fleets could possibly help in a recovery process. As we\u2019ve mentioned in the script, we\u2019ve also worked with some of the debt holders to gain some opportunities for cash \u2013 temporary cash savings and pass those on to our partners. It\u2019s worked out extremely well. But going forward, other fixed costs relative to the company that we have, we\u2019re not immune to anything that you\u2019ve heard within the industry. We are, no doubt, over the next several months going to take some very difficult decisions relative to some of our overheads and fixed costs and take the opportunity that is absolutely necessary to streamline those levels of things, because there\u2019s \u2013 uniquely, there is a different evolution that\u2019s taking place throughout the industry. We have been built on a very, very high level of performance, which still matters, but the investment does not pay the same return on investment that we\u2019ve seen in the past and we\u2019re going to evolve to different types of things. It\u2019s going to, again, meet the needs of our people as well as our partners. And structurally, at the end of the day, find a way that we evolve to be a leaner and better operator on the other side of this.\nSavanthi Syth: I appreciate all those answers. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thank you. I appreciate the commentary about being collaborative, given the recency of the shock. But big picture, what percent of your capacity purchase agreements have guaranteed minimums? And how far are you operating below those minimums? I\u2019m just a little confused. I would think of the pro rate business as being sort of 100% variable cost. So why is there really any cash burn here, given the ratable nature of your business model and what we thought were guarantees?\nWade Steel: Yes. Duane, this is Wade. So first of all, we have been very collaborative with our partners. We\u2019re trying to work with them. Around the minimums, the vast majority of our contracts have \u2013 our CPAs have contract minimums. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are temporarily waiving those minimums during the second and third quarters. And so we are flying about 60% \u2013we have a reduction of about 60%, 65% of our flying right now. And so that\u2019s why there has been some variability in the revenue.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then can you give us a sense for what is still getting paid versus what is not getting paid? So, for example, on the aircraft ownership pass-through, if you debt finance a new E175, but it\u2019s not being utilized, are you at least being reimbursed for the aircraft ownership? And how does that factor into your willingness to kind of take more on to the balance sheet?\nWade Steel: Yes. So that\u2019s a good question. So in the example that you gave there, as we\u2019ve talked about, as Rob talked in his prepared remarks, we\u2019ve worked with certain creditors on getting a deferral in some of our ownership charges. And so during this period of time, we have deferred certain ownership charges to our major partners based on the deferral that we\u2019ve received from the creditors.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then just lastly on payroll support. So you\u2019re getting reimbursed for the labor costs that you\u2019re carrying and those folks are not being utilized. Are you getting any requests from your partners for credit \u2013 for the credit you\u2019re receiving?\nWade Steel: So, Duane, great question. So we obviously are working with our partners very close and we \u2013 the CARES money is for payroll, right? And that is very clear and we are being extremely diligent around using that money for our payroll folks. We are also working with our partners, as I said, during the second and third quarters, giving them rate reductions to help with some of the issues that they\u2019re facing. So we\u2019re being very diligent around the CARES money.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then just lastly, for those of you that were \u2013 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any good analogy to past periods here. But if you think about post 9/11 and a decline in short-haul traffic and people more willing to drive for a period of time, how does the regional model fit with that, right? Like do you lose share to drive? On the other hand, I would have thought that it makes a lot of sense to down gauge higher trip cost mainline aircraft to regionals, which would actually be a potential growth catalyst for you on the other side, but maybe that\u2019s hard to achieve in the current scope construct. So just big picture, how you think about this longer-term from a demand driver perspective?\nRussell Childs: Yes. So, Duane, this is Chip. You are looking at this exactly right. There\u2019s so many different factors relative to the regional model, particularly when you go back to 9/11 and you go back to the financial crisis about what elements do we see smaller aircraft gaining advantages or being \u2013 gaining \u2013 having some handicap in some of the recovery process. Look, I still go back to one statistic that air travel is by math, any math you look at is the safest travel and always has been for the past several years or decades. Now even adding the risk of COVID on to that model, I still think that air travel, particularly relative to what we do, is still the safest mode of transportation. So the bigger question is going to be what does the overall recovery process look like. The data and statistics are relatively clear. We\u2019re also deeply engaged in many activities with our partners and other carriers to just try to fix this \u2013 the air system that we actually travel in relative to what is the new normal. We know this \u2013 that everyone is going to need to be wearing a mask. We know the TSA is going to be wearing a mask. There\u2019s a lot of infrastructure things that we\u2019re working on to get to the number one question that you brought up of bringing back demand. We think that there is some advantages relative to small town flying that we go to a lot. We think there\u2019s advantages to having a smaller aircraft with shorter duration of flights and good, strong trip costs compared to what some of the other elements are. So look, Duane, I wish we had more answers about this. But in a nutshell, you\u2019re looking at all the right variables that we\u2019re looking at. We\u2019re having conversations with our partners on all of these variables, and we\u2019re excited and very, very engaged to see some of the opportunities that will emerge as we get more data points as we come out of the lockdown process and what happens relative to demand. So \u2013 and again, back to the point, we\u2019re doing things in the industry we\u2019ve never done, as well as we do today. I mean, our aircraft are so amazingly clean. They were clean before, but what we\u2019re doing at turns, overnight, midday, everything and how our people are trained to handle this crisis, the flying public is \u2013 once they start are going to get what we believe a tremendous amount of confidence in the product. Given the math that we talked about earlier in the response about how safe it is to fly even with the risk that we have associated with this current crisis.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes, thanks. I mean, obviously, there\u2019s some practical limitations vis-\u00e0-vis scope as they shrink. But I would think that your aircraft would be ideally suited for help them \u2013 helping them rediscover where demand actually exists. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.\nRussell Childs: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon. Just a couple here, I think. So, Wade, I think if I heard you right, you said that flying would be down 60% to 65% in the June quarter. Presumably, you\u2019re talking about block hours on the CPA business. Is that right?\nWade Steel: That\u2019s correct, Michael.\nMike Linenberg: And in September quarter, at this point, are you still planning for down 60% to 65%, or is the schedule, maybe it\u2019s even too early?\nWade Steel: It\u2019s still really, really early for that. We\u2019re obviously working with our partners. But we do anticipate that the \u2013 in all the modeling that we\u2019ve done, we anticipate that it will still be suppressed during that quarter as well.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. So it will be that. Now when we think about the revenues, right, so obviously, there are things that I think Duane covered that they will fully cover, although you are giving some rate reductions here and there. But nonetheless, it\u2019s, call it, 1% off of a full number. So if we think that on the \u2013 at least on the contracts line, if the block is down 60% to 65%, the actual revenue received should be down \u2013 it should be down, but not down nearly as much. If you sort of incorporate some of the discounting rate reductions and the like that you\u2019re providing that you shouldn\u2019t see as big of a flaw. Is that accurate?\nWade Steel: Yes. You understand our model pretty good.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Okay, good. And then just over on the pro rate, and I may have misheard, but it \u2013 and it may have been, Wade, who indicated that June quarter pro rate should be down 60%, and that\u2019s about $100 million less of revenue than what you generated in your pro rate business in 2019. In the March quarter, how much was pro rate down?\nWade Steel: Yes. So for the month of March and the quarter was about $25 million less than what we expected it to be.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. So I got that number on revenue, but do you have just on the percentage?\nWade Steel: The percentage of flying? So we\u2026\nMike Linenberg: Your block hours, maybe how much has it been?\nWade Steel: \u2026the block hours were \u2013 yes, the block hours were very consistent with the prior periods. We hadn\u2019t \u2013 we weren\u2019t \u2013 we didn\u2019t have the ability to pull that down\u2026\nMike Linenberg: I see. Okay.\nWade Steel: \u2026the market has jumped on us pretty quickly. So the block hours were pretty still high.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. So that makes sense. Then back to just the sort of the deferral and ownership costs, where you\u2019ve reached out to your creditors and asked for relief and, of course, you\u2019re passing that on to your partners. Presumably, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a three-month benefit, a six-month cash flow benefit, but ultimately, that will ramp back up. And so the back-half of maybe months nine through 12 or months 12 through 15, we\u2019re going to be looking at much higher ownership charges. You are in a \u2013 presumably, your partners are in agreement with you that when they jump up a lot and they will go up above and beyond what they normally are that they will cover 100% amount of that. Is that the understanding?\nWade Steel: Yes. So on the topic of the deferral, yes, we\u2019re not \u2013 we can\u2019t get into the specifics exactly what it is, but it is an interest and principal-type deferral for a time.\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nWade Steel: And part of that will \u2013 I mean, that \u2013 and it will be recaptured, some of it will be recaptured by being reamortized over the remaining life of the contract.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. That\u2019s great. And then, Rob, you had added up the numbers and I think I just \u2013 I didn\u2019t hear you, maybe my phone cut out, but for your cash, your liquidity position at the end of April, what was that number as of April 30?\nRobert Simmons: Yes. We didn\u2019t give an actual number, Michael. But we did \u2013 just to point out that we did end the quarter with $578 million of cash. And then during the month of April, we received, again, the first-half of our PSP funding. So, we clearly ended the end of April in a solid liquidity position and our cash burn numbers are measured from that May 1 through the end of the year, the 300 \u2013 $235 million of cash burn over that eight-month period is how you get the math to $1 million a day of burn on average.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. I just \u2013 I was curious just the starting point, because we don\u2019t know what the cash burn was for the month of April. But presumably, it was more than $1 million, right? And I\u2019m just\u2026.\nRobert Simmons: Yes.\nMike Linenberg: \u2026I\u2019m trying to get to that April 30 number. Okay. But like you said, it was a solid level. And then just my last, and I apologize for all the questions. There was a lot of detail that was covered. Your EAS markets, I know that historically, you\u2019re guaranteed some profit or maybe you have to have a certain volume, you have to meet volume requirements to get whatever that 5% or 10%, maybe it\u2019s a 5% operating margin. I believe you had more EAS flying than any carrier out there, and that\u2019s a big part of your pro rate business. So I was \u2013 I\u2019m curious, because I know the EAS pool, what is it, $250 million a year? And I suspect that you were getting a good portion of that, but maybe you\u2019re not. Can you talk about that EAS piece and maybe why it\u2019s not showing up in the pro rate? And why the pro rate is getting hit so badly?\nWade Steel: Yes. So the DOT \u2013 Michael, this is Wade, again. So the DOT, I don\u2019t know if you saw that they came out recently and gave some relief to the carriers that they could cancel on a \u2013 so they could cancel some of the frequencies in their markets and still get some of the subsidy. And so starting May 1, we have been doing that is canceling some of our EAS markets. We still have service there seven days a week. But instead of operating two flights a day, we\u2019re operating one. The numbers that I gave you were passenger revenues that did not include the subsidy numbers.\nMike Linenberg: I see. Okay. So passenger revenues could be down a bit, but some of these markets may still be profitable because of the subsidy. Is that a fair point?\nWade Steel: I doubt they\u2019ll be profitable. We\u2019ll obviously look at it. The demand is so small in these markets right now and the DOT has been very helpful in letting us reduce the frequency.\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nWade Steel: And so I highly doubt we will be profitable. But obviously, we\u2019re looking at that.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. That\u2019s helpful, guys. Okay, thanks. Thanks for all the time, gentlemen.\nRussell Childs: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: The next question comes from Conor Cunningham with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hey, guys, thanks for the time. Mike asked a bunch of my questions. But just maybe on the leasing business. I mean, I assume that you guys are deferring some of those lease payments at this point. Can you just confirm if that\u2019s the case or not?\nWade Steel: So, as I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve had 29 airplanes that we\u2019re supposed to put into service with one of our lessees. We\u2019ve actually paused that deliveries. We\u2019re currently working with the lessee right now on how we handle some of their challenges. They are in [Technical Difficulty] financial difficulties right now. And I don\u2019t want to talk about specifics whether we\u2019re giving deferrals or not at this point. We are working with them very closely.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the \u2013 so you said we have 55 aircraft coming out of place this year. Just \u2013 I think that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s coming off-lease, or coming off the CPA this year. Is there anything else that could come up potentially in 2020? And then maybe you could update us on 2021. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much there either, but just curious your thoughts on that. Because \u2013 I mean, in the past, like shrinking and you guys refocusing has been hugely beneficial to your overall profitability. So just curious on how your thoughts on those aircraft are coming off?\nWade Steel: Yes. So, obviously, I talked about in my prepared remarks, our 55 airplanes that are coming out of contract with Delta. That is all that\u2019s coming out of contract in 2020 and 2021. Obviously, we\u2019re exploring all kinds of alternatives with those airplanes, including working with the current partner to potentially renew, but we have not got anything done yet.\nConor Cunningham: Okay.\nWade Steel: And then we also have \u2013 and I talked about in my remarks, we have 51 airplanes on order, right? And so we obviously have the six Delta airplanes that are still coming this year and then we have six used airplanes coming for Delta. We also have taken delivery of 25 used 175s in our United fleet and we\u2019re just working with them on the in-service dates. On the American fleet, we still have 20 new 175s and we\u2019re working with them also on the in-service dates on those, so...\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Maybe just to follow-up on Duane\u2019s question. I would think that when all this settles, that the trends that were already occurring are going to continue or probably speed up. So I would like \u2013 I would think that the move to larger regional aircraft just speeds us significantly rather than slow us down. So I mean, what\u2019s your view on scope when all this settles? It seems like \u2013 I mean, all these airlines are going to be smaller, but it seems like this would be the time that the contracts would actually be reworked in your favor. So just \u2013 I mean, I know it\u2019s a touchy subject, but curious if you have any thoughts there? Thanks for the time.\nRussell Childs: Yes, thanks. This is Chip. I would \u2013 relative to scope, we\u2019ve always managed our business planning that there would be no new scope at our partners and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. We fundamentally \u2013 I mean, I respect your hunch there. We hope that what you\u2019re thinking is obviously true. But at this time, when none of us can answer, there\u2019s a lot of questions what happens on the other side of this, which we\u2019re hopeful for. But there\u2019s so much things between here and the other side of this that we have to do right within our strategy. Otherwise, predicting what it\u2019s going to look like won\u2019t even be an option if we don\u2019t handle what\u2019s in front of us the next six months and we execute on it as good, if not better, than we have in the past four or five years. And that\u2019s the key part of us. I mean, we\u2019re hopeful with what the market and our partners may see happening on that. But look, we\u2019ve just got so much in front of us that we are literally going to bury ourselves in, so that we execute what we need to execute and be disciplined and with everything that we have to execute here in the short-term, because that\u2019s probably going to determine more about what it looks like on the other side than trying to speculate on that. So it\u2019s a great question. We\u2019re optimistic, but we are extremely focused on what\u2019s going to happen in the next two to three or four, five months.\nConor Cunningham: Fair enough. Thanks, again.\nOperator: The next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoyce Koltisko: Hi. This is actually Joyce on for Katie. Thank you for taking my questions. You had alluded to various ways that you\u2019re helping your partners, just from waiving the contract minimum provisions to temporary rate reductions. I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019d characterize that relief that you\u2019ve granted. Have you noticed partners lean on any one option more than the others?\nWade Steel: Yes. Joyce, this is Wade. It\u2019s just \u2013 we work with every one of them on their specific needs. Each one of the contracts are different. We have very large commercial\u2019s agreements with every one of these partners. They \u2013 every contract is unique and there\u2019s different levers that we can pull. And so they\u2019re not leaning on one or another. It \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s just \u2013 a lot of it depends on how the planes are owned and financed and how we can help them.\nJoyce Koltisko: Okay. So broadly, you\u2019re seeing all of them use all those options then?\nRussell Childs: Yes. And this is Chip, Joyce. I think, the other thing is, I mean, the one common factor with everybody is cash, obviously. And look, this is what we\u2019ve build ourselves into over the past several years is that, we wanted to be able to have contract flexibility, we wanted to be able to have flexibility within our risk structure to be able to provide any type of assistance. And each and every partner is unique in the fleets we fly and what we can do for them and what they\u2019d value. And like I said, cash has obviously been the one constant thing that they all have suffer help with. And, however, we can do that in the framework of making sure that we are stable and take care of our people. We\u2019ll continue to do what we feel like we\u2019re really good at and that is be collaborative with them and provide value to them.\nJoyce Koltisko: Got it. That makes sense. Just one last one then, too. You mentioned that the relief is temporary just for Q2 and Q3, but should we expect that any of these could actually translate to be more permanent? And is there any recourse you\u2019ll be pursuing if these are permanent cuts, just given that your staffing and fleet was built around these contracts? Thank you.\nRussell Childs: Yes. I would probably add a couple of things to that. And like I\u2019ve said before on the call, we are evaluating what all this looks like. We\u2019re \u2013 if you look at the demand numbers, you look at the recovery numbers, you look at some of the things that the entire industry is reviewing, I would go backwards and lean on what we\u2019ve built this airline on and that\u2019s good, strong relationships. I\u2019m not going to speculate what\u2019s going to happen in the fall. Like I said, we have a lot of internal things to do here to evolve as well. And until we get to the point where some of the temporary leap kind of comes to fruition, we\u2019re going to approach each of our partners, as well as our people with eyes wide open and being able to achieve the goal of being a strong liquid airline in the long run that can \u2013 is one of the best at providing what the flying public wants. So in essence, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to comment any more than that. But like I said, I\u2019ll reiterate, we have a lot in front of us that we need to execute and collaborate with our partners on long before we get to the end of the temporary leap.\nJoyce Koltisko: Got it. Thank you for the answers.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve O\u2019Hara with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nStephen O\u2019Hara: Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question.\nRussell Childs: Good afternoon, Steve.\nStephen O\u2019Hara: Hi. Just curious, I mean, in terms of the \u2013 your partners and the flying that you\u2019re doing versus some of your peers, I\u2019m just \u2013 I mean, do you get the sense that I mean, it does seem like a lot of the other regional partners might have the same type of flexibility and ability to be as helpful as you guys probably can be. And I\u2019m just wondering, I mean, is that generally the case? And do you \u2013 from what you know, do you think the flying has been reduced kind of across the Board? Or are you guys maybe doing more of it or maybe even less of it because of your willingness to be flexible?\nRussell Childs: So, Steve, great question. I think the number one \u2013 to answer the back-half of your question first, probably the number one determinant of level of flying across the country and within the regional industry is geography. Where we have shorter-haul flying across state lines, some not across state lines, there certainly is some of the things that have happened relative to those who fly in New York, San Francisco, L.A., the Pacific Northwest. We\u2019ve seen it evolve over even eight or nine weeks and that\u2019s the number one, I think, determinant of what\u2019s happening within each specific geographic area on if the carrier is flying or not, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a terrific amount of just overall preference. Relative to the first part of your question and what\u2019s happening with peers, we really don\u2019t focus a ton on that. We just take a very strong approach to what we can provide. The relationship with our partners are a lot more important than what we\u2019re trying to do with our competitors, by the way. So that\u2019s kind of the number one catalyst that we continue to try to be very, very fluid on and we don\u2019t necessarily put a yardstick out there to see how we\u2019re measuring up with others relative to this. It\u2019s just \u2013 the relationship with partners is hands down externally what our priority is.\nStephen O\u2019Hara: Okay. Now, that\u2019s helpful. And then, I mean, I guess, in terms of your \u2013 this \u2013 the length that you\u2019re willing to go to be collaborative and things like that, I just want to \u2013 I mean, I assume you guys have kind of stayed away from M&A. I mean, would that \u2013 would you kind of delve back into that arena again in an effort to \u2013 if maybe, if you got a clearer picture on what the demand outlook looked like and things like that. I mean, is that something that you would consider again, or you\u2019re kind of, that is a kind of road you don\u2019t want to go down again?\nRussell Childs: We would never go down the road we have in our history, again. But we definitely would work very collaboratively with other ways to provide significant type of value from that perspective relative to what we could do for them. But our historical model of acquiring other aircraft, we would not do that again.\nStephen O\u2019Hara: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Chip Childs for any closing remarks.\nRussell Childs: Thanks, everyone, again for joining us on the call today. As I said earlier in our remarks, these are times that we have never seen in our history, times that we never predicted would come. But we are appreciative of the people that are here at SkyWest and their level of engagement on this issue. And from a very high level, we\u2019re all around this table so humbled to be a part of such a great company, with such outstanding professionals and with partners that have \u2013 we have a great relationship with, and we look forward to working our way out of this. We think this will be a time that will be in our history books that we hopefully can look back on and remember how it defined us to become a better airline going forward. So with that, again, thank you for your interest, and we will talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 4, "year": 2019, "date": "2020-01-30 22:10:07", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the SkyWest Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Simmons, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nRob Simmons: Thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer; and Mike Thompson; SkyWest Airlines', Chief Operating Officer. I'd like to start today by asking Eric to read the Safe Harbor. Then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results. Then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2018 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric, and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. The fourth quarter completes a strong 2019 for us. For the full year 2019 we grew earnings per share by 18% over 2018, and we monetized our fleet transition initiatives and moved forward as a single airline with a more efficient footprint. Our employees, once again, did a remarkable job, delivering a solid 99.9% adjusted completion in 2019. I don't want to thank our more than 14,000 employees for their efforts to work together and deliver a great product for our customers. Today we announced a new flying contract with American Airlines to own and operate 20 new E175s. Half of these planes are expected to be placed into service in late 2020 and half in 2021. Additionally, we expect to take delivery of six E175s which we will own and operate in the first half of 2020 for Delta under our previously-announced agreement. These additional aircraft and agreements will certainly not be -- would certainly not be possible without a reliable and efficient product. The people of SkyWest have a significant task of executing these deliveries as we work together to deliver quality service onboard of up to 2,500 departures every day. We continue to manage through a changing market for our product. Scope limitations and competitive dynamics have led to a much stronger demand for the older sectors of our fleet. In response to the strong customer demand, we are planning to invest in additional maintenance on our CRJ fleet during the first half of 2020 even beyond what we discussed last quarter. This year represents the start of the next phase of our fleet transition as we increase the new E175 aircraft in our fleet and prepare CRJ fleet for the future. Given the demand we're seeing, we're changing our overall maintenance approach on our CRJ fleet to improve its reliability and performance in the long run. The impact of these changes will drive additional short-term costs in the first half of 2020. However, we anticipate these investments will translate into long-term value for SkyWest and for our customers. All of this makes 2020 a pivot point for us. Given this investment in our fleet, we expect 2020 earnings to be relatively flat with 2019, but this positions us for a new trajectory in 2021 and 2022. We intend to continue leveraging our position in the market to realize the value of the assets within our operational scope. We're also in the fortunate position to be able to convert strong pilot availability into market opportunity and to respond quickly to our partners' need. With our strong team culture, quality product and opportunities, pilot hiring and recruiting is still running well above last year's levels. As we mentioned last quarter, about half of our current hiring is from our existing cadet pipeline, up from about 10% just five years ago. The contract win announced today, combined with the reshaping of our business model last year, reduces our overall enterprise risk and will help us drive the healthy balance of earnings growth and cash flow generation. We remain very focused on sustainable opportunities that position us for long-term success. I want to again thank our great team of aviation professionals for their excellent work during 2019. Rob?\nRob Simmons: Today we reported fourth quarter net income of $73 million compared to $67 million in the fourth quarter last year. Fourth quarter earnings per share is $1.43, up 12% from $1.28 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Pretax income of $98 million for Q4 2019 is up from pretax income of $91 million in Q4 2018. Our diluted share count of 50.8 million is down 3.4% or 1.8 million shares from Q4 last year. Our effective tax rate in Q4 was 25.8%, down slightly from 26% in Q4 2018. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25% for fiscal year 2020. Let me say a couple of things about our balance sheet as of December 31st, 2019. We ended the quarter with cash of $520 million, down from $572 million last quarter. Our CapEx during the fourth quarter was $181 million, including $18 million in cash and $100 million of debt issued to acquire five new E175s. $39 million was spent for spare engines and used airframes and $24 million for other spare parts and maintenance assets. As you recall the last few years, we've invested heavily in growth aircraft for our fleet. In 2018 we spent $1.1 billion in CapEx, driven primarily by the acquisition of 39 new E175s. In 2019 we spent $636 million in CapEx for the full year, including 10 new E175s. Including the acquisition of 16 new E175s in 2020, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million. Debt for the quarter ended at $3 billion, up slightly from last quarter. Including the effect of financing 16 new E175s in 2020 and 10 more in 2021, debt levels should be approximately $3 billion at the end of 2020 and around $2.8 billion by the end of 2021, again depending on additional orders. Just a reminder that all of our debt is financing aircraft and engines and the bulk of our $3 billion in debt is financing our fleet of 156 E175s that are under flying contracts, largely coterminous with the related debt. Beyond 2021, we continue to expect to delever via repayment of $350 million to $400 million in debt each year through the embedded amortization of principal in this mortgage style term debt before any new financings for new aircraft pursuant to any future new orders. We expect strong cash generation over the next couple of years that will allow us to maintain strong liquidity, delever our balance sheet and maintain the agility to respond quickly to any incremental market opportunities. During Q4, we repurchased $10 million of stock under our $250 million program approved by the Board last February. This leaves us $160 million in authorization remaining under this program. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As per our policy and practice, let me say a few things about fiscal year 2020 without giving formal earnings per share guidance. As Chip mentioned earlier, 2020 is the start of the next phase of our ongoing fleet transition. We now expect an extra $15 million in maintenance cost in the first half of 2020 along with $7 million of transition costs, which leads us to expect full year 2020 earnings to be flat to slightly up from 2019. Note that this $15 million is in addition to the $30 million we estimated last quarter. This first-half investment in our CRJ fleet is making 2020 a transition year for the purpose of putting us on a new trajectory for 2021 and 2022. Free cash flow in 2020 will likely be approximately $250 million, similar to 2019 driven by relatively flat levels of EBITDA and CapEx compared to 2019. Free cash flow could be up nicely in 2021 over 2022, depending -- over 2020, depending on aircraft orders. We would expect earnings per share in each quarter of the first half of 2020 to be slightly down from the first half of 2019 due to the investment in the CRJ fleet referenced earlier. The investment to improve operational performance and reliability of our CRJ fleet is in response to stronger customer demand further into the future than we would have originally expected and ongoing scope limitations. We would expect earnings per share growth in the second half of 2020 with the second half up nicely over both the first half of 2020 and the second half of 2019. Our visibility to future cash flows gives us the confidence to continue to make disciplined investments to create shareholder value as market opportunities present themselves. As we continue to demonstrate, when circumstances align we will be ready with a strong and liquid balance sheet to help our partners optimize their scope or consolidate market share. We continue to strive to drive a healthy balance between earnings growth and cash flow. Wade will now give you some details on fleet initiatives, fleet movements and other commercial opportunities. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. Today we announced a new flying contract with American for which we will own and operate 20 new E175s under a 10-year contract. We anticipate delivery of 10 of those aircraft late this year and the remaining 10 during the first half of next year. We anticipate financing all of the aircraft through long-term debt. As we announced last August, we have an agreement with Delta to operate six used E175s under a multi-year contract, scheduled to begin in the first part of this year. The aircraft are financed by Delta and will be sourced from a regional operator transitioning out of Delta Connection. As part of the same announcement SkyWest agreed to purchase and operate seven new E175s for Delta instead of SkyWest operating seven new CRJ900s that were to be financed by Delta and scheduled for delivery this year. To summarize, our E175 and our CRJ900 delivery streams we are scheduled to take delivery of one more Delta owned CRJ900 in the second quarter of this year which will conclude our delivery stream for the fleet at 13 aircraft. We took delivery of five new E175s for Delta during Q4. We are scheduled to take delivery of four new and six used E175s in the first half of this year. During the second half of the year, we are scheduled to take delivery of 12 new E175s with the final 10 E175s for American scheduled for 2021. This will bring our total E175 fleet to 188 by the middle of 2021. Let me talk about our CRJ700s and our American partnership. As previously discussed, we announced an agreement to add 10 additional CRJ700s to that contract. We anticipate these aircraft being placed into our American system throughout this year. This will bring our fleet total to 70 CRJ700s under long-term contracts. As Rob mentioned, demand for our CRJ flying remains very strong and as a result of that strong customer demand, we anticipate investing in our CRJ fleet during the first half of 2020 to improve reliability and customer experience. As Chip mentioned, while these changes will drive additional short-term cost for the first half of 2020, we anticipate this investment to show an attractive return over the long term as we -- as it will allow us to work with our major partners on further contract extensions. We are also expecting to incur approximately $7 million in the first half of the year on fleet transition expense. These expenses include aircraft out of service time, pilot training, bringing used aircraft on our certificate and transitioning aircraft to different partners. Let me shift gears to our leasing business where we continued to leverage opportunity. This quarter we delivered six additional CRJ700s under our previously-announced agreement with a domestic third party bringing the delivery count to 10 of the 29 aircraft. These aircraft are under a 10-year lease agreement and we anticipate the remaining aircraft will be delivered through the middle of this year. As we communicated previously, the majority of these aircraft will be sourced from the 30 CRJ700s from our previous ExpressJet operation. Additionally, we have delivered all five CRJ900s leased by Air Canada under a six-year lease agreement. We have also agreed to purchase seven used CRJ700s from a third party. At year-end we had closed on two of the seven aircraft. We anticipate utilizing these aircraft through a combination of operating the aircraft for other partners and leasing the aircraft to a third party. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we invested $39 million in spare engines and used airframes which will be used to support our fleet this year. The engines will be used to help fund the 40 CF34-3 engines we will lease to Delta with an anticipated five-year term. This is in addition to the eight CF34-8 engines already under lease with Delta. We expect the deliveries on the 40 engines to begin late this year through mid-2021. As I've discussed, we continue to utilize our flexible fleet and platform for profitable opportunities, leveraging the unique position, we've built over the past several years to enhance our model and to minimize risk. We anticipate ongoing execution of these agreements will help ensure we're well positioned for 2021 and beyond. Okay. Operator, we're ready for our Q&A now.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon. I just had a quick question. In the past you've talked about the duration of the contract. I think you mentioned something like 80% going through the end of 2020. I wonder if you can provide an update on just how many of your CPAs like contract go through maybe kind of '21-'22 time periods.\nWade Steel: Yes, Savi, this is Wade. I'll kind of break it into two groups here. Our E175 aircraft, they all are under very long-term agreements. As we said the American agreement is a 10-year agreement that we just announced today. The other one still have seven to eight years -- seven to eight, nine years left on them. The CRJ fleet, we've recently just extended the vast majority of those. There are still pockets of CRJ that will expire at the end of this year and then some of them in 2021 and 2022. And we're currently working with our major partners on their needs in the demand for those aircraft.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And then I am guessing the CRJ200s are just on short-term basis.\nWade Steel: The CRJ200s is what I was referring to. Yeah. Those are -- there are some that expire towards the end of this year and then some in 2021 and some in 2022.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And then, just curious on the prorate side, you have much connections that go beyond kind of domestic. Just wondering with all the -- some of the international news if there is any exposure there on the prorate side?\nWade Steel: Yes, Savi, this is Wade again. Our pro rate network is a 100% domestic. There is no international and the connectivity internationally to China, I think is what you're referring to is very, very, very minimal.\nSavi Syth: Yeah, makes sense. And if I might ask just one more question, the raw completion factor, it was down year-over-year. Just curious in this last quarter, I'm guessing that's kind of weather related. Curious does that have a meaningful impact on earnings or is it really the kind of a controllable completion factor that drives earnings?\nWade Steel: Savi, this is Wade again. Yeah, the completion factor is down slightly year-over-year and the -- and all of that is due to weather and ATC type issues. There is always a little bit of friction when you don't complete the flight but all of our incentives are based on adjusted completion. And so it has an impact, a lot of it can be mitigated through the contracts and through our labor groups, but there is some small friction there.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMike Linenberg: Oh, yeah. Hey, everyone. Just a couple here. When we look at just your revenue lines and just the growth in this airport customer service and other, I guess, presumably the leasing pieces in there as well, and so I'm not sure if you can give us maybe some breakout there or will you get to a point where you will start breaking that out? I'm not sure what the -- what materiality is, what as a percent of total revenue, which forces you or maybe requires you to do that. Thanks.\nRob Simmons: So look, I think, Mike, on the way that our P&L is structured, airport customer service and other, the bulk of that is going through some mix changes as our model is changing and evolving. And I think we'll consider additional breakouts. But at this point, I think that we're happy with how we've got that structured.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. And then the E175s that are going to American, are those all 76 seaters with, I guess, there are three Class airplanes?\nWade Steel: Yeah, Mike, this is Wade. Yeah, they're all 76-seat aircraft, yeah, three-class consistent with how the rest of the industry is doing it.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. And then just last on the -- on the prorate business, how -- what percent does prorate represent, I guess maybe for 2019, if you could give me a rough number what it represented and how did it perform maybe versus 2018 overall profitability? Thanks. Thanks for answering my questions.\nRob Simmons: Yeah, Mike, it's Rob here. So our prorate is about 13% of our business, still very consistent with what it's been. And again I think our focus has been and will remain on the contract side of our business. And so I think it's probably fair to expect prorate sort of in the same range that you've seen at cargo in the last couple of years.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Very good. Thanks. Thanks to everyone.\nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Just with respect to the incremental investment that you're calling out here, can you just go into more detail what is driving that and what caused you to not have your arms around that late last year?\nRob Simmons: Yeah, thanks. I think that as you look at what we're talking about is an incremental $15 million over what we signaled last quarter. And I think as we've just gone through, we've identified sort of incremental opportunities and I think it makes sense for us to do -- to make these investments in the short term that will help position us for better growth and better profitability in the future. I think this is a story about we're really taking two quarters to make this investment in Q1 and Q2 of 2020, and then we start to see the returns on that investment in the second half of the year, I mean right away. And obviously this positions us for a better growth story in 2021 and 2022. With respect to the incremental transition costs, as Wade mentioned, there's just a lot of moving parts this year, a lot of movement between partners. There will be some out of service time as we bring in new airplanes moving around. There is some pilot training incremental cost, some cost of bringing new aircraft on to our certificate. So there is just a bit of friction during this year. But all of this is great stuff. All of this is really exciting for us as we look to 2021 and 2022.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you. And then as we think about kind of the leverage points of earnings growth into next year, obviously you have the contribution of these incremental 20 E175s. Is it fair for us to think that you'll get all of this kind of $45 million back next year, or will there be other sort of growth investments that you need to make? And any other kind of leverage points into 2021 that you would care to highlight? Thanks.\nRob Simmons: The investment -- the investment in that maintenance is -- it's largely a one-time event for the first half that we will start to see the return on that investment, as I mentioned right away in the second half of the year. We expect that the second half of 2020 to show nice growth over the second half of 2019, as well as just over the first half, obviously, where the first half has the bulk of that investment.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And anything else you'd care to comment on earnings growth drivers into 2021?\nRob Simmons: Well, I think just the point that we've got a lot of interesting conversations going on with our partners. I think you've hit on it that the bulk of that -- the new airplanes with American that we'll be bringing in will be in the latter part of the year. So we won't see a full-year effect of those until next year. And then obviously with 10 more coming in 2021 we've got that virtuous cycle as we continue to have the full-year effect, pushing growth on the following year after delivery.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoyce Koltisko: Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Joyce on for Cathy. Just a question on the contract that you have with your major airline partners. I'm guessing you guys guarantee a minimum amount of block hours every year, but correct me if I'm wrong. And I was just wondering just over the last couple of years, what the average block hours you have actually sold versus the minimum and it is typically right in line with the minimum or maybe 10% or trying 20% higher than that?\nWade Steel: Yeah, Joyce, this is Wade. That's a very good question. So most of our contracts do have contractual minimums. We are well in excess of those contract minimums. SkyWest has typically flown these aircraft very hard. A lot of utilization in them. We're at least 10% to 15% above the contractual minimums in all fleets and it's been able to add a lot of value to us and our major partners.\nJoyce Koltisko: Okay, that's really interesting. Thank you. And then just another question on costs. Just given that none of your labor force is represented by union following the divestiture of ExpressJet. Just how should we think about step-ups in labor costs? Is that fairly ratable or are there typically larger raises every couple of years? Any thoughts on that?\nChip Childs: Yeah, this is, Chip. Thanks for the question. So the way it works at SkyWest we've got some of the best aviation professionals in the entire world. We do have -- continue to have collectively bargained agreements within our work groups that we have at SkyWest. And so these are very, very consistent with what you see within the industry and our philosophy is that in order for our business model to be successful we want to hire the best. We're going to do the very best we can to take the best care of our employees, compared to what our competition does. And in turn that model has returned a very, very good return for all the stakeholders involved, at SkyWest, both shareholders as well as the employees and customers. So the way I would think about it, I would say it's pretty traditional within the airline industry, in fact quite traditional, the same, but we are not entirely shy about the fact that we want the best professionals working at SkyWest. We do have them and we do all we can within our model to take better care of them than anybody else could. So I think that's basically the summary.\nJoyce Koltisko: Absolutely. It seems like a pretty strong pipeline sale. I guess, just a quick follow-up to that then. Are there other areas of cost inflation over the next couple of years that we should be thinking about that could potentially impact margins on the contracts that you or is that all?\nChip Childs: I think -- again this is Chip, I think philosophically, when we take a look at our CRJ fleet, as we've talked about in our script, as -- the philosophy behind the investments that we're making in maintenance on our CRJ fleet is just simply the fact that today performance is more paramount than it ever has been. So although we will potentially have some costs creep relative to that reliability, the overall value that we see within our fleet, particularly the older fleet with scope restriction in the competitive landscape is driving a tremendous amount of value and return for our shareholders and our people. So it's more not that we missed something, it's more that we're seeing something and we're seeing some good opportunity and are moving that particular fleet into a more proactive help maintenance system and from that perspective, I don't know that the costs associated with that are going to eat into the overall return in the long term.\nJoyce Koltisko: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Bert Subin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBert Subin: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for the time.\nChip Childs: Hey, Bert.\nBert Subin: So today's contract announcement with American highlights that your mainline partners are still looking to the independent market for regional flying. How are you positioning your business to compete against, I guess at one end the low cost independents, and then at the other spectrum the wholly-owns?\nChip Childs: This is Chip. Thanks for the question, it's a very good question. Part of what our strategy is with all of this is to stay very close and in good contact with our partners and what they want. And so all of our business model that we've developed over the last five to six years has been in conjunction with them. Like I just answered on the previous question, performance is paramount and I think that's a differentiating factor. We have a very good performance on our 175. Like I said previously, we want to significantly increase the long-term performance of our CRJ fleet. So from the wholly-owned perspective and for the lower-cost elements we just -- I -- with the wholly-owned perspective, we work with our partners and we're team working with them on ways in which we can provide value to their overall Express or Connect product. On the other end of the dynamics who we compete with, to be candid, where we have a completely different philosophy. We have a completely different business model. We find that when we focus primarily on performance and value and flexibility and deliver exactly what our partners want that enables us to do some things to make sure that we have pilots, mechanics, flight attendants, the very best there is. And the carrier to them that they don't have to worry about to say that they know is the solid section of their Express or Connection portfolio, and that's what we drive to do, and we still see a very bright future and growth within that philosophy that we have.\nBert Subin: Yeah, that's helpful, thanks. Just as a quick follow-up, you talked a lot about sort of this pent-up demand for CRJs. Is that just being driven by scope limitations or is there something else there, just demand for smaller jets?\nChip Childs: I think it's probably both, but primarily the scope limitation. One is putting a lot of pressure on being able to fly 50-seaters. And our philosophy and approach is going to be that we -- that's what we have today. We believe that these investments are going to continue to add long-term sustainable performance on the CRJ200 fleet. As we look at that fleet differently and if in fact something does change relative to scope for demand, we have the aviation professionals. We have a broad base of fleet that we can tap into and plenty of capital to pivot in a different direction if need be, but we stay very astute on all of those opportunities.\nBert Subin: Great, thanks for the time.\nOperator: The next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hey guys. It's actually Conor. Just a couple of questions. On the -- I mean, there continues to be a lot of fleet movement. This may not be as relevant as it has been in the past, but just curious if you have any idle aircraft that are not under CPA or pro-rate or being leased out currently. And then I think you kind of answered this, but in terms of utilization on the pro-rate business, has that increased with the Max being out at all? Curious, your thoughts there. Thanks.\nWade Steel: Yes. So Conor, this is Wade. So the first question just on the idle aircraft, so the last couple of years we've been transitioning a lot of airplanes. There are still airplanes in transition. As we talked about some of those transition costs there -- one of the frictions that we are facing is still transitioning airplanes from different partners into our leasing business, all of that. So there are still some of that and we are still going to face some of that in Q1 and Q2. As far as -- so there will be the transition. But overall, we have the vast, vast, vast majority of our entire fleet committed. It's just it's in a transition phase. The second question was on pro rate and the Max. Our pro rate business, these are smaller markets that the Max is not serving. Our pro rate business will just -- it's a very niche market and we're going to continue to serve those. We really haven't increased our utilization because of that. It's something that these smaller communities there is good demand, and we continue to serve those, but we haven't done anything different due to the Max groundings.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, great. And then just on the $45 million in maintenance investment. I know you talked a bit about it already, but just curious if you could break down maybe like what actually falls in the first quarter versus second like it can be -- obviously can be somewhat lumpy, just curious if any thoughts there?\nWade Steel: Yeah, Conor, what I can tell you is that again compared to first quarter of the year ago, both first quarter and second quarter will be down by a little bit and then come back in second half we will have growth over first half as well as growth over the prior year second half. So it's -- we don't have exact timing for you, but it's largely a first-half event. And again it's helping us put our fleet in a place where we can start to see a return on that investment right away.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then just on the actual investment, is it across the entire fleet or is it just a pocket of aircraft, and if so, how many?\nWade Steel: Well, it's about the older sectors of our fleet, the CRJ fleet, both 200s and 700s.\nConor Cunningham: But there is no -- is it across all of them, or is there a certain number? If it's across all of them, it's not a big deal.\nWade Steel: Yeah, I would say this. I would say that there is some things that we've been doing with a certain portion of the fleet, very small fleet, relative to what we wanted to accomplish with performance. But I would say, largely, it's pretty much the bulk of them that we're trying to get through various programs by summer time.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, great. And then just one quick one. On the American contract, I assume the financing is kind of how you've done in the past, 15% cash, 85% debt financed. Is that correct?\nWade Steel: That's correct.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Schoenhaus with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Schoenhaus: Hey, guys. So this is just a follow-up on the last question. You have roughly $520 million cash on the balance sheet. I know you align the debt with the contract and you have -- you want liquidity to meet customers' needs. But just thinking about how you're thinking about near-term opportunities to use this cash, is it to acquire these used CRJ700s for the previous American contract? Is it something else? Is it continuing to buy back shares? Just help me to walk through like your near-term opportunities with the cash on the balance sheet.\nRob Simmons: Yeah. Thanks, Scott. So I think it's really all of above. Obviously it's very important that we have a good strong and liquid balance sheet. I think as we've indicated, part of our cash flow over the next couple of years will be to continue to delever a bit. Our leverage has dropped pretty significantly over the last couple of years as we expected it to. But the cash on the balance sheet -- our favorite use of cash is obviously to find accretive ways to put it to work with various investments in our fleet. But we also are very committed to returning capital to shareholders as again we have good visibility to cash flow in the future where we've got an active share repurchase program. We've got a dividend that we've grown consistently over the last five years. So the answer to your question is really all of the above. We intend to use the cash on our balance sheet to create shareholder value in a variety of ways but always within the context that our favorite use of capital is to find accretive uses for that to invest in our fleet.\nScott Schoenhaus: Great, thanks Rob. And a follow-up, how is the leasing market for you guys whether it be spare parts or airframes engines? I know it's been a great market for you guys in the past. Just wanted to get a sense of the pipeline there, particularly with the opportunity you will have by the end of the year with the eight CRJ700s and four CRJ900s freed up.\nWade Steel: Yeah, this is Wade. So the leasing has been -- it's been a very opportunistic thing for us, right. As aircraft have become available, we've worked with several different parties and being able to buy some very good homes and it's allowed us to re-fleet and bring in new aircraft into our fleet. The real high demand area that we -- that we are focusing very much in is the engine leasing, right. The opportunities there are very good. And we've got very good opportunity to continue to grow that business and continue to leverage our platform. Our relationship with our OEM partner on that as well. And so that's the area that there is a very high demand and that's the area that we are really focusing in.\nScott Schoenhaus: Great, thanks Wade. I'll hop back in the queue.\nOperator: The next question is a follow-up from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, two follow-ups, just on the -- I think it was Bert who was asking on kind of your relative positioning and I was just kind of curious as you look at it, it feels like today the way the marketplace is, and it\u2019s kind of dynamics -- it favors to be a bigger supplier and partner just from sourcing pilots, mechanics and things like that. So Chip, I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about what might be different in this industry and if that is the right conclusion to say that it helps to be bigger in the current environment?\nChip Childs: Yeah, Savi, that's a very good question and technically speaking the size is always one that we kind of consider the advantages in that. I can tell you right now that we always evaluate how big we want the fleet to be, we evaluate the type of fleet we want to fly and we get all sorts of question, is there any other partners you are considering and those types of things. Just philosophically I would kind of step back and put us back on the center line. We really do think that there is good opportunities with these four partnerships we have, they are outstanding partners. They have tremendous operating credibility and one that which enables us to have our culture continue to grow as well. From a growth perspective and how we do that, I think that we've always asked that over the last five or six years, what we want the fleet to look like. All of those things are more about where our position is for opportunities. Sometimes we like to plan five years out, but most of the time we like to focus on what we can do today that is just going to continue to give us opportunities in the future. And the more disciplined we are today and the things that we can do culturally and with our balance sheet and with all these relationships gives us opportunity down the road. And we don't always take every single opportunity that's given to us. Many times we have conversation with major partners and we actually say it would be better for somebody else to serve them in certain types of capacities. But the nucleus of everything that we do relative to this is we first go to our people and take a look at how strong our recruiting is and take a look at the ability for us to train and take care of our people safely. That's the first priority. Secondly, we go to our partners and make sure that we are delivering the product and we have the things we have to deliver our product to them. And as you go through that entire circle, we are very, very comfortable with our cost structure, how we're investing in our people, how we're preserving capital for future opportunities and how we are being open and candid and opportunistic with our major partners. So that having been said, it probably is not the perfect answer to your question about, do we want to get bigger and are there advantages to that. I think that there are advantages to organic growth, and we're going to continue to provide what we believe is some very good dialog with all four of our partners. That's a good baseline for us is that we are having good conversations still with all four of our partners on meeting their needs with additional organic growth at SkyWest Airlines. That having been said, we're not -- we don't jump on anything we can find. We have to be strategic and disciplined about all of it. But we are genuinely -- I would say this Savi we are genuinely as happy and as optimistic with the position that we're in, with all three of those things I've discussed as well as the conversations that we're having for continued strong future.\nSavi Syth: Now that makes sense. Thank you. And if I might, quickly just a clarification, Wade. Am I correct in assuming that you have about 68 CRJ700s with American today and that will get to 70 with some of these transitioning in and some transitioning it out, is that correct?\nWade Steel: Savi, this is Wade. Yeah, so we are a little bit less actually flying today. Some of them are in the process of transitioning from one partner to another. That's some of the friction that we were talking about. But by the end of the year, you are correct, we will have 70 in by the end of the year. So there still is some of that transition expense, some of that transition work that's being done right now to get those all up in service.\nSavi Syth: All right, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chip Childs for any closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Yes, thank you. Thanks everyone for your interest in SkyWest. We appreciate your spending time with us to understand our model and the opportunities, which we have going forward. Again, we appreciate your interest and we will talk to you again next quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represents our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2018 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. Third quarter build on a strong first half of 2019 as we continue to monetize our fleet initiatives and move forward as a single airline with a more efficient footprint. Third quarter is often seasonally the busiest of the year in terms of departures and this here reflects those results. Our employees just did a remarkable job delivering a solid 99.9% adjusted completion for the quarter and continuing to improve our on-time performance. I want to thank our nearly 14,000 employees for their efforts to work together and deliver a great product for our customers. We continue to prepare for and execute on three contract wins we announced in July and August. 10 used CRJ700s going into flying contract with American beginning in early 2020. Seven new E175s for Delta starting in Q4 and six used E175s going into contract starting in early 2020. These deals along with other progress that we have made recently set us up for growth in future years and illustrate our ability to unlock growth opportunities within our partners existing scope limitations, while also making market share gains. None of this would be possible without our ability to consistently deliver a reliable and efficient product. The people of SkyWest continue working together to ensure we remain agile and responsive to our customers\u2019 needs and are focused on delivering quality service onboard more than 2,200 daily departures, providing a seamless product for our four partners and customers is something our people do better than any other carrier. We continue to manage through a changing market for our product. Scope limitations and competitive dynamics have led to much stronger demand for the older sectors of our fleet further into the future than we previously expected. In response to this strong customer demand, we are planing to invest in our CRJ fleet during the first half of 2020 designed to improve the operational performance reliability of our older fleet. Even with this investment, we expect to continue earnings growth in 2020, but we will be set up for an even stronger 2021 and 2022. Rob will give more details on that in a minute. We intend to continue leveraging our position in the market to realize the value of the assets within our operational scope. We are also in the fortunate position to be able to convert strong pilot availability into market opportunity and to respond quickly to our partners\u2019 needs. With our strong team culture, quality product and opportunities, pilot hiring and recruiting is still running more than 20% above last year\u2019s levels. As mentioned last quarter, about half the current hiring is from our existing pipeline, up from 10% of that pipeline just five years ago. This is another risk area that we reduced meaningfully over the last year. Our recent contract wins combined with reshaping our business model earlier this year reduces our overall enterprise risk and will help us drive a healthy balance of earnings growth and cash flow generation. We remain very focused on sustainable opportunities that position us for long-term success. I want to again thank our great team of aviation professionals for their excellent work during the third quarter. Rob?\nRob Simmons: Today, we reported third quarter net income $91 million compared to $83 million in the third quarter last year. Third quarter earnings per share is $1.79, up 14% from $1.57 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Pretax income of $119 million for Q3 is up from pretax income of $110 million in Q3 2018. Our diluted share count of 51.1 million is down 3.5%, or 1.8 million, shares from Q3 last year. Our effective tax rate in Q3 was 23%, down slightly from 24% in Q3 2018. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25% for Q4 of 2019 and for fiscal 2020. Let me say a couple of things about our balance sheet as of September 30, 2019. We ended the quarter with cash of $572 million, up from $550 million last quarter. Primary uses of cash in the quarter included $25 million for share repurchases; $102 million in CapEx, including $30 million to acquire four CRJ900s off leased early; $39 million for spare engines and $33 million for other spare parts and maintenance assets. Debt for the quarter ended at $3 billion, down slightly from $3.1 billion last quarter. Let me say a few things about capital expenditures. As you recall, the last few years, we have invested heavily in growth aircraft for our fleet. In 2018, we spent $1.1 billion in CapEx, driven primarily by the acquisition of 39 new E175s. In 2019, we expect to deploy approximately $670 million in CapEx for the full year. Absent any additional new aircraft orders, we would expect 2020 CapEx to be in the $300 million to $400 million range, a key driver in what could be a doubling in 2020 free cash flow over 2019. We expect that by the end of 2019, debt levels will continue to come down to under $3 billion and could be under $2 billion by the end of 2022, again, depending on additional orders. Just a reminder that all of our debt is financing aircraft, and the bulk of our $3 billion in debt is financing our fleet of 151 E175s that are under flying contracts largely coterminous with the related debt. We continue to expect to delever via repayment of $350 million in debt each year through the embedded amortization of principal in its mortgage-style term debt before any new financings for new aircraft pursuant to future new orders, if any. We expect strong cash generation over the next couple of years that will allow us to maintain strong liquidity, delever our balance sheet and maintain the agility to respond quickly to any incremental market opportunities. During Q3, we repurchased $25 million in stock under our $250 million program approved by the Board in February. This leaves us $170 million in authorization remaining under this program. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As per our policy and practice, let me say a few things about Q4 and fiscal 2020 without giving formal EPS guidance. As usual, we would expect to see the normal seasonal falloff in Q4 2019, from Q2 and Q3 earnings levels that cover the strong summer season. For fiscal 2020, we would expect to see mid-to-high single digit growth in earnings per share over 2019. Free cash flow in 2020 could double from 2019 levels driven by growth in EBITDA and slower CapEx spend. We would expect earnings per share in the first half of 2020 to be flat to slightly up from the first half of 2019 due to the investment in the older part of the fleet referenced by Chip earlier. This $30 million investment to improve operational performance and reliability of our CRJ fleet is in response to stronger customer demand, further into the future than we would have originally expected and ongoing scope limitations. We would expect stronger EPS growth in the second half of 2020, leading to mid-to-high single digit growth in earnings per share for fiscal 2020 over fiscal 2019. Investing this $30 million in fleet maintenance in the first half of 2020 sets us up better for 2021 and 2022 than would have otherwise been the case. Upside to this scenario is possible from additional orders of new aircraft, additional market share wins, additional fleet extensions and incremental leasing opportunities. Our visibility to future cash flow gives us the confidence to continue to make disciplined investments to create shareholder value. As we continue to demonstrate when and if new investment opportunities come, we will be ready with a strong and liquid balance sheet. This future capital deployment could include organic growth opportunities in contract flying, prorate flying or leasing. In addition to organic growth opportunities, of course, we will continue to look at returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. As Chip mentioned, we are striving to drive a healthy balance between earnings growth and cash flow. Wade will now give you some details on fleet initiatives, fleet movements and other commercial opportunities. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. As we announced in August, we have an agreement with Delta to operate six used E175s under a multiyear contract scheduled to begin in the early 2020. The aircraft are financed by Delta and will be sourced from a regional operator transitioning out of Delta connection. Also announced in August, SkyWest has agreed to purchase and operate seven new E175s for Delta, instead of SkyWest operating seven new CRJ900s that were to be financed by Delta and scheduled for delivery in 2020. To summarize our aircraft delivery stream, we received one new CRJ900 during the third quarter for Delta. We are scheduled to take delivery of one more CRJ900 next year. This will conclude our delivery stream for the new CRJ900s at 13 aircrafts. These CRJ900s are owned and financed by Delta. We are also scheduled to take delivery of five new E175s for Delta during Q4, six new E175s in the first half of 2020 and six used E175s by mid-2020. This will bring our total E175 fleet to 168 by the end of next year. Let me talk about our American partnership. As discussed last quarter, we announced an agreement to add 10 additional CRJ700s to that contract. We anticipate these aircraft being placed into our American system throughout 2020. This will bring our fleet total to 70 CRJ700s under long-term contracts. Demand for our small RJ flying remains very strong. And as a result of the strong customer demand, we anticipate investing approximately $30 million in this fleet during the first half of 2020 to improve its reliability and customer experience. This investment should show an attractive return as it will allow us to work with our major partners on further contract extensions and to continue to grow our prorate business. Let me shift gears to our leasing business, where we continue to leverage opportunity. This quarter, we delivered four additional CRJ700s under our previously announced agreement with a domestic third party, bringing that delivery count to five of the 29 aircraft. These aircraft are under a 10-year lease agreement, and we anticipate the remaining aircraft will be delivered through the middle of next year. Also we communicated previously, the majority of these aircrafts will be sourced from the 30 CRJ700s from our previous ExpressJet operation. We have also delivered four of five CRJ900s leased to Air Canada under a six-year lease agreement. We anticipate the remaining aircraft will be delivered by the end of this year. During Q3 2019, we acquired four CRJ900s under an early lease buyout. These four aircraft are scheduled to expire under our agreement with Delta in 2020. We have also agreed to purchase seven used CRJ700s from a third party. We anticipate utilizing these 11 aircraft through a combination of operating the aircraft for our partners and leasing the aircraft or engines to a third party. Finally, during the third quarter, we invested $39 million in spare engines, which will be used to support our fleet in 2020. The engines will then be used to help fund the 40 CF34-3 engines we will lease to Delta with an anticipated five-year term. This is an addition to the 13 CF34-8 engines already under lease with Delta. We expect the delivery of the 40 engines to begin late next year through mid-2021. As I\u2019ve discussed, we continue to utilize our flexible fleet and platform for profitable opportunities, leveraging the unique position we\u2019ve built over the past several years to enhance our model and minimize risk. We anticipate ongoing execution of these agreements will help ensure we\u2019re well positioned for 2020 and beyond.\nChip Childs: Okay. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A session now.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steve O\u2019Hara with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.\nChip Childs: Hey Steve.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Hi. I guess first just on the moves of the aircraft and the commitments for this year and next. You all own the ones that you\u2019re taking this year in terms of E175s but not own the ones that are coming next year. Is that correct?\nWade Steel: Steve, this is Wade. So we will take delivery of five new E175s for Delta during the Q4 of 2019, and we will own those. There will also be six new E175s in the first half of 2020, that we will also own those. There are six used E175s that Delta has financed that we\u2019re operating for another Delta connection carrier. Now they will transition over to us that we will not own. And so those \u2013 that\u2019s how the stream goes.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the kind of the commentary about first half of 2020 and expectations around the earnings growth. So first half versus second half, I think, the comment was around the CRJs and maintenance into those aircraft. And I guess, I\u2019m just wondering is this capitalized maintenance or does it run through the expense line? And is it \u2013 how much of the \u2013 let\u2019s say, flat to up slightly in the first half is due to that? Or maybe just continued building pilots and things like that for the flying that you\u2019re taking on as well? Thank you.\nRob Simmons: Yes. Thanks, Steve. The $30 million in the first half is the expense component of that, that will run through the P&L. And as a result of that and other seasonal factors and what not, we would expect, again, like we said, the first half of 2020 to look a lot like the first half of 2019 in terms of EPS. But then the second half of 2020, the growth picks up as a result of lower investment, obviously, in the fleet as well as the deliveries that Wade outlined already that will be coming into service in the first half of 2020.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. And then maybe just lastly, I think, the commentary was that based on what you\u2019re looking at right now, it seems like 2021 and 2022 would see better earnings growth than 2020. Is that \u2013 was that the comment that was made?\nRob Simmons: Yes, the comment was that \u2013 I think some of the things we\u2019ll be doing in 2020 will set us up nicely for 2021 and 2020, without getting into any specifics, which we\u2019ll, obviously, do a year from now. But I think that the message was that the investments that we plan to make this year will set up us up very nicely for 2021.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. On the 700s that you\u2019re leasing out that are going to be transformed into CRJ550s. Is that universe of 29, the total amount? Or could it be bigger than that? And is there any chance that you\u2019d be operating them at some point down the road?\nWade Steel: Yes, Duane. This is Wade. Right now, we currently have 29 aircraft under commitment to lease to that third party that\u2019s going to fly them in a 550. We have additional CRJ700s in our fleet. We have very good conversations with all of our partners around the demand for those. I said in my script the demand for the small CRJ aircraft is extremely strong right now, and we\u2019re having very good conversations with everyone around that. So we\u2019re definitely working with all of our partners on the best use of those aircraft.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: In a word, why aren\u2019t you operating this first round? Was it just a function of economics, or do you want to see the fleet type proven out? Why isn\u2019t SkyWest operating those?\nChip Childs: Duane, It\u2019s Chip. I think you just answered the question a little bit just in your two comments there. From our perspective, when you look at what our block hours are doing, and what we\u2019re doing with the E175 fleet, right now, I would \u2013 I mean, I think the underlying term is our plate is full. And from our perspective, this worked out extremely well for us as an enterprise to be able to do this. Your first question is, is there ever a chance that we may fly these 550s or any 550s? I think Wade answered that question really well. We\u2019re probably the largest operator of CRJ700s in the world, and we know how to do it really well. And so \u2013 look, I think the overall point here is that we have a business model where through leasing and the operation of these aircraft, we can focus on some of the things that we want to that best add value to our partners as well as our shareholders and balancing those components is something that we spend a lot of time making sure we do the right way.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Leave it there, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon.\nChip Childs: Hi, Savi.\nSavi Syth: Hey. Just clarification on that $30 million investment. Is that for the CRJ200 fleet or also the kind of the 200s and 700s? And just curious if that just about extending the life of the aircraft, or is there kind of you are doing more interior adjustments as well, and just how much of the life of the aircraft gets extended with this investment?\nWade Steel: Yes, Savi. This is Wade. So the $30 million is \u2013 I said in my script, it was for the small RJ fleet, which would include both the CRJ700s and the CRJ200s. We\u2019re going through both a reliability campaign, and then also we\u2019re going to make some changes to the interior of the aircraft as well to enhance the customer experience. So it\u2019s going to be a combination of these. We\u2019ve been doing events to extend the life of the CRJ200 for the last couple of years. We will continue to do that. The aircraft is \u2013 we\u2019re just continuing to invest in the aircraft. So it continue to \u2013 it can go for the foreseeable future.\nSavi Syth: If I\u2019m guessing this CRJ200, are they \u2013 is that like 10 years left in the life of the aircraft on average?\nWade Steel: The airplane, itself, right now, we could \u2013 in our fleet plans, we definitely see that going out there for another seven, eight years. It still has a good run in front of it. We don\u2019t think that it\u2019s anything immediately going away for sure. It will continue to invest in it, and we\u2019ll monitor scope and see what our fleet will look like in the future. But the airplane can go for a nice run and still in front of us.\nChip Childs: Yes, Savi. This is Chip. Just to add to what Wade has said, I think, to a certain extent, we didn\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to be flying CRJ200s this long. I think, certainly, when we bought them \u2013 started buying them back in 1994, we didn\u2019t know that we were. But the way the world works is that the demand for this product is extremely good. And our folks along with the people and the engineers that we work with, like Wade said, this product can continue to operate for quite a while, and we\u2019re going to continue to monitor demand and scope and all the things. But given the economics of this thing, we\u2019re willing to do a lot to keep it in the system and being able to provide great service to our customers.\nSavi Syth: That make sense. And if I might add, I realize this is kind of a smaller segment but since it\u2019s some of your own business. I wonder if you can provide some color on what you\u2019re seeing on the leasing side, and I know you\u2019re focusing on the kind of the equipment that you\u2019d understand well. Just kind of what is the biggest driver? Is it kind of demand and yield on that side and generally your outlook for that business like next two to three years?\nChip Childs: Well, I think Savi, we\u2019ve kind of set this up where what started this was a different approach to financing aircraft compared to what we\u2019ve done in the past. As we transformed our business model and as we candidly did some things through the sale of Express that we\u2019ve ended up with a lot of assets and extra assets that we\u2019ve been able to monetize through leasing. And on a go-forward basis, if we evaluate this, there\u2019s something to be said about our business model where we\u2019re the largest operator of the Bombardier product. We\u2019re becoming one of the biggest in the Embraer aerospace now as well, and we have good capital. We have good credibility within the marketplace, and we love the flexibility that it gives us relative to returning a good return to our shareholders and taking care of our people, being able to go and have some flexibility back and forth with this. Again we\u2019ve always said that this leasing model is only going to be within our existing platforms that we can operate. We\u2019re not going go outside of that. But being the largest regional carrier in the world with a fair amount of assets as well, this is just strategically taking care of our people yet also finding ways to deliver a very good return for our shareholders and these two business models work pretty well with each other in order to do that.\nSavi Syth: Is it being driven by just strong demand for the aircraft type too? Or why doing it now versus maybe five years ago, I guess, maybe another way to ask it?\nChip Childs: Five years ago, when we actually decided to change our approach in financing aircraft. And five years ago is when we started to really have to make some tough decisions on assets relative to ExpressJet. I think the decision back \u2013 long ago, we used to do leverage leases all over the place, and quite candidly, it didn\u2019t really help us be cost competitive and deliver the right return to our shareholders. What this also does in this other approach of owning assets and even having flexibility to lease them is also, like I said, not just being able to take care of our people but also being able to work well within our partners. Our partners have a unique set of needs by their capital structures as well and relative to what we do with engines and aircraft and all of the things, particularly as Wade has announced with Delta, we\u2019re in the business now providing value to our partners by more than just being the best operator in the industry. And from our perspective, that\u2019s a huge competitive advantage, and we can take our capital, apply to our partner\u2019s model and help them with multitude of their business need. And that\u2019s kind of strategically, I think, our partners are getting that. And that\u2019s why it has seen more success now than it has in the past. But part of what our job is, is to be able to bring that type of creativity to our partners and see what we continue to help capitalize on our relationship and help their business model as well.\nSavi Syth: Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey everybody. I guess this is a question to both Chip and Wade. I just I want to clarify the way you answered Duane\u2019s question, and then you went on to answer Savi\u2019s question. I guess one could connect the dots, and reasonably conclude that maybe you were planning to reconfigure some CRJ700s into 550 sometime next year. Is that \u2013 you weren\u2019t saying that. Is that the case?\nChip Childs: No. We are not saying that. No.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, okay. Because you talked about enhancement, improvement, and your little color around that. So, okay. Okay, so that helps that. You have that large order out there for either the MRJ90, and I\u2019m just curious whether or not you have the rights to swap into the MRJ100, the space jet. And I\u2019m curious about your thinking around that airplane. I realize that maybe that\u2019s not coming until 2021, maybe 2022. But with basically Bombardier out of the regional jet business, thoughts on that airplane. And whether or not that would make sense. But I guess we have to start with swap rights first.\nChip Childs: Yes, Michael. Great question. I\u2019d probably tilt back from the question candidly just a little bit, just because of the elements that are happening within Mitsubishi and Bombardier, quite candidly, we\u2019ve got a very strong Bombardier fleet. There\u2019s no question that we\u2019re having a significant number of conversations with Mitsubishi and existing Bombardier folks relative to the entire platform. And when you talk about swap rights, I can tell you that certainly when you have the bandwidth and the size that we are, anything is negotiable. So with this to say, will it work or not? Well, I\u2019d be candid but it doesn\u2019t work, and there is going to be something else very clearly and very similar, if not even better by the time we\u2019re done just because of the volume of what our needs might be going forward in the future. But to that end, the overall conversations that we\u2019re having with the parties on, some of the key elements of what our business model is are going very well. Very good engagement, good clarity and good direction generally.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And then just one \u2013 that\u2019s great. And just one last, really quick one. You mentioned that your pilot availability, right now, you\u2019re running above 20% above last year\u2019s levels. What \u2013 how does that compare to turn over though? So are you doing better? Are you seeing \u2013 holding on to more than what you\u2019re losing? I\u2019m just getting a sense of how many people are actually leaving SkyWest at this point? I should say pilots, what\u2019s that turnover? Thank you.\nChip Childs: Yes, very much so, and it\u2019s part of our strategy to always make sure we have a healthy complement of pilots for several reasons. You\u2019ve heard us talk about operational reliability. It\u2019s good to have a lot of pilots for operational reliability. It\u2019s also good to have a lot of pilots to make sure that they get the livelihood that they deserve, and they get time off with families and everything that we believe is incredibly important, so in all of the strategic analysis that we do relative to pilot, our hiring is extremely good. We\u2019re filling classes into late spring of next year now, and the attrition is in a position where we continue to build pilots as we\u2019re going along. So we monitor it. We\u2019re getting more and more comfortable with how that visibility takes place and are comfortable with our position, where we\u2019re at today.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. Thanks, Chip. Thanks everyone.\nChip Childs: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for the time. Hey guys. So I guess I can tell that I worked with Mike for quite some time, so I was thinking the same thing on the CRJ550 there. But maybe just to ask the question on the $30 million investment another way, are those investments for aircraft that currently have several years less on their contract? Or these setting up for potential contract extensions. These investments, are they \u2013 so basically are they being made on aircraft that \u2013 it\u2019s been requested within this current contract? Or more a setup for the next one?\nWade Steel: This is Wade. So that\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s actually \u2013 the answer is it\u2019s a combination of both, honestly. A lot of these airplanes are under contracts for long periods of time, more than three, four, five years, right? Some of them also have some shorter expiration. So at the end of the day, we need to and we want to make the investment in the fleet, in the aircraft, whether they\u2019re going to \u2013 whether we know they\u2019re going to be under long-term contracts or they\u2019re under short-term contracts, we believe, the fleet, ultimately, will be a long-term fleet because of the demand that we\u2019re seeing from our major partners. And so we\u2019re making the investment in both \u2013 if the airplanes are under a short term or long term, we\u2019re making the investments in the fleet because we believe that it will be there for a long time.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Understood. Maybe just a quick follow-up to that before I ask another one. Would you ever \u2013 would SkyWest ever make the decision to do an interior modification without having first side of discussion with the major partner?\nWade Steel: That\u2019s a great question. At the end of the day, we work very, very closely with our major partners on the interiors of their aircraft. And so we would not go out there and do something without the blessing and working with our major partners. We\u2019re carrying their brand and their customers, and we just want to make sure we\u2019re seamless and in lockstep with our major partners.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Totally make sense. And then I apologize in advance, kind of a long-winded question. But as we think about your impressive margin growth in the last couple of years. I know that\u2019s been driven by a combination of adding new profitable flying and getting out of some unprofitable flying or less-profitable flying. And I guess, first this quarter if I back into the SkyWest only operating margins from last year, based on some of the cost of revenue figures that you gave in the release, looks like SkyWest margins are flat or maybe slightly down year-over-year. That I realize that could also been driven by changes in prorate margins. And so I guess like was the majority of your margin growth this year driven by the reduction of unprofitable flying? Is that right? And I guess, if so, what inning are we in, in terms of getting out of unprofitable of less-profitable flying? Thank you so much.\nRob Simmons: Sure Catie. Let me answer the question as simply as I can. I think it\u2019s a combination of a lot of different things. It\u2019s a better mix. It\u2019s a richer mix of airplanes. It\u2019s improvements on the economics of aeroplanes that we\u2019ve achieved when we get extensions. It\u2019s the elimination of unprofitable flying, obviously, that we\u2019ve worked hard over the last five years to eliminate any end profitable pockets of our fleet, and we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of that. So it\u2019s really \u2013 our profitability and our ongoing profitability is a combination of all of those things. And again, I think we have a nice opportunity going forward to continue to work creatively within existing scope for our partners. We have opportunities to continue to take market share. We\u2019ve got some opportunities, incremental opportunities in leasing and all of these, I think, can help be part of our growth story going forward from here going forward. And obviously, part of that growth story is we\u2019re going to invest along the way where it makes sense and drive this business for profitability in the long term.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hey guys. This is actually Conor Cunningham on for Helane. I know you have some contracted business going on for 2020. But just curious on how you feel about additional growth in the years to come. Clearly, there are some restrictions on scope, but wanted to see if there was any opportunities coming up in the near term that you feel you\u2019re really well positioned to win?\nChip Childs: Hey, Conor, it\u2019s Chip. Yes. No, I think that our outlook is pretty optimistic, honestly. I would, certainly, say, from our perspective, that we \u2013 I think we say this every single call that we have a very close dialogue with our partners all the time. Ours is not just a matter of responding to RFPs but one where we engage heavily with their overall strategic ideas and initiatives that we feel like that we can fill in, in a multitude of ways. There\u2019s no question that we\u2019ve been had this for a while. We\u2019re typically pretty straight down the centerline relative to we know we have to block and tackle, if you will. And do the basics better than anybody else and commit to do what we say we\u2019re going to do. And I can tell you that, that model over the past four, five years that we\u2019ve been working on continues to have us optimistic about our future as much as we ever have been. So that\u2019s kind of what our view is on the overall thing. I know there\u2019s scope restrictions and those type of things. But if we continue to deliver the way we\u2019ve been delivering and have the right dialogue with our partners the way we have, we continue to be optimistic.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then just on the aircraft that you purchased off lease. You guys have been pretty active in the last couple of quarters in terms of doing that and buying just aircraft in general. Just curious of how many of your aircraft, right now, are unencumbered? And if you might have a target going forward? I realize that a lot of this stuff, over last couple of years, is new on E175 so maybe not a lot of equity in those yet but just curious if you have an unencumbered number right now?\nWade Steel: Yes, Conor. If you look at our fleet, roughly a third of our fleet has no financing, no leasing, no debt on it of any kind. There\u2019s some other parts of our fleet that are owned by our partners. But we\u2019ve got a significant chunk on our balance sheet of unencumbered assets.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, great and then just a quick question on operation. I know it\u2019s going really well as of late. And this may be a slightly weird question but you guys are running like near 100% on a completion factor on an adjusted basis, 90 \u2013 almost 99% on the raw flight. I was always on assumption that was incredibly expensive to run near 100%, especially on a regional side, just curious if you have any thoughts on that. I mean, I know that you guys get paid to complete flights but just curious if there\u2019s any additional thoughts. Thanks for the time.\nWade Steel: Thank you, Conor. I think you\u2019re right. I think it is expensive but it\u2019s an investment that yielded tremendous return. Our whole culture, the DNA within our people, who we are, we want to \u2013 it\u2019s not just a competitive thing compared to our competition is that we want to be perfect. And we want to be able to deliver a product and that\u2019s a cultural thing that goes so deep within our organization. You know when you have a reliable operation, life is better for crew members and for everybody and so strategically, as we deploy our assets and as we continue to try to be the best of what we do, we know it\u2019s not cheap. We try to find levels of efficiency to do it, but it is certainly an investment that yield a strong return for us.\nConor Cunningham: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bert Subin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBert Subin: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for the time.\nChip Childs: Hey, Bert.\nBert Subin: Just wondering how do you think about prorate? So you\u2019ve talked a little bit about the CRJ investments. Just wondering, can this business exist with larger regional jets or does this program just start to wind down when those retirements happen?\nWade Steel: Hey, Bert, this is Wade. So \u2013 our prorate fleet, it\u2019s somewhere around 10% of our flying. The prorate from our perspective can exist in this market. There are so many small communities out there that are underserved or not served well right now, and the opportunities are \u2013 there\u2019s so many good opportunities out there in the prorate. We want to keep it very balanced approach between contract and prorate to make sure we\u2019re fulfilling all of our contract obligations to the best that we can and then we\u2019ll \u2013 if there are prorate opportunities out there, we\u2019ll continue to look for those. But the demand, the opportunities and prorate continue to be very, very strong right now.\nBert Subin: Yes. I guess my question was maybe a little more longer-term. I know you said earlier that seven to eight years left maybe on 200s. I\u2019m just wondering down the road, does that business sort of \u2013 because that\u2019s like 61 jets now. Does that start to just move back towards CPAs in the long run? Or you just haven\u2019t really got to that point yet?\nChip Childs: Yes, Bert, this is Chip. It\u2019s a great question, I think, fundamentally, I don\u2019t know exactly what we would say 5 to 10 years down the road relative to these markets. I can tell you, particularly as you evaluate some of the things we already are saying small communities particularly in an economy like this demand a fair amount of air travel and the demand is good there. And when we talked about that on this call \u2013 on another call that demand for this type of stuff is very, very strong. If something happens with the CRJ200s or something like that, I have no doubt one way or the other to our fleet or a larger fleet or if the majors wanted to deploy something else, that demand would be met. Right now, in the \u2013 from now until the foreseeable future, that\u2019s why we\u2019re making this investment in CRJ200. This demand is strong, that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to make the investment in the fleet, and we continue to evaluate it going forward. But the good news is today as the demand and the size of the community to this demand is being created and is something that\u2019s right in our wheelhouse.\nBert Subin: Appreciate that. Thanks. Just one quick follow up. I guess it\u2019s probably for Rob. So assuming no CPAs end up materializing next year, it seems like free cash flow should become pretty material. Can you just walk through sort of what the top uses are if that plays out? Thanks.\nRob Simmons: Yes, sure, Bert. Again, all this is we\u2019re going to call audibles from the line of scrimmage if we need to but based on what we see today, that we would think that our CapEx next year is going to be roughly half where it is. We said $300 million to $400 million, you know of $670 million. So the combination of the lower CapEx, and what we expect to be continued growth in EBITDA should generate powerful cash flow \u2013 free cash flow growth and it could double in 2020 over 2019. So I think that we\u2019re in a great place that based on what we publicly announced today, we should generate a hell of a lot of cash flow next year. But obviously, we\u2019ve got the flexibility in the balance sheet and the liquidity that if other opportunities come, there\u2019s upside to what we\u2019ve talked about. There\u2019s upside from additional orders of new aircraft potentially. There\u2019s an upside from additional market share, additional fleet extensions, leasing opportunities. We want to make sure we keep a very nimble balance sheet, and we have it.\nBert Subin: Great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chip Childs for any closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Thank you, everyone, again, for joining us on the call today. We are excited about our future and some of the things that we have set ourselves up for in the near and long term. And we will get back to you and review our year end results in three months. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 2, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-08-01 01:12:05", "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the SkyWest, Inc. Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Simmons, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nRobert Simmons: Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; and Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer. I'd like to start today by asking Eric to read the safe harbor, then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results, then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2018 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chip.\nRussell Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. The second quarter contributed to a strong first half of 2019 as we continue to monetize our fleet transition initiatives and to move forward as a single airline with a more efficient footprint. Our second quarter results reflect the strong schedule we fly from Memorial Day through Labor Day. And while severe weather in June affected several of our key hubs, our employees delivered a solid 99.85% adjusted completion for the quarter. I want to thank our nearly 14,000 employees for their efforts to work together and to deliver a great product for our customers. We are currently executing on the initiatives announced earlier this year, including a multiyear extension of another 38 aircraft with American along with 2 new contract planes. Today, we announced another contract for 10 CRJ700s with American and expect to start putting them into service starting in 2020. Supporting our developing leasing business, we have also signed an agreement to lease 40 engines to Delta beginning in late 2020. Wade will give some more details on these contract wins in a few minutes.  These deals, along with other progress that we have made recently, set us up for growth in future years and illustrate our ability to unlock growth opportunities with our partners' existing scope limitations while also making market share gain. None of this would be possible without our ability to consistently deliver a reliable product and efficient product. Our -- the people of SkyWest continue working together to ensure we remain agile and responsive to our customers' needs and focus on delivering quality service onboard more than 2,400 daily departures. Providing a seamless product for our 4 distinct and different and important partners is not a simple job. And that's something our people do better than any other carrier.  We intend to continue leveraging our position in the market to optimize the value of the assets within our operational scope. We are also in a fortunate position to be able to convert strong pilot availability into market opportunity and to respond quickly to our partners' needs. With our highly desirable team culture, quality product and strong opportunities, pilot hiring and recruiting continues to be strong and is still running more than 20% above last year's levels. More than 50% of our current hiring is coming from our internally developed pipeline, which is up from 10% 5 years ago. This is another risk area we feel has been reduced meaningfully over the past year. The January closing of the ExpressJet sale, combined with these latest fleet announcements, reduces our overall enterprise risk and will help us drive a healthy balance of earnings growth and cash flow generation. We remain very focused on sustainable opportunities that position us for long-term success. I again want to thank our great team of aviation professionals for their excellent work during the second quarter. Rob?\nRobert Simmons: Today, we reported net income of $88 million or $1.71 per share for the second quarter of 2019 compared to $76 million or $1.43 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Pretax income of $115 million for Q2 2019 is up 17% from pretax income of $98 million in Q2 2018. Our diluted share count of 51.5 million is down 1.4 million shares from Q2 of last year. Our effective tax rate in Q2 was a little under 24%. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25% for the second half of 2019. Let me say a couple of things about our balance sheet as of June 30. We ended the quarter with cash of $550 million, up from $544 million last quarter. Primary uses of cash in the quarter included $35 million for share repurchases; $111 million in CapEx, including the acquisition of 4 new E175s; and $20 million in early debt paydown for the 900s being placed on lease at Air Canada.  Debt for the quarter ended at $3.1 billion, down slightly from last quarter, including the effect of adding $80 million in new debt to finance the 4 new E175s that we will fly for Delta under a previously announced contract. Let's turn for a minute to capital expenditures. As you recall, the last few years, we have invested heavily in growth aircraft for our fleet. In 2018, we spent $1.1 billion in CapEx driven primarily by the acquisition of 39 new E175s. In 2019, we expect only to deploy a little over $500 million in CapEx, and here is the math on that number. CapEx for Q1 was $252 million, and Q2 CapEx was $111 million for $363 million CapEx for the first half. In the second half of 2019, we would expect to spend approximately $160 million toward a handful of used CRJ700s, rotables and spare engines. We expect that by the end of 2019, debt levels will continue to come down to under $3 billion. Just a reminder that all of our debt is financing aircraft, and the bulk of our $3.1 billion in debt is financing our fleet of 151 E175s that are under flying contracts largely coterminous with the related debt.  We continue to expect to delever via repayment of $350 million to $400 million in debt each year through the embedded amortization of principal in this mortgage-style term debt before any new financings for new aircraft pursuant to future new orders, if any. We expect strong cash generation over the next couple of years that will allow us to maintain strong liquidity, delever our balance sheet and maintain the agility to respond quickly to any incremental market opportunities. During Q2, we repurchased $35 million in stock under our $250 million program approved by the Board in February. This leaves us $195 million in authorization remaining under this program. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We feel good about how the first half of the year has gone. And last quarter's expectation of low double-digit growth for full year 2019 off 2018's earnings per share of $5.30 has not changed. With the usual seasonality and the incremental fleet opportunities announced earlier today representing 2020 growth elements, we would expect Q3 to look pretty similar to Q2, with the normal seasonal falloff in Q4. Our visibility to future cash flow gives us the confidence to continue to make disciplined investments to create shareholder value. As we continue to demonstrate when and if new investment opportunities come, we will be ready with a strong and liquid balance sheet. This future capital deployment could include organic growth opportunities in contract flying, prorate flying or leasing. In addition to organic growth opportunities, of course, we will also continue to look at returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. As Chip mentioned, we are striving to drive a healthy balance between earnings growth and cash flow. Wade will now give you some details on today's contract announcements, fleet movements and other commercial opportunities and initiatives. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I'll review our latest agreements and fleet updates that occurred during the second quarter and then discuss the implementation of these changes as well as additional opportunities. As Chip mentioned, today, we're pleased to announce 10 additional CRJ700s with American Airlines. This is a new long-term agreement with service expected to launch in 2020. Along with the extension of the 38 CRJ700s and the addition of the 2 CRJ700s we announced last quarter, this brings our fleet total to 70 CRJ700s under long-term agreements with American. We're -- we anticipate acquiring 7 CRJ700s from a third party to help fund this growth. We're happy with the progress we're making with American, and we'll continue working with them to meet their long-term fleet needs. To summarize our new aircraft delivery stream, we received 4 new E175s during the second quarter for Delta, and we're scheduled to take delivery of 4 more during 2020, which will bring our total E175 fleet to 155 by the end of next year. We also received 3 CRJ900s during the second quarter. We expect to take delivery of one CRJ900 during Q3 and the remaining 8 during 2020. These CRJ900s are owned and financed by Delta. Let me shift gears to our leasing business, where we continue to leverage opportunity. This quarter, we delivered the first of 29 CRJ700 aircraft under our previously announced agreement with a domestic third party. These aircraft are under a 10-year lease agreement, and we anticipate the remaining aircraft will be delivered through the middle of next year. The majority of these aircraft will be sourced from the 30 CRJ700s from our previous ExpressJet operation. We have also delivered the first of 5 CRJ900s leased by Air Canada under a 6-year lease agreement. We anticipate delivering the remaining 4 aircraft during the third quarter of 2019. Separately, our 16 CRJ200s under lease with ExpressJet will return to SkyWest during the second quarter. However, we expect to receive lease payments on the majority of the aircraft through the end of the year. We anticipate that SkyWest will operate the majority of these aircraft. Finally, during Q2, we also entered into an agreement to lease 40 CF34-3 engines to Delta with an anticipated 5-year term. This is in addition to the 13 CF34-8 engines already under lease with Delta. We expect the deliveries on the 40 engines to begin late next year through mid-2021. As I've discussed, we continue to utilize our flexible fleet and platform to -- for profitable opportunities, leveraging the unique position we've built over the past several years to enhance our model and to minimize risk. We anticipate ongoing execution of these agreements will help ensure we're well positioned for the remainder of 2019 and beyond.\nRussell Childs: Okay. Operator, we're ready for Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Fallon: It's actually Matt Fallon on for Mike. So when you look at the business going forward, call it, 1 or 2 years, what is the most compelling opportunity to grow earnings outside of incremental contracts or extension?\nRobert Simmons: Well, Matt, Rob here. I would put it into sort of 3 categories. I would say growth driver number one would be our ability to creatively sort of work within existing scope limitations of our partners. The second would be ability for us over time to make market share gain wins. And then the third category, a broad category, would be ongoing opportunities, as Wade sort of outlined, within leasing opportunities, assets within our operational footprint that we have the opportunity to lease. I think over the next couple of years, I think you can expect us to execute against all 3 of those broad areas.\nMatthew Fallon: As a quick follow-up, I feel like the company is at a real cash flow inflection point here. And so on use of cash, could you just rank your priorities in terms of balance sheet deleveraging, returning cash to shareholders and responding to any market opportunities?\nRobert Simmons: Sure, Matt. No, I'm not sure I'm prepared to rank them exactly. But I think we have a number of initiatives that we've laid out, including delevering our balance sheet over time to prepare for -- if there is a next investment cycle out there, we want to be prepared with a strong and liquid balance sheet that can help us take advantage of those market opportunities. We're clearly committed to continuing to do the right thing and returning capital to shareholders. But I think overall, we just want to be able to remain nimble and be able to be prepared for whatever is out there in the future.\nOperator: The next question comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: I just wanted to ask, the news about Mitsubishi buying the CRJ program, and it sounds like they're shutting down the production of the CRJ program. Can you talk about kind of the implications for kind of future aircraft buying and then maybe the kind of aircraft that you have in your footprint right now?\nRussell Childs: Yes. Savi, it's Chip. Thanks. It's a great question and important development here recently. Look, I think that we're excited about a new opportunity relative to our existing fleet. Yes, we're disappointed that certainly, the production line is closing down. But I think that as you know, the strong number of aircraft that we have with Bombardier, we believe that Mitsubishi will be able to embrace this business model and develop it within their existing program.  And I think for us, the important part is that they've got the ability to invest, enhance what they can provide to us. And we have a very firm expectation that that's what they'll do. But from our perspective, I think that this is something that we look forward to working with Mitsubishi going forward and finding some new ways to develop this fleet into our existing fleet and just work within their parameters that they have with also their new aircraft as well. So I think that this opens a very good door for us to do some different things that we potentially haven't had the ability to do in the past.\nSavanthi Syth: Do you see any kind of implications for maybe the E175 cost or maybe the carrying values, book values on sort of CRJs in-house already?\nRussell Childs: I think the market's going to probably go in that direction. We're fortunate with the commitments that we have with existing manufacturers that we feel very comfortable with our position in those elements for the upcoming future. So that's not one of our primary concerns at this time.\nSavanthi Syth: Got it. And then, Chip, maybe I can address the second question to you, too. Congrats on being nominated as the next Advisory Committee Chair. Just kind of curious why that's important and if there's anything kind of more specific to the regional airline industry where these kind of next-gen initiatives are important.\nRussell Childs: Yes. By the way, thank you. I mean it's a very humbling appointment. There's a lot of things I've been involved with in that for quite some time. And I can tell you I think that first and foremost, relative to SkyWest, we're a very evolutionary company when it comes to technology. We've embraced sort of many capabilities. We've got an outstanding IT department. We've got an outstanding flight operations and maintenance department that embraced this technology.  I think as we look from an industry perspective, I think that there's a lot of things within the national aviation system that can use a lot of help with technology. Certainly, there's things that new aircraft need to be addressing as they come off the production lines, including the ones that we're taking. We're happy with the new aircraft we're getting, but we have an existing fleet that's an outstanding fleet of aircraft that probably needs to have some investment to get to where we need to be.  So the number one thing for us is obviously equipage. And so I think it's a dynamic thing within the regional industry that we have to take a good, strong, hard look at. I think that there's a lot of good ROI relative to the programs. And I'm excited to be more involved with it. There's tremendous professionals involved in that committee. And I think some of the success stories we've seen is ADS-B and how that's produced some of the things that is extremely safe and efficient. And there's a lot more that we need to do, particularly on the regional side. And we look forward to helping lead that effort at SkyWest.\nOperator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just with respect to your commentary about 2019 CapEx, what's your view today for the trend into 2020 off of this 525 level that you outlined?\nRobert Simmons: It's Rob here. So again, it's going to depend on what the future holds in terms of new orders because obviously, we want to be prepared for a future where there are some new orders coming. But again, absent any new orders out there, we would expect that it's likely that CapEx in 2020 will fall. At the same time, obviously, we would hope that EBITDA would rise, so creating a strong cash flow environment going forward.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then with bad weather, with cancellation rates high for a number of carriers this quarter, can you just help explain why that doesn't translate to SkyWest anymore? It used to. Maybe it was a function of this quarter with much more about mainline cancel than maybe it was more about the lack of MAX availability. But can you just comment on if there's something different structurally around your contracts? Or did you see some short-term uplift or increased demand due to mainline cancels this quarter?\nRobert Simmons: Look, I think that clearly, there have been changes over the last few years contractually in terms of the way that weather cancels are handled. That helps. But again, during the quarter, we had a rough June. Gross completion was not -- was affected by weather, and that affects our economics. But fortunately, we had other opportunistic offsets that allowed us to offset any of that -- of the bad weather effects.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Do you think you're seeing any ad hoc or short-term demand as it relates to lack of MAX availability?\nRobert Simmons: I mean the simple answer is no because we fly a very different footprint than the MAX does. And it hasn't been a big effect to us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Helane Becker of Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Chip, I'll add my congratulations to Savi's on your appointment. And then the question I had actually was, with respect to 2019, you didn't update guidance or did you, and I missed it?\nRobert Simmons: 2018, did you say, Helane? Oh, 2019...\nHelane Becker: I don't think so. I thought I said '19, but you'll never know.\nRobert Simmons: No. Now with respect to 2019, what we said was basically, our outlook from last quarter has not changed. We're still expecting double-digit growth in 2019 off of the 2018 earnings per share of $5.30. So that remains unchanged.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then on -- I was happy to hear the comments you made on the pilots. Are you seeing -- let me think how to ask this. With respect to some airlines are, like, overstaffed right now because of the MAX issue, are you seeing people who are interested in just keeping their hours long, flying -- applying to fly for you?\nRussell Childs: Honestly, Helane, we are not. I think within our model, nothing has changed with or without the MAX issue. But we also made the comment that the majority of -- actually at least 50% of the pilots we're getting today have been developed within our existing pipeline and which also translates into pretty much all of the pilots we're getting today are coming up through schools. They're getting their 1,500 hours. We're not getting anything from the other side relative to the issue with the MAX on pilots.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Rob, can you just talk about -- you talked about some opportunities to take share and grow organically. Can you talk about kind of the value proposition that you're offering to airlines? What gives you confidence that you can take share? And then whether there are just kind of some bigger opportunities to do so or if it's kind of evenly spread out over the next couple of years.\nRussell Childs: Joe, and I know you addressed this to Rob. I'm going to -- this is Chip. I'm going to take a crack at this, if you will. I think there's a couple of things over the last couple of years that our partners, we hope and think it's true, has gained confidence in us with a couple of things.  First and foremost, we pride ourselves on being a carrier that, a, has the resources, both from a human and aviation professional perspective and a capital perspective, to be in a position to deliver what we say at the onset. We don't love to be in a position where we have to go in and say, \"We don't have resources. We can't fly what we committed to you for.\" And that's something that we've proven over some difficult times over the past years, that we have gained a lot of trust and that we're going to do what we tell our partners that we're going to do. And that goes a long way in these relationships with our major carriers.  Second of all, we're willing to be extraordinarily creative. One thing that's moved our strategic dial over the last several years is our ability not just to work with partners but strategize with them long term and see some of the needs that they have with the resources we have and help them design things. We've even had conversations with partners where it didn't make sense for us to take all of the flying that they may want us to take them, and we backed off and said, \"You should do some different things with that.\"  So look, I think first and foremost, I think by far, our relationship and our strategic connection with all 4 partners, given what they want, is the #1 thing that we have besides our resources. And then as you say, how does that translate? I have to tell you that we're always in fluid and dynamic conversations with our partners. I mean today's focus at SkyWest is to continue to deliver strong performance through this summer schedule. Once that certainly backs off, then there's other things that happen relative to fleet management and how we capitalize that.  But our partners have seen our 47-year history that we have. They know that we mean what we say and that we come with creativity that, in my opinion, and I've heard this from them, and we believe it internally because it is our #1 goal, is to be their absolute provider of choice. And that helps us get some visibility in some things that we think are unique. So that's where we get our comments and being able to make some of those statements that Rob made.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve O'Hara of Sidoti & Company.\nStephen O'Hara: Yes. I don't know if you could tell me just in terms of the kind of the -- based on the fleet that you're taking next year and maybe what the CapEx is that's already kind of in the books, I mean what's the expected block hour growth next year based on the fleet moves you have right now baked in? And then maybe what's your maintenance CapEx? And what's kind of the minimum level of CapEx beyond that if it's already planned?\nRobert Simmons: Rob here. So I would say vis-\u00e0-vis the topic of CapEx again, like I said earlier, I think '19 over '20 CapEx levels are going to depend on things that we'll have to just stay tuned on. But again, all else equal, based on where we stand today, we would expect CapEx would likely fall in 2020. Baseline CapEx right now, again, ex buying new airplanes, is running about $50 million a quarter, a little hotter than it did a year ago largely because of opportunities within the engine market. And so we're a little more aggressive about buying engines out there in the market right now where we find opportunities. So baseline CapEx is running roughly $50 million a quarter, and then aircraft, if any, would be on top of that.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay. And then like block hour growth, I mean is there a way to kind of maybe bracket that for next year?\nRobert Simmons: Yes. I think typically, what we'll do is we'll -- we usually publish at the end of the year a full year forecast going forward. And I think it's likely we'll do that again this year. You'll notice in the press release that we've sort of updated it for the -- through the end of 2019. And we'll likely give some more color next quarter on 2020.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chip Childs for any closing remarks.\nRussell Childs: Thank you for your interest in SkyWest and in joining us on the call today. We're happy with our business model, and we think that this continued strategy of making sure that we've got the best aviation professionals in the industry working as a team as well as the availability for us to continue to invest in our business model and take care of our partners is one we'll continue to provide good strong results for our shareholders. And we will talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Simmons, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nRob Simmons: Thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer; Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer; and Mike Thomson, SkyWest Airlines\u2019 Chief Operating Officer. I\u2019d like to start today by asking Eric to read the Safe Harbor. Then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results, then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2018 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your joining us on the call today. The first quarter represented a strong start to 2019 as we continue to experience the impact from our risk reduction fleet transition initiatives, which was moving forward as a single airline with a more efficient footprint. Our quarterly results are already showing the benefits of closing of the ExpressJet sale, as well as the early buyout of 52 aircraft from an expensive and inflexible leverage lease structure. We\u2019re also very pleased to announce today the multi-year extension of another 38 aircraft with American, along with two new contract airplanes. This announcement builds on the extension of 60 aircraft with United and 51 aircraft with Delta previously announced over the last two quarters. The first quarter included challenging weather in operations across the SkyWest system and the winter storms have continued into this quarter as well. We also faced unique challenge of a government shutdown during the quarter, which briefly disrupted our aircraft delivery and heavy maintenance schedules. Despite these challenges and a network spanning 11 hubs nationwide, we understand there\u2019s still work to do across the operation. We\u2019re very focused on our operational planning to ensure we are a durable airline and continue to deliver the product our partners and passengers have come to expect from SkyWest. I want to thank our 14,000 aviation professionals for their teamwork and focus on providing an exceptional product this last quarter. During Q1 we repurchased $25 million in stock. $21 million of it was purchased under our new $250 million program approved by the board in February, leaving us about $229 million in authorization remaining under this program. As we discussed last quarter, we believe there is still good opportunity for earnings growth in 2019 and 2020 with smaller, incremental flying agreements and a strong balance sheet that enables us to create innovative revenue alternatives within existing scope limitations. This includes non-flying and lease opportunities as we demonstrated this quarter. To be clear, any leasing business we pursue is will be within our current platform. And as the largest operator of these assets in the world, these are business lines SkyWest is uniquely positioned to develop. To that end, we are pleased to announce today that we have entered into a conditional agreement to lease 29 CRJ700 aircraft to a domestic third-party operator for a 10-year term. We expect this agreement to begin later in the year. We intend to continue leveraging our position in the market to optimize the value of the assets within our operational scope. We also are in a fortunate position to be able to convert strong pilot availability into market opportunity and to respond quickly to our partners\u2019 needs. Pilot hiring and recruiting continues \u2013 continued strong and is running more than 20% above last year\u2019s levels. This is another risk area we feel has been reduced meaningfully over the last year. On January 22, the closing of the \u2013 on the January 22 closing of ExpressJet sale combined with these latest fleet announcements and flying contract extensions reduces our overall enterprise risk and will help us drive a healthy balance of earnings growth and cash flow generation. We remained very focused on sustainable opportunities that position us well for long-term success. I again want to thank our nearly 14,000 aviation professionals for their excellent work during the first quarter. Rob?\nRob Simmons: Today we reported net income of $88 million or $1.69 per share for the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted net income for the first quarter was $69 million or $1.33 per share, compared to net income of $54 million or $1.03 per share in Q1 2018. Adjusted net income for the quarter excludes $25 million of pretax earnings comprised of the gain on the sale of ExpressJet of $47 million pretax, and a $22 million special item pretax expense that included a non-cash write-off primarily related to aircraft manufacturer part credits forfeited to settle future lease return obligations with the manufacturer and employee separation costs associated with the sale of ExpressJet. Our effective tax rate in Q1 was 23%. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24% to 25% for 2019 as a whole. Let me say a couple things about our balance sheet and important point of competitive differentiation for SkyWest. We ended the quarter with cash of $544 million, down from $689 million last quarter. Primary uses of cash in the quarter include the previously announced immediately accretive $110 million leverage lease buyout of 52 CRJ aircraft, $90 million purchase of 16 CRJ700s, and $25 million for share repurchase offset by $50 million in cash proceeds from the sale of ExpressJet. Debt for the quarter ended at $3.1 billion, down from $3.2 billion last quarter. From where we are at the end of Q1, we would expect that net of cash to be approximately $300 million lower by year-end. Just a reminder, that all of our debt is financing aircraft and the bulk of our $3.1 billion in debt is financing our fleet of 147 E175 that are under flying contracts largely coterminous with the related debt. This quarter we adopted the new lease accounting standard. To give me some color on the lease standards impact to our balance sheet, our March 31 balance sheet includes a new $342 million long-term right-of-use lease asset and the $348 million operating lease liability, of which $73 million is classified as current. I\u2019d also like to point out at the end of 2018 we had $216 million in total prepaid lease assets on our balance sheet, of which $87 million was a current asset. Following the early lease buyout of the 52 CRJ aircraft, our prepaid lease asset is now $35 million at March 31 and is included in our long-term right-of-use asset. The combination of the new lease standard and the early lease buyout impacts the comparability of our current ratio from year-end to March 31. Let\u2019s turn for a minute to capital expenditures. As you recall, the last few years we have invested heavily in growth aircraft for our fleet. In 2018, we spent $1.1 billion in CapEx, driven primarily by the acquisition of 39 new E175s. In 2019, we expect to deploy only half of the 2018 CapEx number, $200 million of which is for the 68 used CRJ aircraft I just mentioned from Q1 and a $120 million for five new E175s throughout 2019. Gross CapEx for Q1 was $252 million including normal non-aircraft acquisition capital spending of $28 million in the quarter. This non-aircraft CapEx should run in the $30 million to $50 million per quarter range for the rest of the year, driven by incremental engine acquisitions later this year. With the delivery of nine new E175s expected to be spread over 2019 and 2020, we plan to invest $40 million of our own capital and raise approximately $180 million in new term debt by the middle of 2020 for these plans. We expect that by the end of 2019 our debt will be around $2.9 billion, down from where we are now because of the close to $350 million in normal annual principal payments embedded in our fully amortizing term debt, offset by approximately $100 million in new debt for the scheduled 2019 E175 deliveries. Absent any additional aircraft orders, the $3.1 billion in debt where we are right now is likely a peak. We expect that in 2019 and 2020 we will continue to delever our balance sheet by paying down debt in the neighborhood of $300 million to $400 million per year. We expect strong cash generation over the next couple of years that will allow us to maintain strong liquidity, delever our balance sheet and maintain the agility to respond quickly to any incremental market opportunities. We feel good about how we\u2019ve started the year. Last quarter we discussed that with the accretion from the leverage lease buyout completed this quarter and other leasing and contract opportunities that off the earnings per share base of $5.30 in 2018, we previously anticipated low double-digit growth of annual EPS in 2019, but we expected 2019 EPS to have a five in front of it. Well, we still expect the low double-digit growth in 2019, but considering our strong Q1 results, we can now remove the five handle caveat. Our visibility to future cash flow gives us the confidence to continue to make disciplined investments to create shareholder value. When and if new investment opportunities come, we will be ready with a strong and liquid balance sheet. This future capital deployment could include organic growth opportunities in contract flying, pro rate flying or leasing, as well as opportunities to buy our way out of other inflexible and expensive leasing or debt structures prior to maturity. In addition to organic growth opportunities, of course, we will also continue to look at returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. As Chip mentioned, we are striving to drive a healthy balance between earnings growth and cash flow. Wade will now give you some color on the fleet movements and other commercial opportunities and initiatives. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I\u2019ll review our latest agreements and fleet updates that occurred during the first quarter and then discuss the implementation of these changes as well as additional opportunities. We are pleased to have secured a multi-year extension on 38 CRJ700 aircraft with American Airlines. These aircraft were previously scheduled for contract maturities later this year. Also during the first quarter, we entered into a long \u2013 into a new long-term agreement to add two used CRJ700s to our American agreement, with service expected to launch in May. Shifting to our Delta partnership, we have received the first of our nine new E175s as part of the nine-year agreement we announced last quarter, with four more expected this year and four in 2020. As a reminder, these aircraft will replace used CRJ900s in our Delta contract. Four of those CRJ900s will be returned to the lessor, while the remaining five will be leased to Air Canada. Continuing our dual class deliveries, we received eight of 20 new CRJ900s under our long-term Delta agreement. We expect delivery of the remaining 12 CRJ900s later this year and next. Additionally, you may recall that we had a number of CRJ aircraft under our Delta contract set to expire this year. Last quarter we were able to extend 32 aircraft including 15 CRJ900s, 3 CRJ700s, 14 CRJ200s from this legacy Delta contract. We also extended the term on the first 19 E175s under contract with Delta from nine to 11 years. Separately, we were able to extend 60 CRJ200s with United for an additional three years last quarter. All of these extensions cover the majority of the tail risk across our fleet. We also continue to leverage opportunities in our leasing business. Today, we announced an agreement to lease 29 CRJ700 aircraft to a domestic third party for a 10-year term, subject to the finalization of their flying contract. We anticipate the aircraft will be placed under leases and increments from the middle of this year to the mid-2020. The majority of the aircraft will be sourced from the 30 CRJ700s from our previous ExpressJet operation. As part of the six-year lease agreement with Air Canada I discussed earlier, those five CRJ900s are expected to transition to Air Canada this quarter and next. We have also leased 16 CRJ200s to ExpressJet. Finally, we entered into a joint venture with Regional One during the first quarter, allowing us to utilize their distribution reach to lease spare engine and airframes to third parties. SkyWest anticipates initiating transactions including the transfer of 14 engines through Regional One beginning this quarter. Of course, any leasing business will be within our existing platform as a significant and well positioned operator of these assets. We continue to utilize our flexible fleet and platform for profitable opportunities, leveraging the unique position we\u2019ve built over the past several years to enhance our model and minimize risk. We anticipate ongoing execution of these agreements will help ensure we\u2019re best positioned for the remainder of 2019 and beyond. Okay. Operator, we\u2019re ready for our Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon. Is there \u2013 it seems like most of this takes care of the CRJ700 wide tail risk. Could you talk a little bit about \u2013 I think last quarter you talked about a lot of the contracts going through to 2020. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the durations of your various contracts and not one by one, but generally, how we should think about the longevity of some of these contracts?\nWade Steel: Yes. Savi, this is Wade. So the contracts that we\u2019ve entered into the American 38, as we said, it\u2019s a multi-year longer term type agreement, that\u2019s out there. We also entered into a lease for the 29 aircraft that do have a 10-year duration on those. Those are the two new ones that we entered into the quarter. All of our E175s have original maturities of somewhere between 9 years and 12 years on them. So there\u2019s \u2013 a lot of our dual-class are very long-term type agreements.\nSavi Syth: Maybe I can ask it in a kind of a simpler way, just so as you look at \u2013 when you have some wide tails coming, what\u2019s the kind of the first year where you have more than just kind of one or two here and there coming up?\nWade Steel: Yes. Now that we\u2019ve entered into these agreements, we don\u2019t have any significant tail risk until 2023, 2024.\nSavi Syth: Perfect. Got it. And then if I might ask just another question on the pilot side, just say kind of an update there. I was just wondering if anything has kind of changed in recent months or especially with all the kind of moving parts here, just kind of how you feel about your pilot levels and kind of the supply levels there.\nChip Childs: Yes, Savi, this is Chip. It\u2019s a good question. I think, look, as I stated in our script, our recruiting so far this year in the first quarter has probably been the best recruiting that we have seen in our history, quite candidly. We attribute that to an exceptional culture here at SkyWest as well as outstanding aviation professionals and an outstanding training department, plus good opportunities for our pilots to go to some exceptional carriers after they\u2019ve spent and had some good experience with us. On the attrition side, I would say that it\u2019s very much as expected, if not even a little bit less, but pretty much as expected. So I think we\u2019ve talked in previous calls, the level of effort that we put at our entire pilot pipeline that goes from new pilots learning how to fly clear through, some of our flow through and resume review programs with our major cares. All of that is we felt very, very comfortable with and probably feel as good as we ever have. And we\u2019re very excited about just the exceptional level of pilots that have shown interest in SkyWest and our group is just an outstanding group. So we feel very comfortable about taking that and making sure that we\u2019re meeting the needs of our partners and our passengers.\nSavi Syth: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMatt Fallon: Hey guys, it\u2019s actually Matt Fallon on for Mike.\nRob Simmons: Hey, Matt.\nMatt Fallon: Last quarter you mentioned that buying out expensive leverage leases on CRJ aircraft would yield double-digit returns. Do you see the incremental opportunities you mentioned yielding similar returns? And if so, could you give us a rough idea of the number of planes you see as potential candidates for these transactions?\nRob Simmons: Yes, thanks, Matt. I think that as we \u2013 I believe said last quarter as well that there were originally a couple of pockets of opportunity for this and one we got done this quarter, the other pocket of opportunity that\u2019s out there is a little more complicated. It was a little more broadly syndicated. There are more counterparties involved in the conversation. So it\u2019s something we\u2019re definitely very interested in pursuing, but it\u2019s not something that that I would expect to see completed this year.\nMatt Fallon: Got it. Thanks. And I guess as a follow-up, are you seeing any incremental cost savings or revenue opportunities following the divestiture of ExpressJet since I last heard from you? Thanks for taking my questions.\nChip Childs: Yes. Matt, that\u2019s a great question. I think there\u2019s a couple of things relative to that. I think more specifically, there is actually a very large amount of assets that we did not sell as part of the sale of ExpressJet, mostly on the side of the CRJ700 side. And our intention with that like we\u2019ve announced is to take those assets and find ways to lease both aircraft and engines. It\u2019s a very good market for that type of stuff. So the announcements that we\u2019ve said today, I think that you can kind of integrate that into somewhat of our thinking, but I think it is \u2013 it should be widely known that we sold a lot of assets with ExpressJet, but there is a term \u2013 quite a bit of assets that we did not sell that we\u2019re going to continue to find leasing opportunities for.\nOperator: The next question will come from Helane Becker of Cowen.\nConor Cunningham: Hey, guys, it\u2019s actually Conor in for Helane. Just a couple of questions on the dry leasing business. So, I mean, it seems like a pretty decent splash here, just \u2013 I\u2019m just curious what you think about it long-term. Is it actually conceivable that you may look to purchase new regional aircrafts with the intention of actually just doing dry leases with them and rather than operating them yourself?\nChip Childs: So, I think \u2013 that\u2019s a great question because with some of the opportunities that we have seen so far with the existing assets that we have, it would have to fall within our strategic footprint of what we would like to do long-term with our partners and with our existing enterprise. So if there are opportunities for us to invest in additional assets, whereby we could lease those domestically or internationally, I would say that we would be open to that. I still think that we\u2019re in a phase of confident exploration right now. And as we move through that phase, we\u2019ll keep you guys updated on any other further developments, but it certainly is not out of the question that we can develop this a little bit further.\nConor Cunningham: Is it fair to assume that the margin on that business is going to be similar to the system right now or maybe you can just give a little context to that going forward?\nChip Childs: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t say that the margins \u2013 you\u2019re kind of comparing apples to oranges, a little bit on that. Certainly a flying aircraft is the backbone of our business, which we certainly enjoy and would prefer to do. However, given the construct and strategic focus of where some of these assets are and how they can be utilized to help support our partnerships, we\u2019re open to evaluating that between flying and not flying them. But as of right now with the excess assets that we have, it\u2019s a very good strategic approach to lease them to other people right now.\nRob Simmons: Matt, I\u2019d just add to that that any time we deploy capital, we\u2019re going to do it in a very disciplined way and with return thresholds firmly in mind.\nConor Cunningham: Great. And then just changing topics for a second. So I mean I know you guys don\u2019t fly or aren\u2019t contracted to fly the CRJ550, but just curious if you think there is actually long-term potential with that. Has anyone actually approached you about deseeding [ph] some CRJ700s. I know \u2013 I realize that there\u2019s probably not a lot left with this \u2013 with the new lease agreement at this point?\nChip Childs: Well, I think that the 550 is a very compelling case that we worked particularly with one of our partners. We watch it very closely. I think it\u2019s an intriguing product. I think that we are the number one owner in the world of CRJ700. So that 700 platform has a lot of flexibilities across all of our partner bases. At this point, we \u2013 we\u2019re studying it, watching it very closely, we think it\u2019s a very good compelling case. At this time, we also have some other opportunities with CRJ700s that are equally, if not more compelling, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t think that that could put \u2013 we could play a good part in that some time down the road.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question will come from Catherine O\u2019Brien of Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi guys. This is actually Joyce [ph] on for Katie. Thank you for taking the time. And I was just wondering\u2026\nWade Steel: Hi, Joyce.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. So just with the third party that you\u2019ve leased the CRJ700s to, I was wondering if maybe they\u2019d be interested in leasing further aircraft as they come on contract or if this is more of a one-time deal that you would have to find additional counterparts for if there are future leases?\nWade Steel: Yes. Joyce, this is Wade. I think with this counterparty, I think they\u2019ve fulfilled a lot of their needs. We continue to work with them on additional needs. I don\u2019t know if it will be additional aircraft or potentially helping them with some of their current fleet, but we \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to work with this counterparty and other ones that have interest in leasing aircraft from us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, got it. And then you mentioned that that sort of guidance you had for earnings growth in 2019 of no longer having that five handle in front of it, I was wondering if that improvement was really just that extra goodness in the March quarter or if it\u2019s really these other initiatives that you\u2019re driving for the full year 2019 with the joint venture, the new leasing agreement or potential leasing agreement, if we can extend on that a bit more?\nWade Steel: Yes. Let me answer the question this way and I think, again we\u2019re pleased about how we\u2019ve started the year. But as we look at 2019 and 2020, obviously 2019 we\u2019re going to see some growth just from the timing of when we brought in some of those E175s last year. We\u2019re obviously seeing some of the economics read through already from the leveraged lease buyout that we did last quarter, we took through some of the lease extensions, the contract extensions. We\u2019ve got 12 new aircrafts scheduled to be delivered in 2019, another 12 in 2020. Obviously this new \u2013 this new 10-year lease for 29 planes that really is more of a 2020 story, it should start to read through later in the year though. But I think it\u2019s a combination of obviously a good first quarter and some nice opportunities that we\u2019ve got going into 2020 as these initiatives play out.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you for that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Just a question on pro rate, there\u2019s clearly a lot of kind of volatility that goes on in the non-regional space and you have exposure to that, but I think your pricing and that environment is very different. So just wondering if you could talk about what you saw in the pro rate side of the business in 1Q and your expectation for size for the rest of the year?\nWade Steel: Yes. Savi, this is Wade. So as far as pro rate, I\u2019ll first start off with just the size of pro rate. It\u2019s a little bit more than 10%, somewhere in the 10% to 12% range of our flying. So it\u2019s a very small portion of our flying. It is a little bit different than what the major [indiscernible] it\u2019s all domestic, it\u2019s all, it\u2019s all \u2013 it\u2019s fairly predictable for us. The fuel side of pro rate, the fuel if you look at our P&L it was actually down $1 million. So it was actually pretty consistent year-over-year. We won\u2019t get into the specific profitability, but it\u2019s fairly consistent year-over-year and we\u2019ve \u2013 and it\u2019s a very small portion of our business.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s all. But the \u2013 so the pricing environment especially with kind of the ESA contracts and things like that that\u2019s been pretty stable?\nWade Steel: Yes. It\u2019s been very stable for us.\nSavi Syth: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Chip Childs for any closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Carrie. Thanks everybody for joining us on the call today. Like I \u2013 like usual, we want to continue to execute on our strategy, remain flexible to make sure we\u2019re at the very best positioned long term to have good sustainable opportunities for shareholders as well as all of our wonderful professionals here at SkyWest and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Chip.\nRussell Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon, everyone, we appreciate your joining us on the call today. The fourth quarter completed a strong 2018 and we're pleased to report solid continued progress on our key objectives to reduce risk, enhance fleet flexibility and maintain strong cash flow. We're focused on delivering on our commitments and executing with discipline. As our press release outlines, we continue to make great progress in all of these areas. With the completion of the ExpressJet sell to ManaAir this month, we successfully mitigated a significant risk to our model. We believe our ability to focus on 1 operating entity in SkyWest Airlines will help us better achieve our objectives and deliver an exceptional product for our partners. As we've discussed in previous quarters, another component of our risk-reduction strategy is to further reduce our utilization of expensive and inflexible leverage leases across our fleet. As we outlined in our press release, we're executing early lease buyouts on 52 aircraft this month, as we continue to delever our balance sheet and reduce tail risk. Rob will talk more about that in a minute. Our operating performance remained strong during the fourth quarter with SkyWest Airlines delivering 99.9% adjusted completion on over 200,000 flights during the quarter. This caps off the year of SkyWest producing top-tier reliability for the entire 2018 year, a year in which we operated the most departures in our history. Also during the year, we became the first airline to launch an all-electronic maintenance log, as we work to stay on the leading edge of our industry. SkyWest has been named one of Fortune Magazine's most admired companies in 2019 and is the only regional airline on that prestigious list. We attribute that distinction and our operating credibility to our incredible team of nearly 14,000 professionals. And want to thank them for their great work across their operation each and everyday. That credibility helped us secure multiyear contract extensions for 51 aircraft under flying agreements with Delta as well as new contracts for 9 additional E175 aircraft. SkyWest will purchase these E175 aircraft from Embraer as we will remove 9 CRJ900s from our Delta operations in the coming 18 months. Some of these CRJ900s will be leased to Air Canada and some of will be returned to the lessor. As we've discussed last quarter, we believe there are still good opportunities for earnings growth in 2019 and 2020. With smaller incremental flying agreements and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to create innovative opportunities with an existing scope limitations. This includes nonflying and lease opportunities as we demonstrated this quarter. To be clear, any leasing business we pursue is and will be within our current platform of assets. And as the largest operator of these assets in the world, these are opportunities we're uniquely positioned to develop. Wade will talk more about that in a few minutes. SkyWest people remain essential to our collective progress. And with the finalization of our pilot agreement in the fourth quarter, we now have multiyear agreements with all employee workgroups. Pilot hiring and recruiting is running more than 20% above last year's levels and is another risk area which still has been reduced meaningfully over the last year. So with the January 22 closing of the ExpressJet sell, combined with the latest fleet announcements, flying contract extensions and the leverage lease buyout, this reduction of risk gives us better predictability and visibility for the future. We remain very focused on sustainable opportunities that position us for long-term success. I again, want to thank our nearly 14,000 aviation professionals for their excellent work during the fourth quarter. Rob?\nRobert Simmons: Today we reported net income of $67 million or $1.28 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to adjusted net income of $43 million or $0.81 per share in Q4 2017. For all of 2018, we reported net income of $280 million or $5.30 per share compared to adjusted net income of $182 million or $3.43 per share from 2017. As a reminder, the adjustment to the 2017 numbers was to take out a large gain related to the tax law change. Pretax income of $91 million during Q4 was up 33% from Q4 2017. Revenue was $803 million in Q4 '18, up $42 million from $761 million in Q4 2017. This increase in revenue included the net impact of adding 39 new E175 aircraft since Q4 2017, partially offset by the removal of 48 less profitable aircraft over the same period. Our total fuel cost per gallon averaged $2.66 during the fourth quarter, up from $2.25 per gallon in Q4 2017. The line item in our P&L for aircraft fuel was $7 million pretax higher than a year ago, reflecting the higher rate paid under our prorate business model. Just a reminder that approximately 90% of our model is not subject to fuel risk. Our effective tax rate in Q4 was 26% and for the full year was 23.5%. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24% to 25% for 2019 as a whole. Let me say a couple of things about our balance sheet, an important point of differentiation for us. We ended the quarter with cash of $689 million, down slightly from $705 million last quarter. We issued $159 million in new long-term debt during Q4 2018, financing 8 new E175s. Total debt as of December 31, 2018 was $3.2 billion, up from $3.1 billion last quarter. SkyWest used $28 million in cash and deposits toward equity for new planes and $39 million in other CapEx. Normal non-aircraft acquisition capital spending in 2019 should continue to run in the $25 million to $35 million per quarter range. With the delivery of 9 new E175s expected to be spread over 2019 and 2020, we plan to invest $40 million of our own capital and raise approximately $180 million in new term debt by the middle of 2020 for these planes. We expect to, by the end of 2019, our debt will be below $3 billion, down from where we are now because of the close to $350 million in normal principal payments embedded in our fully amortized in term debt by the end of 2019, offset by approximately $100 million in new debt for the 2019 E175s -- E175 deliveries announced today. Absent any additional aircraft orders, the $3.2 billion in debt, where we are right now, is likely a peak. We expect that in 2019 and 2020, we will continue to delever our balance sheet by paying down debt in the neighborhood of $300 million to $400 million per year. But let's be clear, debt reduction is just part of the story. Subsequent to year-end, 2 important things happened. We closed on the ExpressJet sale and we deployed $110 million in capital to buy 52 aircraft, out of an expensive inflexible leverage lease structure. This lease buyout transaction replaces cash rent expense with noncash depreciation expense, helps us avoid spending down the road on lease return conditions, meaningfully lowers tail risk out to 2024 and is immediately accretive to earnings. At the end of 2017, SkyWest's total future lease obligation was over $700 million, after the removal of ExpressJet's lease obligations and this leveraged lease buyout, I would estimate our current future lease obligations to be down to approximately $400 million. During Q4, we repurchased $29 million in stock under our 3-year $100 million repurchase program authorized by the board in 2017. We still have $25 million in authorization remaining under this program and expect to fully utilize it. We feel good about how we are positioned going into 2019. Last quarter, we discussed that we could see high single-digit baseline growth in earnings per share in 2019 over 2018 but that this expectation did not necessarily capture the upside potential from other initiatives. While including the accretion from the leveraged lease buyout announced today and other leasing and contract opportunities which Wade will discuss in a moment, we expect that off the earnings per share base of $5.30 for 2018, we could now see low double-digit growth in 2019 but we would still expect 2019 EPS to have a 5 in front of it. As our spending on new aircraft goes from $160 million in 2018 to something closer to $20 million in 2019, our cash generation is set to increase dramatically. Cash at the end of Q1 should be in the $500 million range as we deploy $110 million for lease buyouts and other items. But absent any new investment opportunities, cash should be back in the 700s by year-end 2019. This visibility to future cash flow gives us the confidence to continue to make disciplined investments to create shareholder value. When and if new investment opportunities come, we will be ready with a strong and liquid balance sheet. This future capital deployment could include organic growth opportunities in contract flying, prorate flying or leasing as well as opportunities to buy our way out of other inflexible and expensive leasing structures prior to maturity. In addition to organic growth opportunities, of course, we will also continue to look at returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. Wade will now give you some color on the fleet movements and other commercial opportunities and initiatives. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I'll review the new contracts signed, discuss the changes to the fleet and related flying agreements and then we'll walk through the implementation of these changes and our new leasing opportunities. During the fourth quarter, we entered into an agreement with Delta to acquire and operate 9 new E175s under a 9-year term. We expect to take delivery of the first 5 aircraft during the first half of this year and the other 4 during 2020. We expect to remove 9 used CRJ900s from our Delta contract as the new E175s are placed into service, 4 of those CRJ900s will be returned to the lessor, the other 5 CRJ900s will be leased to Air Canada. You may recall that we have a number of CRJ aircrafts set to expire this year and next year under our Delta contract. During the fourth quarter, we extended 32 aircraft including 15 CRJ900s, 3 CRJ700s and 14 CRJ200s from our legacy Delta CRJ contract. The CRJ700s and 900s were extended through December 2022 and the CRJ200s were extended for an additional 1 to 2 years. We also extended the term on the first 19 E175's under contract with Delta from 9 to 11 years, 2018 was an incredibly busy year for SkyWest and this work sets us up for success for many years to come. During the year, we received 39 E175s, 30 are under a 9-year contract with Delta. The other 9 are under a 12-year contract with Alaska. At year-end, this puts our E175 fleet to a total of 146, 65 under contract with United, 49 with Delta, 32 with Alaska. As I mentioned, we expect to receive 9 more E175s for Delta during 2019 and 2020. By the end of 2020 we expect to have 58 E175s under long-term contract with Delta. We're also scheduled to take delivery of 3 E175s for Alaska during 2021, bringing our Alaska fleet total to 35. We also took delivery of 5 new CRJ900s for Delta during the year. During 2019 and '20, we will take delivery of 15 additional new CRJ900s, all under long-term flying agreements with Delta. Demand for 50-seat flying remains very strong and as a result of that demand, last quarter we reached an agreement with United to extend 60 CRJs for an additional 3 years. With the extension of these and other legacy Delta CRJ fleet, this means 80% of our contract flying now goes beyond 2020. We remain confident in our ability to find opportunities for those planes with contracts expiring before the end of 2020. As we completed the ExpressJet wind down for American and Delta flying prior to our completed ManaAir transaction, we removed the remainder of the 30 previously ExpressJet-owned CRJ700s from Delta American service. For the short term, we expect to retain the majority of these aircraft under our current American flying agreement. However, since we own these aircraft with very little debt remaining, we're evaluating various options for these aircraft including selling them, operating them under contract and prorate agreements, leasing them to third parties or utilizing or selling their parts. We have been able to place 17 engines belonging to these aircraft under lease agreements, 13 of which are under long-term leases with Delta Airlines. We continue to see opportunities in our leasing business. We have leased 16 CRJ200s to the new ExpressJet for up to 5 years. We also entered into a 6-year lease with Air Canada for 5 CRJ900. These aircraft start to transition to Air Canada during the second, third quarters of this year. Demand for engines and aircraft is high, and we believe there are strong short and long-term leasing opportunities. As Chip mentioned, any leasing business will be within our existing platform of assets. As I've outlined, 2018 was a very productive year, focused on setting a strong foundation for the next several years. This fleet movement, refleeting and successful sell of ExpressJet is part of our broader strategy to reduce our overall risk and improve our model. The net impact of all these changes leaves us with a single highly efficient airline with significantly lower risk and positions us well for 2019 and beyond.\nRobert Simmons: Okay, operator, we're ready for Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. You guys gave definitely been busy end of the year and at the beginning here. Just on the fleet counts, end of the year was about 21 more aircrafts than previously projected. Is that related to the aircraft that you've now confirmed with Delta, or kind of what led to higher aircraft count at the end of the year?\nWade Steel: Yes, so the majority -- Savi, this is Wade. So the majority of those aircraft that are in there as of year-end are the CRJ200s that ExpressJet was operating for United as of year-end. That's what the increase was.\nSavi Syth: Okay. And I have a bunch of smaller questions related to the different movements, but so the -- with the 70 engines that are under lease agreements, does that mean that by mid-2019 you just still have only about 13 CRJ700s that you have to figure out what you want to do with? Is that correct?\nWade Steel: Yes, Savi, this is Wade again. So yes, we have 30 of those airplanes. As I said in my script, the majority of those airplanes are currently flying under agreements with American, the engines are being leased and so there's just, as you said, 12 to 13 aircraft that still we're looking for homes for.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And 1 last question and I'll -- I'm going to jump back on the queue. Related to these kind of the leasing opportunities that you have, is this one where your just going to work with the fleet that you have? Or would you consider going out, if the opportunity arises, going out and buying aircraft specifically to lease? Like lease out brand new aircraft to airlines that want to.\nRussell Childs: Thanks, Savi. This is Chip. Just real quick relative to that point, I think where we are today, as we start a lot more external leasing activities, first and foremost, it's important to remember our objective is to utilize assets that are already within our existing portfolio. That's the number 1 part. Most of what we're incrementally talking about on the call today is assets that we already have. There's no question that if there are additional assets available for us to purchase within the existing platform, we would be very open to evaluating that along with other opportunities to deploy them either through leasing or with flying. The objective of this entire leasing activity is to make sure that we continue. We talk a lot about fleet flexibility and we find that this is another very strong tool that we can utilize to meet the needs of our partners and maybe a multitude of different ways by deploying these assets that are already within our existing platform. So we will patiently monitor the market and some of the demand for this stuff and keep you updated in the future if there's any new movement relative to this model.\nSavi Syth: Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg: So you talked about the leasing of the engines, the leasing of the airplanes to ExpressJet the CRJ's, and then the CRJs to Air Canada. How are you going to depict this in your P&L? Is there going to be like a revenue from leasing and also the associated expenses?\nRobert Simmons: Hey, Mike. This is Rob. So this sort of activity will all be reflected in our leasing segment.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, okay. Then my second question with all of the extensions or renewals that you've completed with Delta, is it fair to assume that the economics of the extensions or renewals is similar on average with what you had in place previously?\nWade Steel: Yes, Michael, this is Wade. We've obviously been working with Delta on this. They're very consistent with what we've had. Obviously, adjusted for additional pilot costs that we have, but yes.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And then just my last question, now that you've jettisoned the ExpressJet business and you gave us the guide for 2019 and it's a sizable increase even on this higher base, given the strength of the fourth quarter. When I think about the elimination of ExpressJet and as I recall, I believe, it was a separate dispatch, a separate COO, separate executives. There's clearly some cost savings here in running only a single entity rather than 2. Is that partly what's helping to drive a better number? And can you give us a sense of maybe what that P&L benefit is of being just the single stand-alone entity instead of trying to manage 2 different operations?\nRussell Childs: Yes, Michael, this is Chip. I appreciate the question. It's a great one. I think there's a lot of opportunity here with a single carrier. I mean, it's been well over a decade since SkyWest was on its own. And there's no question that a significant portion of why we strategically made this decision was no question efficiency, no doubt increased focus on being able to execute with such a fantastic operation that SkyWest has as well as to focus on cost and deliver what our partners want. There's also a cultural aspect to it. I think that it'd be -- you'd be hard press to find a culture as strong as what SkyWest Airline has along with outstanding aviation professionals. And so from our perspective, the transaction is just a couple of weeks behind us but our strategic focus moving forward is going to be, I think, significantly intangible and down the road continue to reduce risk and provide some good solid opportunities for what the operations that SkyWest Airlines can provide. Now relative [Technical Difficulty] guidance within his script for 2019 and I think that all of that, that we've discussed relative to the transaction is largely embedded in that guidance.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. Just to follow along where Mike left off. Would you be able to provide like a pro forma revenue for 2019 ex ExpressJet?\nRobert Simmons: Duane, it's Rob here. So if you'll -- as you know on the 21st of January, we filed an 8-K that had some split out of that, but just in terms of a high level ExpressJet contributed $564 million in revenue during fiscal 2018 and had a segment level loss of $16 million.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, that's great. And then on Air Canada, is that just aircraft or is it aircraft on an outsourced basis? What is the total opportunity there?\nWade Steel: Yes, so Duane, this is Wade. So this is just aircraft and engines. We will not be doing the flying. I think they've selected another operator to do that. And we've got plenty of flying with our 4 major partners.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then just for my last one on -- maybe on a per aircraft basis, can you just walk us through the P&L impact, the accounting impact of why this is a benefit for you to buy these out? And thanks for taking the question.\nRobert Simmons: On the leverage, I assume you're referring to the leverage lease buyouts. So and -- we're not going to get into too much granularity on that but I can say that the money, the capital that we're deploying against that has got a nice double-digit, sort of, ROI characteristic and should contribute in the neighborhood of a $0.25 of EPS a year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Hi, everybody. Thank you so much for your time. A couple of little things. One, is you mentioned your pilot hiring as being on track and so on. Can you just talk about retention?\nRussell Childs: Yes, Helane, this is Chip. So again, as we mentioned our pilot hiring this year is as good as it's ever been. Retention is -- our anticipation for 2019 is about flat compared to what it was for last year. We do certainly monitor that extremely closely as well as the pipeline of pilots coming in. And I think net-net between the 2, we feel like we're in a very, very good position going into 2019 where we can assist partners real-time and any needs that they may have throughout the year. And also completely honor all of our existing flying agreements throughout the year.\nHelane Becker: Great. And then my other question is probably one for Rob, with the purchase of the aircraft off-lease, do you -- would you have a write-down to the fleet? Or should we be looking for anything like that?\nRobert Simmons: No, nothing like that, Helane.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then my last question is, I think you might have answered this actually. You were talking about having stubborn lease agreements. Can you just clarify what you were saying about that?\nRobert Simmons: Well I think, what I said was expensive and inflexible. And so there were a couple of pockets there, we were sort of attacking. One of them we got done and another one, again, we're not going to give up on. But I wouldn't expect that, that will happen in the next year but I think still reflects a longer-term opportunity as we get closer to maturity on that, we'll continue that. We'll continue to work on that piece of it. But we were delighted to get the piece done that we did.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And you can't say how many, right?\nRobert Simmons: Well, it was 52 airplanes in the deal that we got done today. And again, the capital deployed is $110 million.\nHelane Becker: Okay, got you. And then one, if I can just sneak in one last question. Do your partners ask you what you're doing in the area of carbon offsets and sustainability and stuff like that? Or do they just provide that to you, with the jet fuel that they're providing to you, and making your employees like, for example, United and their Eco-Skies program. Do they follow up with you on that in that area at all?\nRussell Childs: Yes, I think -- Helane, this is Chip. Just real quick. As we work real time with our partners, that's a topic that we absolutely have a lot of conversation about. Anything that we can do in any platform we have relative to flight procedures, for fuel savings, anything from an environmental perspective, I can say without a doubt there our partners are very engaged with us as we want to be naturally, anyway, in any type of dialogue that we can have some environmental responsibility together in a partnership. And I'm actually very impressed with how that process works with our partners. So that's a long answer to the word of yes.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Its really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, everyone. So maybe just one more on this new leasing part of the business. Should we be thinking about these leases as closer to breakeven, covering the cost of ownership on these aircraft? Or should we be expecting a decent profit on this part of the business?\nRussell Childs: Catie, this is Chip. I would in a very general sense, say that this is not an activity to try to breakeven. These are in our view opportunities, we do have a fair amount of assets. Each asset that we've talked about relative to this opportunity, we can fly it or we can lease it or we can even sell it. So in my view, I would view this as a profitable opportunity as we move forward within our existing asset base that we have.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, got it. And then maybe just thinking about like a few, the puts and takes that we've seen change since you last gave the high single digit, now we're low double-digit guidance. It seems like based on Rob's characterization of the [indiscernible] aircraft on lease being about a $0.25 of EPS a year. It seems like that might be the largest chunk of that change, from some quick math. Is that the way to think about it or should we be thinking about more of an equal split between some of the new aircraft at Delta, the contract extensions? Just trying to think about some of the changes since you last guided?\nRobert Simmons: Yes, Catie, it's Rob here. So yes, I think that the leverage lease buyout is probably slightly more than sort of half of the Delta and some of the other Deltas related to the opportunities that Wade was talking about in the leasing and commercial side of the business.\nCatherine O'Brien: Great. And if I could just sneak one quick last one in?\nRobert Simmons: Sure.\nCatherine O'Brien: Should we still be thinking about your E175 being the most profitable in your fleet? Or have some of these new and extended contracts with your partners on other aircraft caught up profitability-wise?\nWade Steel: Yes, Catie, this is Wade. We don't get into fleet level profitability, but we're making money on all of them today.\nCatherine O'Brien: I appreciate the time. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve O'Hara with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nSteve O'Hara: Hi, good afternoon. Maybe just relative to your original guidance that you have provided. How many of the things that seem to be impacting the improvement, I guess, net, so the pilot contract, I would assume would be a negative on that, the sell of ExpressJet and then the lease buyouts. I mean, how many of these things were kind of contemplated but maybe factored in less than expected or something like that when you guided previously?\nRobert Simmons: So Steve, I think that with respect to our original guidance, that clearly contemplated the -- that additional pilot contract cost that we had -- that we did last year. And I think largely is related to and sort of what we said, we get some of the accretion that we get from the leverage lease buyout as well as some of these incremental leasing opportunities.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. And then you talked about the pilot hiring and things like that being as strong as it's ever been. And maybe Helane asked this but I missed it. Just on the attrition rate, I mean has there been an increase in the attrition rate, or is that still kind of where you think it should be? I guess I'm just wondering I mean, it seems like you're taking more aircraft from Delta but that should be slowing relative to what you did last year I guess, which was a very big year in terms of taking aircraft?\nRussell Childs: Yes, Steve, this is Chip. Again, it's a good question. With strong pilot hiring, and we take a look at the retention of our pilots and yes, the question is that where we think it should be. Well, no, it's not where we think it should be. We don't think we should have any attrition. But from the perspective of what we have the reality to deal with our major partners hiring so many. We monitor that very, very closely and as it is today and as we look at the forecast, we think it will be about the same, maybe up slightly from 2018, but you continue to monitor that. You know the math of the increased pilots coming in relative to same attrition, not as much growth on paper is what we had in 2018 does mean that we have a lot of opportunities and more flexible basis with a flexible fleet to have good conversations with our partners, which we always do. And it seems to me I think we mentioned this last quarter, we do anticipate higher volume of smaller deals, real time with our customers as they have needs that arise on a very aggressive basis and that's what our approach is going to be in 2019 and monitor all things with our pilots all the time and make sure we don't have too many, but definitely make sure we have enough to respond to the needs of our partners.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. And maybe one quick one, are there more opportunities along that line because of the leverage lease buyout? And did the -- I think, the change in account -- the lease accounting affects you guys this year? Did that have any net negative or positive impact?\nRobert Simmons: No, we'll adopt the new leasing standards next quarter. But I think as I mentioned earlier, Steve, that what -- we had a couple of pockets of opportunity with some of these leverage lease structures that have been in place for many, many years and one of them, we got done. The other pocket of opportunity is sort of potentially of similar size that I again, I don't know that, that's something we're going to get done in 2019, but we'd like to try to get it done in the next couple of years as we start to get closer to the expiration of that contract.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chip Childs for any closing remarks.\nRussell Childs: Thank you, everyone, again, for showing interest in SkyWest. It's a pleasure to address some of the questions and elaborate more about what our strategy and our model is. Again, I want to thank the more than 14,000 professionals throughout our company and the great work that they do to give us the credibility to make sure we take care of our partners and our shareholders as well. So thank you for the interest, and we'll meet back up next quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SKYW", "quarter": 3, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-10-30 20:53:08", "content": "Executives: Chip Childs - President and Chief Executive Officer Rob Simmons - Chief Financial Officer Wade Steel - Chief Commercial Officer Eric Woodward - Chief Accounting Officer\nAnalysts: Savi Syth - Raymond James Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Steve O'Hara - Sidoti Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI.

[Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference call over to Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nRob Simmons: Thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer, Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer, Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer, Mike Thompson, SkyWest Airlines' Chief Operating Officer and we will excuse Terry Vais, ExpressJet Airlines' Chief Operating Officer. He is out running his operation today. I would like to start today by asking Eric to read the Safe Harbor. Then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results. Then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts.

SkyWest had a great third quarter as outlined in our press release. Summer and the third quarter is typically peak travel season and our production reflects that same trend this year. Overall, our Airlines performed well during the quarter and our teams continued to execute with precision. With more than 260,000 flights during the third quarter, SkyWest and ExpressJet each delivered strong operating reliability. SkyWest achieved 99.9% adjusted completion and ExpressJet achieved 99.8% adjusted completion for the quarter. Our Airlines also led the industry in the most recent VOT report with SkyWest and ExpressJet placing first and second respectively as the airlines with the fewest complaints for the month of August. I want to thank our teams for their work and great work delivering seamless exceptional service for our partners and passengers across North America. As noted in our press release, SkyWest Airlines agreed to an extension with United for 60 our existing CRJ-200 aircraft.  We continue to see strong demand for both 50 seat and dual class aircraft across our fleet. We also continue executing on our current fleet plans with delivery of eight more new E175 aircraft and four CRJ-900 aircraft expected in the fourth quarter under our previously announced agreement. We are focused on delivering on our commitments, maintaining strong fleet flexibility and executing with discipline. With the largest tranche of ExpressJet's Fleet transition and a new pilot agreement complete, we continue to expect modest profitability for that entity in 2019 as we indicated last quarter. We've had significant fleet movement over the past three years to put a smaller, leaner ExpressJet and we are positioned where its losses are expected to finally come to an end. During the third quarter, SkyWest Airlines also secured an amendment to the existing agreement with its pilot. This agreement runs through 2022 and provides improved compensation and long-term visibility, helping to solidify our position as the employer of choice. And while we are very successful tracking pilots today, we firmly believe that establishing ourselves as the employer of choice is a distinct competitive advantage and positions us well for future opportunities. We believe there is still strong opportunity for earnings growth in 2019 and 2020 through one continuing to improve the economics of our legacy fleet. Two, fulfilling demand left by smaller, weaker competitors and three creating innovative opportunities within existing scope agreement. While we don't expect large expanses fleet announcements without scope changes. Solid growth is still available from an aggregate of smaller incremental builds for those who can deliver. We continue to believe that our ability to attract the best professionals will be a competitive advantage. Our philosophy and vision for long-term sustainable growth has not changed, and we will be ready with people liquidity and balance sheet strength when or if new scope arrives. As I've discussed, we are focused on long-term sustainable, strategic business objectives including executing discipline fleet plans, mitigating risk developing balance sheet strength and producing operational excellence. We believe that delivering on these objectives allows us to be the employer, partner and investment of choice. And that by successfully balancing these priorities, we will continue to add tremendous value to each of our stakeholders. I again want to thank our 17,000 aviation professionals for their outstanding work during the third quarter. Rob?\nRob Simmons: Today we reported net income of $83 million or $1.57 per share for the third quarter of 2018, up from net income of $54 million or $1.01 per share from the third quarter of 2017. Pretax income of $110 million during Q3 was up 27% from $87 million in Q3, 2017. Revenue was $829 million in Q3, 2018 up $16 million from Q3, 2018. This increase in revenue included the net impact of adding 34 new E175 aircraft since Q3, 2017, partially offset by the removal of 65 unprofitable or less profitable aircraft over the same period. Our total fuel cost per gallon average $2.69 during the third quarter, up from $2.06 per gallon in Q3, 2017. The line item in our P&L for aircraft fuel was $7 million pretax higher than a year ago, reflecting the higher rate paid under our prorate business model. Just a reminder that approximately 90% of our model is not subject to fuel risk. Our effective tax rate in Q was 24.5% compared to 38% last year at this time with the year-over-year difference being obviously driven by the new tax law. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25% for the fourth quarter and 24% to 25% for 2019 as a whole. Let me say a couple things about our balance sheet and important point of differentiation in our model. We ended the quarter with cash of $705 million, up from $649 million last quarter. We issued $243 million in new long-term debt during Q3, 2018 financing 12 new E175s. Total debt as of September 30th, 2018 was $3.1 billion, up from $3 billion last quarter. SkyWest used $43 million in cash and deposits toward equity for new planes and $30 million in other CapEx. Non aircraft acquisition capital spending in the fourth quarter and into 2019 should continue to run in the $25 million to $35 million per quarter range. With the remaining eight E175 expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter. We plan to invest $30 million of our own capital and raise approximately a $160 million in new term debt by the end of the year for these planes. We expect by the end of 2018 our debt will be approximately $3.2 billion, up $100 million from where we are now because of the close to $100 million in normal principle payments embedded in our fully amortizing term debt by the end of year. Assuming an end of 2018 peak in debt, we expected in 2019 and 2020, we will continue to delever our balance sheet by paying down debt in the neighborhood of $300 million to $400 million per year.  During Q3, we repurchased $15 million in stock under our three-year $100 million repurchase program authorized by the Board last year. We still have $55 million in authorization remaining under this program and expect to fully utilize it. The next couple quarters are expected to be very busy from a fleet perspective as we execute the new contracts and extensions that we have reported over the last few months. As Chip mentioned, we also announced today new pilot agreements at both ExpressJet and SkyWest Airlines. The increase in pilot pay at ExpressJet is offset in our flying contract and does not affect the expectation articulated last quarter though we expect modest profitability from the smaller and leaner ExpressJet next year. The incremental cost of the new pilot agreement at SkyWest Airlines is expected to be offset by future flying contract rate resets and in other market revenue opportunities. In 2019, we expect that half the cost of the new pilot deal at SkyWest Airlines will be offset via contract resets with the full amount offset in 2020. Including the effect of the numerous fleet movements and the newly inked pilot agreements, we would expect high single-digit baseline growth in earnings in 2019 over 2018. This growth expectation includes the cost of this new SkyWest pilot deal, but does not necessarily capture the full upside revenue potential that could come from the recruiting and retention effect of further bolstering our standing as one of the most attractive employers of pilots anywhere in the regional airline world. With more pilots we hope to be able to generate and monetize more production opportunities. We will talk more about this in the quarters to come. In a world with no new scope expected anytime soon, it is not surprising to anyone that our year-over-year rate of growth in earnings is expected to be less in 2019 than it has been in 2018. What should also not be unexpected is that as our spending on new aircraft goes from a $160 million in 2018 to something closer to zero in 2019. Our cash generation is set to increase dramatically. Never have we had better visibility to and confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flow over the next couple of years. When and if new scope and our new investment opportunities come, we will be ready with a strong and liquid balance sheet. Until then we will continue to be disciplined about how we deploy our capital and will continue to look to sensible risk adjusted opportunities for long-term investment. This capital deployment could include organic growth opportunities in contract flying; prorate flying, leasing, as well as opportunities to buy our way out of a couple inflexible and expensive aircraft leasing structures. In addition to organic growth opportunities, we will also continue to look at returning excess capital to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends.  Wade will now give you some color on the fleet movements and other commercial opportunities and initiatives. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I'll first review our fleet changes and flying agreements during the third quarter and then I'll discuss the implementation of these changes from June 30th to September 30th, 2018. Our fleet moved from 583 total aircraft to 574 total aircraft, specifically we added 12 new E175 aircraft to our fleet during the quarter, bringing our total E175 fleet to 138 at the end of the quarter. This includes 65 E175 under contract with United; 32 with Alaska and 41 with Delta. We anticipate taking delivery of eight E175s during Q4 for Delta bringing our total E175 fleet to 146 by year-end. We also took delivery of our first new CRJ-900 during the third quarter as part of our previously announced agreement to operate 20 of those aircraft for Delta. We anticipate taking delivery of four more CRJ-900s during the fourth quarter; eight during 2019 and seven during 2020. Demand for 50 seat flying remains very strong.  We are working with each of our major partners to meet their 50 seat needs. As a result of that demand, we have reached an agreement with United to extend 60 CRJ-200s for an additional three years with SkyWest Airlines. Separately, we began executing on previously announced fleet transition agreements during the third quarter, placing the first four of 20 CRJ-700 into American Service during the quarter. We expect eight more CRJ-700 to be transitioned into American Service during the fourth quarter and the remaining eight in early 2019.  We also transitioned the first 4 of 20 ExpressJet CRJ-200 to United Service on October 4th. The remaining 16 aircraft are expected to be placed into service between now and early 2019. With this continued fleet movement and contract changes, we anticipate some transition noise in the fourth quarter and Q1 of 2019. First transitioning 20 CRJ-200 to ExpressJet United operation will result in some incremental operating costs associated with bridging the aircraft, delivery changes and maintenance, as well as crew location changes. We also anticipate some aircraft downtime as would continue transitioning CRJ-700 to the American contract primarily to accommodate the aircraft delivery changes. Additionally, we anticipate removing the remainder of the 30 ExpressJet owned CRJ-700 from Delta service to complete ExpressJet's wind down of Delta Connection flying during the fourth quarter. For the short term, we expect to retain the majority of these aircraft under various American flying agreements with some transition expense. However, we own these aircraft with very little debt remaining. We are evaluating various options for these aircraft including selling, operating under contract and prorate agreements, leasing to third parties or utilizing or selling their parts. Separately, we expect the 18 CRJ-700 is currently flown by ExpressJet for American will not be extended beyond early 2019. These 18 CRJ-700 include 12 aircraft from the original contract with American and six short-term aircraft that transitioned from the Delta contract. The majority of these aircraft are leased with no tail risk. We expect to return these aircraft to the lessor by early 2019. As Chip and Rob mentioned, new pilot agreements were ratified at both ExpressJet and SkyWest Airlines. The increase in pilot payout at ExpressJet is contractually offset under their current partner agreement. The increase in pilot payout at SkyWest Airlines is expected to have significant offsets via contract rating renewals and other contract provision in 2019 and 2020. As I've outlined, we expect to be busy with fleet transitions in the fourth quarter. This fleet movement is part of our broader strategy to reduce our overall risk and improve our model. The net impact of all these fleet movements and the agreements in the second half of 2018 and early 2019 leaves us with a smaller and more efficient ExpressJet operation continues to reduce overall tail risk and positions us well for 2019 and beyond.\nRob Simmons: Okay, operator. We're ready for the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon. It's helpful to understand kind of the low risk around the 30 CRJ-700s sales next year. Could you help us understand as you know what you're looking at from especially kind of CRJ-200 with the bigger aircraft? What that tail risks you have and like 2020 and 2021?\nWade Steel: Yes. So, Savi, this is Wade. So I think your question was what kind of tail risk we have on the CRJ-700 beyond 2020 and 2021. Yes, so the majority of those aircraft, they're going to be flying for a good part of 2019 and in the middle of 2019 we start to have some exposure. The majority of that debt or all of that debt is paid off by the end of 2020. So there's really very little cash exposure left on those airplanes. We'll get through most of that in 2019 and early 2020. And we've got some very good and interesting opportunities with some of those aircraft. We're actually working on some LOIs for some --to lease some of those engines and other parts. So we're very confident in placing those airplanes.\nSavi Syth: Great. Are there any kinds of additional aircraft that come off [Technical Difficulty] contract that we should be mindful of? Is like 2020 or 2021?\nWade Steel: Yes. So, we all of our CRJ-200, there's very little or no risk associated with those aircraft. All of our 175 and CRJ-900s, there's no tail risk in those periods either. There becomes a little bit of tail risk in the first part of 2020 with some CRJ-700, but we have plenty of time to work with our major partners to renew and extend those aircraft.\nSavi Syth: Helpful and then if I might on the --it was kind of help to get the color on earning for next year. If we take you a status quo and looked at 2020 especially given that some of those pilot contracts increases are getting fully incorporated, what kind of growth can we expect? Again not assuming any significant changes.\nRob Simmons: So, Savi, it's Rob here. So, look, I would say that our comments, we're sitting in October of 2018 here. We made some comments on 2019 today. I think you can expect as usual that we will give more color in the quarters ahead, but I think I would say that between all of the actions that we're taking right now, obviously what we're trying to do is set ourselves up very nicely for 2019 and 2020. We've got growth opportunities in a number of different areas including continuing to improve the economics of our legacy fleet as those renewals and opportunities come up you. We feel like we've got opportunities to continue to take opportunities from smaller, weaker competitors over the next couple of years and then as Chip mentioned, we feel like we've got other opportunities within the existing scope to be creative with our partners and mine opportunities within the existing scope right now. And I think all those opportunities for earnings are sort of enabled by this new pilot feel that we've done and the liquidity and the balance sheet that we've got for these new investment opportunities when and if they come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just a couple things here just, there's obviously a lot of moving parts here. I just want to make sure, so the 20 CRJ-700 I guess that are going into American what there were four that went in and there's eight in the December quarter, and then eight in early 2019. Those are distinct from I guess what is it the 2018 that will not be extended that are coming out in 2019, is that right? So merely it sounds like there's a swap of just airplanes coming in and airplanes coming out almost the same amount.\nWade Steel: Yes, Mike. This is Wade here. You are right on the phasing in of those aircraft. We've got four in there, there's eight. Yes and the timing is, they're fairly close to match up, but they're not exactly the same but it's fairly close when the planes come out and the other ones come in.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question is I don't know if you mentioned anything about the E175 order that United made recently. I know United is going to start taking those airplanes I think sometime in early 2019. So presumably we're going to find out probably in the not-too-distant future where those airplanes go which partner. Do you have any sense of timing on that number one? Number two will you have the wherewithal to be able to if in fact to bid for that and to induct those airplanes into your fleet given the fact that you're going to be dealing with a lot of I guess transition noise presumably right around the same time that those airplanes would be inducted into a United Express flying.\nChip Childs: Yes. Hi, Mike, it's Chip. So just a couple of quick comments on that. One is, yes, you're right and to be candid we have certainly spent a good amount of time with United in trying to find a way to make all that be workable for our enterprise. We certainly can't comment on the progress or anything that we have with those. I don't dispute anything that you've assessed relative to timing. I can tell you that it's a pretty complicated situation. And that we are deeply engaged into it, but we honestly today don't have anything to share we would probably share it. So I think we're going to continue to work with United, if there's something that would work for us with that.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. Just my last question. Rob, you sort of gave us guidance 2019 versus 2018, you said slower EPS growth but then with respect to 2018, we did hear that there's going to be a lot of transition noise in the fourth quarter. When I look at where consensus is it does look like we have a meaningful deceleration in earnings growth. We --you just reported a $1.57; it looks like as we get into the fourth quarter, the street seems to be right above a $1. And so trying to get a sense of the magnitude of the potential impact of this noise in the fourth quarter so that we can get the right base for that high single-digit EPS growth from 2018 off of 2019.  So I don't know if you can give us kind of a range of the expenses associated with this transition cost. Is this a $5 million exercise? A $10 million type exercise when you talk about the bridging of the aircraft, delivery changes, maintenance, crew relocation et cetera? \nRob Simmons: So, Mike, this is Rob. So what I would say is that the transition friction that Wade made reference to in Q4 and into Q1. There's nothing new about that that we're announcing this quarter. That was all related to the deals that we announced last quarter. So that --it's just sort of reiterating what was said a quarter ago on this call about that transition. And again, as Wade laid out in his script, it's like some of the transition is just having aircraft temporarily out of service. Some of it has got some other operating expenses associated with it. Some of the delivery charges, but a lot of delivery charges for painting are covered by our partners, but there's other sort of friction and noise and that. But again, none of that is new. So as you know, we don't officially comment on street consensus or anything but I would just reiterate that the noise and the friction that Wade made reference to is not new.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, that's what I thought. That's what I thought because we were -- we are all well aware the fact that there's-- this is --there are a lot of transitions going on and you painted out in the last couple of press releases. So we kind of know what we're will be dealing with. I appreciate it. Thanks, good quarter guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes with Steve O'Hara from Sidoti and Company. Please go ahead.\nSteve O'Hara: Yes, thank you for taking my question. Can you just talk about the guidance that you gave or the comments about 2019, we'd be in the friction that you'd noted. I mean that's kind of included in that outlook generally and I mean obviously this kind of a continuing issue. So is that correct?\nRob Simmons: It is, yes. The friction is included in our guidance.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay and then just I mean sitting where you are today versus a few years ago and the comments around tail risk, I mean are you in a better position today than maybe you expect it to be or maybe here you could be a few years ago? And I guess how does that look going forward? I mean is there a reasonable expectation that tail risk will improve as the --your partners need evolved I think was the word you guys used in the press release. \nChip Childs: Yes. So, Steve, it's Chip. I think your question about fleet exposure in that compared to where we were honestly three four years ago, it's an entirely different picture. And it's taking a lot of patience; a lot of hard work; a lot of capital to position where we are in today. We talk about where we're going to be in the next year or two with this exposure. And it continues to get better with time and that's a key element of our strategy because when we talk about fleet flexibility, it's also about being able to be agile among four outstanding partners, but it's also the ability to be flexible with costs and meet what is very, very dynamic needs of the partner. So in a big broad picture it's a lot better than what it has been in the past. As time goes on it will get a lot better, and to be candid, all of the aircraft that we've taken in the last three or four years have strategically been done and financed with that and intentionally not with leverage leases so that we can continue to utilize what Rob is outlined is some pretty strong cash flow in the years to come to continue to offset these risks. And so we're very pleased with where we are today with fleet risk and flexibility compared to where we were and we're very optimistic where we're going to be in the years to come.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay, thank you. And then maybe just one quick follow-up just on the pilot contract in SkyWest. I know it's not a union work group but you have a contract with them. Is there, I mean was there any change within, I don't know, last two month or so where you thought you needed a new contract, was a new contract kind of do and there -- has there been any change in maybe your ability to source pilots or any in the churn at the hiring et cetera.\nChip Childs: No, that's a good question, Steve. I think first and foremost of the onset I think our strategy with the SkyWest pilot deal was consistent with our long-term approach to stability and opportunity. I could honestly say that there was no quantitative data that would have us alarmed or concerned about the need to go back out and do an amendment to the existing pilot agreement. But we do fundamentally admittedly within the agreement, thought that it was an out of balance.  We were very strong and among the top in compensation with captains, but candidly first officers were lagging behind and given the situation having the flexibility with other fundamentally believe that a carrier that does not have a top tier pay for pilots over the next several years is not going to be one that you are going to be able to grow and have some strong stability. So with that we had a good opportunity to do this. We certainly looked at the overall economic model and its entirety over the long term, and saw good opportunities to take care of pilots. And this is not just about just getting pilots either. It's about getting the best pilots because our model is based upon extraordinarily high performance and safety metrics and from that perspective we have to deliver what the flying public and what our partners need and you need exceptional aviation professionals to do so. So it all came together very well for all parties involved in. We look forward to moving forward long term and continuing to develop the model together with our -- with all of our professionals.\nOperator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks for the question and thanks for moving the call to a more convenient time. What was the margin on prorate in this quarter versus this quarter a year ago? Is there any visibility you can give us into the profitability of that as fuel moves around?\nWade Steel: Yes, this is Wade. So our prorate fleet is very consistent year-over-year both in size and profitability. We did see an increase in fuel, but the profitability is stayed very consistent with what we have been experiencing, but we don't give exact margins for that, but it has been very consistent year-over-year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: But it is a positive number.\nWade Steel: It's very consistent, yes, so it's a little bit up, yes.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Can you just remind me what is the aircraft CapEx that's left this year, the gross CapEx number and does any of that trickles into 2019?\nRob Simmons: Hi, Duane, it's Rob here. So we've got eight more E175 that will take delivery of by the end of the year. So that's roughly going to translate into a $150 million or so of new debt that will serve us or that will put on in somewhere in the neighborhood of $35 million of equity and deposits that will deploy against those. So in terms of aircraft CapEx, this sort of brings us to the end of our E175 delivery stream and as Wade mentioned, we'll have a total of 146 on property by the end of the year. With respect to non aircraft CapEx, again that will continue to run somewhere in the neighborhood of $25 million to $35 million a quarter just as that's historical.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And so that's how you're thinking about 2019 at this point.\nRob Simmons: That's right. I mean as I mentioned it's like this year in 2018 we spent close to $160 million of our own cash in acquiring new airplanes. In 2019 that numbers going to be barely close to zero depending on what happens but this is one of our thesis that I hope came through clear on our call today that we would expect to be generating very significant cash over the next several years.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: What is your target cash level? Is this a level that feels about right or do you want it to build to some higher level?\nRob Simmons: With respect to our balance sheet, Duane, I mean the thing that's most important to us is being disciplined about how we deploy our capital and making sure that we've got the liquidity. And the debt availability for whatever opportunities comes our way. So we're very comfortable that we're in that place right now that we have more than adequate liquidity for whatever future opportunities, the future may hold for us, but we don't have a specific number in mind. We're just going to be disciplined about the organic growth that we do. And to the extent that we consider ourselves having excess capital, and we'll look at ways to return that effectively to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends in the future.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks Rob. And then just one last one. What is your high single digit earnings guidance assumes for buybacks next year?\nRob Simmons: So I would say that we would --this is a conversation that will obviously have with our board and we do regularly, but we would expect to continue to buy into next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes with Conor Cunningham from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hey, guys. Just to drill down a little bit on your confidence in the 50% offset to the pilot contract next year. Can you just, I know you mentioned a little bit on the leasing side of engines but how much of it will actually be done via like flying on prorate or short-term contracts. First like parting out and the whole engine leasing stuff that you were talking about. And the only reason why I'm asking I'm just trying to figure out if there's any stickiness to that type of revenue going forward.\nWade Steel: So, Connor, this is Wade. So as far as the offsets that there's, we have almost 500 airplanes; 450 some odd airplanes that operated SkyWest Airlines. And with those airplanes, we have lots of contract renewals that are constantly taking place. And as part of those contract renewals that we're doing and we've even done a lot of those pilot costs are baked into those contract renewals. So we believe there is some stickiness to it. There is also on certain provisions in some of our contracts that we reset the rates every few years. And some of those cost, obviously the pilot cost will be baked into those rate resets as well. And it will have stickiness to it so.\nChip Childs: And Connor this is Chip. I think part of the process here to clarify is as we review our business model with our partners, it's important for us to have good strong transparency at the onset of our strategic approach to managing the fleet. So it's not just even pilot costs. I think one of the things that we've improved on over the past several years is our ability to be transparent and work very creatively with our partners no matter what the issue that being pilot compensation or maintenance things or and those types of things that moves forward. So we really do think we have a best practice in place and how we work with our partners and make sure we their needs and the constructs of what we're talking about here.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, great. And then just on the balance sheet a little bit. So we're going to be paying down a quite a bit of debt in 2019-2020 given your cash flow. Is there a leverage target that you want to get to or that you like think about that would be adequate for you guys, it's like still have like liquidity to go do whatever you want if incremental growth kind of was out there?\nRob Simmons: Yes, Connor, this is Rob. So again as I mentioned, it looks right now based on our view of the market that our debt should peak at the end of this year in the neighborhood of about $3.2 billion from a leverage standpoint. That's going to put us somewhere in the 0.62 range and again the important thing for me is not the absolute number, but it's what that translates into in terms of access to capital in the market. And I think as you've seen leverage has not been a problem for us with all of the new airplanes that we've brought into service over the last year. We've gone from a year ago our leverage was 0.64 at the end of Q3, 2017. We've actually come down in leverage between growing building up our equity piece and just the normal amortization that comes, the pay down that comes as part of these fully amortizing debt structures that we've been exclusively using over the past few years. So right now we feel like we've got access to any capital market that we need. And we've got the liquidity and access to market that could provide for any new opportunities, new organic opportunities that might come our way. But that said, if again without any new orders coming in 2019, there will be $300 million to $400 million of debt per year come off our balance sheet just as a natural de-levering as a result of the fully amortizing structure. \nConor Cunningham: Great and just last one, what's your underlying assumption on the fleet at the end of 2019? And is it safe to assume that you'll see increased aircraft utilization in 2019 given your transition to E175 and so on? Thanks again guys.\nChip Childs: Yes, so the fleet, we anticipate the fleet to be somewhere around 575 airplanes at the end of 2018. We expect a little bit of growth in there probably somewhere around 3% to 4% just with some of this new airplanes that are coming in. And to your point here, Connor, on the utilization as we take out planes that our 50 seat aircraft, the utilization on those airplanes are less than the 175. So we do expect to see a little bit of an uptick in the -- to block our utilization as we go forward.\nConor Cunningham: And just to be clear that moves into 2019 as well, so we should like to continue to expect like utilization to improve and I mean obviously the fleet -like will continue to shrink a little bit I assume. Just any additional color there. I know you just kind of quoted 2018 numbers but I didn't know if you had anything for 201 as well.\nChip Childs: Yes. So in 2018 where we'll go there'll be a little bit of shrinkage on the 50 seat side, but then we'll also have the new aircraft coming in. And so we should be very consistent. It may be a point or two higher year-over-year.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chip Childs for any closing remarks.\nChip Childs: All right, thank you and thank you all for joining us on the call today. We continue to be excited about executing our business plan remain, make sure we remain flexible and ensure that we're best positioned for long-term opportunities.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please also note, today's event is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin.\nRob Simmons: Thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Rob Simmons, SkyWest's Chief Financial Officer. On the call with me today are Chip Childs, President and Chief Executive Officer, Wade Steel, Chief Commercial Officer, Eric Woodward, Chief Accounting Officer, Mike Thompson, SkyWest Airlines' Chief Operating Officer and Terry Vais, ExpressJet Airlines' Chief Operating Officer. I would like to start today by asking Eric to read the Safe Harbor. Then I will turn the time over to Chip for some comments. Following Chip, I will take us through the financial results. Then Wade will discuss the fleet and related flying arrangements. Following Wade, we will have the customary Q&A session with our sell-side analysts. Eric?\nEric Woodward: Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Actual results will likely vary and may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected for a number of reasons. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are included in our 2017 Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I will turn the call over to Chip.\nChip Childs: Thank you, Rob and Eric. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us on the call today. SkyWest had a strong second quarter as outlined in our press release. Much of that strength can be attributed to disciplined execution of our fleet transition as well as the solid operating performance of our teams. As we have discussed in previous calls, this year was planned to be a very busy year with a lot of fleet movement. Overall, both SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet performed well during the second quarter and we are pleased at how well our team is executing through all the transition. We operated approximately 255,000 flights during the second quarter with very strong operating reliability. Both SkyWest airlines and ExpressJet delivered exceptional 99.9% controllable completion factor despite experiencing both late winter and early summer storms across their networks during the quarter. Our professionals are the best in the business and I want to thank them for their great work during the second quarter. Our new agreements with Delta, United and American demonstrate our continued ability to turn strong demand for our products into strong flying contracts and extensions. This movement and progress is setting up well for 2019, 2020 and beyond. Strategically, we continue reducing risk across our business, including fleet tail risk, operating risk and contract risk. This focus is essential to both our short and long-term success. Our 50 seat fleet remains competitive differentiator for SkyWest and demand for that product is as strong as ever, although we continue to see high demand for our dual class product as well. The introduction of the E175SC has gone well and we continue taking delivery of those and other E175 aircraft through year-end. We expect these aircraft will continue to create solid growth and cash flow in 2018 and beyond. Additionally with the developments during the second quarter and continued progress we are making at ExpressJet, we believe we are finally getting that entity to a place for modest profitability in 2019. We will provide more information on that progress next quarter. We anticipate ExpressJet will be in all 50 seat operation by early next year. Wade will share more specifics on the total fleet in a minute. Looking ahead, we are focused on maintaining our strong balance sheet and liquidity. We also believe our fleet flexibility remains key to unlocking new opportunities and help mitigate the various risks I talked about earlier. Our multiyear fleet transition has allowed us to eliminate problematic contracts and better meet the evolving needs of our major airline partners. The remainder of 2018, we stayed busy with our fleet transition and as we discussed should set us up well for a strong 2019 and beyond. We remain focused on disciplined execution of our strategic business objectives, including operational excellence, fleet transitions, risk mitigation and balance sheet strength. Again, I want to thank our 17,000 aviation professionals for their excellent work during the second quarter. Rob?\nRob Simmons: Today, we reported net income of $76 million or $1.43 per share for the second quarter of 2018, up from net income of $50 million or $0.95 per share from the second quarter of 2017. Pretax income of $98 million during Q2 was up 21% from $81 million in Q2 2017. Revenue was $806 million in Q2 2018, up $14 million from Q2 2017. This increase in revenue included the net impact of adding 23 new E175 aircraft since Q2 2017, partially offset by the removal of 66 unprofitable or less profitable aircrafts over the same period. Our total fuel cost per gallon averaged $2.63 during the second quarter, up from $1.93 per gallon in Q2 2017. The line item in our P&L for aircraft fuel was $10 million higher than a year ago, reflecting both the higher rate and higher volume under our prorate business model. Just a reminder that approximately 90% of our model is not subject to fuel risk. Our effective tax rate in Q2 was 23% compared to 37.5% last year at this time with the year-over-year difference being obviously driven by the new tax law. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25% for the second half of the year and into next year. Let me say a couple of things about our balance sheet, an important point of differentiation in our model. We ended the quarter with cash of $649 million, up slightly from $646 million last quarter. We issued $282 million in new long-term debt during Q2 financing 14 new E175s. Total debt as of June 30, 2018 was $3 billion, up from $2.8 billion last quarter. SkyWest used $50 million in cash toward equity for new planes and $35 million in other CapEx. Non-aircraft acquisition capital spending in the second half of 2018 should continue to run in the $25 million to $35 million per quarter range. With the remaining 20 E175s expected to be delivered this year, we plan to invest $70 million of our own capital and raise approximately $400 million in new term debt by the end of the year for these planes. We expect that by the end of 2018, our debt will be approximately $3.2 billion, up only $200 million from where we are now, because of the $200 million in normal principal payments embedded in our fully amortizing term debt over the next two quarters. Assuming an end of 2018 peak in debt with no additional orders for airplanes, we expect that in 2019 and 2020, we will continue to pay down debt in excess of $300 million per year. We would expect cash at the end of 2018 to be up from where we are now, including our plan in the second half to reinvest $70 million of this year's free cash flow in equity toward another 20 airplanes by the end of the year. During Q2, we did not repurchase any incremental stock under our three-year $100 million repurchase program authorized by our Board last year. We still have $70 million in authorization remaining under this program and expect to fully utilize it. The second half of 2018 is expected to be very busy from a fleet perspective as we execute the new contracts and extensions that we reported earlier today. We would expect earnings per share in the second half to be similar to the first half earnings per share of $2.46 because of all the fleet movements and transitions in the second half. Wade will now take you through the newly inked agreements and extensions we announced today and give you some color on the fleet movements in the second half of the year. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you Rob. I will first give an update to our flying agreements and related fleet and then discuss the implementation of these changes. During the quarter, we reached an agreement with Delta to operate 20 new Bombardier CRJ900s under a nine-year flying contract. The aircraft will be acquired by Delta under a previously announced agreement with Bombardier and will be operated by SkyWest Airlines, SkyWest Airlines anticipates taking delivery of these 20 CRJ900s from the second half of 2018 through 2020. These aircraft will replace 20 CRJ700s scheduled to expire under SkyWest Airlines' flying contract with Delta during the same time period. We also took delivery of 10 E175SC aircraft under our Delta agreement during the quarter. We anticipate the arrival of 17 additional E175s during the last six months of the year for a total of 30 E175SCs under contract with Delta at year-end. We further developed our partnership with American during the quarter by securing a new agreement to place 20 CRJ700s under a four-year contract. These aircraft are expected to be sourced from within our existing fleet. The first aircraft in this agreement was placed into service in June 2018 and all 20 aircraft are scheduled for service by early 2019. We extended an existing agreement and secured a new agreement with United during the second quarter as well. We agreed to extend 19 CRJ700s operated by SkyWest Airlines for an additional three years. These aircraft were previously scheduled for expiration during mid-2019 and 2020. As a result of this extension, all of our dual-class aircraft operating for United are under long-term agreements. Separately, we agreed to a three-year contract for ExpressJet to operate 20 used CRJ200s for United. The 20 CRJ200s are expected to be sourced from within our existing fleet through contract expirations with other partners. These aircraft are expected to be placed into service with United between September 2018 and early 2019. We expect that by early 2019 ExpressJet will enjoy additional operating efficiencies by flying exclusively for United under long-term agreements. Under our Alaska partnership, we received four E175s during the quarter. We anticipate taking three additional E175s during the third quarter, after which will have 32 E175s under contract with Alaska. With all of these fleet movement and contract changes, we do anticipate some transition noise in the third and fourth quarters. First, transitioning 20 CRJ200s to ExpressJet United operation will result in some incremental operating cost associated with bridging the aircraft, delivery changes and maintenance as well as crew location changes. We also anticipate some aircraft downtime as we transition 20 CRJ700s to the American contract, primarily to accommodate the aircraft delivery change. Additionally as part of our agreement to wind down ExpressJet's dual-class Delta connection flying, all Delta owned aircraft, including 28 CRJ900s and three CRJ700s have been returned to Delta. We anticipate completing the removal of the ExpressJet owned CRJ700s from Delta service by the end of the year. For the short-term, we expect to retain the majority of these aircraft under our various American flying agreements with some transition expense. However, since we own these aircraft with very little debt remaining, we are evaluating various options for these aircraft, including selling, leasing to third parties or utilizing or selling their parts. Separately, we expect that the 18 CRJ700s flown by ExpressJet for American will not be extended beyond early 2019. These 18 CRJ700s include 12 aircraft from the original contract with American and six short-term aircraft that transitioned from the Delta contract. The majority of these aircraft are leased with no tail risk. We expect to return these aircraft to the lessors by early 2019. As Chip and Rob have discussed, the fleet movement is part of our broader strategy to reduce our overall risk and improve our model. As I have outlined, we are going to be busy with fleet transitions in the second half of the year. The net impact of all these fleet movement and agreements in the second half of 2018 and early 2019 leave us with a smaller, more efficient ExpressJet operation, continue to reduce overall tail risk and positions us well for 2019 and beyond.\nRob Simmons: Okay. Operator, we are ready for the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Linenberg: Hi everybody. I have a couple questions here. The 20 CRJ700s that are coming out of Delta, are those airplanes that are owned by Delta and so they are just going back to Delta? Are they SkyWest airplanes?\nWade Steel: Hi Michael. This is Wade.\nMichael Linenberg: Hi Wade.\nWade Steel: Hi. So those 20 CRJ700s that are flying at SkyWest for Delta, those are all SkyWest owned or SkyWest controlled aircraft and the majority transitioning to the American contract.\nMichael Linenberg: I see. So it's the majority are coming to that. Okay. My second question is to just go back and to touch on what Rob said about the P&L impact for the second half of the year. Presumably there's a lot of puts and takes but net net it sounds like there is more positives than negatives. And when I say negatives, it's the transition cost, right, because you said, what we should anticipate for the second half of the year is similar to what you were able to achieve from an earnings perspective in the first half of 2018. Is that right? The right way to look at it?\nRob Simmons: That's right, Michael. And we were expecting to take delivery of 20 more E175s by the end of the year. But there is also going to be some transition expense related to some of these other fleet movements that Wade was talking about. So net net, we would expect the second half of the year to look a lot like the first half.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. And then just lastly, there were airplanes out there that had to be replaced as of the last call. These were airplanes that were coming out of Delta and I believe there were some airplanes that were also coming out of American. It sounds like some of the airplanes that ExpressJet flies, I believe, for American that are coming out, you indicated there is no tail risk, in the sense that they are coming up I guess on the lease terminations, so you will just return them. Can you just give us a sense of what the number of aircraft and type that still has to be placed somewhere? Are these the airplanes that you said that you would potentially part out or sell? What's that number and what's the date? So for example, we get to what? March quarter of 2019? And you have gone through all these machinations? What's left? What's left to either be placed and or sold? Just trying to get a feel for what aircraft you are ultimately liable for?\nWade Steel: Michael, this is Wade again. I will go over just a little bit. Like you said, there was a lot of fleet movement that we talked about. The American side, there are 12 planes that go back to the lessors and there is no tail risk. Of the Delta ones that ExpressJet that we were talking about, number one, what I would say on those your aircraft, there is very little debt and the debt that is remaining is very attractively financed. So it's going to give us a lot of great opportunities with those aircraft, whether to lease, sell or do something with those. To really answer your question, the exposure that we have we get about half of the airplanes. So somewhere in the range of 12 to 15 become available and it's in the middle of 2019 where we start out that exposure.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. So that's actually really helpful because at some point, we are up to like 30 or 40 airplanes that were looking for homes based on what has been announced up to this point in time. And so now it sounds like you found a home for a lot of those airplanes. You have got new opportunities with the new CRJ900s coming in with the atmosphere cabin, et cetera. So that's actually very helpful. So at the end of the day, it's slightly more than a dozen airplanes that you will be dealing with in mid-2019. My last question, how should we think about the profitability of the CRJ900s coming from Delta since they own those airplanes? So you are not going to be taking a margin on ownership because Delta is the one who bears that burden or cost. As airplanes overall going to be, I guess they will be less margin accretive or less profitable, but I am trying to figure out, are they half as profitable than bringing a wholly-owned E175SC and leasing that to or operating that on behalf of Delta or United? How should we think about that?\nWade Steel: Michael, this is Wade again. Yes. So there is 20 of those CRJ900s that are coming in. Delta will be owning all of those. And to your point, Delta is providing all the capital associated with that, all of the down payment, the debt. So there will be no capital. So our return would be less than what it is on a wholly-owned 175. But we won't get into the specifics about how much --\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. All right. Fair enough. Okay. That helped me out. Thanks..\nWade Steel: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.\nHelane Becker: Thank you operator. I appreciate the time. Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question or questions. Okay. So I just had a couple. One, on some of your aircraft that are leased in from Bombardier, are there opportunities to improve the lease terms on those aircraft?\nWade Steel: So I would say, Helane, we have a couple of pockets of opportunity that we are looking at in our fleet on some of our older and more expensive leased airplanes. And like we announced last quarter where we had successfully refinanced one chunk of it in an accretive way, we are going to continue to look for opportunities to do that. But as of today, I don't have any new news. So that is one area of potential capital deployment that we are interested in pursuing.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then my other question is with respect to this $1.245 million line item underneath other income loss. What's that?\nRob Simmons: Yes. If you remember last quarter, we had an equity investment that we mark-to-market, this quarter we had another mark-to-market. It was positive the first time around and negative this time. But the net of that was a capital gain for us, which is nice, which is one of the things that help drive our tax rate lower. But that equity investment has now been fully monetized and the gain fully realized. So there shouldn't be any more noise related to that going forward.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Well, obviously, I didn't remember that So thank you for clearing that up for me. And my last question maybe is, have you talked to United at all about the new E175s that they are taking?\nChip Childs: Yes. Helane, this is Chip.\nHelane Becker: Hi Chip.\nChip Childs: I would say, we clearly have talked to them about it, yes. We really don't have anything to discuss relative to what we know about those E175. As we talked about with Delta, there certainly is a bit of a trend for the major carriers to own the aircraft this way. And I don't know that United has necessarily decided the operator. I know that all of us are very interested in it. We are very interested in it and working with them on ways to potentially see if there is something that we can provide for them on those. But as you know, we are very disciplined in our approach and we may not win everything. And sometimes we don't want to win everything. So we are going to approach it with the same strategic things that we have in mind with the other parts of our business that we pursue and hope that something may come of those. But if not, we still, as you can tell from what we have talked about on the call, we have got a lot going on still. So we will keep you informed as we know anything.\nHelane Becker: That's great. Thank you. And then I just have one last question about something, I don't know if you said this or Wade said this, but when you talked about moving crews around, like obviously you have got all these moving parts, all these aircraft tucked to go different places you now, Americans have this different from United or Delta. Do you worry about, I don't know, operating in a different location with weather and other issues because remember a bunch of years ago you guys were, like United had you all over the map and your metrics, completion factor, reliability and so on fell, in part because they just kept changing the schedule on you arbitrarily. So I know it's a long-winded question, but have you been able to work out with them that they are not going to just move your equipment here, there and everywhere without some reliability for yourselves?\nChip Childs: Yes. Helane, that's an excellent point because if you go to our website and you look at the consolidated fleet map, there are very few airports we don't fly to and we have a tremendous amount of destinations in every single major city that we fly to and several of the smaller cities that we fly to have their own set of unique operational challenges. And no two airports are the same. So we can say that part of our transition about what we have discussed with risk and managing contracts and meeting the needs of our partners, all of this has been developed over time within various contracts to make sure that we contemplate the dynamic ability for SkyWest to be agile. I mean, I think in our world it's all about agility, being able to respond to partners, but also making sure that we have transparency within the contracts that contemplate any additional cost. Sometimes there is cost savings in these things. And so, the evolution of our contracts over the last decade plus has started to contemplate items of weather, ATC, airport operations, unique local challenges. And so as we talk about reducing risk, this is a big element of what we have done through what to our partners. So we are comfortable about it. Are there preferences of where we would like to fly? No question. But that having been said, our number one priority is making sure we deliver what our partners need.\nHelane Becker: Great. Thank you very much for those answers. I really appreciate it.\nChip Childs: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.\nSavi Syth: Hi. Good afternoon everyone. Just a couple of questions here. On the transition, I know there is a lot or moving parts here, could you talk about like when that becomes really intensive and when we should see some of that start to abate and understanding that you might have new announcements going forward and that might change the picture? But as it stands today, when does the transition costs, like when does that peak and when does that start to kind of taper off?\nWade Steel: Yes. Savi, this is Wade. So as far as the transition costs, it really starts to kick off for real starting in September and it will really peak in October, November, December timeframe and then it starts to taper off in the first part of the year.\nSavi Syth: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe this is, Wade, for you again too. On the CRJ200s that are being placed with ExpressJet or even with another CRJ that maybe replace that one, is that at similar economics as the E145s? Or how should we think about that? And then even like extensions that you talked about, do those get extended at the current rates or is there any improvement as they have gotten extended?\nWade Steel: Well, Savi, this is Wade again. I will just talk a little bit about the CRJ200s. The 200s are a little bit different model than the 145s. We will own the aircraft. So it's a little bit different. The economics are similar to what we will get on the 145s next year. And then as far of the extensions, we work with all of our partners to deal with our anticipated cost and such going forward and the new rate anticipate our anticipated cost going forward.\nSavi Syth: Got it.\nWade Steel: I think in other words, since we agreed to the extension, I think it's good for both parties. I think from our perspective, we try to predict the cost. I think everyone has a good understanding of those. That's not a difficult part of the conversation. And obviously when we get extensions that was good for us as well as United and our other partners as well.\nSavi Syth: That makes sense. Thanks. And just one last question on the cash side. So with these changes, does that change any of the use of cash for 2019? Or since this just going to be mostly moving around and there is no real purchase, 2019 cash flow is still just dry powder or return to shareholders?\nRob Simmons: Yes. Savi, this is Rob. So I think the comments that we made about cash flow definitely continue to hold through that I think cash that we are deploying this year in 2018 for the acquisition of these 39 new E175s obviously won't be repeated next year. So that's incremental cash that potentially we have next year. So think that the overall cash flow story remains very strong.\nSavi Syth: All right. Very helpful. Thanks everyone.\nRob Simmons: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve O'Hara from Sidoti. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteve O'Hara: Hi. Good afternoon.\nRob Simmons: Hi Steve.\nSteve O'Hara: Just quickly on the pilot front. Just wondering if everything's still as it was there in terms of your ability to source key pilots, et cetera?\nChip Childs: Yes. Steve, it's Chip. I think as of today, we are extremely comfortable with our pilot situation. I know we kind of refer to this every quarter, but I can say, at both airlines we are very adequately staffed, which is what generates some of the transitions that we have and have our ability to execute so well in some of these transition. So as of today, we are well staffed and continue to be optimistic.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. And then maybe, I know last quarter you talked about some things that I think you would talk to initially about sub $4.50 per year and then I think it was at a quarter of that and now it looks like we are close to $5. And just on the things that came together, did everything come together that was kind of you were hoping to get done? Or there are still a few bogeys out there that could be more incremental? And then just relative to that, it looks like the block hour guidance dropped down a little bit. I am just wondering, it seems like if everything came together, is that just the transition cost and noise you are talking about?\nRob Simmons: Let me talk a little bit about the quarter. I think you know that we obviously had very strong production this quarter and it was strong in the right areas. Since all block hours are not created equal. Obviously, we were pleased with our operating performance and our production during the quarter. But vis-\u00e0-vis the comments we made about the second half, as you know, as Wade talked about, a lot of this transition movement that we talked about is really in the second half of the year. So when you think of it in terms of the full-year, most of that incremental operating expense from some of that friction will be in the second half of year. Thus our guidance the way that it was.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. And then just obviously the other aircraft that come up over time and things like that, are you more confident today that you can work with your partners and there's demand for those aircraft based on what you have done so far? How do you feel on that? And that's my last question. Thank you.\nChip Childs: Thanks, Steve. This is Chip. I will give a comment I think of what you are referring to about overall demand and we have got, it seems like every quarter we come up with some transition opportunities, some new flying opportunities. I would go back and just reiterate that our strategy continues to be the same and has yielded great results so far when we are discipline, when we engage our partners' needs. I can say there is a lot of things that we don't do that sometimes they want us to do. And there is a lot of things that we are eager to do as long as we can work together and meet the demands for what they have. I don't doubt that if we continue to stay disciplined with our existing strategy, take care of our people, do it in a safe manner and be the top operator, that demand in the next year, two or three years is going to continue to stay very, very solid. And I think it's reflective of a couple of factors. It's our view of the economy. It's our view of the traveling public and the demands on travel over the next several years. So from our perspective, we think we have got a good formula that two years ago, I don't know I would be saying that would be here talking about the exact same things that we are talking about. But we can see very clearly, it's reflective of a very disciplined strategy that we have been able to execute. And we can't do what we are doing without the best 17,000 aviation professionals in the entire country and we have these things going for us. And so I think that for a long answer to your very short question is we are optimistic about what we can do, what's out there from a demand perspective as long as we are disciplined and continue to execute the same strategic ways that we have.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call over to Chip Childs for any closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Thanks Jamie. Thanks everyone for your interest in SkyWest. We are we are very, very happy with the results this quarter. We are humbled and grateful to be associated with such great partners, outstanding aviation professionals throughout our companies and we look forward to updating you further the next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for attending.

Our fleeting business plan continued to move forward and we accepted a number of new E175 aircraft, including the first of our E175 special configuration aircraft for a Delta operation. I want to thank our more than 17,000 professionals for their ongoing commitment to delivering an exceptional product during the quarter. We operated during the quarter approximately 250,000 flights with strong operating reliability. SkyWest Airlines delivered 99.8% adjusted completion factor and ExpressJet despite being affected by severe weather in their East Coast operations delivered an impressive 99.9% completion when adjusted for that weather. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we continue to see very strong demand for both our 50-seat and dual-class products. We anticipate an additional 34 E175s on property by year-end and expect these aircraft will continue to create solid growth and cash flow in 2018 and beyond. Specific to our ExpressJet business, I want to remind you as we\u2019ve mentioned in our previous guidance, we do not expect at any of the breakeven this year. However they\u2019re making strong progress and as this quarter\u2019s operational performance shows they are more focused than ever with a smaller footprint. This progress sets them up well for 2019 improvement. We also continue working through opportunities in some of our legacy contracts and financing of aircraft, which Rob and Wade will provide more color on in just a minute. This is a critical part of our evolution as we focus on reducing terrorist going to improving economics. From a big picture perspective, both within our organization across the industry, we continue to see solid opportunity and demand. As we\u2019ve discussed previously 2018 is another busy year in our fleet transition that\u2019s just set us up well for a very strong 2019 and beyond. We\u2019re looking ahead to a busy summer and remain focused on our discipline execution of our strategic business objectives. Again I want to thank our 17,000 aviation professionals for their outstanding work during the quarter. Rob?\nRob Simmons: Today, we reported net income of $54 million or $1.03 per share for the first quarter of 2018, up from net income of $35 million or $0.65 earnings per share from the first quarter of 2017. Pretax income of $67 million during Q1 was up 28% from $52 million in Q1 2017. Revenue was $783 million in Q1 2018, up $36 million from Q1 2017. This increase in revenue included the net impact of adding 19 new E175 aircraft since Q1 2017, partially offset by the removal of 71 unprofitable or less-profitable aircraft over the same period, including 46 50-seat aircraft. Our total fuel cost per gallon averaged $2.40 during the first quarter, up from $2.01 per gallon in Q1 2017. The line item in our P&L for aircraft fuel was $9 million higher pretax than a year ago, reflecting both the higher rate and higher volume under our prorate business model. Just a reminder that over 90% of our model is not subject to fuel risk. Similar to Q1 last year, where we had a tax provision about 4 points lower than the annual rate, because of new accounting rules around equity compensation this quarter is 19% effective tax rate was also several points lower than what we would expect for the rest of the year. The lower provision in Q1 was primarily driven both last year and this year by the fact that we had certain equity grants invest during the first quarter. We would expect this pattern and trend to continue as our board typically only issues new grants once a year during the first quarter. The timing and amount of future related tax impact on our provision will vary based on restricted share vesting, stock price performance, stock option exercises and other factors. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25% for the remaining three quarters of the year. The full year should still be in the 24% to 25% neighborhood as we estimated last quarter. This quarter we recorded a net gain of $3 million in other income that was a mark-to-market gain on an investment net of other items. Let me say a couple of things about our balance sheet, an important point of differentiation in our model. We ended the quarter with cash of $646 million, down from $685 million last quarter and up from $586 million last year at this time. We issued $160 million in long-term debt during Q1 2018, financing five new E175s and acquiring nine used aircraft off of lease. Total debt as of March 31, 2018 was $2.8 billion, up slightly from last quarter. SkyWest used $38 million in cash toward equity for new planes and planes acquired of lease. $30 in other CapEx along with $10 million in cash for share repurchases. Non-aircraft acquisition capital spending in 2018 should continue to run in the $20 million to $30 million per quarter range. With the remaining 34 E175 expected to be delivered this year, we plan to invest $120 million of our own capital and raise approximately $675 million in new term debt by the end of the year for these planes. We expect to by the end of 2018, our debt will be approximately $3.2 billion, up only $400 million from where we are now, because of the $275 million in normal principal payments embedded in our fully amortizing term debt over the next three quarters. Assuming an end of 2018 peak in debt and no additional new orders for airplanes, we expect that in 2019 and 2020, we will continue to pay down debt in excess of $300 million per year. We would expect cash at the end of 2018 to be up from where we are now, including our plan to invest $120 million of this year\u2019s free cash flow in equity toward another 34 new airplanes by the end of the year. We will continue to explore accretive opportunities to deploy the free cash flow we are generating. As I referenced earlier, during Q1 we repurchased another $10 million in stock under our three year $100 million repurchase program authorized by the board last year. We now have $70 million in authorization remaining under this program and expect to fully utilize it. 2018 is expected to be another busy year for us with many fleet movements as Wade will discuss in a moment. But we finished today with a little commentary on capital allocation. Earlier, I made reference to a small transaction, where we had the opportunity this quarter to acquire nine aircraft off of lease. Negotiating our way out of an unattractive inflexible lease structure and reducing our financing tail risk, the $20 million in equity capital, but we deployed in that transaction will drive a $0.07 annual EPS benefit to 2019 and beyond and represent a 25% pretax return on capital. This is just another example of the type of opportunities we are exploring to drive value creation through accretive financial engineering and risk reduction within our legacy fleet. Because of all the ins and outs around the fleet in 2018, last quarter we made the comment that we would expect our earnings per share to come in under $4.50 for 2018. Including our actual GAAP results in Q1, we would update last quarter\u2019s comments by adding another $0.25 to that number. Wade?\nWade Steel: Thank you, Rob. I\u2019ll first review our fleet changes during Q1 and then discuss our current fleet expectations for the rest of 2018. From year-end 2017 to March 31, 2018, we successfully moved from 595 total aircraft to 580 total aircraft in our fleet. Specifically, we added five new E175 to our fleet during the quarter. As of the end of Q1, we had 65 E175s under contract with United, 25 with Alaska and 23 with Delta, bringing our total E175 fleet to 112. We anticipate taking delivery of 16 E175s during Q2, 13 during Q3 and 5 during Q4. At Alaska\u2019s request, we have agreed to defer three E175s previously scheduled for delivery during the fourth quarter of 2018 until 2021. As we discussed last quarter, ExpressJet have extended its United ERJ145 contract for five years effective January 1, 2018. The new agreement enhances ExpressJet-United\u2019s partnership, significantly reduces contract risk and provides long-term stability to its model. As of March 31, 2018, we had 100 ERJ145s under contract with United. As part of our agreement to wind down ExpressJets dual-class Delta connection flying, 22 CRJ900 has been returned to Delta as of the first quarter. We anticipate returning to remaining six CRJ900 by the end of the second quarter. We also began removing ExpressJet remaining 33 CRJ700 from Delta service during the quarter. The three Delta owned CRJ700s have been returned to Delta. We own the remaining 30 CRJ700s, eight of which we expect to redeploy under our American contract. Our Q4 forecast assumes these 22 aircraft will not be renewed. However, conversations regarding placement of the remaining 22 SkyWest owned CRJ700s are positive and we remain confident that they will be placed prior to their expiration at the end of 2018. On the SkyWest airline side, we also have several CRJ200 contracts expiring during 2018. Our partners demand for 50-seat flying remains strong, we are working with each of them to meet their 50-seat needs. During the quarter, we added eight CRJ200s to the United contract. Our fleet strategy continues producing tangible results to our model and overall profitability. As we\u2019ve discussed, we expect fleet transition to continue throughout 2018 as we place new aircraft into service and continue to deliver on our commercial agreements. Okay. Operator, we\u2019re now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon. I just have some couple of questions on the fleet data you had by a year-end here. I notice that with the CRJ900/CRJ700 numbers, they don\u2019t necessarily go down by an additional 30 by the end of the year. Is that a function of \u2013 the timing of things coming out with Delta or is that some level of confidence that [indiscernible]\nWade Steel: Hi Savi, this is Wade. So what in our CRJ700/CRJ900 lines as I talk about my script there is still six more CRJ900 that will be removed during Q2. There are also some other 7s and there is also some other CRJ700s and CRJ900s that are going away. The 22 are going away in this model as well what we have in the pressure release. And so if we are able to place those, that will be upside.\nSavi Syth: Okay. So its adjusting from \u2013 I think it was like 169 to 140, okay. So that\u2019s the 29 just coming down.\nWade Steel: Yes. That\u2019s right.\nSavi Syth: Okay. And then the CRJ200 just wondering how many you\u2019re flying with prorate \u2013 has a prorate number increase at all and with the \u2013 king of the ones that you place with United, how long of those contracts going at?\nWade Steel: Yes. So this is way again Savi. So as far as the prorate, it\u2019s very consistent with what we have in the past, its about 10% of our total fleet. And then on the United side, the 8 CRJ200, it is a two-year contract that we sign off those yet.\nSavi Syth: Okay. And then just somewhat a question on pilot supply, could you just provide kind of update on what you\u2019re seeing from hiring an attrition on that side. And I thought I heard that maybe can ExpressJet has an agreement with United for a path through, at least interview on that front and they can \u2013 is there more opportunity to do things like that?\nChip Childs: Thanks, Savi. This is Chip. Yes, let me just make a couple of quick observations about pilot supply, I think as we usually update relative to our current position with pilots, I can tell you that right now we\u2019re still in a very good position. Going into the summer, we feel very comfortable being able to fly with what we have forecasted and being able to meet our partners need. The ever changing pilot supply model, we do see things that are happening within the pipeline. I believe the longer that we continue to go down the pathway of dealing with this struggle, the pipeline gradually continues to grow. It\u2019s not necessarily growing as fast as what probably should, but we are \u2013 we spent a lot of time and energy and effort with schools and the front end of our pipeline of both of the \u2013 both carriers to make sure that we\u2019ve got a good strong recruiting footprint and we\u2019re still \u2013 we still continue to be optimistic about. ExpressJet does have a pathway with United relative to the 50-seat flying that they do. And it\u2019s been something that I think is that\u2019s been able to provide some good clarity for those pilots as they progress throughout their career. And in relation to this being an opportunity to do some additional things in the future, I think that it\u2019s safe to say that this is a dynamic enough situation that we do have a lot of conversation with our partners. All centered around making sure that we can provide for their needs in a number of different ways. This is just one of those ways we continue to have a conversation with. So look we\u2019re optimistic. We\u2019re not oblivious that it can continue to be an issue, but we spend a significant amount of time and effort making sure that we can honor the good commitments that we have with our major carriers.\nSavi Syth: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes. Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Hey Rob, just a quick question, you mentioned in the other again on a small investment a few million dollars. What is that? What is that again?\nRob Simmons: Its just a small investment they had a mark-to-market on it during the quarter net of a couple other items in that line item, but that it\u2019s $3 million net.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. So what \u2013 can you tell us the nature of the investment or now that\u2026\nRob Simmons: It\u2019s just an equity investment that we had.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, okay. And then my second question is Chip, when you were characterizing ExpressJet, I just want to make sure I heard this right that I think you said that ExpressJet was what on track to either be breakeven this year or that its results would not any better than breakeven. How did you characterize? I just want to get a sense of what \u2013 I know this is there\u2019s a little bit of a transition there, but what\u2019s the view on ExpressJet again I just I don\u2019t think I heard you well on for 2018.\nChip Childs: Yes. So for 2018, we\u2019ve had a good conversation about ExpressJet several quarters in a row. We continue to transition that way the main goal is to make sure that we have a transition to where it is long-term sustainable.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay.\nChip Childs: So in my script, I said that its going to not be breakeven this year. So we\u2019re still going to lose a bit of money this year.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay.\nChip Childs: As embedded within our forecast, but it\u2019s actually a significant transition this year particularly with this we\u2019re pulling out all of the Delta flying and transitioning it is to primarily United and American in one year it spend \u2013 it is taking a lot of cotton and the main reason why we\u2019re saying what we are about a losing money to share number one priority in this transition to make sure that there is no service interruption with our partners. So we can say we have pulling the fleet down that much. We have plenty of professional, maintenance and pilot and flight attendant throughout that transition to make sure that its a good, strong, solid operation during the summer and throughout the rest of your for our partners, but it does set us well to turn the other way hopefully in 2019.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. So that\u2019s what I was going to be. My next question, so it sounds like that everything that happened this year at least on paper, it should be profitable I guess on a fully allocated standalone basis in 2019, maybe not all that profitable, but still nonetheless it seems like that things should setup for it to be in the block next year. Is that a fair assessment or am I still being too aggressive?\nChip Childs: No, I think that\u2019s a pretty fair assessment and you can imagine a lot of the investments we\u2019ve made over the past couple of years to get to that point. But Michael you\u2019re pretty on track, that\u2019s a pretty fair assessment to be setup to be in the block next year.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. Thanks to answer my questions. Appreciate it.\nChip Childs: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.\nConor Cunningham: Hey guys, it\u2019s actually Connor. How are you?\nChip Childs: Hey, Connor.\nConor Cunningham: If I just had a question around scope, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion with that the network carriers regarding scope. Maybe can you just talk a little bit about how important it is to your outlook pass 2019 to see scope release your partners? Or maybe you can just talk about your expectations around that actually happening or not. Thanks.\nChip Childs: Connor, it\u2019s a great question. And I think it\u2019s one that we have set our model of really well to deal with this question of if we get scope or not, part of that strategy that we have I think we need to be prepared either way. Certainly the opinion of its scope release is going to happen in the near-term is not an answer for us to speculate on. We would love it, if it did. But we have set our model up to really, really well if it doesn\u2019t. Because I mean if you take a look at what we\u2019ve done over the past two, three, four years, it\u2019s been a really, really long time since there was any real genuine scope release I mean even back to the bankruptcy area of the major carriers pretty consolidation. So from our perspective, our mix between dual-class aircraft and 50-seat aircraft is to be able to just to respond to our partners need, which today is showing very, very good demand for both. If we do not get any scope release, then I think that we\u2019ve made all the right investments in all the right places to continue to have a good sustainable business model given the demand that scope enable that they have. And if there is scope relief in the future, in our view, that\u2019s just pure upside, but we\u2019re certainly not strategically planning or gambling on having scope relief in the near or long-term.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, great. And then, pull down prorate so obviously jet fuel has been on arise. Have you guys thought about a little bit differently this year? What\u2019s your expectation just around its profitability, if you can talk to about? Thanks.\nChip Childs: Yes. I\u2019ll give you just some very high levels about, I know there\u2019s a lot of dialogue about fuel today. I can tell you in all of the sensitivity analysis that we\u2019ve evaluated given yield, capacity and fuel. None of those three factors at least as we view it or causing us to change any direction our strategy in the near or long-term. It\u2019s hard to speculate, what\u2019s going to happen with fuel. Certainly, Rob indicated on his script that we\u2019re like 90% of our entire business model is totally immune from fuel. The prorate side of our business, we\u2019re still comfortable with what we\u2019re seeing a speculation out there a fuel prices and continue to execute as plan.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And one last one just a housekeeping one. Rob, can you just go over the transaction you did during the quarter, when you bought the aircraft I believe \u2013 I didn\u2019t \u2013 I just want to make sure heard it correctly.\nRob Simmons: Yes. It was nine aircraft that had been under sort of the long-term leverage lease type structure that we\u2019re not big fans of now. Those sort of lead structures tend to be sort of detrimental to our partner strategy is where executing this model. So we\u2019re exploring any and all opportunities to go back and cure some of those inflexible lease structures and we had a small transaction this quarter, where we were able to deploy $20 million in equity capital in an accretive way and take away the tail risk for nine additional airplanes and give ourselves more flexibility. And we\u2019ll continue to look at incremental opportunities to do that across our legacy fleet.\nConor Cunningham: How many incremental aircraft are there in your fleet that you could potentially do this left?\nRob Simmons: Well, I think that, it all is going to come down to economics. We\u2019re going to be smart about the way that we do this. Obviously, we\u2019re only going to deploy capital against opportunities like this to the extent that we can do it in an accretive way. But stay tuned, I mean we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re hopeful that there\u2019ll be more to come.\nConor Cunningham: Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steve O\u2019Hara from Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Hi, good afternoon.\nChip Childs: Hey, Steve.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Just on the \u2013 you talk about solid demand and things like that across the fleet. And maybe kind of upside and downside to your estimates, I mean your estimates but kind of projection that you updated today. I mean I guess good demand is great, I mean do you feel more confident today that you can capture some of that and I would assume beyond 50-seat side at rates that makes sense going forward. I mean, you feel more confident today that you\u2019re getting closer to something like that.\nChip Childs: Yes. Steve, it\u2019s Chip. Let me just kind of give you a parameter of what we see for demand out there. I fundamentally believe that as we\u2019ve mentioned earlier with respect to scope. We\u2019re engineering kind of our business model to be able to continue to be sustainable and successful without scope. With that, people can be concerned about scope, but if there\u2019s no scope there\u2019s still certainly demand for the regional model. And so at a very high level, Steve, I would reiterate \u2013 the demand for the regional model just the pure economics, that\u2019s out there relative to what we do for major carriers is a very, very good model today. From our perspective, we look at it in terms of what sustainable from growth and we\u2019re taking a lot of new aircraft this year in 2018 is SkyWest Airlines. And to the extent that it\u2019s probably the maximum that we can take and be able to do it in a good orderly manner. And so from \u2013 on a future perspective fundamentally look if there is scope relief, there is certainly the economics of these aircraft are very, very good, if we get scope relief. If not, then we can certainly back to a more with 50-seat. So the more likely scenario for us, if there\u2019s not scope relief, we could do a lot with 50-seat aircraft. To the extent that we have a very large fleet of them and we can continue to invest capital and then to be an extremely good product for what our business model is. So looking general term, it\u2019s hard to predict the details of where it\u2019s going to go, it\u2019s mostly our job to continue to put ourselves in a position with outstanding operating performance, good aircraft financing, discipline cost approach that meets the demanding needs of our partner. We\u2019ve seen recently that\u2019s good thing to happen as long as we\u2019re focused on those three or four elements.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. And then just go back to the pilot comments, maybe I\u2019m misreading this. But was there a change into your quarter or recently in terms of attrition or your ability to hire qualified candidates. Or is it just kind of normal diligence in that process and keeping that line of hiring going the way you needed to go.\nChip Childs: Yes, yes. So let me give a little bit more color, I probably should have done that on the previous question. I mean I think from our perspective, where we are with pilots today, we\u2019re seeing consistent attrition across to our platform, that\u2019s pretty much the same as it\u2019s been over the last couple of years. Our hiring is as strong as it\u2019s been the last couple of years and we\u2019re spending. Just as a matter of diligence, we do have a good healthy respect for what the retirements of the major carriers still are. So we do fundamentally believe that we continue to work to make the pre-regional aircraft pipeline bigger through the schools and the operators that are producing pilots for us. That\u2019s an imperative investment for us to continue to make. But as it relates to now through the near-term and our commitments with our partners, I don\u2019t want to call it status quo, but we do feel is comfortable as we ever have given the commitments that we\u2019ve got to fly. And that being said, it\u2019s also like I said before, it\u2019s a very strong year for additional E175 growth at SkyWest, which we\u2019ve got to put a lot of \u2013 lot more numbers of that. So like everything is working today, we\u2019ve got great cultures of both of our enterprises that are able to recruit with credibility and we\u2019re optimistic, but we\u2019re also extremely diligent on the front end of the pipeline as well as still as well.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. All right, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we close today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019m showing no additional questions. I\u2019d like to turn the conference call back over to Chip Childs for any closing remarks.\nChip Childs: Thanks, Jamie. Again thanks for joining us on the call today. I think in summary, we continue to remain focused on our strategic objectives by maintaining strong mainline partnerships delivering good solid operating reliability and continue to attract the best aviation professionals that are out there. We continue \u2013 as we continue to executing our business plan, we believe that there is a very strong demand for our product going forward. And look forward to meeting the demands of \u2013 needs of our customers and partners. So with that, we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."}]
