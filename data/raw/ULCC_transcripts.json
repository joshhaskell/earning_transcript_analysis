[{"symbol": "ULCC", "quarter": 3, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-10-26 18:00:28", "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Frontier Group Holdings, Inc. Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Erdman, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDavid Erdman: Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. On October 19th, we announced changes to our management team and so I'm pleased to introduce today's speakers and their new roles. With me are Barry Biffle, Chief Executive Officer; Jimmy Dempsey, President; and Mark Mitchell, Chief Financial Officer. Each will deliver brief prepared remarks, and then we'll get to your questions. But first, let me quickly review the customary Safe Harbor provisions. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those predicted in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors which could cause such differences are outlined in the announcement we released yesterday -- earlier this morning, along with reports we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to the nearest comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of the earnings announcement. So, I will give the floor to Barry to begin his prepared remarks. Barry?\nBarry Biffle: Thank you, David and good afternoon everyone. I first want to recap the recent changes to our senior leadership including the promotion of Jimmy Dempsey to President and Mark Mitchell, the CFO. Jimmy will now oversee commercial, customer care, and operations research design and planning functions and Mark will assume Jimmy's former role. Jimmy and Mark have been invaluable members of Frontier's senior leadership team over the years and I'm excited about their contributions going forward. We also welcome Rajat Khanna to Frontier as our Chief Information Officer and Matt Saks as our new Treasurer. Rajat has extensive experience, including IT leadership roles at Lowe's Companies and at United Airlines, and Matt comes to us with significant cross functional experience at Airbus. Please join me in welcoming Rajat and Matt to Frontier and congratulating Jimmy and Mark on their promotions. Frontier has a deep bench of executive talent and we're well positioned to help guide the growth of our airline into the future. Our third quarter results reflect a pre-tax loss of 5%, with non-fuel operating expenses at the low end of our guidance as we continued our rigorous focus on cost management. The quarter was impacted by elevated fuel prices, uneven demand recovery, and uneven industry domestic capacity deployment as well as increased flight cancellations from weather and other operating challenges. Additionally, we observed softer than expected demand in the off peak periods in the quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, stage adjusted non-fuel unit costs are expected to sequentially improve. We've also seen booking volume stabilize, driven by low fare stimulation, albeit at higher fuel prices. In the 2024, we believe demand pattern will normalize and industry capacity growth will moderate and rebalance across geographies. We believe unit cost leadership will be fundamental to long-term success and we expect Frontier will be the lowest cost provider of a seat in the United States for years to come. Further, operating a high utilization, highly reliable airline will be important to our success and long-term growth as well as delivering a low cost and rewarding customer experience. I'll turn the call over to Jimmy to elaborate on our plan to dramatically simplify our operating model to align with the ULCC best practices and to fuel the next stage of Frontier's scalable growth. Jimmy?\nJimmy Dempsey: Thanks Barry and good morning everyone. I will start with recapping the quarter. Total operating revenue for the third quarter was $883 million, reflecting RASM of $0.091, down 19% from a strong prior year comp on 21% capacity growth and a 2% increase in stage. Fair revenue was $39 per passenger, lower than the $58 in the 2022 quarter, primarily due to the impact the additional capacity -- industry capacity concentrated in certain of our key markets, weakness in the off peak periods, and heightened flight installations resulting from weather and continued challenges in the operating environment. In contrast, ancillary revenue was $76 per passenger, only 3% down from the prior year quarter, demonstrating the resilient nature of our suite of ancillary products and services. While we have achieved the highest utilization in the industry this year, it's been challenging to reach higher utilization due to the post-COVID operating environment, including ATC staffing challenges and reliability that is underperformed as a result. In my new role, one of the primary objectives is to plan and allocate resources to achieve improved reliability, resulting in our ability to operate at high utilization and deliver lower costs. Transitioning to a more simplified operating design will result in industry-leading low costs, higher reliability and the best value proposition in the industry. After careful analysis, we have determined that simplifying our business in a manner similar to European ULCCs will provide improved reliability and enabled the airline to make continued progress toward pre-COVID utilization levels, despite similar operating issues experienced over the past decade. This essentially means returning aircraft to base nightly. As we expect consumers will seek greater value in travel, we recently launched Get It All For Less. As a first step, we've enhanced the Frontier Miles program to be revenue based, rewarding customers for fair and ancillary purchases. We've expanded our elite status levels to incorporate many new features, including waves, change and cancel fees, free bags and seat assignments and a multitude of other benefits. Additionally, elite status is more easily attained, including our gold status after spending just $3,000 on the Frontier Barclay's Mastercard. In the coming months, we expect to broaden and get it off for less to further enhance our customer value proposition. I'll now yield to Mark to provide a financial update.\nMark Mitchell: Thank you, Jimmy, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter pre-tax loss margin was 5.1%, reflecting a challenging environment as Barry covered earlier. Total revenue was $883 million, down 3% compared to the 2022 quarter and fuel expense was in line with guidance at an average cost per gallon of $3.08. Adjusted non-fuel operating expenses were $646 million or $6.66 on a unit basis, 3% lower than the 2022 quarter and an inflationary environment and at the low end of our guidance, reflecting our continued focus on costs. We have the lowest total unit costs in the industry and we are focused on continuing to maintain our cost leadership through high utilization, improved reliability, and simplification of the operation. To that end, we've identified more than $200 million of annual run rate cost savings related to fundamentally changing the way we operate as presented earlier, which we expect to be fully implemented by the end of 2024. We will provide more details as we progress through next year. We exited the quarter with $640 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalent. As a reminder, we also have access to substantial liquidity through our unencumbered loyalty and brand-related assets. We had 134 aircraft in our fleet at September 30th, after taking delivery of eight A321neo aircraft during the quarter, five of which were financed with direct leases. Two aircraft scheduled to be returned in September were delayed into early October and with another four deliveries expected in the 4th quarter, all financed through sale leaseback transactions, our forecast to exit the year with 136 aircraft is unchanged. Turning to fourth quarter guidance. Capacity growth is anticipated to be in the range of 12% to 14% over the 2022 quarter, on stage length, which is expected to average 950 miles, 8% lower than the 2022 quarter, which reflects network optimization and response today's heightened fuel prices and demand environment. Accordingly, we estimate fuel to remain elevated at $3.20 to $3.30 per gallon based on the blended fuel curve on October 24th. Adjusted non-fuel operating expenses are expected to be between $655 million to $665 million which on a stage-adjusted CASM basis is in line with the prior year and lower than the prior quarter. Taken together our adjusted pre-tax loss margin in the fourth quarter is expected to range from 6% to 9%, which at the midpoint is slightly wider than the third quarter, mainly due to higher fuel expense. With that, I'll turn the call back to Barry for closing remarks.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks Mark. I want to thank Team Frontier for staying focused on providing low fares done right in a challenging commercial and operating environment. We're disappointed in our results for the quarter and the outlook for the fourth quarter and we're taking methodical steps to ensure we deliver reliable and rewarding experience to our customers to remain the lowest cost provider of a seat in the United States for the long-term. We believe these steps will position the airline to return to profitability. Thanks again for joining us this morning. We're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Thanks. Good morning. I was kind of curious if you could provide a little bit more color on demand maybe particularly the peak versus off peak. If I look at your unit revenue, it's similar on a year over year basis to what you're seeing in 3Q. But you do have slower capacity growth and your stage length is, kind of getting shorter. So, I would have thought that that would have been the unit revenue tailwind.\nBarry Biffle: Well, the peak periods continue to be more resilient than the off peak. But what we're dealing with is an overall slowdown in demand. Which has been cited multiple times now, since we kind of brought it up over a month ago. We've seen that and that is more acute in the off peak periods. And then we're also seeing kind of an uneven deployment of capacity in the United States. So there's a lot more capacity versus 2019 in the Las Vegas and a lot less in Minneapolis as an example. So, that unevenness is impacting Frontier the most as we study that We're probably more impacted by the unevenness than anybody else in the space. But to answer your question about the peaks, the peaks continue to remain very resilient.\nSavi Syth: And if I might just as you kind of look to kind of capacity and your plans here, especially as you kind of restructure the approach, how should we think about 2024, is it still kind of similar to kind of 4Q level of year-over-year growth or should we see that moderating our--\nBarry Biffle: So, we did moderate our growth, somewhat in the fourth quarter versus even just a few months ago expectations. And as we look to Q1, which is going to be back to where we see the biggest challenges in the demand environment is in Q1, as I mentioned, off peak is not as resilient as the peak. We are targeting mid-single-digit growth for Q1, but we are maintaining our mid-teens growth for the year. And I think more specifically, we will be targeting growth kind of away from where these places that have been saturated in the more underserved markets as we move into 2024.\nSavi Syth: Very helpful. Thanks Barry.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Appreciate the time. If we could just sort of play back, 3Q revenue outcomes and maybe the variance relative to your initial expectations, could you could you maybe bucket what you feel like are contributing factors and maybe one bucket being holding out for higher yields when basically your competitors really went for load and maybe weren't doing that to the same degree? Two, the ops challenges, which you highlighted and maybe you have a sense for how acute kind of the revenue outcomes were in the markets that had had seen those the most? And then three, maybe just some suboptimal network bets that didn't play out the way you anticipated. May maybe there's other buckets, but would appreciate if you could walk through some of that.\nBarry Biffle: Well, I think first and foremost, Duane, thanks for your questions. I think number one throughout the pandemic and post-pandemic, we've seen the fall be much stronger than it has turned out. And so that was kind of a surprise for that -- maybe we can call it normal, but I think it was more abnormal, from a downshift than we've seen in a relationship of the peaks versus past. We also did see and it doesn't help, when you've got, maybe one or two carriers that are behind material on load factor in the very large. And their promotional activity kind of did rob a lot of, demand, at a time when, yes, we were planning on getting some bookings. So, that didn't help. But that is normalized now. So, those are two big factors. And I don't know about, our execution, I mean, we chased -- we always chase what we think is going to be the highest margin. The challenge is and we've gone back and studied this kind of after 9/11 and after the Great Recession. And anytime you have a big contraction in capacity and you have a whole bunch of capacity return, it's not all perfectly allocated because different we don't coordinate with other airlines. That's not allowed. And so you've got places like Las Vegas, that they're just saturated. I mean, if you compare the capacity versus 2019, it's up dramatically. And in fact, the occupancy rates midweek are actually down. So, you've got a tough situation contrast that to Minneapolis where you haven't seen even a full recovery. And so when we track airline performance in the United States, it's much closer and much more well explained when you look at the competitive capacity that most carriers are carrying or dealing with in their markets, and Frontier is the most impacted by that. Now, history shows that this typically in six to 18 months starts to correct itself and we'll be eager to see that rebalancing take place.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate those thoughts. And then just on ops, we heard about this kind of modular network approach for a while. And frankly, there were long stretches of time where your operations were quite good relative. So, I guess what went sideways this quarter, despite the modular design? And sorry if you're repeating it, but what is different about the new approach -- the new simplified approach versus the modular network approach that you talked about in the past?\nBarry Biffle: I think the challenge that we've had, Duane is we had great success with the modularity. And coming out of the pandemic, it was great. And we'd gotten to 50% modularity out and back. The problem is, is that the ATC staffing and the delay minutes as an example, we saw a significant increase. I mean, it was something like 10x, the amount of ground delay program minutes that we were dealing with in the system this summer. And so even though we'd gone modular, we didn't do enough. And so when we look at where we are very challenged reliability wise, it is dramatically impacted in the multi day trips. And so where we are at now, we are simply going to deepen the modularity and go straight to a kind of a best-in-class ULCC model of Europe. And we're finally at a size and scale that that makes sense. For us, they have to be a little bigger. If much about Ryan or Wizz, I mean, they can make a base with just a few aircraft That doesn't really work with our reserve coverages in the United States, but we're at the point that we can do that. And so we will be in a situation where we don't have anywhere near the multi day trips and we're targeting in the 90% plus range, by the time we get to spring, which will help us mitigate this. And I'll just give you an example, even with the 50% out and back, we had a situation where we plan for today for tomorrow night where aircraft would be because of the disruption with ATC, we saw consistently over a third of our aircraft not end up where they were supposed to be the fallout side. That has massive disruption to your maintenance plan. It causes you to need excess mechanics. It causes you to need more parts. It's a big step towards the recoverability. So, we feel like it not only unlocks the reliability of the airline, but it unlocks our ability to increase utilization because when we look at Europe, they've dealt with Euro Control in in a tougher operating environment for decades. And that is why we have to adopt that model. It's the only model we believe that is going to work at high utilization in this country.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you for the thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is going to come from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yes, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Barry, I guess if you can step back, what do you tell investors that have been with you since the IPO? Because it's been a pretty tough run here. And if we look at your order book, over 200 aircraft on order yet 130 today, that's a lot of growth the next 10 years. And I know you're pulling it back in the first quarter, but some of it seems like uneven demand off peak weakness fuel pressure APTC delays. They seem to be continuing. So, what structurally changes in the next year or two that gets you back to that pre-tax double digit margin range?\nBarry Biffle: I think it's pretty simple. One, I think you're going to see, as I mentioned, I think you're going to see the rebalancing of the capacity in the US. You're not going to have these wild swings, about 20% in one city versus down 15% and others. I think that's going to rebalance and that's going to be significantly beneficial to Frontier in absolute and on a relative basis. I think you're also going to see a shift in normalization and demand. I mean, international is in vogue, but that isn't going to last. And so that's going to rebalance as well. History shows you that. So, that's worth three to four points each. And then we ourselves are going to take our own self help, and we're going to grow away from the from the from the saturations worth several more points. And as we we've laid out, we're going to actually reduce our costs significantly, which is going to drive a couple more points of margin. And that's also going to drive greater reliability, which also increases your revenue. When you're cancelling 2%, 3% of your plights, the costs stay the same, but the revenue goes down. And then obviously, we've got, as Jimmy mentioned, our get it off for less, promise that we rolled out this week, which we think is going to pay massive dividends with the loyalty approach, which happens to be with Barclaycard. So, but we're going to control the things we can control. And, that's going to deliver, profitability. And we believe that that low cost will win.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate that, Barry. I mean, are you going through a wholesale change on the network next year? Is that what we should think, like, getting out of markets like Vegas and Florida incrementally?\nBarry Biffle: No. We're not getting it. So, let me be clear. We are not getting out and we're not leaving anywhere. But we will concentrate the growth that we plan. So in the mid-teens, it will be away from places that are saturated. It's going to be in places that are underserved.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. And sorry, I should have rephrased, like, not getting out, but incrementally moving away from those markets with relative new capacity. Is that right?\nBarry Biffle: No. No. We are the lowest cost provider in Las Vegas. We're not going anywhere. We do believe that that the industry will probably slow its growth and probably contract there, but we will not be contracting. We will just the growth that we add to the company will be an underserved will not add more capacity to markets that we believe are oversaturated\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is going to come from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good morning everyone. Hey Barry, just back to your view on next year, talked about mid-single growth in the March quarter. And then aiming for mid-teens for full year. So you would obviously have to ramp up as we move through the year. Are there any sort of whether it's margin targets or return metrics that you'll have to achieve in order to then sort of green light that type of growth know, maybe it's by the June quarter where you start to ramp up, because I'm sure there's metrics you probably want to hit before you want to accelerate that? Your thinking around that. Thank you.\nBarry Biffle: Yes. Thanks, Mike. We're not guiding for 2024 margins at this point.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Okay, too early. And then, just a question to, Mark, and congratulations on your promotion. I want to go back just on the guidance. You had mentioned that, the pretax margin guide for the fourth quarter versus the third, you said a lot of that had to do with a higher fuel price assumption. Are you assuming sort of similar demand that what we saw in September quarter continues into December. Is that is that is that a fair a fair assumption?\nMark Mitchell: Yes. I mean, I think, as was highlighted in the initial remarks book trends, here to have stabilized. And so what you see in that guide range is primarily the impact of the higher fuel costs.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is going to come from the line of Stephen Trent with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nStephen Trent: Yes. Good morning everybody. Can you hear me okay?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. We can.\nStephen Trent: Okay. Sorry about that. I have a little trouble with my phone. And congrats. I share, Mike's comments, congrats to Jimmy and Mark on those new moves. That's great stuff. Just one or two for me here. Could you tell me with your 2024 plan what are your basic assumptions about the Air Traffic Control situation and sort of infrastructure investment in US airport? Any change there or you're assuming everything states as it is now?\nBarry Biffle: Yes, thanks, David. Actually, we're assuming it gets worse. And that is why, we had always planned by 2025, 2026 to get to above 80% to 90%, kind of out and back simplified network. But we have to accelerate that. We have we've studied this extensively for now six to eight months. We have studied what how they manage this in Europe very similar situations. And so we believe that, their traffic control gets if you look at the staffing levels relative to the departures, it's going to be more constrained than it is now. And so we are planning around that by ensuring that we no longer have the kind of dependencies and the risk of running multi-day trips that are vulnerable with three to four to five hour GDP programs.\nStephen Trent: All right. Really appreciate that, Barry. And just one other quick question. Could you refresh my memory regarding what percentage of your fuel exposure is West Coast refined?\nJimmy Dempsey: Steve, it's Jimmy here. I mean, it's less than 20% of our exposure covers the West Coast, and we also have an exposure of about 10% or 15% in Denver as well, which is incorporated into that kind of more higher kind of crack spread and higher jet fuel cost. But over half of our exposure to fuel is around the U.S. Gulf Coast.\nStephen Trent: Okay, perfect. Thanks very much, Jimmy. Let me leave it there.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Helane Becker with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody, and thanks for the time here. Is there a way for you to quantify what the Barclays card spend is and whether it's up, down, or the same as it was six months or a year ago?\nBarry Biffle: We don't actually disclose that, but I can tell you we're very pleased with the performance of credit card partnerships with Barclays. And we are investing significantly in the loyalty, as we announced earlier this week, our Get It All for Less promise includes changes to how people earn on the program, our elite status levels, but also the fact that you can actually earn gold status by just spending $3,000 on the credit card, which unlocks free bags, free seats, no change fees, no cancels, so just a lot of value. And so what we believe is that there is no one in the space that if you travel a few times a year and spend at least $10,000 on a credit card that you earn as much as you will on us in terms of free travel. And when you couple that with what we are doing on the modularity and where we are going to be concentrating our bases, we also believe that we're going to see much more market maturity as we continue to be much more relevant for customers in our bases.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's hugely helpful, actually. The relevance is very helpful. But the question I have about the comment you made on underserved markets and kind of thinking about growing in those markets. I understand why you would want to do that and it makes perfect sense, but do you need to have smaller aircraft to do that because those markets may not be as robust or as demand driven as some of the other markets that you are serving already? I feel like Americans only go to places, right?\nBarry Biffle: Well, it's a good question, Helene, but no. look, when you've got the 321neo in our configuration, it provides the lowest seat cost in the industry and it enables you to fly more places, whether it's just a couple times a week for small markets or several times a day. We have an amazing amount of stimulating, amazing ability to stimulate demand. But I think what you should look at is just take the cities in the U.S., take all the airports, and just go in and look at the fourth quarter capacity by city, look how many seats in each city, and compare that to the same quarter in 2019. And you'll see a dramatic, dramatic difference. You're talking probably 30 to 40 points swing between the top and the bottom. So if demand is similar, and you have a 30% swing in capacity, that can be a 20 to 30 point jump in RASM or it can be a 20 to 30 point drag on a relative basis. So, that's what we're talking about when we say uneven capacity deployment in the U.S. And I think you'll find something very interesting if you do that analysis. You'll find that there's a large correlation between the airlines that are doing well and the ones that are doing well and the ones that are struggling margin-wise when you compare where their concentrations are. And that's why we say, and history shows that these things will normalize over the next 6 to 12 months.\nHelane Becker: Right. That makes sense. Yes. Okay. That's really helpful, Barry. Thanks for all of that.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JMP -- JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning everybody and congrats to Jimmy and Matt, Rajat and I'm sorry, Jimmy and Mark, Rajat and Matt as well. It's already been a long morning. Can you update us on CapEx for the next couple of years? Obviously, everybody hoping for a better year next year, but just in the event that 2024 ends up resembling 2023, particularly after you reach a pilot deal, that 2024 ends up resembling 2023, particularly after you reach a pilot deal. I just want to make sure I understand your ability to raise incremental capital. I know you cited the credit card program and IP, so I'm just guessing that liquidity is on your mind as well.\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes, Jamie, it's Jimmy here. Look, it's not a secret that we've spent a lot of time over the years fostering relationships across the leasing community to fund the growth in the business. And, we have about 22, 23 aircraft delivering next year. We have a really good pipeline on selling leasebacks on those aircraft all the way through to the end of next year, but most of our aircraft committed really in the first seven or eight months of next year. So we feel really good about the material capital spend on aircraft assets. The other capital spend that we have in the business is clearly engine shop visits and then just funding the growth in the business, they tend to be much lesser in terms of CapEx spend than the aircraft themselves, albeit the LEAP aircraft is coming in the next few years into its window where you'll see some more engine shop visits develop for those aircraft. And the other thing that we're watching quite closely, although, we're unclear right now is that the impact it will have on Frontier is really what's happening with the GTF. Frontier delivered its first GTF engine in September 2022. We're outside of the initial window where inspections on those engines are occurring at the moment, but we do anticipate we'll have to do some inspections towards the back end of 2024 and into 2025 and beyond. And so, albeit, we think it's going to be a minimal impact on Frontier in relation to how we understand it at the moment, it's obviously a fluid situation. We're watching it quite closely. And so that will determine our spares ratio and various different things, engine capacity in the airline.\nJamie Baker: Okay. So no definitive CapEx guide, but we should be thinking about sale-leaseback activity as we model for that. That's the summary?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes, I mean, that market has been really good to frontier and it continues to be so. So, I mean, obviously, interest rates are higher and higher for everybody and we operate within that world, but the pipeline of operating leases that we have coming are pretty good. So we're quite comfortable with it.\nJamie Baker: Okay, good. And then second, Barry, you talk about lower ex-fuel CASM next year. What's your confidence on getting there if you mark your pilots to market, and let's just assume you did that on January 1st for illustrative purposes? I'm not asking you to negotiate in public. I'm just asking you to speak to your confidence in achieving lower X fuel chasm after a pilot hit of what's sort of best case scenario, I'm guessing $50 million of annual incremental expense. I'm not guessing, I'm analyzing, but probably a figure potentially north of that.\nBarry Biffle: Well, we plan on, as we outlined earlier, we plan on saving over $200 million on 2023 size with the simplification of the operation. So we believe we have adequate capacity to more than cover any pilot labor cost increase.\nJamie Baker: Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning everyone. Barry or Mark, maybe two-parter for you. What are the buckets of the cost opportunities within that $200 million that you cited in your prepared remarks? And then, Barry, the road back to profitability or stopping the margin degradation, can it really just be accomplished on the cost side and utilization side, particularly with pilots coming? Or is it really just a revenue issue whereby you just kind of have to rethink your longer-term capacity plans in the high teams? Just trying to dissect those two parts. Thanks.\nMark Mitchell: Yes, so this is Mark. So from, the $200 million that we highlighted, so, broad strokes, as we simplify, the schedule and the operational design, you're going to have, as a benefit of that, lower crew travel, a better ability to utilize reserves, and just, better predictability of people and parts, that are going to drive cost benefits through the organization. And then with that, you're also going to position the organization to drive higher utilization. And so I think that's really the foundation of the $200 million.\nBarry Biffle: Yes, and as far as the growth rate, I don't see a challenge with that. I think if you look under the hood, we feel confident with the cost savings that we're going to have, even net of the pilot cost. Like I said, you're going to see the uneven deployment of capacity and the market saturations start to normalize. That's a huge benefit to us. You're going to see the rebalance. You're going to see people come back and travel more domestic than they did on a relative basis to Europe. That's just going to happen. And so those two together are a massive benefit. And then you've got our own self-help that we're going to grow in places that are also underserved ourselves. So I think you couple that with the better reliability, what we're doing with our loyalty on the revenue side, and we believe that we will get back to profitability and get back to great margins, and therefore we don't have a challenge with the broker.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And then Barry, I'm just curious if you have any updated thoughts. I know there have been continued articles out there in the press just with regards to the government and kind of the excise tax on ancillary revenues. How do you think that plays out? And at what point, what would trigger kind of a change in terms of how you account for that? Thank you.\nBarry Biffle: I didn't see that. I apologize, I didn't see the article that he's referencing. But what specifically would you see?\nAndrew Didora: Just the excise tax on ancillary revenues, the potential of putting tax on that stream of revenue on that.\nBarry Biffle: Oh that's, yes, so that actually has been out there for a long time. And I think there's really good, I think, kind of precedent on this that goes back, I think, to the 1950s, actually. So, look, if it's optional and it's not part of the core service, I think the statute was very clear.\nAndrew Didora: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, and one moment for our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hi everyone. Thank you. A couple questions on revenue. There's been a lot of discounting happening right now in the U.S. domestic market. As you run fare sales, I'm just curious if the uptake rate has been any different than it has been in the past. Just trying to understand the difference between load factor and so on as you kind of go forward. Thank you.\nBarry Biffle: I'm going to let James Finner [ph], our Vice President of Revenue Management speak to that.\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes. As we look at the results, certainly we saw a bit of a slowdown in the second half of August and the September, but we've been pleased with the results as we've continued to run promotional activity through the last six, eight weeks and are optimistic as we see a trend, activity through the last six, eight weeks and are optimistic as we see a trend, particularly for the peak period, as Barry mentioned, are more resilient here in the fourth quarter. We believe low fare stimulation is fundamental to run the ULCC and remain focused on that.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then on these new markets that are underserved, when I think about that, I kind of think that they're underserved for a reason. So as you guys look into those markets, is your expectation that the spooling period is going to be a lot quicker than it probably has been in the past? Just trying to understand if there's going to be a drag on RASM as we start to add these new markets and so on, because new market development tends to be at the margin to live, just trying to understand that. Thank you.\nBarry Biffle: Well, so yes, I've read some things about this. I think there's some misunderstandings in the marketplace in this. So when you're always growing, right, you always have a percentage of your airline that's immature. And that is kind of a permanent, if you will, kind of degradation to your RASM that you take on. And this is why some airlines you see, and there's one in particular you can go look at, that stopped their growth this year and people have slowed it down or even contracted and they've popped the RASM. The challenge with that is it's temporary because once they go back to growing, they take the drag on RASM. Now in our case, what we're seeing is that, yes, new growth in the oversaturated market I'll continue to use Las Vegas as an example the new growth is actually not performing at levels that we're accustomed to, but we're also seeing our mature markets seeing significant incursion and reduction in RASM on mature markets. So, I think there's this confusion about it that it's the growth that's the problem. It's not our growth that's the problem. It's the uneven deployment of capacity into a lot of our core markets in Las Vegas and certain Florida markets as an example that has caused the degradation.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, and one moment for our next question. Our next -- our last question comes from the line of Christopher Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Barry, your prepared remarks. You spoke about your belief that industry capacity is going to rationalize next year. And there are fewer carriers today in the US than there were 10, 15 years ago. So perhaps less of an opportunity here for some irrational behavior. But the marginal cost per seat is such where well capitalized carriers can continue to add inventory into the market here. So just help us, or if you could kind of explain your view there, particularly when we look at Southwest this morning, looks like their order book is growing, and of course you have a full order book. So just kind of want to better understand the comments around it. I appreciate the history and analogy, I think, to Europe, but here in the US here is perhaps a little bit of a different dynamic. Thanks.\nBarry Biffle: We're less convinced of the overall capacity and we'll let those bigger airlines decide what they think is the right amount of deployment. What we're seeing week after week in the schedule change adjustments and some of the most recent commentary is expectation for their capacity deployment is coming down, down, down. And we're seeing it, for example, we've seen attrition in pilot rates slowing down as a result because they're slowing down their hiring of pilots. So evidence that the big airlines are actually slowing down their capacity. What I was really more referencing was not the total capacity, however. And I was talking about the unevenness of the capacity deployment. And ultimately, if everyone showed their cards, I think you would find that some of the oversaturated Las Vegas and oversaturated Florida markets, it doesn't matter who you are. The route P&Ls on those routes, regardless of airline, are probably a little bit under pressure. And so we see that capacity being redeployed at a minimum, and possibly in some cases, just eliminated. So at best, they maybe retire the aircraft, but at worst, it's just get redeployed. So that unevenness will get itself sorted out, and that's really what I was referencing, not total capacity.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you. And then the comments for next year, and thinking about capacity allocation, to be clear, you're not arguing around a wholesale change here to some of your core markets and you're looking at some of these underserved markets, which to the earlier question comes with its own set of challenges. But if we take a step back and think about your net route growth next year, so with no wholesale change to markets like Vegas and alike, and these new underserved markets, just if there's a number of, or kind of directionally how we should think about your net routes for 2024? Thank you.\nBarry Biffle: I don't think that the overall routes is going to change that much. And I think when you look at, the percentage of our capacity that's in immature markets, it's hovering around 10%, and it could go a little closer to 12% with some of the new markets. But when they're in underserved markets, we think that that's going to do really, really well. But it probably wants to be a little more when we look at, kind of the underserved places.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session for today's conference. And I would like to hand the conference back over to Barry Biffle for any closing remarks.\nBarry Biffle: Yes, well, thank you everybody for joining and we look forward to updating you at the next quarterly call. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ULCC", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-08-01 21:11:05", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Frontier Group Holdings' Second Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host Mr. David Erdman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDavid Erdman: Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Today's speakers will be Barry Biffle, President and CEO; Jimmy Dempsey, EVP and CFO; Daniel Shurz, Senior Vice President, Commercial. Each will deliver brief prepared remarks, and then we'll get to your questions. But first, let me quickly review the customary Safe Harbor provisions. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those predicted in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors which could cause such differences are outlined in the announcement we published earlier, along with reports we filed with the SEC. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to the nearest comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of the earnings announcement. So I will give the floor to Barry to begin his remarks. Barry?\nBarry Biffle: Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite challenging operational conditions, we generated strong second quarter results with a pre-tax margin of 9.1%. Our highest post-pandemic margin on an industry-leading capacity growth of 23%, compared to the prior year quarter. Our continued focus on cost management help drive a beat on our non-fuel operating expense. Our total cost structure is significantly lower than the industry average generating an advantage of more than $70 per passenger today.  Our cost structure is a key element in underpinning our growth strategy and I'm proud the organization has continued to ensure we remain the leader among our peers.  Ancillary revenue continued its strong performance during the second quarter, achieving $80 per passenger, $5 higher than the comparable quarter last year. We expect our industry-leading ancillary platform to continue to provide us with pricing flexibility to tailor our suite of products and services to our customers\u2019 needs.  It also enables us to maintain low fares and enhance engagement and loyalty with our brand. Our GoWild All You Can Fly Pass is a great example. Since a substantial number of our pass holders do not have prior travel history with Frontier, we've had the opportunity to expand brand awareness and preference, along with driving incremental revenues as these customers engage with our other loyalty platforms such as Discount Den, our co-branding credit card, as well.  It's a key part of our strategy to increase the contribution from loyalty and subscription-related products. As we look to the third quarter, we expect a moderation in fares largely due to the increase in competing long-haul international travel flows. To better understand this phenomena, we recently surveyed our Frontier customers.  Survey found that 5% or more of our customers have traveled or plan to travel to Europe versus last year. We estimate this environment to be a three-point temporary headwind on a pre-tax margin basis. Encouragingly, our survey also revealed over 90% plan to travel the same or more with over half planning to travel more on a go-forward basis giving us the confidence that once the balance shifts back to domestic, we believe RASM will normalize.  Turning to the operational environment, the challenging conditions experienced in June continue to cause an historically elevated level of cancellations. Weather across the United States, in particular, in Florida, has produced record air traffic control delay programs resulting in the cancellation of over 3% of our flights in July.  We are incorporating ATC constraints into our network design going forward and we expect this environment to impact our third quarter pre-tax margin by approximately three points. Accordingly, we anticipate our third quarter adjusted pre-tax margin to be 4% to 7%.  With the lowest cost structure of any carrier in the United States and we are focused on sustaining that advantage with ongoing induction of the hi gauge, fuel-efficient, A321 Neo aircraft and by leveraging our high utilization capabilities to drive low fares and stimulate demand.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Daniel for commercial update. \nDaniel Shurz: Thank you, Barry, and good afternoon, everyone. Total operating revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $967 million, more than 6% higher than the prior year quarter. RASM was down 14%, 10% on a stage-adjusted basis. From a strong prior quarter, our capacity growth was 23% over the same period and an 8% increase in stage length.  Revenue per passenger was $127, 9% lower than the 2022 quarter, during which time fuel prices were 40% higher and post-COVID domestic travel demand surged. In May, we launched promotional and other GoWild seasonal product, the fall and winter, pass for travel, from September through February. The pass included access to more than 85 US and international destinations.  Furthermore, lastly, we put the new GoWild monthly pass on sale, given even more customers the opportunity to enjoy the best value in air travel.  Turn to a brief network update. In the second quarter, we launched 26 new routes, originating from Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Midway, Cleveland Detroit, Houston, Orlando, San Juan, St. Thomas and Tampa. These new routes were all added to existing Frontier airports, which increases our customer appeal in key markets.  That concludes my remarks and I\u2019ll now yield the call to Jimmy. \nJimmy Dempsey: Thank you, Daniel second quarter results reflect a pre-tax margin of 9.1%, a post-COVID record. The results reflect strong demand throughout the quarter and diligent management of our cost base. Revenue increased 6% on a 23% increase in capacity, while fuel expense was in line with guidance at average cost per gallon of $2.69. Adjusted non-fuel operating expenses were $644 million, beating guidance or $6.09 on a unit basis, 5% lower than the 2022 quarter. We ended the quarter with $780 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents or $350 million net of total debt.  In addition to our cash bonds, we also have access to substantial liquidity through our unencumbered loyalty and brand-related assets. We had 126 aircrafts in our fleet at June after taking delivery of three A321 Neo aircrafts during the quarter, two of which were financed with direct leases. Having already experienced significant aircraft delivery delays across the first half of the year, Airbus has informed us that any further delays should be modest. As such, we expect to end the year with 136 aircrafts.  Turning to guidance, third quarter capacity growth is anticipated to be in the range of 21% to 23% over the 2022 quarter, while full year 2023 capacity is expected to affect growth of between 19% to 21% over the prior year.  Fuel costs are expected to be between $2.80 and $2.90 per gallon in the third quarter and $2.90 to $3 per gallon for full year 2023 based on the blend of fuel curve on July 24th. Adjusted non-fuel operating expenses in the third quarter are expected to be between $650 million to $665 million and $2.535 billion to $2.585 billion for the full year. This range incorporates the costs related to our challenging operating conditions.  Finally, reflecting Barry\u2019s earlier comments on the operating environment, adjusted pre-tax margin in the third quarter is expected in the range of 4% to 7% and 4% to 6% for the full year.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Barry for his closing remarks. \nBarry Biffle: Thanks, Jimmy. I want to personally thank team Frontier for their dedicated service during the quarter in a difficult operating environment and for delivering low fares done right. We remain focused on controlling the things we can control to run a sound operation, despite challenges posed by extraneous factors. Our competitive edge lies in sustaining our cost advantage over the industry and we intend to utilize this advantage to simulate leisure travel demand and maximize shareholder value.  I want to be clear, while we're disappointed in our projected results, I strongly believe the company will return to double-digit margins given that most of the headwinds are temporary. I want to thank everyone again for joining this afternoon and we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is open. \nBrandon Oglenski : Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. So, Barry, I guess, can you expand on that a little bit, because you had been guiding I think for like 10% to 12% or 10% to 13% pre-tax margin the back half of the year. This seems like you're pulling that back somewhere around 4% to 6% at the midpoint. And I think you did mentioned three points from restructuring operations around Florida and ATC. So can you maybe dive deeper into that, please? \nBarry Biffle : Yeah, sure. It's pretty simple math. We laid out - we had put out a 10% to 13% expectation for the second half, and we are seeing roughly three points in the operational challenges as we discussed. The ATC ground delay programs, and so forth. And we're seeing an additional three points in the revenue environment, which is primarily driven by the shift to European travel. So that pretty much explains the six points. I think it might be a little bit more fuel in there, as well but that explains it all. \nBrandon Oglenski : What \u2013 I guess, Barry, can you talk about the changes around those operational challenges, because it looks like your capacity guidance maybe didn't move all that much. So does this go beyond just capacity? \nBarry Biffle : No, no. This is this is just simply - it started a little bit in May, but really took effect in kind of your mid June time frame and it\u2019s continued through the last six weeks pretty heavily. We see maybe even a similar storm event. We will see ground delay programs start hours and hours before with significantly longer and lots more minutes.  And so, we planned our airline in the past and we had roughly three hours of buffer built in. And we're seeing consistently with these kind of ground delay programs, we need around four hours. So, we've made some tweaks to it. But there's no real immediate fixes that will fix this in the near term until \u2013 but when we look forward to next year, and beyond, we will start factoring this into our plans.  The reality is that ATC is just issuing more ground delay programs and they're at lasting considerably longer than we've seen in the past. And so we've got a plan for that. But in the meantime it's a drag and so we can kind of schedule around with the fuel. \nBrandon Oglenski : Okay. Appreciate that, Barry? And then, Daniel, maybe can you expand on the European comment? Overseas travel, this is not the first time we've heard it this quarter. Should we be thinking that folks have more propensity to travel internationally this year than they will next year? \nDaniel Shurz : Look, what we know, Brandon is that, as I said our customer, we surveyed our customers air traveling to Europe more, but this commonality from, others, there seems to be there is seems clearly pent-up demand for long-haul international travel and from a US point of origin perspective, that skews very, very heavily to Europe.  We don't know. We don't know, what we don't obviously know exactly what's going to happen in the future, but what we've seen in pent-up demand \u2013 what we\u2019ve seen in pent-up demand Germany is the first time you see that pent-up demand. That's one of the strongest and it tends to ease off as you go forward. \nBrandon Oglenski : Okay guys. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Just on network development, couple questions. On your planning horizon and how that relates to the booking curve, we're a little surprised to see large changes to October here in early August or late July granted they were capacity adds or they're not deletes. Can you just talk a little bit about how your network planning process has changed?  And how you see it evolving over time? What prevents you from planning with stability kind of further out? Or are you waiting to see aircraft availability et cetera? And I guess, most importantly, do you think this costs you at all from a sort of long-term bookings curved perspective? Or is all the action kind of close in? \nDaniel Shurz : Okay. Duane, Well, I'll unpack that. Look, I think Paul, we have made tweaks to our schedule and some of our schedule rules and schedule design rules to try and address some of what we've seen in the operational environment we're going through at the moment.  We made those changes, we made those changes as close than as we could that did that did cause us to be somewhat to get somewhat behind on actually loading all of our schedules that particularly affected us, actually, September that have most significant effect.  That we're expecting that to be sort of a relatively one-off. We're actually moving forward to adding the capacity we want to add earlier, but we did want to make sure that we did make adjustments that we needed to make. We need to see improvements obviously in this. And we've made some improvements, we think, but we made some changes that we can improve operations. From the the booking curve perspective, it's a very minor impact.  We are seeing - we see most of our volumes are much closer in the math. There's a small impact, but it truly is small. And going forward, as we get schedules on sale further out it just extended our schedule for New Year and that impact will go away altogether. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you. And then, just with respect to the booking curve, at least one carrier in the U.S. talked about kind of the surprising strength close in. But that they basically didn't assume that going forward for the rest of the quarter. Does that ring true to you? And what assumptions have you made with respect to kind of closing bookings for the balance of the quarter? \nDaniel Shurz : We have a value proposition of \u2013 very well from a close in perspective and we've seen continued impairment. We have seen a continued trend since the pandemic or since pandemic recovery in 2022 of strong close in demand. Our anticipation broadly speaking is that that will maintain relatively similar to the way we've seen it over the last number of months. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Appreciate the time. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Again, Michael Linenberg your line is open. \nMichael Linenberg: Great. Hey, good afternoon everyone. Hey, I guess, one part - one question here, but sort of two parts. When we think about your network and we sort of think about what percent is under development, I'm trying to get a sense of what percent can we look at a same-stores basis? And then, what would be new? There's obviously - I know you're in a lot of seasonal markets and so they go away and they come back.  How should we think about like, if I were to look at your market today, take a snapshot like what percentage is under development are relatively new markets, may be something that's been added in the last 12 months?  And something that's not seasonal that that comes in and out every six months out of the year, it's in six months out. Can you give us a better sense on that? I guess that would be to you Daniel and I have sort of a follow-up tied to that. \nDaniel Shurz : So, first I want to mention with regard to this is, we are obviously growing at the moment faster than our intended medium term trend line growth. We've committed to mid-teens growth being our standard medium term trend line. And as we kind of come out of COVID, we are to recover capacity and we're continuing to grow up and we are continue to grow this year at a rate in the 20s percent.  So that tended to push this up on and rapidly scrambling to get you an actual number. That is already, but we are - But look, we're always going to have our - we are going to tend to have a higher percent of the network in development broadly, because we are growing and we have a - we are always looking to add \u2013 we are always looking to add new capacity. And it's \u2013 look, the thing at the moment is we are adding new airports to the network. We are adding join the dock service around the country. I'll get back to you on the other exact on the current percentages. \nBarry Biffle: But the only thing I would say is look, if you're in the 20s on growth, that just tells you right there, that is all new and then, at every given moment, you've got anywhere from 15% to 35% of your implying you did a year before that didn't work. So you redeploy it. That's kind of how growth airlines work. And so, that's going to push you, I'm just say 20% or 25% from last year 30% actually. So you're in the over 30% is immature, \nMichael Linenberg: Okay. \nBarry Biffle: And so, yes, we have a significant amount and I think this is an underappreciated part of Frontier. I mean, people have picked on us about underperforming our historical margins, but I think what people don't grasp is that, when you're growing and 10 plus points higher than your target rate and you take a 20% to 30% discount on that that's just a flat-out three-point drag on margin and it could likely be even more just simply because you're also still coming out of COVID.  So, but that's a long way of telling you. Yes, it is over 30% in the immature stage and that will come down as our growth moderate into 2024 where we're now expected to be in the mid-teens, mid to upper teens. \nMichael Linenberg: Okay. And the reason I was asking, Barry and Daniel is that, look, you've done a nice job on ancillary, right? I mean you're up, year-over-year five bucks moving, you're at 80 now. But when I look at the base fares, you're down almost $20 and so the question is, what you're making up on ancillary, you're losing on base.  And presumably, you're a growth carrier and demand stimulation, but we're also in a pretty high inflationary environment and we are seeing average fares for a lot of carriers they're flat up and now they're moderating as we move forward.  But to see that down as much as it is in the June quarter, presumably that's because they're like, you said, you're in a lot of relatively new markets call it a third. And so, you're engaging in demand stimulation, which is your model I guess. And maybe, maybe I'm answering your question or maybe I'm missing it. If there's anything you can add on that, because that's a pretty meaningful drop on the base fare. \nBarry Biffle: Look, we are very aware, Mike and that is why we're extremely focused on getting back to double-digit margins. And a big part of that is getting our growth rate normalized, and we're largely back to a normal growth rate once we get to 2024. Yes, we have swallowed a lot of capacity to get the utilization back and, and we're finally do most through that. And yes, it has a corresponding impact to fares and we need that to stimulate.  The good news is, we're growing everything, whether it be your emails, your frequent flyers your Discount Den members should go out. So the good news is that, those things are keeping up with our growth. And so as that moderates, we expect to see the benefit of that as we move into 2024. \nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Okay, very good. Thanks everyone. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Your line is open. \nJamie Baker: Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen. So, appreciate the Airbus commentary before. Just wondering if you have any specific GTF-related assumptions embedded in the forward six months guide? Or if it's just business as usual? \nBarry Biffle: So, thanks, Jimmy. We don't have any of the engines and in fact the ones that were impacted were manufactured through September of 2021. We did not take an aircraft - we didn't take a GTF until actually year later. And that actual engine was manufactured, both those engines were manufactured in May of \u201822. So, we are about six to eight months past the risk profile of those so. \nJamie Baker: Good. Good. And, looking forward, later this year, when you give us some color on 2024 costs, any updated thoughts on whether you may choose to accrue for new pilot economics or are you still debating this internally? And I suppose more importantly, when you think about your earnings profile once pilot costs are mark-to-market, do you think about the network any differently? I mean, basically, do you envision flying any differently? Or is it just as simple as, hopefully, raising fares in hopes of preserving margins. \nBarry Biffle: Look, so, I think there's a couple things. One we're very early. I know there was a group of you asking another airline about whether they should include it and their contract I think had been open for several years. We're not in that situation so, right. So it's very early, we just had our first meeting. So I don't think, I think we're a little premature on that. But let's just talk about, yes, we are going to pay our pilots more at some point. We're going to pay all of our workers more at some point.  And so that's why we're constantly innovating and looking for ways to improve our situation. So, I'll go back to previous question about moderating growth. That's going to be worth several points right there just in RASM to help pay for it. We can get past the current operational environment or at least, I don't know that we'll get past the operational environment because I believe that the forecast is, is the ATC staffing stays low for a few years, but we can plan around it much better.  And so, I expect that by 2024. We made some close in tweaks. But when you, like any plan and you are a airline geek. \nJamie Baker: Yeah. \nBarry Biffle: I know, I know, you know the network works. The more - the sooner you know the inputs to putting together a plan, the better and the more optimized it is. So as we think about 2024 and probably really are spring and beyond which is most impacted, just simply because of the weather-related impacts. We are going to build from the ground up completely different firebreak assumptions and buffers.  So, you would expect that we would get the majority of this benefit back by planning around the operational impact. \nJamie Baker: Got it. \nBarry Biffle: And then, and then, as you, well know, and I think we've probably been the leaders in ancillary and revenue-related pipeline. So, we've got kind of a robust pipeline there. So I believe that we will have by the time we get new labor contracts, we will have ample capacity to pay for it with all the things that we have in the tank to expand our margins. \nJamie Baker: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Savanthi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is open. \nSavanthi Syth.: Hey, good afternoon. Can I ask so, with getting to kind of mid to upper teens in 2024 in terms of capacity growth and making some of these changes to ATC, I'm guessing you'll have some improvements in kind of Iraq costs and things like that. But like putting all that together what's your kind of revised view on what CASM what you can get CASM X to be in 2024. I know it's really early stages, but generally kind of what's your revised view on CASM X here? \nJimmy Dempsey : That's obvious. Jimmy me here. We haven't published a view on CASM going into next year. I mean, at the moment, we're just putting together our capacity plans, so that we can get an idea over the next couple of months on where we think directionally CASM is going given some of the changes that we have. What we're really focused on is, sustaining the differential we have to our \u2013 in the last quarter, we\u2019re comfortably $70 per passenger and lower cost on all of our competitors across the average of the aviation space in here in the states and we would anticipate that we sustain this going through next year.  This year, our CASM is probably slightly above six and a half cents. We would anticipate that going into next year, it'll be in that area code. And one of the things that's benefiting us going into next year, is the more normalization profile of Airbus deliveries that we expect across 2024 in comparison to 2023. So that will help us. \nSavanthi Syth.: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, last quarter you talked about, kind of reshaping capacity. I was wondering if you can provide an update on if you know how that's playing out. I realized kind of your overall revenue - pricing environment is softer, but generally how has kind of the capacity reshaping been playing out?\nDaniel Shurz: Well, so the first month, where we see an actual significant amount of our capacity shaping is actually going to be the month of September. That\u2019s the first month with the most significant discussion. We continue to see in the same travel demand pattern.  And we continue as we look at what's happening with September bookings, we do absolutely see the day of week happens that we described when we announce these changes. And so we are confident that we have the right approach to take and we're continuing to roll it out as we roll out schedules into 2024. \nSavanthi Syth.: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nKatherine Kallergis: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Katherine Kallergis on for Ravi. So thank you for taking my question. I wanted to just quickly follow up on a previous question asked about international travel pressuring the shorter haul that you are guiding towards in 3Q. Just curious your thoughts around whether or not this might reverse in Q4 as the holidays are typically more favorite towards visiting friends and family.  And whether or not that's something you're baking in for the full year assumptions? Thank you. \nJimmy Dempsey : Sure, we don't know. We surveyed customers and we know that many of them continue to plan travel this fall. What it appears to us is that, the summer did get very expensive relative to some people's expectations. And so, we actually believe a lot of the demand is going to spill into the fall. And therefore, we have not made an assumption that this environment changes before we get into the heart of winter.  Although I do know that once we get to January, February, it's a heck of a lot better to be in Florida than it is in most parts of Europe. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Trent of Citi. Mr. Trent, your line is open. \nStephen Trent : Good afternoon, gentlemen and thanks very much for taking my question. Just one or two for me. So the first one is on, definitely appreciate what you guys have mentioned about whether, did you see sort of any episodes in July where - let's say, extreme heat in places like Vegas. You know, maybe let you don't bump some daytime capacity into the evening for example? Or it's kind of we are primarily talking about thunderstorms were the main headache? \nBarry Biffle: The biggest challenge is simply that we are seeing more ground delay programs and we're seeing them put on much sooner and for much longer duration than we've seen in the past. I mean, we've seen upwards of five to ten times the amount of ground delay program minutes that we've seen in the system versus years past. So that's the big challenge.  As far as heat goes, yes, I've seen some of those and I know there was a plane stuck \u2013 with another carrier that was stuck in the area hot. The only specific thing that we've had is there have been the normal challenges with more tires that are damaged as a result of heat.  And in particular, we did have one day where the temperatures were so high in Las Vegas that it caused temperature warnings to cause the fuel in the aircraft to exceed a temperature warning, which actually had it made cancel flights. We actually have been tankering fuel now in there to mitigate this. But we've had - I think it's probably less than a dozen or two just related specifically to heat. Everything is mainly aircraft control ground delay programs. \nStephen Trent : Okay. No that's great. I definitely appreciate that. And thank you, Barry and one other quick thing, I appreciate what you've mentioned about long-haul demand and what have you. When we think about Florida, over the last kind of two to three years for a lot of the time that was kind of the only place that was open are you seeing any specific sort of nuances in demand trend aside from more people flying in long haul?  You hearing one or two organizations on a boycott the state, et cetera, et cetera. But I'm not sure if you're seeing anything like that in your data. Thank you.\nBarry Biffle: No, we have not seen anything quite like that. There is some theories around temperature like, when it's really hot, you don't necessarily want to go to Phoenix right now and some other places in and it doesn't help when those destinations are actually in the news for being very, very hot. And when you talk to certain hotels, I think they have actually experienced it.  But in our data, we haven't really seen anything in particular that points to a state or a specific destination outperforming or underperforming. In fact, I think if you go back, the COVID recovery in the pent-up demand was very uneven, really benefited the Florida as you mentioned it benefited, even some of the kind of secondary destinations in their off seasons.  And then, it's taken a little longer for the coasts of the New York's the California's to come back. But in our business, we now see out California and bounce back as an example. And so, we see a pretty even recovery forming this big shift to go to Europe this summer and into the fall is look at, it takes money. I mean, if there's so many consumer dollars, when we look at just our customers, we surveyed our customers, not the whole traveling public.  And when we lose 5% of our people to go to Europe, that's a lot of customers. And so, and they're spending a lot of money to go on those trips. So that is a pretty big dent. But we think that it will normalize just like we saw huge spikes to Florida and other places when the pent-up demand hit. I think that we're going to see this moderate. The question is, is it three more months or is it six more months, but it will moderate at some point. \nStephen Trent : Okay. Really appreciate that Barry. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Your line is open. \nConor Cunningham : Hi everyone. Thank you. Just on this network reshaping debate, you guys had actually started the last quarter and now it seems like there's been a bunch following you. As their adjustments are made Tuesdays and Wednesdays and then capacity is added to the peak days, I think there's some fear around just potential impacts to fares there.  I know you don't want to talk about floor fares, but if you could just provide any expectation around, how much are you spilling during peak days? Or how much do you think you should be getting from a fare share standpoint on the peak days that you're not right now? Thanks. \nDaniel Shurz: Conor thanks for the question. It\u2019s Daniel. I'm not sure there's a huge amount of change coming on peak days. And we are a low fares demand stimulating airline, right? But what you're seeing \u2013 what you are hearing mainly and what will I certainly what I've heard mainly as other airlines have talked about, this is really, they're taking capacity out of the days where the revenue isn't strong enough to just it but fine.  Generally speaking as an industry flying, our capacity intensely on peak days because that's where the revenue is highest, that's where the demand is highest. So we think the general trend, and certainly think that the one thing that helps the more capacity comes out the midweek, the more it stabilizes midweek fares. And the more it helps the demand level on that on peak days. But that's all group. That's all we can really say from what looking from here. \nBarry Biffle: I would just add to, look, reality and how revenue has spread across the days of the week is not a new phenomena, what we were just the first ones to point out maybe controversial at the time, and yes, as you point out, it seems like just about everyone has followed us once we've laid the groundwork for them. But what you see, even pre today and go back 10 years, 20 years, is that the midweek capacity is an example your Tuesday and Wednesday, that's when your lowest fares exist traditionally.  And so, what it does actually pulls people from the peak days over to those days, because there's a lower fare option. What's going to happen not only with our changes and now that so many have followed us, there's just going to be a lot less Tuesday, Wednesday seats. So there's going to be a lot less discounting. So, so it generally benefits those days but you also find that it makes your peak days even better, as well.  You typically will see a RASM benefit when you make those trends across every day a week, just simply because you remove the most marginal capacity. \nConor Cunningham : That's helpful man. And then, you actually faced a fair bit of weather this quarter and, I know you made the adjustments to the modular network. I'm just curious on - I realize a lot of the stuff out of your control from ATC, but just how you held up from a recoverability standpoint given that given the changes in that modular network? Thank you. \nBarry Biffle: Well, there's two things. I\u2019d say one, we often we often see it as a positive that we're diversified and actually very spread across the United States with multiple bases, in multiple jurisdictions. And we pretty much follow all the major travel flows in the United States. Said another way, there's really no way that we're not impacted by weather.  Some airlines that may be operate in the west or north western United States, they've escaped this weather this year. But if you're in - if you like us or in Denver, central time zones, Florida Northeast capacity, we've gotten hit by that. So, we are exposed. In terms of the modularity, what we're learning is, we don't have, we typically don't have the three, four, five up to seven day rolling events, because we only, we mainly only have one and two day crew pairings.  But what we have found is that we're likely to be more impacted on the day up. So, if an airplane goes out and back and has to go through the same weather system twice or in some cases three times, if you catch a two-hour delay every time you go through, by the third leg, that aircraft I can just guarantee you, there's not a crew planning world that that crew hasn't timed out.  So, while it makes us easy to not have these like catastrophic multi-day, week-long events, we are more susceptible on the day that you do have a weather event if that makes sense. \nConor Cunningham : Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] One one moment, please. Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Barry Biffle for any closing remarks \nBarry Biffle : I want to thank everyone for joining or call today. Appreciate all the questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to the Frontier Group Holdings' First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there are question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Erdman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDavid Erdman: Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Today's speakers will be Barry Biffle, President and CEO; Jimmy Dempsey, EVP and CFO; and Daniel Shurz, Senior Vice President, Commercial. Each will deliver brief prepared remarks, and then we'll get to your questions. But first though, let me quickly review the customary safe harbor provisions. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those predicted in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors which could cause such differences are outlined in the announcement we published earlier, along with reports we filed with the SEC. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to the nearest comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of the earnings announcement. So I will give the floor to Barry to begin his remarks. Barry?\nBarry Biffle: Thanks David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our results for the first quarter reflecting adjusted pretax loss margin of 1.9%, slightly outperforming expectations on a strong spring break period. While demand during January and the first half of February was seasonally weak, particularly in off peak days, demand strengthened as we progress from President's Day through the spring break period. In fact, we operated an average utilization of 11.8 hours per day in March. The progression in demand throughout the quarter helped drive revenue of $848 million, a record for any first quarter in the company's history. We expect the strengthen demand for leisure travel to continue to extend into the busy summer travel season. The leisure demand is supported by consumer, which today has a greater propensity and ability to travel compared to pre-pandemic periods. More notably, they have far more flexibility to travel and to do so more often with work-from-home arrangements and flexible work schedules. We believe this is largely the basis for the surge in total leisure travel demand that began in earnest last year. It's showing resiliency, and we positioned ourselves to capture a disproportionate share of it through our low fair done right strategy and innovative product offerings. Our GoWild Pass, which launched last fall, is a prominent example. It's a leisure focused product were best suited to offer. Before the pandemic, this kind of product would've had the limited appeal. Today, however, sales have been strong with customers across many consumer segments, creating the building for inexpensive frequent travel. The Pass gives them the freedom and peace of mind to unlock unlimited and spontaneous travel to all destinations we serve. Of the Pass sales thus, far over half do not have prior travel history with Frontier. With this previously untapped customer base, we also have the opportunity to expand brand awareness and preference along with driving incremental revenues as these customers engage with our loyalty platforms such as Discount Den and the Frontier World Mastercard. It's a key part of our strategy to increase the contribution from loyalty and subscription related products, supporting our goal of achieving ancillary revenue of $85 per passenger by the fourth quarter and $100 per passenger by 2026.  The strength we're experiencing in leisure travel demand favors peak days and peak periods where we see an outsized contribution. This outsized contribution is a trend that has developed over the last year as we emerged from the pandemic. Having analyzed this new customer behavior and until peak and off peak demand relationship normalizes, we're reshaping our capacity beginning in the second quarter to exploit this dynamic and expect the changes to be fully deployed in the second half of 2023. We are excited about this ship and our ability to lower execution risk while maximizing revenue and profits. While we expect the update to our network strategy to enhance our operational performance and pretax margins, the resulting adjustments to capacity and utilization will increase our unit cost. With that said, we still expect our total cost advantage, which widened from over $60 per passenger pre-pandemic to over to $70 passenger in 2022 to further expand in 2023. We anticipate our cost advantage to benefit from the ongoing gauge and fuel efficiency benefits from the increasing mix of A321neo aircraft, the operational benefits from our enhanced network strategy and the significantly lower debt exposure we have compared to the rest of the industry  Overall. As a result of the planned network changes I've highlighted, we're adjusting our full year capacity guidance to reflect expected growth of 19% to 22%. The entire organization is aligned and focused on the return to double-digit pretax margins. Our second quarter guidance of adjusted pretax margins in the range of 7% to 10% is a significant step to getting double-digit pretax adjusted margins in the second half of the year and will represent the highest post-pandemic margins achieved by the company. With that, I'll hand the call over to Daniel for a commercial update.\nDaniel Shurz: Thank you, Barry, and good afternoon, everyone. Total operating revenue for the first quarter of 2023 totaled $848 million, a record for any first quarter in company history, driven by RASM growth of 19% on an 18% increase in capacity, both compared to the 2022 quarter. The RASM increase was driven by a nine percentage point increase in low factor to 83%, and an 11% increase in revenue per passenger to $124, both compared to the 2022 quarter. Ancillary revenue performance continued to be strong even in the seasonally weaker first quarter with $80 per passenger generated during the quarter, $11 per passenger higher than the 2022 quarter. Last month we opened access to our GoWild Pass holders begin booking travel three weeks earlier than we had originally announced. Feedback thus far has been overwhelmingly positive with customers taking to social media's claimants benefits. In response to consumer demand, just yesterday we announced another GoWild promotion for the summer of 2023 pass for $499 during the month of May. The GoWild program is an important addition to our loyalty ecosystem. When supplemented with elite spending levels via our Frontier World Mastercard, customers now have the opportunity to travel on the unlimited amount without incurring ancillary fees for seats and bags. Further, as customers invest in the GoWild Pass on the Frontier World Mastercard, the value of the discount then becomes an obvious complimentary product. Explaining briefly on the shape our utilization changes to our network. We conducted a full review of profitability of the past several quarters and observed a clear change in consumer demand patterns. While overall leisure travel is increasing, the benefit is disproportionately landing on peak days and in peak travel periods. Prior to the pandemic, the RASM premium on peak days versus Tuesday to Wednesday was 19%. This premium has expanded to over 25% today. By maximizing flying on peak days and peak periods, and reducing underperforming flying in low demand periods, we believe we can generate better profitability with less flying, thus derisking our operations. Given our modular network approach, which has proven to be more resilient from a reliability perspective over the past few years, specifically reducing midweek flying on longer stage route is more operationally complex as it would cause significant crew inefficiencies. For this reason, we have eliminated a select number of longer haul routes as part of this network optimization, which will reduce our average stage length from 1070 miles closer to 1000 miles. That concludes my remarks and I'll now hand the call to Jimmy.\nJimmy Dempsey: Thank you, Daniel. Our first quarter results reflected pretax loss margin of 2% on a GAAP basis or minus 1.9% on an adjusted basis. The results are reflective of the seasonality of the business, but the seasoning week first half of the quarter substantially offset by a strong spring break period. RASM increased 19% during the quarter on an 18% increase in capacity. Fuel expense was slightly lower than anticipated, driven by an average cost per gallon of $3.45.  Adjusted non-fuel operating expenses were in line with expectations of $580 million or $6.61, 8% lower than the 2022 quarter. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position at $790 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents or $363 million net of total debt. We had 125 aircraft in our fleet at March 31 after taking delivery of six A321neo aircraft during the quarter, three of which were direct leases. As noted in our earnings release, Airbus notified us of its intent to shift its remaining aircraft deliveries expected in 2023 by approximately one month. This will cost two incremental A321neo aircraft shift from 2024, sorry, to shift into 2024 from 2023 in addition to the previous delays from earlier this year. Additionally, the 2023 delays cascading into 2024 are expected to result in no net change to the expected deliveries in 2024 as a similar number of number of delays are expected in 2024. Based on the revised schedule from Airbus, we expect to take delivery of four A321neos in the second quarter, three of which are direct leases; seven in the third quarter, four of which are direct leases and four in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we recently executed an agreement to extend the current leases on two A320ceo aircraft by four years, which otherwise were scheduled to return in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we expect to end the year with 136 aircraft in our fleet, unchanged from our prior estimate. Turning to guidance. Second quarter capacity growth is anticipated to be in the range of 22% to 24% over the 2022 quarter. While our full year 2023 capacity is expected to reflect growth of between 19% to 22% over the prior year to align with the utilization changes presented earlier and the impact of the Airbus delays. Fuel costs are expected to be between $2.65 per gallon and $2.75 per gallon in the second quarter, and $2.80 to $2.90 per gallon for the full year 2023, based on the blended curve on April 24th. Adjusted non-fuel operating expenses in the second quarter expected to be between $645 million to $665 million and $2.5 billion to $2.55 billion for the full year. Our second quarter cost guide includes the deferral of an aircraft delivery into the third quarter and excess crew staffing resulting from the Airbus delays earlier this year. Full year cost reflect the deferral of two incremental aircraft deliveries into 2024, as well as the previously noted network changes detailed by Barry and Daniel, which deliver a similar level of departures on a shorter average stage length than previously planned. We are proud of our relative cost advantage of over $70 per passenger over the industry and are confident that with longer stage and maintaining higher utilization, we would've beaten our sub $0.06 [ph] CASM objective. However, we believe our network changes deliver a better profitability outcome for the business. Second quarter adjusted pretax margin is expected to be in the range of 7% to 10%, which will be our highest post-pandemic margin. While average adjusted pretax margin in the second half of the year is expected to be in the range of 10% to 13%. With that, I'll turn the call back to Barry for closing remarks.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks Jimmy. I'm extremely proud of team Frontier and want to personally thank all of our employees for our performance during the quarter, including the achievement of high utilization during the peak March period. We're focused on achieving double-digit margins and expect that the strength of our ancillary product offerings and widening cost advantage position us well to achieve this target. In addition, we believe that the network updates we're making to capitalize on the post-pandemic demand changes have created a unique opportunity for us to optimize our capacity and our high utilization capabilities in a manner that enable us to lower our execution risk and maximize profits, putting us on track to return to pre-pandemic margins over the next year. Thanks everyone for joining the call. I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Appreciate the time. With your new or maybe increased emphasis on seasonality, could you just put that in context for us? Maybe compare a peak relative to a trough a month within a quarter? I assume, it's sort of within the week, as well as kind of month to month, so maybe -- just pick a September, for example. How would you be thinking about a September now relative to a July versus before you made this change?\nDaniel Shurz: Duane, thank you. It's Daniel. It's much more day of week issue than it is a month-to-month issue. It's going to -- our peak day utilization is going to look very similar. We think month-to-month through the rest of the year, we're seeing peaks be strong even in off peak period. What you're going to see, I think, relative to where we would've been is what you're going to see is in the most significant periods, we're probably going to be about 20% smaller on Tuesday and Wednesday than we would've been prior to this. The overall difference is about 15% in the second half between our peak days and off peak days. And in the most significant period it's about 25%, but you would've seen a small difference in the past, so I'll call it about 20% in a month like September.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then maybe just for my follow up, longer term in nature, is load factor something that you're driving to from a target perspective? What would be the goal on load factor over time? And how do you expect this shift to aid that goal?\nJimmy Dempsey: Well, load factor is, we only look at it as a function of total revenue and RASM. It is helpful when you're in a high ancillary business of the leader in the world to actually run a high load factor. And for that reason, we have been targeting it. You'll actually see that we've been improving in this area, and we expect to continue to improve. And we would like to get to a flown load factor that starts with a nine.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Maybe just one last little follow up there. The GoWild, to the extent you get to a nine, the GoWild, how many points would you anticipate that would contribute.\nJimmy Dempsey: In the one to three point range once it's mature.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. We have a question from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan Securities. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. So, Barry, at Investor Day, you leaned pretty heavy into work life attributes that were helping you navigate the pilot shortage better than some of your competitors. Several months have elapsed since then, several new contracts have been reached. Spirit admits that it's raised isn't particularly helping things. I'm just wondering if your pilot staffing confidence is unfazed by anything you've seen since Investor Day?\nBarry Biffle: It's unfazed. We remain in a surplus position. And we're really proud of what we offer and nothing's changed in that area. And in fact, we were just reviewing it earlier today and the attrition is right on target. And I think you just have to remember we have competitive compensation if you look over the first 10-plus years of their careers. We've also got a better work life balance as you mentioned with more days off than practically anybody else in the industry. I think we're averaging in the -- starts in the 12 range days per month for average bid line holders. So no, we have a robust recruiting and we don't have the attrition that you're seeing at some of these other carriers.\nJamie Baker: Perfect. And just as a follow up, historically, most U.S. airlines did not accrue for higher wages, new contracts. It caught me by surprise, as that convention appeared to change in the last year or so. Obviously, doesn't make sense before you reach your amendable date, but have you given any thought as to whether you might guide 2024 CASM reflective of a new contract, or will you just wait until it's ratified, which was the old school way of doing things?\nJimmy Dempsey: Jamie, it's Jimmy Dempsey here.\nJamie Baker: Hi, Jimmy.\nJimmy Dempsey: I mean, we -- how's it going? We haven't -- we need to open the contract. The contract expires at the end of the year and the early opener for the pilots is in July. I mean, we'll address next year's guidance when we get closer to next year. Clearly, we've -- we're aware of what's happening in the pilot world. We are staffing the airline very effectively, managing our contract and our relationship with the pilots in a very effective manner. Some of those other contracts were open for quite some period of time and also had deals on the table that showed substantial increases in in pay. We are some ways away from doing that, so -- but\u2026\nJamie Baker: Got it. Thanks for the feedback. I appreciate it, gentlemen. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is open.\nConor Cunningham: Hey, everyone. Thank you for the time. Just in terms of the changes to the reshaping of your network. I'm just trying to understand why you're doing this now. I would've thought that some of these changes would've already been implemented. But just are you seeing off peak a lot weaker than you've anticipated, and then peaks just being that much better? Just curious if you're seeing anything on the margin from a demand standpoint that that's really changing how you're thinking about your network overall.\nBarry Biffle: Well, look, it has changed versus pre-pandemic. As Daniel laid out, it was a 19% difference off peak versus peak prior to the pandemic. And we're seeing levels over 25% now. So, in some cases even more extreme in the off peak months for off peak days. So yes, the reason why we haven't changed is, is quite candidly. We are a high utilization business and we've actually run a lot higher utilization than most people on balance from a midweek perspective in the past. And we are now at the point we've seen several quarters. And we just -- the data's staring us in the face. And I think when you look at the first quarter in particular, I think, what I think's most interesting is we believe we could have made money from a profitability perspective, when we looked at first quarter had we made these changes. And so, one of the best ways to stop losing money is stop doing things that lose money. And so, we are on a go forward basis, we're reacting to this. And if the dynamics change, going forward, we'll look at it again, but we think this is the right path to get back to pre-pandemic margins.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. That's helpful. And then as you start to think about your 2024 plans and growth overall, I mean, there's been a lot of talk about capacity constraints, you've talked a fair bit about Airbus delays. Just why shouldn't we expect whatever we had in terms of our capacity growth plan for 2024, that it should be lower going forward. It just seems like a lot of these issues that we're talking about right now just won't necessarily dissipate going forward. Just curious on how you're thinking about that as we go onto 2024. Thanks.\nBarry Biffle: Well, there will be delays in 2024. I think the biggest thing that you have to understand though is that the majority of the pain has already been felt. So, you're laughing when they first came in with this big delay, you moved a whole bunch of airplanes to the right. What's going to happen is yes, we'll move aircraft out of 2024 into 2025 at some point, but the 2023 that got moved into 2024 will actually deliver. So, I think you have to remember we have enough aircraft on delivery that we expect to continue to have sizable growth. So, I think what's more important when you think about Frontier versus the overall industry is that if you ask an airline today, would you take an airplane from the manufacturer that's maybe delayed a few months versus not have one, they'll take the airplane delayed and we have a very good order book, and it's a real asset to the business. So, I think, yes, it will impact 2024, but from a year-over-year perspective, I think you're not going to see the changes that you've seen in the past.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time this afternoon. So, can you maybe, Jimmy, talk about the non-fuel cost pressures that you're seeing, like which airport cost maybe is included in that? I know salaries are up, but the other costs that you're experiencing?\nJimmy Dempsey: There's a couple of things. We're not immune to inflation like the entire economy. We are seeing some inflation in the business being offset by the growth in capacity and the average seats per departure are increasing considerably. And so that is effectively managed inflation. What you're seeing at the moment in the cost base is overstaffing from a crew perspective, both in the pilot and flight attendant world. And then, you have some noise around the delivery delays that are happening in the airline that move from one quarter to another some of the financing benefits that we get from sale of these packs [ph]. And so you have some noise that's going on around that where the typical Airbus delivery delay is now four to five months as opposed to three to five months previously. Outside of that, the business is -- from a cost perspective is operating very, very effectively. Our cost differential to the competition is still over $70 a passenger. Pre-COVID, it was $60 a passenger. And so our cost advantage against the rest of the industry has widened, and we expect that to continue.\nHelane Becker: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow up question. I noticed in the last -- I don't know, random survey, you guys were last in, I guess, consumer satisfaction, if that's a word. And I'm wondering how you're thinking about retaining customers as opposed to churning customers, or do I have that wrong? And you're not really churning, you just had some bad luck?\nJimmy Dempsey: Well, I think, when we look at the data, we have one of the highest repeat businesses in the industry. We have over 90% repeat business. Look, I saw one of these recent surveys. I think I would be very careful about the sources of some of these and how they base that off of. The other thing is, is when you look at the waitings of some of these, I guess, studies or analysis, they really don't wait price like they should. And what you see is that, that consumers when they buy air travel, the number one thing they look for, especially for leisure customers, is price. And so, if you wait price as it should be weighted, I think we're a clear winner when you look at the overall value for consumers. And that's why we continue to have such high repeat business.\nHelane Becker: Thank you. Very helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew DiDora with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew DiDora: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Just in terms of the network changes, right? I know, Barry, you speak about it lowering your execution risk, but I would think that more peak flying maybe kind of might increase operational risk a bit here. And am I right to think about it that way? And maybe what are you doing to potentially mitigate some of this operational risk at peak times?\nDaniel Shurz: So, Andrew, it's Daniel. We're broadly speaking flying the same utilization on peak days. We're keep -- what I was saying is actually we're just going to keep the peak utilization up. Well, maybe apply slightly high peak utilization in and off peak month because we found the peak days in those off peak months, which a bit better, but we're not pushing our peak utilization higher than it was before. So, the lower execution risk is simply you've got more with lower off peak flying, you've got more recovery time during the middle of the week. We've got more recovery time on Saturday, which helps you. And we've seen that. We've seen evidence of this helps us run a better operation than -- on both those days and on the peak days of the follow up.\nBarry Biffle: The other thing I would point out too is that if you look at the March and especially April, we're the highest utilization airline in total, not just peak days, in total. And yet we've been mid pack or higher. I think we're fourth place in completion in April as an example. So, if you can trust anyone to run high utilization effectively and reliably, it's Frontier.\nAndrew DiDora: Got it. And then, sort of a follow up to an earlier question regarding your costs. I guess 2023 capacity came -- did come down a decent chunk, but your -- the midpoint of your OpEx guidance went higher. Can you maybe provide a bridge on what is driving that, Jimmy, maybe providing some of the bigger cost buckets, that's driving OpEx higher even while capacity is coming down?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yeah. I mean, I mentioned it earlier to Helene's question. The movement of aircraft out of the period is one of the big drivers of increasing the higher range, the higher end of the range. The other thing that's happening in the business is you have a similar number of departures, but lower ASM production because the stage length is shortening. And so, you have a very similar overall cost base, albeit on slower ASM produced capacity, but a similar level of departures. And so, you end up with a similar cash cost effectively. You do save some money on fuel, but your airport charges, your station costs in general, and the ground handling costs typically stay similar, and so that's all you're seeing at the moment.\nAndrew DiDora: Got it. And if I could maybe speak one more in there. Just in terms of pretax margins for the year, obviously fuel came down a bit, your costs started moving higher. Anything change from your perspective in the way you're thinking about the revenue cadence throughout the year?\nJimmy Dempsey: Not really. We're expecting the revenue for the rest of your -- we're expecting domestic to look much more like normal years. We're expecting peaks to be good. We're expecting the summer, therefore Q3 to be -- Q3 to be strong with the usual. We're expecting the usual holiday strength in Q4. So we're expecting the cadence through the year to be much more like a normal domestic year.\nAndrew DiDora: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I guess, this one's for Barry or Daniel. With the off peak changes, does this change in any way, like your new market strategy, especially in the back half of the year as you get into the more trough period after the summer?\nBarry Biffle: No. This wouldn't change our new market strategy in particular. Although, longer hauls are more complicated because if you do want to reduce midweek flying, it causes inefficient crew pairings, it causes deadheads as an example. And I would say, if you just look at a specific city where this has been most pronounced, it's Las Vegas. I mean, we have seen that the midweek is just nowhere near what it was prior to the pandemic. I mean -- and you can see it in the pricing of hotels in Las Vegas, you can see it everything, you can see the strip is packed on a Friday night, but on a Tuesday it's just little, you can get a reservation anywhere you want. And so that is reflecting in our loads as well, as well as fairs. And so that impacts Las Vegas and it especially impacts long hauls from Vegas as an example. So -- but overall, we haven't seen anywhere else be that challenge like we've seen in Las Vegas.\nBrandon Oglenski: I mean, I guess, Barry, some of the concern in the market is you do definitely have the absolute cost advantage, but is that just not resulting in the stimulation that you guys were seeing maybe pre-pandemic?\nJimmy Dempsey: No. Brandon, I'll take this one. We're seeing demand strength. We're seeing the ability to stimulate demand in new markets. We are still aggressively expanding the airline. We are aggressively adding new markets. And we're absolutely seeing that strength come through. What we're saying here simply is in off peak periods, off peak days a week have been -- are further underperforming relative to what we saw pre-pandemic. But again, that's not to say that we don't want -- that's not to say we're going to find expansion, we're not going to simulation. I can point to markets where -- which were new last September compared to pre-pandemic, where on the peak days a week we saw very strong performance. We saw great demand. And we continue to see in the future lots more markets where we think we're going to see exactly the same thing.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate that. And maybe just one last one on utilization. If you are taking down off peak, how do you plan to match utilization? Or do you take a slight penalty there too?\nBarry Biffle: I wouldn't slight penalty there too, in addition to what we're not -- I mean, look, utilization will be slightly lower, but overall our cost advantage, we expect to widen. So, let's be clear that our cost advantage is widening even with these changes. So, this is less than a 10% move. This is not that dramatic of a change. We expect that this is accretive couple points in margin from a profitability perspective. So, this isn't a major change in our business. It's just a tweak that we're just seeing that travel patterns, people are willing to pay a lot more to travel Thursday, Sunday than they did even before. And there's more of them. But the work-from-home and I would actually argue it's less the work-from-home, but more the work flexibility where people are working two and three days a week in the office. The most common two days in the office are Tuesdays and Wednesdays. It's no coincidence, it's -- this is not some just mysterious black box of information. That's why travel for leisure is the hardest on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. And so that, to be blunt, we've got to utilize the airline and we're better at it than anybody on the other days of the week. But Tuesday, Wednesday's just not as pronounced as it was before, but it's not going to kill our business \u2026\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you, Barry.\nBarry Biffle: Yeah. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nShannon Doherty: Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Shannon Doherty on for Mike. Barry, I appreciate the details that you gave in the script about the GoWild Pass and saw that you recently put Summer Pass on sale, I think for 499. I just wonder whether that was demand driven or if you're just trying to sell even more? And like do you hit a limit in the number of passes that you can sell, maybe unlike a credit card, just thinking about fleet growth and capacity.\nBarry Biffle: Well, there -- they're actually -- I mean, ultimately there's a limit. We want to -- we want GoWild to be the highest NPS product that's out there. We want to sell it at favorable prices, but ultimately there is a limit, just like there's a limit on how many seats you can sell. And even I think credit cards would actually eventually have a limit to people because they only have so much capacity. But no, we're really excited about it. It's probably been the best received product that we've ever launched. And I think -- if I recall, I think you were personally interested in it yourself. So, hopefully, you've taken advantage of the great deals and we're really excited about it. But yes, there is ultimately going to be a limit. But we've said this before publicly, and that's why I said, it could be a couple points in load factor is look, we had 6 million seats that were going to potentially go empty. We've said if we could just fill a third of those, that's 2 million seats. This isn't tough math, right? That's several points in load factor. And so you can kind of back into there -- yes, there will be a limit based on how many times they fly, and how much the usage is, is how many we could actually sell. And so -- but we don't believe we've hit that yet.\nShannon Doherty: Great. Thanks. And just my second question. I noticed that you guys filed a schedule through spring 2024, but about a week ago, fully cut it beyond November. What was that about? Was that more just unsure about the demand beyond the summer? Or does it have to do with this peak -- off peak month and day changes that you guys are making? Anything you have there would help.\nDaniel Shurz: It's Daniel. No, that was actually an error, but that was an error by the industry schedules provider. They mistakenly took our full schedule and just extended it forward into the winter. We put -- we have a schedule on sale to customers through November -- through November 15th. We -- that's the -- furthest out extension we have for this year. And we've never had a date on sale to customers beyond that time.\nShannon Doherty: Got it. Makes sense. All right. Thank you guys.\nBarry Biffle: No, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna Investment Group.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So, Barry, I think this is the second cut to the 2023 capacity guide, it's around I think $42 billion ASMs you outlined in November. February was on Airbus. Today's network changes, and it sounds like some additional delays, but of smaller size. At this point, if there are additional delays in deliveries, can you offset that with utilization or something else? And just how do we get comfortable with the current guide in light of what looks to be -- like elevated risk with the OEMs at least through year-end? Thank you.\nBarry Biffle: Well, I think, look, we have been disappointed in their delivery stream. But I think as we get closer and closer and we're watching them, like a hawk to be honest, I think we're growing in confidence that yes, it's firming up. I think they've gotten their bad news out. And I think, it's -- I think it's pretty tough. But again, I'm not going to speak for Airbus, they could have another challenge, but it looks pretty good. On a utilization basis, look, I mean, if fuel prices change, if demand changes somewhat, we have the ability to add more capacity. But I think at this point, given that they're four months in and they've pushed another two aircraft, I think that kind of shows the magnitude of the change, which is not a big material piece from here on out. And again, like the capacity change we're making right now, this is elective. We could put these ASMs back in. We just think that we can make more money without flying them. And quite honestly, we'll make more money and we continue to have the lowest cost in the business and we'll have an even widening cost advantage. So, it's really an unnecessary utilization.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And as a follow up, so as we look at the network plans that you outlined in November, which included this focus on building a more modular network, does this change in capacity impact the plans? Is it sort of unchanged, and just there's a different path now to get there? Or is it going to take longer? Just if you could put a little finer point on how we should think about the plans you outlined at your Investor Day versus this new dynamic, yeah, plans you have. Thanks.\nDaniel Shurz: Absolutely. This is Daniel. From a modularity perspective, we were talking in November, we implemented that high -- that increasingly high modularity network in November. We have continued to work in that -- with that design approach to the network. That will continue even with this off peak capacity. We will -- we've made the network increasingly designed around one day crew trips, one day crew trips obviously work perfectly with day of week variance, because if you have the trip in the schedule on Monday and you don't have it on Tuesday, that's fine. And to the extent we are a mix of one and two day crew trips primarily, two day crew trips, we'll make sure they're in markets that actually want to fly seven days a week. So there's not a problem with that either. So I don't expect any change to the modularity. I don't expect any change to the crew efficiency from moving in this direction.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Felipe Nielsen [ph] from Citi. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. It's Felipe speaking from Stephen Trent team at Citi. Thanks for taking all the question. Well, we are curious about to hear from you about, to what extent do you see upside from co-chairing with Mexico carrier Volaris, in case Mexico regains its category one status on safety rating. And then I have a follow up question after that.\nBarry Biffle: Okay. Daniel, can answer it?\nDaniel Shurz: So, yeah, we obviously have a co-chair share with Volaris. We're suspend under the downgrade of Mexico. We are not allowed to co-chair on Volaris. Volaris continues to operate a co-chair on Frontier flights. And assuming Mexico is upgraded -- when Mexico is reupgraded to category one, we will resume putting our code on Volaris operated flights.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great color guys. And just a second follow up on my side. How do you feel about your current pipeline of mechanics? Do you see any risks there? Curious to hear about?\nBarry Biffle: That's a great question, Felipe. People talk a lot about the pilots, but actually the mechanic shortage is also real. It's not kind of the numbers that we've seen for the pilots. But it is a challenge. And the industry overall has had some difficulty, I think, attracting the younger generations to go and choose that vocational path and get into training. We have actually seen, I think pockets of issues. So, it's a little different than the pilots because the pilots, you can move them around the system, if you will. It seems to be much more local market issue, where we have challenges in some places. But we've seen strength in kind of the sunbelt, where -- in the pockets where we're growing the network. But then you're also seeing some cities, there's shortages. So, it -- and it changes the incentives you have to have in order to hire them. And they vary by city. And we've been doing a lot of things to actually, just like we've done, we haven't been talking about it. But just like we've been doing our cadet program, our head of HRs, he has been going out and putting together a recruiting team, and we're working with a lot of the schools, that are producing a mechanics. And so, we feel good about the pipeline that we've put together. But yes, it is issue. A lot of people don't want to talk about it or haven't recognized it. But it is an issue. And we're-- we've been managing it now for well over a year. But the truth is, is that Frontier remains an attractive place to work for our pilots as well as mechanics. And so, we have a pretty good pipeline of folks coming in.\nUnidentified Analyst: Clear. Super clear. Thanks for calling guys.\nBarry Biffle: Hey, thanks Felipe.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Barry Biffle for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nBarry Biffle: Hey, I want to thank everybody for joining today, and especially those of you that ask questions, appreciate those thoughtful questions, and we look forward to talking to you again in the next quarter. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ULCC", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2023-02-09 14:12:10", "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Frontier Group Holdings' Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Erdman, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDavid Erdman: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Today's speakers will be Barry Biffle, President and CEO; Jimmy Dempsey, EVP and CFO; and Daniel Shurz, Senior Vice President, Commercial. Each will deliver brief prepared remarks, and then we'll get to your questions. First though, let me cover the safe harbor provisions. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those predicted in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors which could cause such differences are outlined in the announcement we published earlier, along with reports we filed with the SEC. We will also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to the nearest comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of the earnings announcement. And so with that, I'm going to give the floor to Barry to begin his comments. Barry?\nBarry Biffle: Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Frontier posted strong fourth quarter results, achieving an adjusted pretax margin of 5.7%, our third straight quarterly profit. Results were underpinned by a record ancillary revenue performance along with meaningful improvements in our unit cost and utilization. The strong result was hampered by major disruptions followed by winter storm early during the busy holiday travel period. However, we were able to minimize the impact through the recoverability of our modular network and the dedication of team Frontier who worked tirelessly to ensure our passengers arrive safely at their destination. I'd like to extend my gratitude and recognize the team's efforts as they overcame treacherous weather conditions with extended shifts and managed customer disruptions to get them to their destination safely. At our Investor Day last November, we've highlighted how leisure travel demand has undergone a fundamental shift and how we're uniquely positioned to exploit it. Customers have more flexibility and more propensity to traveling than they did pre-pandemic and its compelling evidence points to the resiliency in the leisure travel segment. We expect the benefits from this resilient demand to be amplified by industry capacity constraints predominantly by pilot shortages and supply chain bottlenecks. But this creates a significant opportunity for Frontier. Although we're not immune to these issues [indiscernible] dominated by the A321neo, together with our Robust Pilot Recruiting and Training platforms uniquely provides us the foundation to harness the growth opportunity before us. Last year we launched our Cadet and [indiscernible] Program, and both are driving strong demand in candidates who applied to Frontier. Over 100 pilots have already been accepted into the Cadet Program, and we have nearly 5,000 applications last year through all of our hiring channels. In fact, the first cadets from the program will be joining us as first officers in just a few weeks. Although aircraft manufacturers are dealing with supply chain issues, the delays we're experiencing from Airbus are between 1 to 5 months. While we're disappointed with these delays, they effectively represent a manageable 1 quarter shift on average across our orderbook. Our strategy has been to focus on the areas that we can control. We'll focus on hitting our near-term target of $85 in ancillary revenue per passenger, and we achieved $82 for the fourth quarter, enhancing our confidence that hitting the $85 in the fourth quarter will happen. Moreover we lowered our total adjusted CASM, including interest by 8% from the prior quarter and widened our total cost advantage with the industry to an equivalent of over $70 per passenger. Our costs are our competitive edge, and we expect to maintain this advantage for years to come. Put simply, our strong ancillary performance and industry-leading unit costs are the variables that make it possible for us to capitalize on the strong leisure market and stimulate profitable growth for the rest of the decade. All of the team Frontier are unified in this pursuit and it gives me confidence to reaffirm our target of returning the airline to pre-pandemic profit per plane by the second half of 2023 on a run rate basis. With that, I'll hand the call over to Daniel for a commercial update.\nDaniel Shurz: Thank you, Barry, and good afternoon, everyone. Fourth quarter revenue was $906 million, a 38% increase from the 2019 quarter, marking the fourth consecutive quarter in which revenue has grown by double-digits over the respective 2019 quarter. Travel reached [indiscernible] a high level of capacity. Total revenue per passenger was $133 supported by impressive performance on the ancillary front, which, as Barry mentioned, reached a record $82 per passenger. Our ancillary performance demonstrates our customers' preference for unbundled products, enable them to personalize their travel experience [indiscernible] for a more stable and predictable source of revenue. This has affected our [indiscernible] ancillary performance that we saw throughout 2022 with [indiscernible] achieving our target of $85 per passenger in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as our long-term target of $100 per passenger by 2026. [indiscernible] utilization improved by approximately 25 per day over the prior quarter to 11.5 hours, on average daytime [indiscernible] to 1,032 miles. With the continued progression in our utilization [indiscernible] throughout 2022 towards pre-pandemic levels, we're on track to achieve average daily utilization of over 12 hours and an average [indiscernible] of 1,050 hours during 2023 as set forth at our Investor Day. In the fourth quarter, we opened [indiscernible] market were 140 [indiscernible] now based. With the [indiscernible] we launched in the fourth quarter was [indiscernible] and that's up 23 destinations [indiscernible]. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we announced a new [indiscernible] in May 2023, where we expect to employ 120 pilot from 220 [indiscernible] by the end of the first year of operation. We've been the fastest-growing carrier at DFW since 2019. And once we launch [indiscernible] will be the first largest carrier at the airport based on destinations served. And last, we announced [indiscernible] service point of retail. With additional long-term routes to [indiscernible] a new service to [indiscernible] key destinations on the island. Once the [indiscernible] we also have more destinations from the Caribbean Island than any other airline. Finally, since we launched in November [indiscernible] have been strong. This unique product provides travelers the opportunity for unlimited flights to all of our domestic and international destination for one low annual price. Just last week, we introduced the second [indiscernible] product to travel during the summer months. We're seeing strong demand since it went on sale. [indiscernible] encouraged by the increasing engagement this product creates with our brand, both for existing and new customers. That concludes my remarks. I'll now hand over the floor to Jimmy.\nJimmy Dempsey : Thank you, Daniel. We generated a pretax margin of 5.5% on a GAAP basis, 5.7% on an adjusted basis during the fourth quarter, above the midpoint of our guidance range despite the impact of the holiday winter storm. Our adjusted pretax margin excludes $2 million in employee retention [indiscernible] termination -- terminated the combination with Spirit, the recognition of which is expected in the March 2023 quarter. The sequential margin improvement hampered by storm impact was largely driven by record ancillary revenue and lower fuel cost per day. Adjusted CASM ex-fuel declined sequentially to $0.64, which was 7% lower than the prior quarter, the lowest expense since exiting the pandemic. The decline was driven by higher utilization along with the timing of aircraft deliveries and aircraft returns, partially offset by higher other nonfuel expenses, particularly lease return costs. We ended the year in a strong financial position with $761 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $332 million of net of total debt. In addition, as previously highlighted, we have the ability, if needed, to access substantial liquidity through our loyalty program and brand related asset. We had 120 aircraft in our fleet at year-end after taking delivery of 2 A320neo and 3 A321neo aircraft during the quarter. We expect to take delivery of another 6 A321neos in the first quarter of 2023, of which 3 are direct leases. As noted in our earnings release, Airbus' delay in aircraft has reached by 1 to 5 months for delivery scheduled in 2023. Accordingly 9 A321neo aircraft deliveries previously expected this year will shift into 2024, resulting in about 5% capacity in 2023 than we expected in November. We therefore expect to encounter slight upward pressure on adjusted CASM ex in the near term given the unit cost efficiencies unlocked by the A321neo. Accordingly we anticipate being below $0.06 during the second half of 2023 and largely above for the full year, a level which we believe is materially below the industry average. Recap and guidance, first quarter capacity is anticipated to grow 17% to 19% over the 2022 quarter, while full year 2023 is expected to grow 23% to 28% over the prior year. Fuel costs are expected between $3.50 and $3.55 per gallon in the first quarter and $3.05 to $3.15 per gallon for the full year 2023 as of the [Brent] fuel curve on January 30. Adjusted nonfuel operating expenses in the first quarter are expected to be between $570 million and $595 million and $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion for the full year. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 24% for the entire year. Finally, first quarter adjusted pretax margin is expected to be in the range of minus 2% to minus 6%, largely reflecting elevated fuel prices and seasonal softness. With that, I'll turn the call back to Barry for closing remarks.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks, Jimmy. Our objectives for 2023 are clear. All 13,000 members of team Frontier are focused on completing the post-pandemic turnaround. I'm confident we can sustain the momentum from the last 3 quarters as we execute on widening our relative total cost advantage as we deliver on revenue enhancements, particularly on the ancillary front. Together these 2 factors will enable us to return the airline to pre-pandemic profit levels. Thanks again everyone for joining the call today. We're now happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Stephen Trent from Citi.\nStephen Trent: Definitely appreciate the color and everything you mentioned about the cadet program and what have you, and that's great to hear. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind giving us some color on what you're seeing in terms of mechanics and sort of availability of mechanics and if you're seeing sort of any hiccups in terms of engine maintenance throughput issues of any kind?\nBarry Biffle: Yes, thanks, Steve. So look, we've been talking about the mechanic shortage for years, and everyone is focused on the pilots, but actually the mechanic shortage is just as problematic. We have seen some of our business partners. As a reminder, the majority of our maintenance on the line is actually provided by business partners, and we have seen some challenges there. In particular, we've seen issues, especially in places where we have still on-call maintenance where we don't do maintenance every day. Sometimes the availability, lots of times, how quickly they respond has deteriorated a lot as a result of their staffing levels. But we are working with them. We've had a lot of talks with them recently. The other thing that's been impacting us, you mentioned the engines which hasn't been a major issue for us. However, there has been significant challenges with parts overall. And we have seen in many cases over the last several months, we've had multiple instances with aircraft out 5 to 7 days, waiting on parts. And so we've kind of seen the supply chain issue that a lot of people have had. And so we are working with all our providers and spending a lot of time on that, but the supply chain issue this year across other industries, and including our own, they are real.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: So this first question, I wasn't planning to ask until last night. Of your total ancillary take, what percentage comes from the seat assignment fees on reservations with more than one traveler in the PNR?\nDaniel Shurz: Jamie, [indiscernible] we don't disclose the breakdown, that's something I don't have breakdown of. I don't have a breakdown of exactly what -- what the mix is of how many passenger is on the PNR and what's going on [indiscernible] we're obviously conscious of the things that you've talked about.\nJamie Baker: Yes, yes, which is why I'm asking.\nBarry Biffle : Well, Jamie, I know why you're asking the question. And first of all, we have 4 years and is the standard practice across the industry, we have shown every option available to a customer before they complete their booking. So everyone knows prices well in advance. If a flight is canceled or if they're significantly delayed, we provide prompt refunds on request. And also as it comes to families and seating families, we actually do that today for free and we have high success in actually getting families seated together. There are operational challenges last time, and flexible and there is plenty of other seats in, the last few seats were sold to a family, it's a little harder. But we do a really good job with that. So, I think there's a lot of confusion with that.\nJamie Baker: Well, and I appreciate that, Barry. So let me just ask, and I apologize because I'm going to give away the fact that I don't fly Frontier very often. But if I go to book a flight right now for a party of 5 for travel in June, you're telling me that all 5 of us will be able to make adjacent seat assignments for free?\nBarry Biffle: No, no, we will make every [indiscernible] if you don't have seat assigned, we'll make every effort to get you together, but not the whole family together, we will put an adult with the smaller children.\nJamie Baker: Okay, fair enough. I'll experiment more with it in a second. I'm sure, the 5% reduction in 2023 capacity, it takes some pressure off pilot hiring and I know you made an excellent point at Investor Day emphasizing new crew bases out and back flying as lifestyle benefits. But given the recent wage increases, it looks like you're now bringing up the rear in the industry in terms of pay save, I guess, for maybe Avelo and Breeze. Obviously this will change the new pilot contract in 2024. But until then, why shouldn't we assume that the pilot shortage hurts you more than other low-cost airlines in the U.S.?\nBarry Biffle: Because it happened. We have an aggressive hiring program and we\u2019re not bringing up the rear. I think we\u2019ve gotten the brunt of a lot of this dialog. This is a regional situation, right. We are significantly higher than the regionals and we are successful in all of our classes and we\u2019re still getting over 10 applications a day of qualified applicants. So I think you\u2019re welcome to come out, Jamie. I\u2019ll introduce you to recruiting, go around the recruiting, we can show you our classes. It\u2019s not the problem that I think that the perception is out the there. In fact, we\u2019ll have to slow our hiring in order to accommodate the Airbus.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Appreciate the color. Just 1 or 2 questions here. I heard what you said about demand in the fourth quarter. But as you're looking at the cadence of demand in the first quarter, can you just talk about what you saw in January and what you're seeing for the rest of this quarter into maybe the second quarter?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. So look, we've seen continued robust demand for leisure travel, and it continues to do very well. In fact, I think if you look at our results, you can see in the fourth quarter, I think we were second place in terms of capacity compared to 2019, and we put up an impressive RASM number against that. And in Q1, we continue to see that trend continue. We're going to be in a really good RASM position even though we are now the largest carrier in terms of size relative to our 2019 size. So even with significant growth in capacity, we are seeing continued strength in leisure demand and especially when we look to the peaks, and we've got presence there right around the corner, and we've got the spring break period. We see really robust demand, probably the best we've ever seen. And I expect at the current rate, we will have never seen a spring break that is as good as this year.\nHelane Becker: That's hugely helpful. And then I think -- I don't know if it was the last earnings call or the one before that, you talked about seeing trade down from other carriers to you guys. Are you still seeing that among maybe a nontraditional Frontier customer?\nBarry Biffle: We\u2019ve seen a significant uptick in customers that did not fly us before. So as a growing carrier, you\u2019re always seeing new customers because you\u2019re in new markets and so forth. And you\u2019re always adding new customers and say, I think that you already applied to. But we did see a significant uptick in customers over the past year that has not flown us before. We\u2019ve seen a significant uptick in customers that are buying our GoWild pass, as an example, who we\u2019ve never seen before at Frontier. It\u2019s hard to say if that\u2019s a price pressure of them being priced out of the legacy carrier or is it just simply that our brand is getting that much stronger. It's hard to say. But yes, we continue to see a significant amount of new customers.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: I guess to Barry, I guess you're sort of in a unique position in the sense that you're one of the few carriers that I think you have both the LEAP engine on your A320neo and I believe you're bringing in the GTF on your A321neos. Curious if you're seeing anything now or is it just because you just started getting the GTFs in your fleet? And what -- from maybe conversations that you're having with the OEMs, what is the issue? What do you think is the root cause, so that when a year or 2 or 3 down the road, you're not taking engines off the way?\nBarry Biffle: Well, I think that's a question for the engine manufacturers. But yes, we operate both engines. We -- in fact, it seems like yesterday, but we've been operating the neo now for, oh gosh, for 7 years. And we had a lot of teething challenges with the LEAP. There were shroud issues. There were a number of challenges of fuel nozzles, all types of things as there is with every new technology that has come in. We are past most of those issues now, there's maybe still a few lingering. We're not as familiar with the GTF, as you pointed out. We just started operating this aircraft basically in the fourth quarter. And so we're very new to it. We haven't had many of the issues. A lot of the issues, as we understand them, are earlier production series parts [indiscernible] and we're fortunate to have many of those upgrades later, but there obviously could be challenges. I think the biggest issue is not -- is the reliability is there, but the turnaround time on the engines themselves. So how long it takes, if you have an engine come off wing, how long it takes to get that engine overhauled and back. And I think what we're seeing, not just in engines, but in all types of components, we're seeing it take longer to get components repaired and back to the airlines. This is one of the challenges we're seeing with our provider on parts. It's just things are taking longer to get repaired. And so it takes longer to get them back on the shelf. And I do know, yes, there's another airline that called us out recently in the United States, but there's several around the world that have, in the engine space, that actually have aircraft sitting without engines. And so we're watching this closely. But yes, we're pretty good ways away from having any of these challenges and hopefully, given the improvements that they've already made to the engines, it's not as profound at Frontier.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, that's helpful. That kind of reinforces the adage that you kind of never want to be first in line for the new technology, let it teeth and be the airline #4 or 5. So that's good. And then my second question, and maybe this is Barry, to you, and Jimmy, the comment in the release about second half of 2023 getting back to the profitability per aircraft in 2019. I go back to 2019, and I see 14% pretax margins, that makes me salivate, probably makes you guys salivate as well. Is it a margin? Is it EBITDA per aircraft? What are you referring to? What metric do you hope to hit in the back half of the year?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes, Michael, we have an internal target of getting back to pre-pandemic profit levels, obviously. I think the entire industry is trying to do that, but like we have a real line of sight to moving back to a pre-profit per plane on a net income basis, on a run rate basis in the second half of the year. Obviously there's a lot of work to do to get there, moving our unit costs and widening the cost advantage against the competition and gives us a real runway to moving margins higher. And obviously we want to move margins higher, but it's not necessarily a margin race. It's more of a profit level per plane.\nBarry Biffle: Yes. So Mike, it\u2019s total dollars of net income per plane. And again, and just what we did with the fourth quarter kind of illustrates, if you look sequentially at the last 3 quarters, you can see the cost trajectory is clear. And so \u2013 and you can see that the ancillary revenue trajectory is clear. And so it\u2019s just math. And if you look, we\u2019re already back pretty close to pre-pandemic utilization. We got maybe half hour to go, but we already did 11.5 hours just in \u2013 just in the fourth quarter. So it\u2019s all systems go, and then we have a clear path. It\u2019s not a maybe, someday, it\u2019s right upon us.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes, the takedown on full year growth makes sense. More near term, can you just speak to the March quarter? How many -- how much of this is just short on deliveries in the here and now versus some increased conservatism in your planning assumptions?\nDaniel Shurz: Duane, it's all delays in aircraft deliveries. We have been working with Airbus for some time on understanding the supply chain issues that they have in their business. And we've been notified recently of significant delays across this year that we were previously unaware of. What we have been seeing is delays of between 4 and 6 weeks in aircraft deliveries. We've now seen that extend out between, as we said in the release, between 1 and 5 months. So the change in capacity is really driven by those aircraft delivery delays.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And how many, sorry, go ahead.\nBarry Biffle: Well, in Q1, in particular, this is the first time we've had kind of this close in with this many aircraft be late, but we had full 4 lines out as a result. So it's pretty significant, even close to it, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes, how many are you short like right now? Where do you think you would be and where are you?\nDaniel Shurz: What we're seeing, Duane, is aircraft delays start to like extend it. So you're seeing today that were occurring months, 6 weeks, 2 months, now going to 3, 4 months. And so that's what you're seeing cascading across the year. So if you go all the way to the end of the year, given the profile of our delivery schedule, you see 9 aircraft actually dropping out of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter and a bit beyond the first quarter of next year. And so that's what you're seeing. Right now, we've taken, as Barry said, 4 lines, we expect it to be 4 aircrafts.\nBarry Biffle: And there was already one. So we're actually down 5 now end of this quarter, and it grows to 9 by the end of the year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe a hypothetical, maybe more than hypothetical, on Spirit, slots and gates, if there was a package that became available, can you comment on your willingness to bid on that? Any thoughts on that conceptually?\nBarry Biffle: No, we can't comment.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski : Barry, can you talk to, I guess, the resiliency of your network and your operation? I mean I know I hear you on the pilot issue that maybe that's not really one that's fair to apply to you guys. But last summer, you did have constraints across the network, whether it was like airport capacity or FAA, ATC capacity. So what are you doing to mitigate those challenges this year? And what gives you the confidence you can grow at the levels you think you are?\nBarry Biffle: Yes, so actually it wasn't the summer. It was actually in the spring, we saw some challenges, particularly in Florida. Some carriers got, I guess, a bigger run than we did. But what we did is we reoriented our flying on pairing, crew pairing actually cross Jacksonville Center. And so effectively, you don't have any aircraft or any crew that actually crosses Jacksonville more than twice. And so this helps mitigate if we ended up with 3 and 4-hour ground lay programs again, we can just trim the flying and [indiscernible] for ATC, but it doesn't disrupt the aircraft for the next several days, right? So you don't get any situations where these carriers that have airplanes that are kind of duties daily chain, multi-leg all across the United States that lead through all super cities, we don't -- we're not impacted by that. And so that's one of the reasons why I think you look at the storm, we did so much better, I think, recovering after the fact, even though we were much more impacted than most when you look at our geography. I don't know, Dan, do you want to talk about scheduled construction?\nDaniel Shurz: Well, I was going to say one thing I'll say is, one thing that's changed since last spring and summer is we've increased the level of modularity. We've further tightened up in terms of -- with a higher percentage of crew just during the 1 day pairing, we've got on almost 4 are flying in 1 and 2-day pairings from a crew perspective. We've got more aircraft. We've got more aircraft based overnight in our biggest crew base. We've just simply -- we've simply created more resiliency with the [indiscernible] further increase in the modularity of the network, but it sets us in a good place going into the summer of 2023.\nBrandon Oglenski: I guess I appreciate the outlook as well for second half profitability, just like the earlier question. But Barry, what's the view, or Jimmy maybe, right now that you can't generate that profitability? Because you have got your cost down here recently, aircraft utilization is coming up. Is it really just the outlook for lower fuel prices, that's the difference?\nJimmy Dempsey: I mean, there is a relationship between fuel prices and revenue that we've seen over the course of the last year. And so, I mean, no, it's not just lower oil price. If you look in our guide today, we've given you the market price for oil for Q1. We've given you what the curve is for -- that we're seeing for oil prices for the year, and that's reflected in what we believe we can achieve throughout the year. What we've seen so far this year, particularly going actually towards the end of last year and going into the peak parts of this quarter, there is a real strength in demand coming through into the business. And that allied to $82 going to $85 in non-ticket plus your unit costs moving towards $0.06 plus the business in a really good position to improve profitability, which is really the objective that we're working towards.\nBarry Biffle: Specifically to your question, Brandon, about why not now, well, seasonally in Q1 is actually the worst for our network, the lowest random time. So the seasonality does come back. But also, your costs continue to sequentially go down. And so it\u2019s just mechanical. I mean, as the revenue comes up seasonally and the costs continue to go down and we\u2019ve also got further tailwinds coming in the ancillary that Daniel kind of mentioned, 82 going to 85 by year-end. Those things come together to put us back to pre-pandemic profitability.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham from Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: Maybe talk a little bit more about just the pilots in general and staffing. So some of the other airlines have talked about needing to be like 5%, have 5% more pilots to hit their like prior production levels. And you appear to be overstaffed right now, but I assume it has to do with delays and hopes of growth. But just long-term, do you think that there's a structural change in staffing and maybe employee productivity at Frontier?\nBarry Biffle: We don't completely understand that. We've heard that commentary, but we do not have more pilots per plane. We don't -- we have not seen a need for more pilots per plane. There is slightly higher pilot costs because we do have attrition that we've talked about in the past, we have a higher level of attrition causes, you'd have to train more. But if you look at like [indiscernible], for example, that's the main source. In fact, we see more efficiencies as Daniel kind of talked about the modularity network, we actually see more efficiencies come to this. So we're not sure what those businesses -- what other things are doing, but we don't understand why they would need a more positive plan.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, I'll take that. And then just on crew bases in general, you've opened up a lot, and I understand the idea around the modularity of your network and I get the benefits to the operational side of the business. But when a crew base is opened, why shouldn't we just turn around and assume that there's a -- there's an additional cost to Frontier, like a structurally higher cost, the fact that -- I mean, it is a much different stance than you had pre-pandemic. So just curious on how you think about crew bases and the impact to your overall profitability?\nBarry Biffle: Yes, so we spend a lot of time on this, and Daniel can spend hours with you explaining it. But as long as we have a minimum amount of sizing, in fact, today, we\u2019re in Phoenix hosting the call, and we just opened a base here. And we\u2019re already at the minimum scale that we need. So the only inefficiencies, if you will, that you get with a base are in reserves. And so as long as your reserve ratios don\u2019t get too high as a result of your base coverages, it\u2019s not a big deal. Sometimes what we have learned is depending upon the windows that you cover for your reserves, you could end up with percentages that don\u2019t make sense, if the base gets too small. But we believe we\u2019ve largely cracked the nut on this, and we are not opening bases that we don\u2019t believe fit our efficiency on a ratio perspective. And then when we think about from a reliability perspective and resiliency, there\u2019s just \u2013 there\u2019s not a better way to operate.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Christopher Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna Investment Group.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Barry, the -- going back to the outlook for pre-pandemic profitability per plane, what are the assumptions around seasonality there and utilization? Does the outlook assume any macro softening or is it seasonally in line plus or worse? Any color here on how you're thinking about demand as we move through the quarters and utilization?\nBarry Biffle: Yes, so from a utilization perspective, we look to be at 12 hours. We were actually at 11.5 in the fourth quarter. We've been operating plus that level now. So there's not much more to go in utilization. So utilization will be what it is. The big leverage that you get is the delivery of the 321neo, I mean, with 240 seats. It just simply delivers as a major CASM advantage. We actually do assume, as a result of that, that RASM is going down. I mean, we actually have assumed that those incremental seats will come at a marginal fare. So we expect that there will be a kind of ability to withstand any kind of weakness, if you will, in the economy by us further reducing our cost levels. And so-- but -- and we plan on a major 2009 type event, no, but we can withstand a medium to mild recession.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: And my follow-up, so November's outlook modestly above 6, I think it was to -- or yes, today's outlook, modestly above 6 to November is less than 6. I understand the slippage here. But if there are more delays, you called out the 4 to 6 weeks, has moved to 1 to 5 months. What are some of the levers that you could pull here because it sounds like an 11.5 or 12, there's not much more you can do on utilization to offset what could be perceived as upward pressure on unit cost should the additional tails slip?\nDaniel Shurz: Well, let's just start. Our trajectory on unit cost is heading in a really good direction. What you're -- what's happening with the Airbus delays is a delay in that benefit of the 321neo coming into the fleet. And that's maybe a quarter. And so you're on a very strong trajectory on a unit cost benefit and efficiency benefit in the business. In order to mitigate the delays, I mean, we've certainly looked at infilling some capacity by extending leases or looking at distressed aircraft around the world to replace some of the capacity. What we believe is that this is not a single year event where the manufacturer has delays and supply chain issues and deliveries. We believe this is a multiyear event. And so we're looking to plan our business accordingly. And so we may look to infill some capacity from outside of the business probably from within the business by expanding some leases in order to manage the capacity profile of the business because the changes that we're seeing in deliveries create some lumpiness in capacity [indiscernible] the business, and we may choose to smooth that out.\nBarry Biffle: And just to clarify on the \u2013 what we thought versus November, I mean, we were looking at sub-6 and now we\u2019re talking low 6 for the year, right? And we expect it to still be below 6 in the second half, even with the delays.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Just for the first question, just a follow-up on fourth quarter, your cost came in much better than you had thought, even though you had these storms. So I was just curious what was driving that and just trying to gauge what level of conservatism might be there in your kind of nonfuel guide here for 2023?\nJimmy Dempsey: I mean, look, the big driving force in our business, as you know, is overcoming the fixed overhead exits and moving utilization to 11.5 hours for the full quarter as it has a big impact on unit cost metrics, if you measure CASM ex-fuel or something like that. And I mean, look, I mean, we are giving you what we know today in terms of our outlook on costs for the year. Where the business is very focused is ensuring that we have a structural cost advantage versus the industry that's sustainable. And so as we move towards the $0.06, that puts us in a very strong place versus the competition. I mean, if we come in at $0.06 or $0.061, I mean, it still puts us in a place overall on total cost less net interest somewhere in the mid-30s percent lower cost than the entire industry average. And I think Barry talked about it earlier, like we were over $70 a passenger, a lower cost than the industry average in the last quarter, and that's moving higher as your unit costs come down. So that's in a great place to grow the business in the short-term, in the medium-term. And that's something that we're very focused on achieving. What we're trying to do with you guys is educate you on how we get there. And in the fourth quarter, you're seeing a really good move towards $0.06. If you look sequentially across the year, utilization was lower, came up, unit cost came down, and we expect that to continue as we progress through this year. That's where we get our competitive edge.\nBarry Biffle: And just to clarify, we were $70 -- over $70 advantage for the full year of 2022. And by the fourth quarter, that has expanded to over $80 for the past year. So with this cost advantage, this is what gives us the confidence that the momentum is going to continue, and we'll be back to a pre-pandemic profit per plane in the second half.\nSavi Syth: That makes sense. And then if I might, at the Investor Day, you talked about some of the moving from high touch to self-service and some of those things should drive some cost benefits as well, not as much as A321s. But I was curious on how the kind of the switch in call center and saw how some of those initiatives are being kind of accepted by customers?\nBarry Biffle: Yes, so look, I think contrary to maybe some of the news reports. So we\u2019ve actually seen really good performance. In fact we were just reviewing it this morning. We\u2019ve seen NPS go up dramatically compared to the call center. And the reality is, I mean, if you just think about it in your personal life, how often do you text versus how often do you call. And I think this is the way people want to interact. And as long \u2013 what we see is the biggest driver, can you solve their issue and do you do it promptly. And when I think when you compare to some of these other carriers that recently have had 10, 20, 30-minute waits to get a hold of an agent, that\u2019s [indiscernible]. So look, customers like it, and it\u2019s working well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So if I look in the fourth quarter, capacity is up about 15% versus 19% and CASM ex is up low 20s. If I look at Q1, capacity is now going to be up about 40% versus 2019, but CASM ex is still up low 20s. Why aren't we -- I guess my question is, why aren't we seeing better sort of unit cost leverage as capacity is really already ramping up pretty meaningfully?\nDaniel Shurz: Well, Q1, you have a lower utilization quarter than is typical in our business. So you've got to see that progression throughout the year where utilization moves higher in the second, third, fourth quarters on those than Q1. So just purely comparing Q4 and Q1 was a challenge under unit metric. But we've made no -- we haven't hidden behind the fact that the 321 introduction to the fleet drives substantial efficiency into our business. The 321neo, just sort of to remind you, has 240 seats. Our fleet today is dominated by the 320neo with 186 seats. So your average seats per departure moved quite dramatically creating a lot of efficiency in the business. So the more deliveries of those, they operate in our business, more efficiency that comes into our area. So that's a large part of the efficiency and drive from where it is in Q4, $0.064 CASM ex fuel down to where our targets are greater.\nScott Group: Okay. And then any thoughts on...\nDaniel Shurz: Sorry, Scott, and look, we like to look at total unit costs. And so one of the things that we've watched in our business as a metric is watching our comparison total cost versus the industry. And that includes that is CASM including fuel because we have a very fuel-efficient fleet. It's very important to how you price your tickets. The input cost of fuel is very important, plus also net interest. And so if you're looking at just purely our CASM ex-fuel and you're ignoring the ownership cost that a lot of the other airlines have in their business and also the investment that we've made in our business on fuel-efficient aircraft over the last 7 years and continue.\nScott Group: Yes, that's a good point. Can you just talk about within your view of getting back to the margins you are at or the profitability you are at per plane, what -- how should we think about full year revenue growth or RASM? Just what's in the plan?\nDaniel Shurz: We don\u2019t guide at unit revenue. It\u2019s obviously a function of what happens with oil prices across the year. We\u2019ve given you a sense of where we see oil prices at the moment based on \u2013 I think it was January 30 [indiscernible] but we\u2019re not guiding unit revenues across the year.\nOperator: I'm not showing any further question in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to the company for any closing remarks.\nBarry Biffle: I want to thank everybody for joining our call today. I especially want to thank the Phoenix Airport for hosting our call. And we look forward to talking again after the first quarter. That concludes our call. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."}, {"symbol": "ULCC", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-10-26 21:50:06", "content": "Operator: Hello, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Frontier Group Holdings Inc. Third Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll be advised that today's conference maybe recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Erdman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDavid Erdman: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. Today's speakers will be Barry Biffle, President and CEO; Jimmy Dempsey, EVP and CFO; and Daniel Schurz, Senior Vice President, Commercial. Each will deliver brief prepared remarks and then we'll get to your questions. But first, let me quickly review the customary Safe Harbor provisions. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those predicted in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors which could cause such differences are outlined in the announcement we published earlier, along with reports we filed with the SEC. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to the nearest comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of the earnings announcement. In addition, comments about relative operating statistics exclude pandemic affected quarters during 2020. Lastly, if you didn't already notice the announcement in the earnings release, we will be hosting an Investor Day the morning of November 15th, in New York. The event will be live streamed and archived on our website. Pre-registration is required for all participants, whether in person or virtual. However, in person, participants must register at least 24 hours in advance. Registration link is provided on our Investor Relations web page at ir.flyfrontier.com.  So I'll give the floor to Barry to begin his comments. Barry?\nBarry Biffle: Thanks, David and good afternoon, everyone. First, I want to thank all of Team Frontier employees for serving our customers in the quarter and doing a great job producing these great results. With a supportive demand environment for affordable travel, record ancillary revenue performance and improving unit costs, we posted back to back quarterly profits and expanded our adjusted pre-tax margin to 5.2% nearly double the second quarter margin.  Total operating revenue was 35% higher over the 2019 quarter, while capacity increased by 8% over the same period, contributing to a 26% increase in revenue per available seat mile. In fact, over the first nine months of the year, we've grown capacity about 12%, while increasing total operating revenues by 31% compared to the same period in 2019, demonstrating the strength of our leisure focused ultra-low cost business model. The strong revenue performance was underpinned by the achievement of a record $78 of ancillary revenue per passenger during the quarter, which eclipsed the record set last quarter by $3.  Since the third quarter of 2019, we've grown ancillary revenue per passenger a remarkable 38%. And we're confident in achieving our targeted run rate of $85 per passenger by the end of 2023. We'll talk more about how we plan to continue to innovate and optimize our ancillary product offerings at our Investor Day on November 15th. Leisure travel demand remains strong and has undergone a fundamental increase versus customer propensity to travel prior to the pandemic. To gain more insight into emerging trends, we recently polled our customers to understand how they're thinking about future travel plans and their ability to travel. The results of the survey revealed an inclination to fly more frequently than they did pre-pandemic with over half of the survey respondents indicating that they now have more money and more flexibility to do so.  The results of this poll demonstrate resiliency in the Leisure segment. We expect the benefits from this resilient demand to be amplified by industry to capacity, which continues to lag GDP growth. As we can look to capitalize on this consumer sentiment, we expect to benefit from our ability to offer ultra-low fares. These bares are underpinned by our industry leading position in both ancillary revenue per passenger and unit costs. We operated with the lowest adjusted CASM plus net interest of all U.S. based carriers in the first half of 2022, and our unit costs improved from the second quarter. We are focused on expanding our cost advantage versus the rest of the industry, supported by increased utilization, relentless cost management and a significant engagement benefit from a321neo aircraft. Our first A321neo arrived about a month ago. It's an incredible aircraft with a livery reflecting the new Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan technology which is helping to deliver a stunning 120 ASMs per gallon, along with significantly lower carbon emissions and engine noise. All are fundamental elements to furthering our standing as America's greenest airline. This is the first of 168 a321neos scheduled to be delivered through 2029, including direct leases, 36 of which are expected by the end of 2023.  With 240 seats, this aircraft will provide a transformational shift in our business, we\u2019ll be able to fly more passengers more sustainably and with lower CASM. We launched our cadet program in the third quarter and have over 1,300 applications today. We also announced our rotary transition program last week. Coupled with our university aviation programs, these three recruiting platforms will provide the backbone for our pilot recruiting in 2023 and beyond, and we expect the majority of our new pilots will come from these programs within a year.  Overall, we are positioned to capitalize on a strong leisure market, given we have the lowest breakeven fare, driven by the highest ancillary revenue per passenger and the lowest cost. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Daniel for a commercial update.\nDaniel Shurz: Thank you, Barry, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue performance was once again exceptional, rising 35% over the same quarter in 2019. This is the third consecutive quarter we posted double-digit revenue growth over the respective 2019 quarters and it's a testament to the strong travel recovery that we believe is sustainable as Barry covered earlier. Our third quarter capacity was up over 8% over the 2019 quarter, while RASM increased 26% over the same period, from $0.896 to $0.1127, despite a high concentration of capacity deployed during off-peak periods in September. Revenue per passenger increased 24% to $135, with ancillary revenue computing $78 of that amount. Both RASM and revenue per passenger set an all-time third quarter record and ancillary revenue per passenger eclipsed the previous record. Ancillary performance continues to benefit from recent product expansion and enhancement, strong attachment rates and increased revenue integrity. As the third quarter progressed, utilization increased to over 11 hours per day. Our schedule for the fourth quarter sees a further improvement to over 11.5 hours per day as we continue normalizing stage length. We continue to grow our international footprint. Beginning next February, we will launch service from Denver, Chicago Midway and St. Louis to Montego Bay. We also will begin five new Caribbean routes from Atlanta next week. With the opening of our new crew base in Phoenix next month, we announced 12 routes from the city to destinations across the country. With these new routes, we will offer a total of '23 destinations from Phoenix, a rapidly growing market which has been underserved by ULCCs.  That concludes my prepared remarks and so I'll now hand it over to Jimmy.\nJimmy Dempsey: Thank you, Daniel, and welcome everyone. We generated a pretax margin of 6.4% on a GAAP basis and 5.2% on an adjusted basis during the third quarter above the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted pretax margin primarily includes $12 million of net transaction and merger related credits associated with the company's terminated combination with Spirit Airlines and reflects a nearly 250 basis point improvement over the prior quarter. The margin improvement is driven by the record ancillary revenue for passenger performance that drove a 35% increase in total operating revenue and a 26% increase in RASM versus 2019, coupled with an 8% reduction in our adjusted CASM plus net interest over the second quarter. Unit cost improvement is related to both a 13% reduction in the average fuel cost per gallon to $3.85 per gallon as well as a 5% reduction in our adjusted CASM ex-fuels to $0.609, due to improving utilization and cost management efforts across the business. We expect the fourth quarter to deliver further improvement in our unit cost, driven by improvements in utilization and continued cost management efforts.  Our cost strategy is focused on expanding the cost advantage we have over the industry. The pillars of this strategy are: One, growing our industry-leading field efficiency; Two, having the lowest debt service cost; and three, achieving the lowest CASM ex-fuel capable in our business with a 2023 CASM ex-fuel target of below $0.06. We intend to maintain the lowest unit costs in the industry, including fuel, non-fuel costs and interest. As Barry mentioned, during the first six months of 2022, Frontier operated with the lowest adjusted CASM plus net interest of all U.S.-based carriers, with the improvement in our unit costs during the third quarter and the execution of our cost strategy, we expect our total unit cost advantage versus the industry to expand. We ended the third quarter in a strong financial position with $674 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $251 million net of total debt. In addition, as previously highlighted, we have the ability, if needed, to access substantial liquidity through our loyalty program and brand related assets.  We had 115 aircraft in our fleet on September 30, after taking delivery of two A320neo aircraft and our first A320neo aircraft during the quarter and returning two A320ceo aircraft. In the fourth quarter, we expect to take delivery of another seven A320neo family aircraft, including five A320neo aircraft. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect a continuation of the favorable demand environment. Capacity is expected anticipated to grow by between 15% and 17% over the comparable 2019 quarter. Fuel costs are anticipated to be between $3.7 and $3.75 per gallon based upon the blended jet fuel curve on October 21st. Adjusted non fuel operating expenses are expected to be between $565 million and $585 million in the third quarter, reflecting further unit cost improvements on the planned capacity growth. Our cost and capacity guidance alongside the favorable demand environment is expected to deliver and adjust the pre-tax margin in the range of 3% to 7%. With that, I'll turn the call back to Barry to deliver closing remarks before the Q&A.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks, Jimmy. Demand for affordable travel is greater than ever with a customer base that has more flexibility and plans to travel more often than they did pre-pandemic. We are better positioned than anyone to exploit this opportunity as our ultra-low cost fares are the most attractive for leisure customers. As a result to demonstrate our focus is to build shareholder value through our Low Fares Done Right business model, we look forward to expanding on our results and commentary for the quarter, and other elements of our business at the upcoming investor Day, November 15. We hope to see you there. We'll now move to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Trent with Citi.\nStephen Trent : I'm just going to start off with one for now. I was wondering if you have any high level thoughts about the ultra-low cost business model in the event that we get downturn. So if you look back at the credit crunch, any sort of high level view of the extent to which carriers like Frontier thrived, because you had consumers maybe leaving the legacies and looking for cheaper fares while oil rolled off. I would just love to get your high level thoughts on that.\nBarry Biffle: So Steve, we, I think everyone knows if you look at history, the lowest cost model going back to the 80s is generally the winter. In any recessionary environment, we've seen that with Southwest back in the 80s and 90s. We saw it with Ryanair, we saw it was Spirit back in there in the Great Recession. So typically, you would find an ultra-low cost carrier, especially ourselves, which is the lowest cost to fair most likely the best in a recessionary environment. And part of that is just simply because we'll have the lowest cost. So it's easier to cover our costs. There is generally trade down that you see in those type of recessions. But we also have higher ancillary, we see a lot more stickiness in that versus the fair revenue and it doesn't seem to fluctuate as much. So I think we're probably better positioned than most. I do think, though, that from what we know today, and depends upon how deep a recession could be. But if you look at the increase in propensity to travel and the fact that people are traveling more times per year on at least in their -- in what they've been doing right now and what they plan to do, I think a recessionary impact could only maybe just bring that back to what you had kind of pre-pandemic. So I think you couple that with the constrained industry capacity, and I'm not going to say there won't be any turbulence in our space, but I think we can see a very mild recession, if anything impacts us at all. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: So like other airlines, you're citing consumer -- shifting consumer travel patterns, is it driving any changes in how you schedule and fly the airline? Or is it just as simple as kind of sitting back and letting the revenue roll in? \nDaniel Shurz: Hey, Jamie, it's Daniel Shurz. So look, as we see demand -- as we see demand spread out a little bit across the weekend, we move away from the very peak -- the very peak to Friday, Sunday pattern. What is -- what\u2019s it already starting to allow us to do is increase utilization on the shoulder days of the week and even just on the some -- now on the optic days of week because we've seen demand flattened this past week. It's actually benefit -- it's actually beneficial to the business, because we've got -- we're getting better demand across the week.  And we're also expecting and we're seeing some evidence that it's starting to deseasonalize the business to some extent. I'm not going to say that our peak periods are suddenly going to become peaks, that's not it. But we're not -- we're seeing a little bit less, we're seeing a little bit less than oil seasonality as well. So I think it's it'll lead us to pushing utilization up a little bit, because we've got more ability to generate cash, we've got more ability to have cash positive fly on periods, what compares one when previously, we might have left a few airplanes sitting on the ground.\nJamie Baker: Does it disrupt maintenance schedules in any sort of measurable way? \nDaniel Shurz: No, in many ways actually flattening things out and making things more consistent across the week actually tends to help operationally in all sorts of ways, it helps. It helps, because you've got consistent access patterns for maintenance, it helps with your consistent patterns at the airport for staffing purposes, it helps because you get more efficiency from crews when you have consistency across the week. So it actually helps a little bit and potentially has a little bit of a benefit from a cost perspective as well. \nJamie Baker: Interesting. Second question, in the release you you've said that aircraft leases are expiring between what, this year and 2034? Is that front end loaded, back end loaded, fairly consistent? I'm just trying to think through, how the reality of rising interest rates and rising lease rates are going to flow through the P&L going forward?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yeah, Jamie, yeah, our redelivery program is pretty consistent from about 24 through into the next decade, given that we typically do either 8 or 12 year leases on delivery of the aircraft. So kind of lags the delivery in the first place 8 to 12 years. So pretty consistent.  From a current market perspective, we're in a really good position in terms of financing the airline. We have next 12 months COVID In terms of our aircraft deliveries, in fact, we have 35 of the next 37 aircraft deliveries financed. We've done it in a way that has kept the interest rate exposure on a lot of these leases. So in the recent run up that you've seen in interest rates, certainly for next 12 months, we're in really good shape to manage that. And then we have obviously aircraft deliveries beyond that. But that puts us in a very strong position from a financing perspective for the next year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. You may proceed.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Very, very pleasant questions so far, unlike publicly questioning your business model on other conference calls. But anyway, on fleet, how would you rate your confidence in ending 2023 with the 36 A321s? And are we right that, did some aircraft actually shift out of this year that you expected?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. We have had a couple of aircraft shift from the end of this year into next year. I mean, they were due to deliver right at the end of the year, so it doesn't really have a meaningful impact on ASM production this year. We have visibility on our aircraft deliveries, probably largely into the middle of next year, and you have certainly seen some delays in aircraft deliveries. But it's nothing like you are seeing with Boeing. We are lucky that, we are delivering aircraft through Airbus, who have some supply chain issues, but not to the extent that you are seeing in other manufacturers. And so any delivery delays are generally modest of the two months to three month varieties. So the aircraft are coming, it's just whether they come in October, November, December next year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay.\nJimmy Dempsey: Look, there may be a case where a couple of aircraft like this year, rolled from the end of next year into 2024. But we will deal with that if that happens.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Can you walk us through the building blocks of capacity next year? It just feels like gauge is going to be up quite meaningfully. Can you -- how big a contributor would that be to the 30% you are targeting?\nJimmy Dempsey: Well, like about half the capacity that we are bringing next year is already delivered to the aircraft or to the airline. We have been under utilizing the asset all across this year. I mean we moved to just over 11.5 hours in utilization in the fourth quarter, of this year. But if you look at the previous three quarters, you have been at 11 or below 11 hours in utilization. So some of that growth comes through using the assets that are in place today, and the rest of it comes with 321 Neo, that we took the first delivery of a month ago. And that move to delivering aircraft at 240 seats, it changes the ASM production in the airline quite materially for the block hours that are required to produce that production.  And so, if we are growing the business towards 30% in ASM production, our block hour needs are in the low 20s. And so you are getting a significant efficiency gain in the business. And so your requirement for pilots or flight attendants mechanics to support the fleet is not as fast as 30%, if we push ASMs towards 30% mark.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. That's helpful. Go ahead. Sorry.\nJimmy Dempsey: So I was going to ask Daniel to answer the question on how it builds throughout the year.\nDaniel Shurz: So if you look at the year-on-year -- if you look at the shape of our current plans for next year, we are sitting with some similar growth in Q1 next year to Q4 this year. And then it picks up to above 30%, not much above 30%, but above 30% for the rest of the year. That's driven by the fact that we return to peak utilization or traditional pre-pandemic utilization late in the first quarter, and then we retain that utilization expectation for the rest of the year. So as Jimmy said, that's roughly half of the growth next year -- half of the growth is how much the utilization grows and delivery pace continues to pick up during the year in terms of number of aircraft.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg : Just a couple here. I want to go back just on utilization. I know, Daniel, you had mentioned, I think you're roughly 111, you're going to 115 in the fourth quarter. Next year, , where can we get on utilization? And I'm talking about hours per day, is that -- what's the aspirational number and how should we think about how that helps on CASM? If we go from, say, 11 hours to 12 hours, is that like half a cent of CASM unit cost improvement? Jimmy, how should we think about that?\nDaniel Shurz: So I'll answer the first part. Yes, we're looking to get utilization next year to over 12. We're looking to get slightly above 12 on the fleet is the plan for the full year. As per the CASM impact I\u2019ll let Jimmy.\nJimmy Dempsey: I mean, you can see this in your model, like an hour on utilization is probably about 0.2 to 0.3 in CASM ex-fuel. The fixed overhead that's recurring just drives that number.\nMichael Linenberg : And then just second question, and this is probably to Daniel, you guys have pretty meaningful overlap with Florida and even the Caribbean now and yet, you didn't call out in your release any sort of impact from Ian for Fiona, the two hurricanes, either last quarter or this quarter? Anything on -- impact on revenue or costs that we should be aware of?\nDaniel Schurz: So look, do we have an impact, yes. We estimate about a 0.1 margin impact in the third quarter. We're looking at -- looking at the fourth quarter and some of the demand impacts, we're guessing probably about a one point impact in the fourth quarter. I will say and we could see it, post hurricane we were able to we were able to recover our operation more quickly than some of the other airlines who have significant operations in Florida. So we did -- we again, some of the benefits, we've talked about the modular network and the modular way we design the operation. Well, once again, visible recovering operations post hurricane. But look, yes, the one airline that has really called it out. Our presence in Florida is almost exactly the same as theirs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Barry, can you talk to the sustainability of your ability to grow in the market? I know you guys didn't necessarily have a pilot availability issue this summer, but it was compounding factors external to your company. I think that made you pull back your schedule a little bit. So do you think you now have the pieces in place and the externalities solved that you can sustain that growth outlook in the 2023?\nBarry Biffle: Look, we had the challenges that a lot of airlines faced. It was probably back to the overlap in Florida. I think those that with high concentrations in Florida were more impacted than others. And we were in that category and Jacksonville center was the big culprit that hit us back in March and April. I know that the -- they're working on their staffing issues, what we did as a knee jerk reaction is we cut a lot of flying into Florida and across the Jacksonville center. And that hurt our utilization that summer. We have rejiggered the schedule now.  And so we're in a situation where we are more -- even more -- extreme modularity as Daniel described, so that we don't get impacted. We've also looked at the pairings, we talked about this before where we don't have three or four times that a crew crosses Jacksonville center, a maximum two per duty period. So we've lessened our risk now.  And so look, we'll see what happens. I mean, we're eager to watch the holiday periods with air traffic control, and what happens during the spring break period. But what we've done is we've lessened our risk there. And so we think our ability to grow is cleared for takeoff.\nBrandon Oglenski: And Barry if you have the available pipeline of pilot hiring and training as well, no bottlenecks there?\nBarry Biffle: Yeah, so we have surplus as a result of pulling back to summer, we're slowly feathering them back in, we hope to have them fully utilized by the end of the quarter and then growing in. But as I said in my opening remarks, our cadet program has been wildly popular, we've had over 1300 applications so far, roughly half of those that have gone through financing with ATP have already gotten financed. So that's great to see. We announced our rotary transition program last week. There's a lot of pilots to come from there. And we've had our university program, which we haven't talked about a lot, but we've had it in place for several years. And that's really starting to just finally come to fruition producing pilots. So between those three programs, we expect within one year, the majority of our pilots will come from that. And we continue to see good, good numbers. So we feel pretty good about our, our pilot hiring at this point.\nBrandon Oglenski: Right. Thank you. And lesson for me, Jimmy, do you think it's still right to be targeting a sub 6X ASM? I mean, there's been a lot of inflation across the board. You still think that's an attainable number though? \nJimmy Dempsey: Yeah, look at there's been inflation and Frontier has experienced some inflation across its business, particularly around the airport world. What we've been doing in the last six months or so is really focusing on the elements of the cost base that we can control. And we've started to look at changing the way we do business, which is driving real cost savings into the business. If you look at our unit costs in Q3, and our unit costs going into Q4, we're seeing real step changes in our path towards success.  Obviously, the 321neo gives you a significant boost in terms of seat density on the aircraft and average seats for departure, which really helps bring efficiency into the airline. But in the context of changing the way we do business, we really don't want to disclose a huge amount right now on that. We have our investor Day on November 15th. And our entire management team will be there where we will actually give you some insight into the things that we've been doing to change the way we look at our business from a frontier perspective and that is driving real savings.  Part of the improvement in unit costs in the last quarter over Q2 and what we're seeing going into Q4 is on top of improving utilization and lengthening the stage really in the airline, is this project that we've been embarking on, which is showing real promise and real savings. So more to come in November.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thanks. So not to steal any magic away from the Analyst Day, but I think there is been a lot of potentially structural change in consumer behavior kind coming out of this pandemic so just wanted to ask on ancillary. Do you feel like there is any kind of real structural change in the way consumers are shopping for add-on stuff in addition to the base ticket? And also kind of what do you think some of these new proposed regulations on price transparency does to that?\nDaniel Shurz: Thanks, Ravi. It's Daniel. I'll talk about the two issues separately. Look, we are finding with our ongoing work on optimization, we are obviously driving better and better non-ticket revenue. You've seen that you saw a new record in the third quarter, and that's driven by -- we offer the lowest fare and the better we can drive our ancillary, the more we can drive the lowest fare in the market. And we give customer the choice of lots of different options and the more products we add, the more potential items customers can buy and customers find options, they find appealing and I think this has been proven. Are we seeing a huge structural shift in what people are buying? No, we're not. We're seeing better performance brought across the board on all of our ancillary products.  The proposed DOT regulations, I'll just say this for right now, Airlines already display transparently all the products we sell and the pricing for all those products. No one buys the Frontier ticket on our website without knowing the price for any of the ancillary products they might want to buy. They are all extremely visible in the purchase process for those who have purchased them. Anything you might buy later is extremely clear and extremely obvious. We don't have a problem with price transparency. Our consumers don't get any gotchas in the process. They get to see everything that they need, and we will make that point clearly when we respond to we respond to timely proposals.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. You may proceed.\nSavi Syth : Hey, good afternoon. If I may ask, Barry, it feels like you talked about pilot hiring and that's been a big kind of topic lately. It seems like there is a shift here. As you point out versus relying on regional airlines for hiring, you are going directly in hiring pilots and not relying on others. It seems like that's a shift and maybe might strengthen your kind of pilot offering. Does it lower cost in the long-term? Does it -- how does it change your positioning in the industry? Or is it just net neutral because you have just shifted you are getting your pilot?\nBarry Biffle: Well, look, first and foremost, we are a safety-oriented business. And so I think with what we are doing right now, it's actually pretty exciting from a training perspective. I think we could end up with a more uniform training program that delivers much safer pilots. But the big component here is the fact that, we are controlling our destiny and we will control the sourcing of our pilots. And so, we just kind of put to bed this continuous drumbeat of the sky is falling. And so, we are just taking control of it. We don't know what's going to happen with regionals and everyone else, but we're just putting in programs that ensure that we have a solid supply for years to come.\nSavi Syth : And then in my follow-up on the kind of the CASM kind of commentary on sub six. To me, is that given the timing of the capacity and the kind of utilization rates? Is that like something you'd be able to reach by the second quarter of next year? Is that a realistic expectation?\nJimmy Dempsey: I mean, Savi, we're not guiding quarters next year at this stage. But look, we will progress through Q1 is always a quarter that's slightly higher cost than the rest of the year, and so your trajectory towards $0.06 for the year, you should see it in Q1 but it'll obviously show up more closer to the second half of the year as you drive utilization and the assets come into the business. Like part of getting to sub six is delivering on the 321neos that come into the fleet during next year. I mean, it's not the sole component, but it's a significant portion of the improvement from where you expect to be in the fourth quarter for example, and then rolling through next year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Connor Cunningham with Melius Research.\nConnor Cunningham: Just on the RASM or all the implied RASM. I'm pretty surprised at the lack of decline, given you up higher capacity. There's a ton of noise just in holiday timing is. Can you just talk to the -- where you're seeing the strength in your markets relative to some of the others? Like, a lot of the guidance that you're hearing out of other carriers has some sort of deceleration implied in it. And then you really aren't seeing that right now, imagine some of its ancillary, but if there's any other color that you could provide on that, that would be helpful. \nDaniel Shurz: You've got them. The biggest point, we're seeing continued progress, and we expect to see continued progress in the fourth quarter on non-ticket as we work our way towards the goal of $85 by the end of 2023. So that provide some of it. We've also \u2013 looked, we've also -- as part of our work on November schedule where we've worked on a stream modularity and on thecost change, we've also looked to performance of the network, we've also made changes there that are going to help, drive volume in the business because we're focusing on whether or not things are doing well. And look, our brand is the most positive one in the ultra-low cost space and I think we're getting -- consumers are recognizing that and they're seeing the value we offer them. That's the thing. You can look the numbers up in the industry, including today on how really we've got the best value proposition out there and customers understand that.\nConnor Cunningham: And then Barry, I think you made some comments about potential Transatlantic and Deep South America, flying with the XLR. And like when I understand why that may be appealing, but it's 3X years stage length and all that stuff. So I'm just trying to trying -- I mean, there's been some struggles with ultra-low cost, long haul model over the years. So I'm just curious on why that may be appealing to you now and just any thoughts? That would be great. \nDaniel Shurz: Well, look, we have options on 18 XLRs that could come as early as 2026. And to be clear what I said -- what I was describing is what the aircraft can do. They are asking where could it fly? And obviously yes, it could go to South America, it could go to Hawaii, Europe. And so there's a lot of places that the airplane can fly. It obviously gives you the ability to fly several times our -- yes, maybe several times our average stage, that's if you use it to its full potential. But the reality is it enables us to fly longer sectors, and we've got a lot of options with the U.S. license to do that.  And with 18 aircraft, by the time that comes in, this will be a small percentage of the fleet. But I think it'll enable us to fly some exciting destinations that will make our Frequent Flyer program and our Discount Den and all of our substitute subscription products just that much more powerful from a brand perspective. So will it materially change the economics and the financial of the company's? No. But indirectly, it will, because it will help propel the brand further. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: I had a bunch of questions on utilization, but you've addressed all those by now. But I\u2019ll ask Barry, strategically, when you you spoke in your prepared remarks about kind of the structural changes that you're seeing in travel, does that change the way you think about your network construction over the next few years as you grow? How do you think about the -- do you think there's more room for growth within a new markets or as a lot of this is just adding depth and breadth to the current network? Just curious on kind of how that -- how does these structural changes -- how you view these structural changes in terms of network construction? Thanks.\nBarry Biffle: I can start and Daniel can add to it. I think one thing it helps is it actually really helps a carrier like us that often flies less than daily, because if they've got more flexibility, they can move to different days a lot easier. But I think what it's going to kind of cause us to do is just make sure that we have more and more of the right portfolio of places that they want to go and a lot more options. Because the truth is, if you if you look at the data, they're telling you they're going to travel more often. And so that means they're going to they're going to explore and experiment with more destinations.  So having a really good footprint and breadth of service I think it's going to become more and more important. I don't know, Daniel, if you want to --\nDaniel Shurz: I think Barry is right. I think it definitely encourages frequency. We're already seeing -- we're already seeing that we -- we have a very large airport footprint. And so already our growth going forward is going to it's going to be more of a mix of frequency and them surely than as heavily new market focused as it was in the past.  Look, we will also watch and I think that this bit is to -- we\u2019re seeing this broadly. And we're seeing this flexibility and these trends towards flattening of demand patterns broadly. So -- because it happens broadly across the network, it doesn't inherently drive -- doesn't inherently drive one particular type of network growth. And look as we continue to add bases, Phoenix was a great example. We're having those problems in Phoenix. There also exists in cities in the front end network. As we as we continue to grow as we continue to add crew bases, we will find a lot more opportunity to have markets that connect the dots within the existing network.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Thomas Fitzgerald with Cowen.\nThomas Fitzgerald: Thanks so much for the time. A lot of mine have already been answered, but I guess just quickly if you could provide maybe a little more color on the opportunity in the Phoenix market that you see and what -- [Technical Difficulty] you are excited about there? \nDaniel Shurz: Well, look, it's reasonably simple. Phoenix is a top ten metro area, relatively fast growing market. One of the top three or four fastest growing metro areas in the country, and it's a great mix of a good destination market, a good inbound tourist market and a strong outbound market, some of the best markets in the country from a ULCC perspective to have those characteristics. And Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is incredibly well located for the metro area, and it's underserved by ULCC capacity today. And so, we are excited there.  And look, we are a western brand. But we are a national brand, but we have a brand that is -- we have a brand that's rooted in the west, rooted in here in our hometown, obviously, of Denver, but that plays well across the Western United States. I think you look at the city of that scale, you looked at the metro area well over 4.5 million now and you look at how could you ULCC departures there out from the airport, tt's a natural opportunity. So much leisure demand.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. You may proceed.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks for taking the follow-up and maybe you answered it with Phoenix. But Barry and Daniel, as you observe the domestic industry rebuild with regional carrier constraints and general pilot constraints and every carrier having a focus on scheduling that supports reliability, are there any new surprises or new thinking regarding the types of markets you want to target? We got to think there is more white space in midsize markets, given the industry's constraints but maybe there isn't a good way to target those with less than daily service and focus on reliability at the same time. So would love some thoughts on that topic and then have one more for you.\nDaniel Shurz: I'll start and I'll let Barry add. So when we look at capacity build back and I would say, to your point, actually is lack of capacity build back would be a better way to describe it in some cases, right? Lower regional capacity has an advantage. Maybe not always directly for us in the markets where there isn't a capacity, some of those regional markets are obviously quite small. But we look at examples of some of the longer haul markets we recently added from Las Vegas and what's notable with the lack of regional capacity is how many fewer connect options exist, for example and how often that creates marked options because there is simply fewer options options for customers even in some relatively bigger market.  And I think, look, our expectation is there will be some changes in the way the network careers build their network. They have less regional capacity today. It's going to create opportunity for us. We have got the lowest total cost. We are focused on maintaining those lowest total cost, increasing our cost advantage. And as we do that we will find -- we will continue to find more markets, we can talk about them. But Barry, there's more you want to --\nBarry Biffle: Look, I think you're right. I mean, it's just math. And it's economics, right? As you shrink the regional footprints and what's left is increasing its cost dramatically, they're starting to knock on pilot rates of our size, of our levels with a third of the seats. So when you start thinking about the economics of these flights, the costs are going up. So there's going to be fewer seats and much more expensive in small to midsize markets, which is going to create an opportunity for career like us. So I mean, it's just Economics 101.\nDaniel Shurz: No, I'll add one more thing. As we add more -- as we continue to have more pilot bases, there's more and more opportunity to the type of modular operations, there's more markets we can find ways to enter that we can operate reliably and that's going to be a growing opportunity over the years to come. With this growth there's more bases to come. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then just real quick, I can't see it in your results and maybe you said it, but just given the overlaps on some of those Florida markets. How much did hurricane Ian impact you in 3Q and 4Q here?\nDaniel Shurz: I was asked earlier with -- the answer, I'll give it again. We think about a one point impact on our margin in Q3 and we think from the advanced -- the demand destruction affecting in Q4, probably about a one point impact in Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Berni with Susquehanna.\nAnthony Berni: Just quick question on next year's CapEx. I'm assuming with all these deliveries CapEx will probably step up, but if you could just give us any sort of rough ballpark of that? That would be helpful. \nJimmy Dempsey: We\u2019ve financed the vast majority of the fleet that delivers next year and they're through operating leases. So obviously we're delivering a significant portion of aircraft, over 30 aircraft next year. And so that will be reflected in the CapEx number. However, because we finance on operating leases, they will not be coming out of the books as a typical asset like other airlines where they finance their aircraft on balance sheet through some sort of debt structure.\nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Barry Biffle for any further remarks.\nBarry Biffle: Well, thank everybody for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you on November 15 at the NASDAQ in New York at our Investor Day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ULCC", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-07-28 23:29:08", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Frontier Group Holdings Q2 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, David Erdman. You may begin.\nDavid Erdman: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. Today's speakers will be Barry Biffle, President and CEO; Jimmy Dempsey, EVP and CFO; and Daniel Schurz, Senior Vice President, Commercial. Each will deliver brief prepared remarks and then we'll get to your questions. But first, let me quickly cover the customary Safe Harbor provisions. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those predicted in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors which could cause such differences are outlined in the announcement we published earlier, along with reports we filed with the SEC. We may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to the nearest comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of the earnings announcement. And then lastly, we will be participating in several investor conferences in August and September and we certainly hope to see you at one of those events. And so, I'll give the floor to Barry to begin his comments. Barry?\nBarry Biffle: Thanks, David and good afternoon, everyone. Needless to say, it's been an interesting few months since our last earnings call. While public attention was largely centered on the merger, behind the scenes we realized the highest quarterly revenue in history at $909 million, 43% above the comparable 2019 quarter and a record ancillary revenue of $75 per passenger. The strong revenue performance in the second quarter enabled us to overcome elevated fuel prices and generate an adjusted pretax margin of 3%. We were able to lessen the impact of the weather and air traffic control limitations through proactive measures which led to an improvement in our completion factor as the quarter progressed, with a completion factor of 99% during June and over 99% during the busy 4th of July week. In addition, unlike many other carriers, we are not experiencing disruptions due to shortages related to pilot and flight attendant staffing levels. In fact, we have surplus staffing today and a capacity to train 80 additional pilots a month. Contrary to common paradigms and misconceptions about the ULCC segment, we're a highly attractive landing spot for the pilots, given our career growth and resulting pay opportunities as compared to the legacy carriers, along with a desirable footprint of bases, including the opening of the Phoenix crew base later this year. To further strengthen our pilot recruitment capabilities, we're working with a major flight school to develop a cadet program which will provide an opportunity to train 250 zero-time flight applicants per year who might otherwise have chosen a different career path due to employment uncertainty. Upon completion of training, we will assist in placing them into flying assignments to continue to build experience and we'll be able to hire them once they reach requisite flying times. As we look forward to the third quarter, we expect the demand environment to remain strong, with RASM growth anticipated to be over 20% versus the comparable 2019 quarter, supported by continued strength in our ancillary revenue per passenger. We will continue to focus on generating profitable growth in the business as we increase utilization and successfully overcome the challenges with the pandemic. Accordingly, we expect to turn a second consecutive quarterly profit in the third quarter, with an adjusted pretax margin in the range of 1% to 5%. I'd like to thank Team Frontier for their continued dedication, professionalism and commitment to provide safe and reliable service to our customers. They are at the core of our Low Fares Done Right model. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Daniel.\nDaniel Shurz: Thanks, Barry and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue performance was exceptional on many levels. Revenue growth of 43% over the comparable 2019 quarter was driven by a 29% increase in RASM, from $0.0927 to $0.1197, along with a 10% increase in capacity over the 2019 quarter. Revenue per passenger were an impressive 24% to $139, with ancillary revenue contributing nearly $75 of that amount, a record for the business and above our expectations. And third, performance was driven by recent product expansion and enhancement along with strong attachment rates. We will continue to expand and enhance our ancillary offerings to allow our customers to personalize their travel experience and to allow us to continue to offer ultra-low fares. Given our strong performance and future plans, we're now targeting ancillary per passenger to reach $85 by the end of 2023. We achieved an 84% load factor during the second quarter, an improvement of 10 percentage points over the prior quarter. Utilization was an average of 10.9 hours per day, roughly in line with the prior quarter and we expect a gradual trend toward the 12-plus hours we realized in 2019, consistent with our recovery plan. In response to high fuel prices, we designed our second and third quarter average stage length to be between 960 and 980 miles which is considerably below historical levels. We expect to return the airline to pre-pandemic average stages starting in the fourth quarter. As we build that capacity, our ASM growth relative to 2019 is expected to accelerate during the current quarter with capacity up 5% in July, 8% to 9% in August and 14% to 16% in September, resulting in a higher proportion of our seats being deployed in an off-peak month and creating an approximate 3% drag on RASM in the quarter. Touching on commercial highlights. We recently announced expanded service turn from Las Vegas. Beginning August 9, we'll launch service from Harry Reid International Airport to Baltimore, Buffalo, Hartford and Kansas City. With these new routes, Frontier will serve 57 destinations from our Las Vegas base, making us the fastest-growing airline and one of the top leisure destinations in North America. In response to strong demand since we launched service in Houston Hobby in May, we're adding a daily nonstop route to Denver beginning in September. Just last month, we expanded our international and Caribbean service from our Tampa base, launching nonstop flights to Montego Bay and San Juan, along with expanded service to Cancun. And lastly, on August 8, we'll formally break ground for our innovative new terminal at Denver International Airport, where we're planning construction of 14 ground loading gates which will facilitate expedited planning and deplanning [ph] through the front and rear aircraft doors, leading to shorter turn times. This and other streamlining initiatives across our network are designed to improve operational performance and enhancing customer experience. And with that, I'll hand it over to Jimmy Dempsey.\nJimmy Dempsey: Thank you, Daniel and welcome, everybody. Second quarter results were in line with our guidance. The strong demand environments drove record-setting revenue growth compared to the same quarter in 2019; and, along with the exceptional ancillary performance, enabled us to turn our first adjusted profit in over two years. We've employed rigorous financial discipline through this difficult period to ensure Frontier has a strong platform to deliver profitable growth. Results in the second quarter were impacted by elevated fuel prices, resulting in $335 million of fuel expenses at an average fuel cost of $4.41 per gallon. Total operating expense was approximately $900 million, including $9 million of transaction- and merger-related costs and $7 million related to an asset impairment, while adjusted nonfuel operating expense was $550 million. This resulted in the CASM ex-fuel of $0.724 which was impacted by lower utilization, lower average stage, higher station-related costs and the short-term cost of surplus crew. Though our CASM ex-fuel is currently elevated, we're still targeting a return to sub-$.06 during 2023 as our utilization of stage length normalized and seats per departure increased with the planned introduction of the 321neo to help mitigate inflationary pressures on the business. We ended the second quarter in a strong financial position, with $766 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. Frontier is in the enviable position of having access to a substantial liquidity source by leveraging our co-brand credit card program and related brand assets should the need arise. As planned, we have enhanced our pre-delivery payment facility to align with the short-term obligations under the Airbus order book, whereby the facility was increased from $200 million to $280 million. We ended the second quarter with 114 aircraft in our fleet after taking delivery of three A320neo aircraft during the quarter. We expect to take delivery of another four aircraft in the third quarter and eight in the fourth quarter, including the first of 36 A321neos by the end of 2023. Looking forward to the third quarter, we expect a continuation of the favorable demand environment we saw in the second quarter. Capacity is anticipated to grow by 8% to 10% over the comparable 2019 quarter. RASM is expected to improve by over 20% in the third quarter versus the comparable 2019 quarter, bolstered by continued strength in ancillary revenue per passenger. Fuel costs are anticipated to be between $3.75 and $3.80 per gallon based upon the blended jet fuel curve on July 22. Adjusted nonfuel operating expenses are expected to be between $565 million to $585 million in the third quarter, the increase from the prior quarter due largely to capacity growth. Adjusted pretax margin is expected to be in the range of 1% to 5%, constrained by the 3% RASM drag Daniel mentioned earlier. With that, I'll turn the call back to Barry to deliver closing remarks before we move to Q&A.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks, Jimmy. Before closing, I'd like to offer my thoughts on the termination of our merger agreement with Spirit. Obviously, we're disappointed in this outcome and that Spirit shareholders will miss an opportunity to meaningfully participate in the rebound of leisure travel, of which we're in the early stages. Our Board took a disciplined approach throughout the course of our negotiations. Rather than overpay for Spirit, the Board prioritize the interest of Frontier, our employees and our shareholders. As a standalone entity and potentially America's ultra-low-cost carrier, Frontier has a fantastic platform for profitable growth, underpinned by a strong balance sheet, an unmatched 321neo order book, a clear path to CASM-ex below $0.06 an exceptional ancillary performance with plenty of room to run. Collectively, these elements are key contributors to the resiliency of our business model. I could not be more confident in our future, especially given the growing demand for affordable air travel. Our proven and resilient ultra-low-cost model continues to provide the foundation for our strategy and long-term value creation. Even with rising fuel prices, we continue to keep costs and fares low while generating record revenues and providing reliable service. We have one of the highest completion rates in the industry and our recent performance further validates our business model and strengthens our confidence. We appreciate everyone's time this afternoon. We will not be commenting any further on the termination of the merger agreement, nor a potential tie-up between Spirit and JetBlue. I am, however, happy to take questions about how we grow our business and add shareholder value as America's ultra-low-cost carrier.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jamie Baker with J.P. Morgan.\nJamie Baker: So Airbus cut its production forecast today, also delayed the planned ramp in 320 production rates. Just wondering how you expect that to impact planned capacity over, I don't know, the next 24 months or so and whether there's any flexibility within the Indigo portfolio to shift around deliveries so that you don't slip?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. Look, Jamie, we've been a little focused on our own things right now, so we haven't focused on that. But look, I mean, we have a large order book with Airbus and obviously, we buy a lot of planes. I know a lot of people have maybe moved some orders around. I'm not sure what this has to do with us. Yes, we do have the ability, as been disclosed before, to move aircraft among the Indigo portfolio carriers that participated in the Dubai order a few years ago. But we're unaware of any material differences versus our order book as we stand today.\nJamie Baker: And second, there's no shortage of data at this point proving that lower-end consumers are certainly trying to find ways to economize. Your third quarter guide looks fine to us. Just curious if you're seeing any change in trip duration. Obviously, lobbing off a day of holiday is one way to save on the aggregate expense. Or any changes in the booking curve? Or maybe your data just implies complete immunity to slowing economic trends. Any thoughts there?\nDaniel Shurz: Well, I'll start and I'll let Barry add on, Jamie. It's Daniel. No, we're not really seeing any difference. We've seen no change in trip duration. We're not seeing any slowdown in demand and so we don't see this at the moment. So we're not being affected at the moment and we're confident that we're offering the right value to customers to keep getting them to come and choose Frontier.\nBarry Biffle: Yes. We have seen two things that are interesting. One is kind of the work-from-home phenomena. We have seen an extension of some people's itinerary. So I think, in the composite, there may be some people, Jamie, that actually are cutting off a day. I've read articles, just like you have, about some hotels, maybe they cut a day or two off their vacation but they still go and save money. At the same time, you've got people moving around that are working from home but really working from somewhere else. And so they are actually expanding. So the averages, I think, may be clouding that. The one piece of data we do have that is pretty empirical is that we have seen an increase in incomes of our travelers and so a significant increase in the $100,000 household income and a significant increase in the $200,000-plus household income which suggests that you are seeing the buy-down effect to Frontier.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I wanted to ask you about new markets. I understand you've been busy and focused on other things. But as you think through the implications of staffing shortages for the industry, staffing shortages for regional carriers, more white space in small markets, are there any obvious targets or markets that you feel are really constrained, or overly constrained, from a capacity perspective? And I certainly appreciate your comments about not wanting to go there but you have spent a fair amount of time studying potential overlap. What would you might see as the opportunities that could develop if they do pursue a relationship?\nBarry Biffle: I'm going to let Daniel talk about the more recent kind of phenomena with shortages of regional capacity and he's probably got some examples, because I know he's been exploiting them.\nDaniel Shurz: Yes. Look, we always, Duane, watch what's going on in the industry. What we've seen, actually, it's less, I think, regional service in the traditional sense. They tend to serve quite small markets, fundamentally, probably. We do have markets that, even for us, are a little bit too small. But what we've also seen is, as airlines have consolidated capacity again this year, we've seen a pullback in certain markets. You can see, notably, we've looked from our Vegas base. One of the reasons we went into the markets we went into is you can see meaningfully reduced capacity in some of those markets as other airlines have sort of consolidated the way they're flying. So, for example, Las Vegas-Buffalo, Las Vegas-Hartford, substantial markets, much less competitive service than what is seen pre-pandemic. There are other examples in our key leisure bases of where we're seeing similar phenomenon and those are the ones we're going to take advantage of.\nBarry Biffle: As far as your second question -- thanks, Duane -- I said we were going to talk about our exciting future as America's ultra-low-cost carrier. So I'll answer your question in that vein. So in the event that they do emerge, you take a carrier that's probably one of the most similar to us, you slap on 40% more costs and that creates a lot of runway ahead of us.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Maybe we'll get you to expand a little bit. There was a period of time and I don't recall the exact quarter or when but to manage your costs, to focus on your costs, you sort of deemphasized some expensive Northeast airports, for example. Would it ever make sense to come back to a LaGuardia, or could you envision having a bigger footprint in South Florida if assets became available?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. Look, absolutely. Look, I mean, you're referencing what we did in Newark and some other places. It's not that they were expensive. In addition to being expensive, we were unable to put together an efficient operation with the landing slots that we had. And so absolutely, if we could get the right opportunity in LaGuardia, we would be really excited about it. I think consumers would be, too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Congrats to getting back to profitability. My first question, just on looking at the differentials, the year-over-year, year-over-2-year, in sort of your base fare versus your ancillary. And it is interesting. You were obviously successful in pushing both up which is a good thing in a highly inflationary environment. But that ancillary increase was roughly double. And I'm curious about, either Barry or Daniel, just they're different products, different price elasticities, presumably one is more stickier than the other but it was a big increase. We're talking about $20, $25 or so, plus or minus a few dollars. What were the big components? Or is there just an inflationary piece in there where just bag fees are now $3 to $5 higher and seat fees and insurance fees are all $3 to $5? Is that really what's flowing through here? Because it does look like a step function change, if you could add color.\nDaniel Shurz: Right. So look, we took advantage of the pandemic to continue developing new products. So it's a mix. It's a mix of everything. It's an inflationary effect. It's new products we've introduced. It's the continued work we've done and I think where we lead the industry and how we optimize our pricing of our ancillary products, reflecting what customers want. And it's just the continued work to improve this. And that's why we now have confidence. Given what we've seen, we now have confidence just to increase our target to $85 by the end of 2023.\nBarry Biffle: And I would just add, Michael, we learned in the pandemic. We used to think that 50-50 was a good split. And you said it just a moment ago. We used this word. Literally, you'll hear this around our office multiple times a day. We talk about the stickiness of non-ticket. And the truth is, is fares and fuel are largely out of our control but non-ticket is not. And so what we like about non-ticket is that we can get closer and closer. I mean, I can't guarantee profits but we can get closer and closer to protect our profits, going forward. So that's why we've laid out today that we plan to get to $85 by the end of next year. And that is to not only get us back in solid profitability in 2023 but make sure that we can maintain it for decades to come.\nMichael Linenberg: And then just my second, Barry, because you brought this up and it seems like you guys are sort of on the leading edge here with respect to zero-hour pilots and helping them get through training and getting them to that 250 hours. And the question that hasn't been well-answered is, okay, they're at 250. At what point do you get them to 1,500? And I know there's Part 135 opportunities but there's only so many that are out there. It sounds like you've studied this. What is it, a 2-year, 3-year? What's the timeframe from getting from 250 to 1,500? It seems like everybody talks about it and it seems like you get them through the program and they're ready to fly but it sounds like it's a few years. Can you just give us at least a little bit more sort of your thoughts on that?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. I'll start it off. And we thought there might be some questions, so we are fortunate today to have Brad Lambert, our Vice President of Flight Operations. But there's a couple phases. You've got to get your private at roughly 40 hours. You've got to get to commercial 250, CFI, II. And then, yes, you can get ATP at 1,000 if you have 60 college hours of aviation. You can get it at 1,250 if you have 30 college hours. And you can get it at 1,500 if you don't have any college hours of aviation. And the cadet program that we're rolling out will target using some of the college hours to limit that. But Brad, we're really excited about it and Brad can tell you more about the kind of opportunities that we're going to work with them to do here and abroad to build their hours from 250 up.\nBrad Lambert: (Indiscernible), this is Brad Lambert So we've definitely got opportunities, obviously, with the 135 carriers. You're right, there's limited capacity there. But the nice thing about our agreement with ATP is they are the biggest, call it, manufacturer of pilots out there in the country. And there's lots of opportunities there for them to instruct and build time very quickly. So we look at the program 24 months or so. But again, we want to control our destiny and we think we've got enough opportunity for them to build the flight time up to the (indiscernible). The 24 months, that's what we're looking for. That's actually very helpful.\nBrad Lambert: And we're also looking for international opportunities, as well. There's a lot of other countries out there that accept USA licenses and we can fly them at 250 hours, build time up to that ATP minimums.\nBarry Biffle: The main thing I would just say, Michael, is we're just going to no longer entertain these speculations that we're going to run out of pilots. We're going to source our pilots and have control of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So as you think about the standalone growth potential, I guess what I'm trying to understand is what do you think your capacity growth looks like over the next several years in an environment where Spirit is standalone and then where JetBlue acquires Spirit? I don't know if that's om violation of what you want to talk about. But I guess I'm trying to understand how your growth story is different now on a standalone basis and how do you navigate sort of that regulatory uncertainty potentially over the next year-plus? Do we have to wait for some of that accelerated growth?\nDaniel Shurz: This is Daniel. We already have an aggressive growth plan. Next year, as we return to normal utilization levels and to say 30% growth in 2023 over 2022 as we fully get the airline back to normal utilization. And then, going forward after that, we already have a fleet plan that provides for 15% to 20% a year growth. What happens in the environment? What happens in potential combinations? We could always accelerate it, move it closer to 20%, if necessary above 20%. We will watch for opportunities by controlling our costs as discussed. By driving our non-ticket, we are controlling our destiny and we can make the choices about where we fly.\nMichael Linenberg: Did I hear that the plan is to grow 30% next year versus '22?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes. Scott, it's Jimmy Dempsey here. Yes, given that we have constrained capacity across this year or next year, as you move back to full utilization, you get to 30%, slightly above 30% growth.\nMichael Linenberg: And then maybe just last thing, just as I focus on the report and the guidance, can you just talk about the monthly TRASM trends? And I know you're talking about 20%-plus but if you feel like it should be closer to the upper $20s you did in Q2? Any color there?\nDaniel Shurz: We are seeing right now typical seasonality. We're not going to go into more detail on that. What we're seeing for Q3 is just typical seasonality patterns. But obviously, the issue as we discussed is because we have the higher amount of capacity growth at the end of the quarter because we're growing 5% in July and 14% to 16% in September. That is creating a drag on the overall RASM for the quarter of around three points because we pushed more capacity growth into an off-peak month\nOperator: Our next question comes from Savanthi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: Just as follow-up on Jamie's question earlier, it looks like maybe even this year, your kind of aircraft deliveries are getting a little bit delayed. So are you seeing that delay this year? And just as you kind of plan out your capacity, what's your confidence level? And how much of that 30% is dependent on fleet deliveries versus just getting utilization back up?\nBarry Biffle: Roughly half of it is fleet deliveries and the other half comes from increased utilization.\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes. And Savi [ph], near-term, we've seen some delays. I mean, it's been relatively modest. We're obviously on the Airbus program. It's nothing compared to the Boeing program. You're seeing six week delays, four to six weeks, eight week delays in aircraft deliveries for some of the aircraft but all relatively near-term story [ph].\nBarry Biffle: Yes, the delays have generally been in days and weeks. And so we typically put in a 45-day, up to 45-day kind of cushion between a delivery and when we have it scheduled to fly.\nSavanthi Syth: And if I might, one thing you've shown last year and this year throughout is a nimbleness to react to the demand environment, or whatever the environment brings, with COVID or anything else. Just kind of curious what kind of environment you're assuming in that 30%. And if we do see a slowing down or kind of a recessionary environment, what you're comfortable maybe moderating that to? Or how should we think about that?\nBarry Biffle: Well, look, I think we're always probably the fastest to react if things were to dramatically change but I think our confidence in the 30% is driven by a couple things. One, we're headed to sub-$0.06 CASM. So if anybody can be successful with the airline business, it will be with low prices if demand were to fall off. And so we'll be one of the few that can afford to actually carry low prices. And it will be further subsidized, not just on the cost side but by the fact that we have the $85 target by the end of next year in non-ticket and we're already producing $75. So we're pretty confident in the growth. Obviously, we'll reevaluate that if there were a deeper recession than what we're seeing. But so far, the demand looks very good and we've seen some seasonal changes but nothing major. And I think what seems to be missed in the airline space is, even if there is a recession, the capacity cuts on the airline space is, even if there is a recession, the capacity cuts are already built in. And I think, if you track back what we should have had with normal GDP growth over the last three years, we are significantly lower than where you would normally see capacity, it would normally see capacity. And so, if you get a 10% to 20% cut from a recession, well, the cuts are already in. So that's why you're seeing a lot of the pricing power across the industry even as other industries are having a tough time right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: I just have two questions. To follow up that comment, Barry, that you just made about capacity reduction already factored in, what do you think that the hiring will look like at the airline in an environment where things do slow? Would you pause the hiring? Or would you just continue to forge ahead?\nBarry Biffle: No, I think we would be the last airline to stop hiring, or even slow hiring, because when you're the lowest-cost producer in the space, you're the first one that should be growing.\nHelane Becker: And then the other question I have, I'm not sure how you can -- the answer. But what responsibility do you think the Pilots Union itself, like Alpha National, has for training pilots? They seem to want a lot of, I don't know, assurances but they don't seem to want to accept responsibility for building up the pilot ranks. Do they bear any responsibility? And in your negotiations with your pilots, can you get them to accept some of that?\nBarry Biffle: I guess I'm not understanding your question.\nHelane Becker: Well, think about it this way. If you want to become a pilot, the $250,000 cost is 100% on you. And part of the reason for that is the rules around which you can become a pilot. It's not that easy a career path, right, if you don't go military or something like that. So don't you think Alpha itself bears some responsibility for helping an 18-year-old or a 22-year-old get the necessary hours in order to build a career?\nBarry Biffle: I don't know if it's Alpha's responsibility. I think maybe they have some. Maybe everyone has a responsibility across the entire aviation community. I mean, just to clarify, it's not $250,000. It's less than $100,000 to get your commercial. Yes, if you paid for all of your hours and you didn't get any type of job, yes, it would cost considerably more, maybe in the $250,000, $300,000 range. But the challenge with that, you're not going to be as good a pilot as someone that we can hand-hold through our cadet program, place at a great place where they get good training and they get real-life experiences flying from a commercial perspective. But look, I think we as an industry and overall need to take responsibility but I can just tell you what we're doing. Look, we see the shortages coming down the line. And while we haven't had challenges, we're just taking control of our destiny and we're going to have the sourcing that we need, no different than we source airplanes and no different when we source engines, parts, everything else. We're going to source training of pilots from zero hours. And to be quite honest, I mean, in the last few hours, it's been one of the most exciting times at Frontier. I mean, look, our Head of HR is right across (indiscernible) right now. I mean he's been inundated today. We have a bunch of flight attendants that already are like, \"Hey, I always want to be a pilot.\" And so this is really exciting to have a program that kind of handholds them, get them through it, help them get set up with a really good training program and then gets them the right type of experience that they need to be safe pilots. And so, not only are we going to control the sourcing of our pilots but we're also going to control the quality and the training so that we can ensure that they'll be successful and safe pilots for us. And we hope that we can partner with Alpha when they come in but they are generally not involved until once they become an active line holder, or actually a pilot at Frontier.\nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Barry Biffle for any closing remarks.\nBarry Biffle: Well, thanks, everyone. We appreciate everyone joining us today. And again, as I said, we're excited to be America's ultra-low-cost carrier. Really excited to talk to you soon. Talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: (Indiscernible) conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "ULCC", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-04-29 17:39:29", "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Frontier Group Holdings First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and- answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that this conference may be recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Erdman, Senior Director of Investor Relations.\nDavid Erdman: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Today's speakers will be Barry Biffle, President and CEO; Jimmy Dempsey, EVP and CFO; and Daniel Shurz, Senior Vice President, commercial. Each will deliver brief prepared remarks, and then we'll get to your questions. But first, let me quickly cover the safe harbor provisions. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those predicted in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors which could cause such differences are outlined in the announcement we published earlier and with reports we have filed with the SEC. We may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to the nearest comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of the earnings announcement. As well, during the call, any commentary regarding the proposed combination of Frontier and Spirit does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval. Our registration statement and subsequent amendment were previously filed in Form S-4 with the SEC, and you should closely read those documents as they contain important information related to the proposed combination. And just lastly, we will be participating in several investor conferences in the coming months, and we hope to see you at one of those events. With that, I'll give the floor to Barry to begin his comments.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. As we progress through the first quarter, we entered a period of post-pandemic when demand for air travel is on solid path to recovery. Our revenue for the first quarter was 11% higher than the comparable pre-COVID quarter in 2019 and included $69 of ancillary revenue per passenger, 21% higher than the first quarter of 2019. In addition, capacity in the first quarter increased by 20% versus the comparable pre-COVID quarter in 2019. The recovery began in earnest in March and has continued into the second quarter. The strength of recovery is the strongest I've experienced in my career, and we expect it to gain momentum as we progress through the year. Accordingly, we expect record revenue in the second quarter with RASM growth of over 20% compared to the second quarter of 2019 and continued strength in our ancillary performance leading to an expectation of a further improvement to $70 per passenger in the second quarter. As we position the airline to be a leader in the post-pandemic recovery, we are focused on balancing capacity in response to elevated fuel prices and the current demand environment to enable the airlines' return to profitability in the second quarter and full year 2022. Utilization in the first quarter was impacted by COVID in January and February and severe weather in March, exacerbated by staffing shortages at the Jackson Air Traffic Control Center. Daniel will elaborate further on this in his prepared remarks later. We plan to grow second quarter capacity 10% to 12% versus the comparable quarter in 2019 and full year capacity by 12% to 15% versus the full year 2019. Utilization should continue to improve as the overall passenger volumes increased through year-end. Our expectation of record revenue for the second quarter and our industry-leading fuel efficiency validate our ultra-low cost model even in a high-cost fuel environment, providing confidence in our return to profitability. Before I turn the call over to Daniel for a commercial update, I wanted to highlight how proud I am of team Frontier, which has successfully navigated the airline through the pandemic and positioned us to succeed in the recovery, while upholding our mission of Low Fares Done Right. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Daniel.\nDaniel Shurz: Thank you, Barry, and good afternoon, everyone. Total operating revenue in the first quarter was $605 million or approximately $111 per passenger. Our total revenue per passenger was in line with the level achieved in the comparable pre-COVID quarter, despite the lingering effect of the Omicron covariant in January and February, due in large part to the strength and resiliency of our ancillary products. Our ancillary revenue per passenger of $69 in the first quarter was 21% higher than the amount in the comparable pre-COVID quarter and represented 62% of our total revenue per passenger. We're seeing strength across our ancillary product portfolio. In addition, we introduced new ancillary product offerings during the first quarter, including our Board First and [indiscernible] check bag programs, which are providing further strength. With this quarter's results, we have significantly surpassed our previously stated ancillary target of $65 per passenger. And as Barry mentioned, we are now targeting $70 per passenger during the second quarter. We will continue to expand and enhance our ancillary product offering to further strengthen our loyalty programs, our customers' ability to personalize their travel experience and our ability to offer low fares to our customers. We averaged over 420 departures per day during the quarter, 30% higher than the comparable 2019 quarter, while our capacity is measured by ASMs increased by 20% over the same period. Our stage length was 9% lower than the comparable 2019 quarter, the intended consequence of our modular network strategy, which is engineered to reduce costs and enhance operational performance. As travel demand gained momentum during the first quarter, capacity in March 2022 was 26% higher than the corresponding pre-COVID month in 2019 and load factors in March 2022 improved to 80%. Average aircraft utilization was 10.8 hours per day during the first quarter, given the longer demand impact from COVID in January and February and severe weather patterns during March across parts of Florida, where we operate the high concentration of flights. The weather issues and resulting downline impacts were exacerbated by staffing shortages at the Jacksonville Air Traffic Control Center, which controls our space over the northern two-thirds of Florida. Further improvement to aircraft utilization is expected as operations normalize and the recovery from the pandemic progresses. As Barry mentioned, the demand recovery is expected to continue into the second quarter and lead up to the summer travel season and supported an improvement in both load factors and passenger yields. Turning to commercial highlights. Earlier this year we announced the launch of 14 nonstop routes from two new airports. Service at Chicago Midway commenced today, offering daily flight to eight destinations with another route starting in May and two more sets to begin this October. As Houston Hobby, we will offer nonstop flights to Cancun, in Las Vegas and Orlando beginning Memorial Day weekend. This new service complements our existing operations at Chicago O'Hare and Houston Bush Intercontinental and it strengthens our position in two of the five largest metropolitan areas in the United States. We also announced 23 new domestic non-stop routes, during the quarter the majority of which will originate from Raleigh Durham and Philadelphia to rapidly growing markets. In our international Caribbean region, we launched service from Orlando to Aguadilla, Puerto Rico and announced new routes from Las Vegas to Guadalajara and Monterrey and from Houston and Tampa to Cancun and finally from Miami to Kingston As part of our western expansion, we announced plans for a new crew base in Phoenix to open in November 2022. It will be our eighth pilot base and ninth flight attendant base and is expected to grow to 180 pilots and 275 flight attendants within the first year with additional growth planned in the future Finally, earlier this month plans will prove to construct a new addition to Denver International our hometown airport and the third busiest in the United States. The plans call for new facility to be constructed at the east end of the A Concourse to include 14 ground loading gates for our preferential use. The dates will be configured to facility in-planning and deplaning through the front and rear aircraft doors, providing us with the ability to improve our efficiency with shorter term times. The expansion is expected to be completed in 2024 and we'll provide our customers traveling out of Denver with even more travel options at ultra-low fares. That concludes my remarks and so I'll now hand it over to Jimmy. \nJimmy Dempsey: Thank you, Daniel and welcome everyone. Our financial results for the first quarter reflect the soft travel demand experienced in January and February, due to the lingering effect of the pandemic followed by a substantial recovery in demand and passenger yields in March. Fuel prices were elevated during the quarter, resulting in $215 million of fuel expenses at an average fuel cost of $2.99 per gallon. Total operating expenses for the first quarter was $758 million, including $11 million of transaction and merger-related costs and adjusted total operating expense excluding fuel was $532 million. This resulted in CASM of $0.1019 with an adjusted CASM excluding fuel of $0.715 in the first quarter as compared to $0.083 and $0.055 in the first quarter of 2019 respectively. The increase in adjusted CASM excluding fuel was driven by the reduction in average stage length, lower average daily aircraft utilization, the timing of aircraft deliveries and aircraft returns and labor rates increases. We consequently recognized a $121 million net loss for the quarter on a GAAP basis and a $109 million adjusted net loss after adjusting for transaction and merger-related costs and costs associated with the repayment of our treasury law. We ended the first quarter of 2022 in a strong financial position with $727 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents after the repayment in February of the $150 million previously outstanding or the treasury loan. Our loyalty program brand assets are now unencumbered and available for debt issuance should the need arise. We ended the first quarter with 112 aircraft in our fleet after the delivery of two A320neo. Our fleet is 5% larger than the comparable prior year quarter and 30% larger than the comparable pre-COVID quarter in 2019. Our fleet continues to be the most fuel efficient of all major US carriers when measured by ASMs per fuel gallon consumed. Frontier is positioned to build on its fuel efficiency advantage with the introduction of the A321neo aircraft in the second half of 2022. Consistent with earlier comments, the A321neo aircraft will also enable the company to continue its trend to hire average seats per departure, driving cost efficiency into the business. Looking forward to the second quarter and the balance of 2022, we expect continued strength in demand and resulting passenger yields as the travel recovery progresses and our primary focus is on returning the airline to profitability. Capacity is anticipated to grow by 10% to 12% in the second quarter versus the comparable quarter of 2019, bolstered by continued strength in ancillary revenue per passenger. RASM is expected to improve by over 20% in the second quarter versus the comparable 2019 quarter. Fuel costs are anticipated to be between $3.85 and $3.90 per gallon. And adjusted total operating expenses excluding fuel are expected to be between $545 million and $555 million in the second quarter. As utilization improves and capacity is restored, we expect a downward trend in our unit cost metrics of almost $0.01 as the year progresses. As Barry mentioned, the benefit of the from the anticipated strength in demand for the balance of the year is expected to more than offset forecast fuel prices and non-fuel expenses, resulting in the company's expectation of profitability for both the second quarter and full year 2022 excluding special items. Adjusted pre-tax margin in the second quarter is expected to range between 1% and 5%. With that I'll turn the call back to Barry to deliver closing remarks, before we enter the Q&A.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks, Jimmy. As we fully transition into the post-pandemic recovery, I'm as optimistic for this business as I've ever been as we showcase the merits of the ultra-low cost model. We're here to win. We have the right people an optimal fleet of modern fuel-efficient aircraft and with more on the way, a strong brand and the financial flexibility to meet that objective. Before we move to questions, I'd like to comment on our pending merger with Spirit Airlines. Our signed agreement remains in place and we continue to be excited about completing the merger and delivering the significant benefits that will come with it. For shareholders, this combination offers tremendous value. In addition, the structure of the transaction will enable both Spirit and Frontier shareholders to benefit from the substantial upside potential of the combined company. Our regulatory process is already well underway, and many months ahead of any alternative. For consumers, this merger will supercharge the ULCC model. You've heard it before and I'll say it again. Together Frontier and Spirit, will offer even more ultra-low fares to more people in more places and deliver $1 billion in annual savings for consumers. For employees, we expect the combination to create 10,000 new direct jobs and thousands more at our business partners. For the competition, the dominant Big four airlines and other high-cost airlines like JetBlue will be faced with a true nationwide ultra-low fare competitor. With that said, we're here today to talk about our results for this quarter and our strong outlook, so I ask that you keep your questions focused on these topics. We appreciate everybody's time this afternoon. Let's open the call for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And I might violate your request on my first one just as an attempt. Look this might be a really dumb question, and clearly there was a sort of spirited defense of the benefits that you see on this call. But I guess, why hasn't there been more of a campaign? Why haven't you been more vocal about those benefits since the JetBlue bid? \nBarry Biffle: Well, I think we've been pretty clear. I don't think we have to keep repeating it. And I think, if we read what's going on, I think people understand it. But like I said a while ago we think this benefits consumers, we think it benefits the employees and we think it benefits shareholders. And that's there's not much else to say. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay Barry that's\u2026 \nBarry Biffle: We'll, let you ask a real question Duane, if you don't\u2026 \nDuane Pfennigwerth: All right. Yes, I will. That's all I'm going to do on that. I appreciate it. Just with respect to the 2Q and just the massive change, the massive inflection that happened over the course of the first quarter, how much of 2Q was maybe given away or sold in a very different revenue environment? And said differently when you think about closing and closing inventory, do you feel like you have enough of that left kind of in this environment are there enough of those seats available in your network to benefit from those much higher closing fares? And I would think that those sort of drive the value proposition of what Frontier brings very clearly in a closing environment? \nBarry Biffle: Sure. Thanks, Duane. It's a good question. I mean look we do sell relatively close-in I think versus some other airlines. And to be clear while the March revenue really started to take off, the sales kind of started turning back in February, right? And so as the sales turned I mean we've got smart people in revenue management just like everybody else. And if they started figuring out that hey we need to be more conservative around under-selling if you will, kind of Eastern and beyond -- and so while we might have I guess undersold some part of April, it was a small amount and the majority, I would say probably over 80% of the quarter was still available for sale when we started to see the inflection kind of in your mid-to late February. So, that's why you're seeing the majority of the benefit in the quarter. But yes, I mean could it have been a little bit better had we known in December? Sure. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes. I mean I guess the point is as you look beyond the second quarter into third quarter and beyond and you had made some bullish comments about the summer, which obviously falls across both quarters. So I guess the question is, is there incremental upside as sort of everybody adjusts to this new normal? And thanks for taking the questions.\nBarry Biffle: Yes. Thanks, Duane. And I actually -- I mean it may have been subtle, but I referenced that just a small amount in my prepared remarks but yes, we expect the momentum to continue. And you're correct while it was a small amount that we had maybe undersold if you will for the quarter, there'll be none in future quarters. And interestingly, every day that goes by we're seeing the demand continue to recover even more. I mean as great as everything is right now, I think we need to remember that the mask rule just kind of just -- well based on the ruling, the math just changed last week. I mean there's a lot of excitement. I don't know if any of you have flown in the last week or so, but I mean there's maybe one out of 10 people still wearing mask. People are excited about it. So you've got that barrier kind of gone. And then now you've got the -- still the international testing, which I can attest to and several people in this room have actually been caught by this it's still a drag on the international side. And so that's still a barrier. And then you still got a handful of communities like New York and some of the Northeast and parts of California are still a little bit behind in lagging. So, you still got that benefit to come, as well as kind of the return to office and kind of the full robustness of business travel which I think will continue to improve through the summer and definitely by fall. So, there's plenty more legs up from here. So yes, that is why we believe that there'll continue to be sequential improvement in demand. \nQ \u2013 Duane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open. \nJamie Baker: Hey, good afternoon. So, the press release guys was refreshingly bereft of any pointed language on the topic of labor strain outside of some ATC commentary. You're obviously aware of what other airlines are saying about pilot challenges. Are you sweeping the topic under the rug or do you just think the narrative is a bit overblown here?\nBarry Biffle: Well, I don't know if it's overblown for some airlines. I mean I think there's some airlines with some real challenges. But in our particular case in the near term, we have an excess of the pilots for example. And so, while we've seen some attrition greater than years past, Frontier is really in a fortunate position. We actually have a lot of tailwinds in our pilot workforce and our recruiting success versus some of the low-cost and regional airlines.  I mean number one, we're the best brand in the low-fare space. So, there's kind of a natural affinity that folks want to work here. You've also got the fact that our growth enables people to upgrade to Captain within four years. So, when you look at your first 10 years of W-2s, you're going to make as much or more money at Frontier than you will at the big airlines, even though we have lower pay rates because you upgrade to Captain so much faster.  And then you have to add-in not just pay, but lifestyle. And when you look at the fact that we've got probably one of the best portfolios of bases available in selection and choice, in some of the best cities including the fact, Daniel mentioned a while ago we're opening Phoenix later this year. We've got a lot of attractive places people want to live. And also because of the growth the other benefit to lifestyle is you're going to have holidays and weekends off a lot sooner maybe a decade sooner than going to one of the big airlines. So, when you put all that together that's just a completely different much more compelling value proposition that we offer to pilots versus an airline that might base you in JFK or Boston and you're living in a crash pad, sitting reserve for a long time. So that's why Frontier's just a much better home for pilots and I don't think we have the distress that you've seen at some of these other airlines. \nJamie Baker : Barry, were you prepared for the question or was that just all off the top of your head because that was a really good response? Second on fleet. In the event you find yourself, just hypothetically let's say, a year 1.5 years from now in a situation where you want more planes. How does that work with the Indigo order book? I know allocations have already been determined. But with, if you can prove that you can generate a better return on the next airplane than I don't know JetSmart -- I mean is there a mechanism there or would you have to look outside of the Indigo order? \nBarry Biffle: So, we have actually disclosed within our order -- the large order that you referenced. We have the ability to move a percentage of aircraft amongst the portfolio of carriers that actually did that order. We can always get white tails from leasing companies and there's another huge mechanism that we have that can moderate our capacity growth. And one of those would be, we could actually extend leases. So, we have a lot of aircraft over the next three to five years that will be falling off lease. So, if we found we wanted to raise our capacity growth greater than the planned that's out there we could do that pretty quickly. \nJamie Baker: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks a lot gentleman. Thanks Barry.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks Jamie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \nMike Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Barry the fact that in the release you call out some of the issues with the Jacksonville ATC, this summer can you tell us maybe you or Daniel what percent of your capacity actually touches Florida maybe June/September quarter? And I guess you'll probably correct me, and say maybe it's more important what touches Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville? I'd be interested to kind of know what that is? And sort of as a part two, we heard on the Southwest call, there is like an all-hands meeting in May with the FAA to figure the situation out because it's just -- it's been unworkable. And so maybe you can talk to that as well? Thanks. \nBarry Biffle: Sure. And Daniel can get you the percentages here in a moment. But overarching we're going to be smaller in Florida in the near term as a result. Jimmy mentioned the reduction in capacity and talked about the headwinds that, that causes and that's a large reason why we have excess staff in the near term, but we did trim near term. And it's simply that, the Air Traffic Control is an unsustainable thing. We're really excited that the FAA is stepping in knee deep on this and they are going to have a Summit in the next couple of weeks and we'll go through it. We've got everything from spatial launches to general aviation and other factors. But the good news is, ourselves and other carriers have reduced some of the schedule flying. And I can tell you that in our particular case, we have looked at some of the most at-risk flying.  So, for example if an airplane was to transit Jacksonville Center, if it transits once, you have a one to three hour delay that's not the end of the world. It transits twice, you could have two to four hours of delay. If it transits at three times, then almost in every case we've seen that that results in the crew timing out. So we will be taking as we do with everything that the company faces, a very active and aggressive role in taking steps that we can to control our destiny and kind of schedule around this. And then, hopefully that summit results in some things that will help us by fall. But I can tell you in the near term, we're actively looking at rescheduling like I mentioned changing some of the pairings as well as reducing the overall capacity in the impacted airports. And as far as percentages Daniel.\nDaniel Shurz: Yeah. So look if it comes down naturally in our summer schedule Mike, we see strength in the rest of the country. So we go from the mid-50s in March down to 50% in April and by June, we've made some changes to the schedule we're down to 40% of our operations in now to Florida. And as Barry said, we're taking the right actions the things we can control. We're trying to make -- we're going to make adjustments to make sure that we can maintain our operational integrity.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. That's awesome. Just a quick follow-up on the pilots. It's really encouraging to hear that it sounds like you guys either have a good pipeline or you have a good amount of -- like you said Barry you're scaling back capacity and so you have some excess. One of the issues that we hear also is just the whole process, where you bring the pilot on board, they go through the classroom training, the new hire. And the next thing you know it you're waiting three months for Sim to get Sim time. Where -- I mean I never even thought to ask this question, but do you have a training center with a bunch of Sims? Are you running into the lack of flight simulator availability? Any color on that because I think it's all part of what's kind of creating this bottleneck?\nBarry Biffle: Sure. And so yeah, Mike, we've been -- I mean, all have been dealing with it. We've gone from negligible attrition to a measurable attrition maybe not at the level that other carriers have. And so what that just simply causes you to hire more and which needs necessitates the need to train more. And so while there's been a shortage maybe of pilots that's caused by this bottleneck, the good news is we continue to have 14 to 15 good applications a day that are coming in. We've got plenty of folks in the class as you described. The gating item in Frontier's case is the simulator and that is why I'm pleased to say that we have secured that. We've been working on that for months. And by August we literally will be doubling our ability from a class size perspective per month. So we don't see any challenges and it kind of lines up with what we've seen from the demand the fuel environment the ATC and so forth. So we think that we will be more than in a position to make up any deficit that we've seen as we move into the fourth quarter. So we still remain on track that we can kind of hit the pilot numbers that we had hoped for. But if you didn't get your Sims lined up it's getting harder that's right.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thanks. Thanks Barry.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is actually Matt [ph] on for Savi. Thanks for the time. I hate to belabor the labor point, but maybe if you could just quantify the surplus in the pilot that you talk about a little bit more. When you look at your 2022 growth rate, how big is that surplus versus year-end 2021 levels? And then if you have any idea out into 2023 based on growth expectations there I mean is it sufficient or how much further do you have to go to\u2026?\nBarry Biffle: Well, look I mean, to give you an idea of magnitude, I mean we have over 2,000 qualified applicants on file right now. We've got a robust pipeline there's plenty coming. And as I just mentioned we're going to double our training footprint beginning in August. So as far as 2023, we believe that with the robust nature of our pipeline, the attractiveness of Frontier that I mentioned earlier that we should be able to solve 2023. As far as in excess, it's probably in the area code of high single-digits percentages this summer on that. Hopefully, that will moderate as we're able to get the utilization back and hopefully they come up with some great solutions for the ATC, but we're hopeful that by fall, we will not have an excess. It's not a good idea to -- these are our most expensive workforce, so having a lot of extra ones laying around. And look they want to work too. So you don't want to have a lot of pilots stuck at the minimums. So we should be able to resolve that and get moderated back to not having a whole lot of excess by fall.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Really appreciate the extra detail there. And then maybe to 2023, if you could provide any color about how you're thinking growth there if possible?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yeah, Matt. This is Jimmy Dempsey here. We're not guiding into 2023 at the moment. Clearly, the business is designed to grow by mid-teens every year. We'll go through the planning process as the year progresses. And we'll have ample capability -- training capability to feed the pilot requirement for next year. We would anticipate adding somewhere between 200 and 250 pilots per annum. And given the number of applicants we have on file we feel pretty good about filling that capacity should the actual capacity go to a higher level of utilization than it is today.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you all for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is open.\nMyles Walton: Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could touch on the ancillary expectation here in the second quarter. Obviously you've got pretty boundless opportunity on the RASM side. So I'm just wondering why $70 is the number you're using given you did $69 in the first quarter.\nDaniel Shurz: Thanks Myles. It's Daniel. Look we're saying that is our current expectation. We were as I said able to roll out some new products in the first quarter. We made pricing adjustments. We've been focused on ancillary since the pandemic's been going on. And we've been looking for the opportunities. The team has been working on ideas and working on ways we can further increase our non-ticket revenue. And we're going to continue to work to build the pipeline and to build our performance in this area. Based on what we see currently that's our expectation and we would expect that to continue to increase beyond the second quarter. We're, obviously, focused on non-ticket because it's more stable. And we're also focused on it because it allows us to offer the lowest fares.\nMyles Walton: Maybe one question I should probably know this, but how close-in or how disparate is the timing of booking the ancillary from the actual ticket itself? How coincident are those two occurrences?\nDaniel Shurz: It's a mix. We have a healthy portion of customers who book directly who book by their ancillary at time of booking that's when they get their best value. We incentivize paying for your ancillary as soon as possible. The longer you wait, the more you will pay. We, obviously, do our customers who pay at check-in notably a higher rate of third-party customers who pay at check-in. But we do everything we can to incentivize earlier payment and communicate that customers will save money if they buy early. And, obviously, we also give customer savings with bundles. We encourage customers to buy bundles of products that's been another successful part of our business. And we optimize the price and we optimize the offerings we make to customers and that's part of how we're increasing the revenue.\nMyles Walton: Okay, all right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, Operator. Hi everybody, thank you for the time. I have a question Jimmy about the treasury loan. You paid that off. Is there -- are there any warrants or anything outstanding that treasury still has related to the Cares Act?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes. Helane, I hope you're keeping well. They are -- we have warrants linked to the treasury loan outstanding both to the treasury loan and also to the payroll support program that we participated in. So they continue to be outstanding.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Would you consider buying those back if it was available to you?\nJimmy Dempsey: Certainly we would not -- we would look at it. It's not something that we've been looking at in the short-term, but it's certainly something we would look at if an opportunity, existed absolutely. \nHelane Becker: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then my other follow-up question is on -- I saw an article about four or five weeks ago about hiring pilots from Australia on an E3 visa. Are you actually doing that? And if so how many pilots can you hire? I know they can only stay for 24 months, but is that something that you're doing or was that like a throwaway comment from a magnitude\u2026?\nBarry Biffle: No, Helane, I wouldn't throw away. We're excited about it. Look we've always been aggressive and creative and innovative and we've been looking at this for a while and we've been really successful with it. And there's the E3 program from Australia but we're looking at other parts of the world and we think the E3 program alone could do at least 50-plus pilots a year. So you could saw call it one-quarter of your demand just from that we're looking at other parts of the world. And so I just think that, yeah, it just kind of shows how creative we are. But they want the job and there's lots of opportunities and some of these can end up depending upon their situation and whatever type of lease program, it can be a lot longer than 24 months they could end up possibly with citizenship. But I think what's really important too that people seem to miss on the pilot side with us is Jimmy mentioned it it's not a throwaway comment. The 321neo that's coming in later this year has 240 seats. And so think about the precious use and how the scarce resource is getting used here at Frontier. And we're going to be able to spread two pilots over 240 seats not 120, not 140, not 180, 240 seats. So we're getting aggressive to make sure we have plenty of pilots but we're also using them in a very efficient and productive way by ensuring that we're getting plenty of passengers moved per pilot.\nHelane Becker: Great, got it. Yeah. That\u2019s totally helpful. Thank you very much. Have a nice afternoon.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Hey. Good afternoon everyone. Jimmy, I know you are highly focused on the balance sheet in the pandemic. And it's in a good spot right now. I guess, when you look out into more recovered earnings power later this year into 2023, at what leverage level do you have kind of the most comfort running your business? And kind of what's an upper cap we should be thinking about in terms of net leverage levels?\nJimmy Dempsey: Well, I suppose during the pandemic we've been really focused on spending as little money as possible and preserving as much liquidity as we could, without actually burdening the business with debt. And so we've emerged from the pandemic in a really good shape from a balance sheet perspective. Our focus at the moment is really getting our liquidity levels back to like if you look at that pre-COVID we always had about 30% of trailing 12 months in cash on the balance sheet. And the only debt we had on the balance sheet was effectively productive debt. So we had debt related to PDP facilities for pre-delivery payments to Airbus. And then also clearly operating lease debt linked to the aircraft fleet that we have. And so we want to get back to that type of scenario where the depth that's sitting on the balance sheet is really for funding growth into the business. And so my focus at the moment and across the business is really getting our cash as a first measure to 30% of trailing 12 months of normalized revenues and we're a little bit short of that at the moment. We do sit in a good place, but we're a little bit short of it. And then, normalizing our leverage ratios based on the productive aircraft we have in the business. We don't disclose publicly our leverage targets but if you look at us pre-COVID you can get a sense of where we would anticipate to, get to.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. That's helpful. And I guess, I want to go back to the non-ticket front just a really good result in the quarter. Obviously the $70 kind of already exceeding your kind of your prior targets, we get a lot of questions around demand elasticity around fares as they continue to move higher here but I guess how do you think about that in terms of non-ticket? Where do you think it maybe maxes out in terms of percentage of total fare or something like that, just curious to get your thoughts. Thanks.\nDaniel Shurz: Andrew, I'll start and I think Barry, might have some thoughts as well. Look, we don't know where the limit is. And we're going to keep -- we've got a lot of ideas and we've got a lot of experience obviously continuing to build this. And what you watched -- as I said, what you watched during the pandemic was we continue -- we set targets last year of $63 and then $65 and we kept moving the needle up. And we've delivered higher than that. As we continue to find opportunities we build products. A lot of what we're now doing is finding things that truly have no impact truly have no impact on fare. We're introducing new products that customers value and we think there's plenty more opportunity to do that. And obviously as we've talked and again there's more opportunity over time as we grow our third-party type programs discount on our credit card program we'll continue to get stronger. We get to be a larger airline and these products become more and more relevant to customers and we'll drive more revenue. So Barry, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add?\nBarry Biffle: No, I just want to add I'm really proud of Daniel and his team. I mean, we've got an impressive result. And we didn't waste the pandemic. They've been really busy in growing the non-ticket. And in years past, I think we thought a 50-50 split of non-ticketing ticket was a good idea. We've kind of learned in the pandemic that the non-ticket is a lot more, sticky and if you'll be creative and to Daniel's point work on things that are truly incremental that don't have any degradation to the ticket that's where the real profit potential is. So I'm really pleased with what they put together. As you said, we announced last year a target of $63 then $65 we keep blowing through these. So all I can tell you is that they're not done they're really busy and really excited about what we get done but 50-50 is no longer the idea. We think it's going to be considerably higher and we'll deliver a lot more sustainable profitability in the years to come if we can grow that percentage.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks everyone for joining. We'll talk next quarter."}, {"symbol": "ULCC", "quarter": 3, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-11-10 22:51:03", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Frontier Group Holdings Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Susan Donofrio, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSusan Donofrio: Thank you, operator and welcome, everyone to Frontier's third quarter earnings call. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call can be found on our website. On the call with me today are Barry Biffle, Frontier's President and CEO; Jimmy Dempsey, EVP and CFO; and Daniel Shurz, Senior VP, Commercial; as well as other members of the management team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for the sell-side analysts. We also wanted to remind everyone on the call that today's discussion does contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. And in comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our third quarter 2021 earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. With that, I will turn it over to Barry for his opening remarks. Barry?\nBarry Biffle: Thank you, Susan. And thank you everyone for taking the time to attend our third quarter earnings call. This quarter reflected another step in our path to recovery with the business remaining resilient in managing the dynamic nature of the pandemic. I'm very proud of the team and thank them for their continued delivery of safe and reliable service to our customers. During the quarter, we increased our capacity while also delivering a high level of operational reliability. We continue to view the delta variant as transitory and remain focused on getting the airline back to full utilization in the second quarter 2022, while being nimble to address any further impacts from COVID. We also achieved $63 in ancillary revenue per passenger, which is higher than the levels we were able to achieve pre-COVID. While the pandemic has lasted longer than any of us expected, the vaccine boosters, vaccines for children and the new therapeutic treatment expected to be approved by year end provide strong support for sustained demand recovery into 2022. More broadly, as the recovery progresses and demand returns we plan to continue the expansion of our domestic and international network while continuing to build on our ancillary performance. In a moment, Daniel will take you through our third quarter revenue performance and the opportunities we see going forward. On the cost side, we're focused on expanding our relative cost advantage by driving efficiency in all aspects of the business and offsetting inflation by being relentless in eradicating waste in our efforts to drive lower costs. And to be clear, when we reference our relative cost advantage we mean our total costs, including fuel and interest expense. I'll now turn it over to Daniel to provide a commercial update.\nDaniel Shurz: Thank you, Barry. I want to join you in thanking team Frontier for all of their hard work in managing the COVID pandemic, while delivering safe and reliable service to our customers. We generated $630 million of total operating revenues during the third quarter with our total revenue per passenger of $106, increasing 8% from the second quarter and reflecting 97% of the comparable amount during the pre-COVID quarter in 2019 with a low factor of 77%. We had an 8% increase in average departures per day versus the comparable period in 2019 on a 7% shorter average stage length. We generated $63 ancillary revenue per passenger during the quarter, which is 12% higher than the comparable pre-COVID quarter in 2019. On the network front, we continued our domestic and international network expansion during the third quarter. Opening stations in St. Maarten, San Jose, Costa Rica and Burbank, California, and we introduced our largest ever schedule in Las Vegas. Our expansion will continue into the balance of 2021 with new stations being added in Antigua, Belize and Costa Rica. And last week we introduced our largest ever schedule in Orlando, making it our largest station in terms of daily departures for the winter schedule. As we grow our network we are focused on doing so in a financially disciplined way ensuring as Barry mentioned that we are relentless in eradicating race and eliminating things we don't get paid for such as excessive airport costs. To that end we're taking action on the significant increase we're seeing in the cost per employment of certain airports. Following our decision to exit LAX in San Jose, California earlier this year, in the first quarter of 2022 we will be ending service to Washington Dallas and Newark. As with any airport if the fare and cost relationship improves we will revisit the decision. As we discussed on our last earnings call, the delta variant has impacted demand. Encouragingly, over the last two months as COVID case counts stabilized, we've seen the start of demand recovery with improvements in both volume and fare levels. And as we manage the post-COVID revenue environment, we see an opportunity associated with rising household incomes, which combined with our competitive fares gives us confidence in our growth potential. We've seen early indications of this in the overall strength of our ancillary performance. The recent strength and momentum of our loyalty program including both a record number of Discount Den memberships in the quarter and adding a record number of new Frontier Barclays credit card accounts underpins our confidence in the plan growth of our business and our ability to increase our 2023 ancillary revenue per passenger target to $65. With that, I'll turn it over to Jimmy to provide more details on our financials.\nJimmy Dempsey: Thanks Daniel. I also want to thank all of our team Frontier members for their hard work and dedication as we manage the airline through the pandemic, while staying financially disciplined. We were profitable in the third quarter on a GAAP basis recognizing $23 million of net income. Our adjusted net loss of $24 million or $0.11 per share excludes a number of special items. These include $72 million of CARES Act credits and $1 million of cost associated with the early lease termination of our remaining 319 aircraft. While the quarter was impacted by the delta variant and rising fuel prices, we remain financially disciplined in managing the business. We ended the third quarter with $802 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and have a $161 million current income tax receivable from our annual tax returns filed during the first quarter of 2021. We continue to be focused on repaying the $150 million of outstanding loan under the treasury facility at the appropriate time. As previously highlighted, this will enable us to unencumber our co-branded credit card program and related brand assets that are currently collateralizing the treasury loan and make that collateral available to access liquidity if needed. While the company has adequate liquidity on its balance sheet with the strength of our loyalty programs as highlighted by Daniel, including our co-branded credit card program Discount Den subscription program and our related brand assets. We believe we have approximately $1 billion of potential untapped liquidity based on debt financing secured by other airlines. We ended the third quarter with 112 aircraft in our fleet after the addition of five new airbus A320neo aircraft that were financed through sale and expect transactions partly offset by two lease returns during the quarter including retiring the last 319 aircraft. We have no planned deliveries in the fourth quarter. Our fleet is 10% larger than the prior year and continues to be the most fuel efficient of all major U.S. carriers when measured by ASMs per gallon of fuel consumed, generating almost 100 ASMs per gallon during the quarter. 65% of our fleet is comprised of the fuel-efficient A320neo aircraft and we will introduce the A321neo aircraft in the second half of 2022, adding another steps change in efficiency to the business. We remain focused on getting the airline back to full utilization in the second quarter of 2022 while remaining flexible to address the unpredictability of COVID-19 on our bookings. As Daniel outlined, the delta variant had a significant impact on the airline's bookings through August and September creating a deficit in forward bookings as we entered the fourth quarter. During September, we experienced the normalization of volume levels, but at discounted fares. We are currently seeing an improvement in fair levels as the Holiday season approaches. However, fuel prices have continued to increase creating a short-term cost hurdle to overcome. Our forward guidance summarizing the earnings release takes the lingering effect of from the delta variant into consideration along with higher expected fuel prices. These impacts are partly offset by the improvements in booking trends that began during the latter part of the third quarter as COVID-19 cases stabilized. As a result, our guidance range for our fourth quarter adjusted net income margin is a loss of between 10% and 15%. More details on our forward guidance can be found in our third quarter earnings release. With that, I will hand it back to Barry for some closing remarks.\nBarry Biffle: Thank you, Jimmy. While COVID has lasted longer than any of us expected and the delta variant has created a delay in the recovery, we're in a strong financial position and we're seeing improvement in demand. We have a proven and resilient business model that is poised to take advantage of the future growth opportunity of our business and we couldn't be more excited about the future. With that, operator, please open up the call for questions,\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have your first question from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your lines open.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Barry, you said at a conference a few months ago that industry pricing discipline that we saw earlier this year was one of your kind of biggest positive takeaways during the pandemic. You mentioned in your release that there were some discounting of fares to get volumes back up in September. Can you just describe the competitive pricing environment right now? And kind of how you see that evolving into 2022 both for base fares than of ancillary [ph], please?\nBarry Biffle : Sure. If I recall the conversation, it was talking about prior to the delta variant starting. We had seen more pricing discipline across the industry than we had seen honestly since probably 2013. And so whether it be levels, rules, APs restrictions and so obviously that was kind of washed away when the delta variant hit. I'm pleased to say now though we have seen kind of the depths of the delta variant from a demand perspective was in September. We've seen demand continue to recover and as that volume has come through our revenue management team has worked really hard and to systematically continue to take advantage of that and methodically raise fares. And we continue to see strengthening to the point now where yesterday we reached the highest sales level on a daily basis that we've seen since July, which gives us the confidence as we look forward that by spring break if you kind of roll through the booking curve what that would look like. We believe that from a demand and revenue environment we should be back to 2019 levels by the time we get to spring.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. That's great. And for my follow-up, the airport fees that you mentioned and kind of that's kind of changing your decision to fly to certain airports kind of obviously that's understandable, it's something that's been flagged by all the airlines. What's the long-term sustainable solution to that? I mean, do you just kind of sit out those airports for a while and kind of go back to it when things come back to normal and kind of how long does that take. Or kind of any color on the forward outlook there would be helpful?\nDaniel Shurz: Thanks Ravi. This is Daniel. I think it's going to be a combination of situations depending on the airport. We're going to see airports where absolutely, I think they realize with their costs to driving service away and they'll try and figure out ways to make it more cost effective. And we'll absolutely look at that and potentially come back to those airports. And we have so many growth opportunities as we said multiple times this year. We have lots of places to put our aircraft and so we're finding more cost-effective places in the short term. And look, a number of the airports we've made decisions on are in multi-airport cities. And there are much more cost-effective airports for us to fly from in those cities than those metro regions. And if that's ultimately what we have to do for the long term, we'll do it for the long term. So yes, if costs come down and I think some airports will see costs come down we will be back. But if costs don't come down we will stick with lower cost airports.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We have your next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question. I guess, Barry, in your response to that one from Ravi, you talked about by spring break hopefully getting back to normal. I think unfair structure on just revenue and yields. Do you think you can be profitable by then too? Or does getting back full utilization really the key there?\nBarry Biffle : We would expect to be profitable if we get back to 2019 revenue per passenger levels. And look, I think to be clear, I think what happens and there's confusion especially during a pandemic I think a lot of people have gotten an education about the difference between sales and revenue. And normally, there's not this much volatility week-to-week, month-to-month and definitely not quarter-to-quarter, but you see this. And so, when we talk about sales today we're talking about all future sales for all travel periods, which you need to look over the next three to six months. And so, even if you're getting back to 2019 revenue per passenger levels, it takes a full flow through of the booking curve in order for those revenues to materialize from a flown perspective. So we're not immune to the dent that was put in all of our load factors and fares caused by the delta variant. But what we're telling you is that we're moving out of that and we're climbing towards what we believe is spring and we're seeing really good things from an overall fare perspective in total dollars, which leads us to believe that we will see revenues that should be back to 2019 levels and obviously to cover fuel we'll need a little bit more than that. But we're pretty optimistic about the future? Yes. We will be profitable at the current trajectories.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate that. And I guess, jimmy or Daniel, you guys talking about getting back to full utilization by 2Q. I think you will be taking deliveries in the front half of next year right? So should we be thinking full utilization means capacity growth north of 30% versus where you were in 2019?\nDaniel Shurz: Yes, Brandon. We're still working through what we think Q1 should look like. We think it's probably up to about 10% lower capacity than what we had originally planned. We haven't finalized it yet. The issue that's happening at the moment, we think there'll be a sustained recovery post around spring break. But we think the off-peak period still need work. And so, it's focusing on the off-peak periods and the capacity deployed in those periods that we're doing at the moment. And so, we think our capacity to be a little bit lower than what we previously thought where it was up about 30% in ASMs year-over-year.\nBarry Biffle : Go ahead.\nDaniel Shurz: We haven't set a final number.\nBrandon Oglenski: Right. Thank you.\nDaniel Shurz: Thanks Brandon.\nOperator: Thank you. We have your next question from Helane Becker with Cowen. Your lines open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody and thank you very much for the time. I just have a couple of questions. The first one is on Costa Rica specifically. I know this is getting like greedy. But I've seen that demand in the market hasn't been that strong and yet you guys are going in opening I think a second -- I think you just said a second station there. So obviously, you're seeing something that the peer group isn't seeing. Can you just talk about like that market opportunity? And I know it's kind of weedy, but I was just interested in that?\nDaniel Shurz: So Helane, no, it's a good question. I think, I'll talk about two things. One we have much lower feds. What we're bringing into the Costa Rica market. We're adding Liberia to our to San Jose which opened in the summer. We're bringing much lower fares and we're following the leisure demand that exists. There's incredibly strong leisure demand in these near shore destinations and that's what we've seen in our expansion internationally. And I would also point out again that we fly -- we're looking at digital nomads. We know Costa Rica is interesting for people to go what, go stay there for a few weeks and work. We're also differentiated from other islands. We fly a lower frequency level. We fly the right frequency level for the right market and that's a consistent part of our network deployment strategy. And it's just the same in Costa Rica as it is across our network.\nHelane Becker: That's really helpful. Thanks Daniel. And then, my other question is this with respect to capacity growth in 2022. It seems like and it's kind of subpart A and B. So subpart A is Barry earlier in the year on one of the earnings calls you talked about demand would be strong for the holidays. And I think jimmy just said that, you expect strong demand for spring break next year with the off peaks still needing trouble. So the demand that you thought you would see for Thanksgiving and Christmas, are you seeing that level of demand or is it better or worse? And then subpart B of the question is with respect to capacity, I know you have aircraft coming in. And you've got bigger aircraft replacing smaller aircraft, which is a good thing. I'm assuming that means that you won't need to hire quite as many pilots. And is that a gating factor on capacity not even getting back to 2019 levels, I'm talking about the ability to grow beyond those levels to kind of as GDP grows and as we kind of get out of this pandemic and get back to whatever our next normal is. So maybe a lot in there, but pick two questions?\nBarry Biffle: Sure. Thanks Helane. Look, I mean, I remain as confident today as ever that the holidays are going to be big. I think what happened though for the last three months since we last spoke to you on the last call. What's happened is the delta variant put a damper on demand. And so, it hurt -- obviously, it hurts August, September, October and even the front end of November. We're seeing everybody now like Thanksgivings really booking. The Christmas holidays are really booking. I think the biggest challenge though to the quarter while well, I think I can say that we're going to have one of the best Thanksgiving and Christmas periods, we've had in a long time or if ever. The periods around it are still soft. And I think that's driven by a couple things. One, the delta variant caused the return to office to get delayed and a lot of people have moved that to January. If they're not in the office then they're largely not traveling. So I think that hurts business travel, which isn't direct to us, but it's indirect in that that it hurts the whole travel ecosystem. And then the second thing is the wide bodies are just now being unleashed to go back to their proper homes in the international. So, as we see that capacity go out, I suspect that you'll start to see things improve. The other reality is that that you don't have the full vaccines, right? So the kids just now children 5 to 11 just now got approved. They're just now getting their shots. They're not fully vaccinated yet. So I think that slows down. But yes the Holiday periods look good. The shoulder period's still a little bit soft but I think when you flow that through once everybody's back in the office, once you have the boosters in place. And I think probably most importantly we're underestimating the power of this therapeutic pill that eliminates death by like 90% that will be available by the year end. That I think you'll start to see those off-peak periods start to fill in. And that's why we're confident by spring and beyond everything will be good.\nHelane Becker: Got you. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We have your next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Hey, everybody. Jimmy, what are you expecting for say at least back gains in 4Q?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes. We've no aircraft deliveries in the fourth quarter. So we don't expect any suddenly spec gains related to aircraft deliveries this quarter.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then on the 4Q CASM number please, just to feel that back which is the ultimate nature of the first question. What is driving that pressure? If you could just help me understand the specific line items in the P&L. How much this is transient? How much of this is sticky? How much or maybe you spending a little bit to ensure good operational integrity. Just help me understand that CASM guide for 4Q please? Thanks.\nBarry Biffle: Yes. We entered into if you trace all the way back this year, our objective was to get the airline back to full utilization as you got towards the end of the fourth quarter. And so, we've been hiring pilots and flight attendants in order to satisfy that. And since the delta variant came about we've been close in canceling flights. And if you look through September, October we've taken anywhere between 7% and 9% of the plan capacity out of the business. So you're carrying a bit of cost in relation to crew through the quarter. And the biggest differential is really the sale lease back gains that you referred to. And then also we're probably about 3% to 4% higher in capacity. And there's a little bit of inflation. We certainly are not immune to it like every other airline. We've seen some inflation occur through the summer. But it's less than about $5 million in terms of the quarter. So relatively small in the context of our overall cost base. But there is an element of inflation particularly around stations and airport costs and like other airlines have mentioned on the on their calls and we're certainly seeing some disjointed airport costs coming in largely linked to uneven capacity across the industry as the industry starts to move through the pandemic. And so that's really what's happening. And sequentially it's a little bit higher than Q3 than we'd expected but largely because of the items that I just laid out.\nHunter Keay: Thank you.\nOperator: We have your next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your lines open.\nSavi Syth : Hey, good afternoon everyone. Maybe first just to follow up a little bit on Helane's question. Just -- I was wondering in terms of your kind of what your hiring plans are for 2022 mainly I'm kind of curious if you're confident about being able to meet those targets. It seems like from an training infrastructure standpoint, it seems like the industry as a whole is doing a lot of hiring and training just to get to summer capacity. And I know there's kind of fleet changes and things like that. So just curious what your views are on kind of supply and training capabilities across like pilots, flight attendants and mechanics?\nBarry Biffle: Well, let's just go by work group. So starting with pilots, we're extremely confident. We plan out the airline a long ways in advance as Hunter's question just a moment ago pointed out however when plans change like the delta variant we get stuck with the cost. But right now we have significant excess crew just simply because we over hired to when we plan to fly a larger airline right now. But if you just flow this out and you go through the training from recruitment to hiring to training to getting on the line and being a pilot in the first officer seat. That then frees up someone to move from the first officer's seat to the captain's seat. And that whole process can take six to eight months. And so, my confidence on the front half of next year and even into Q2 is like close to 100% because we've almost all these people are already on property that we need in order to satisfy that. Flight attendants can be managed a little bit closer in. There isn't the upgrade cycle with the captains and so forth. But when we look today at the people that we're getting through the door for training and continuing to fill classes. We feel really good. And in fact, we've seen now that once we got past the unemployment incentives and so forth back in September, we've seen in all parts of our business, the places that we did have shortages. We've been able to satisfy that. So, feel really good about the flight attendants. The airport staff probably is one of the most dramatic recoveries. Probably the most hit by many of the unemployment incentives, but probably the quickest to snap back as well. So we feel very good about that. And I think the one area and we've highlighted this before that there is a shortage in the United States and that's one in of maintenance. And so there are qualified technicians are at a premium today. And we continue to work with our business partners to make sure that we have the right number of folks out there. But I'll tell you from an efficiency perspective, we've looked at it. And you start saying, well, how many hours do I have of mechanics that are sitting around not working? And we're trying to figure out how can we be much more efficient and make sure that they've got a wrench in their hand and working on airplanes if we're going to be paying them. So we feel pretty good overall about the situation and while we're not immune to the the workforce challenges that people have had, I think we're managing it pretty well and feel good about the pipeline. And I think we have probably as good a better handle on the costs. And we have modeled those out. And I would say that unless something materially changes that further increases their trajectory. We incorporated that into our thinking for our 2023 guidance that we gave that that we would be sub success x fuel including the inflation we know today. So, if that answers your question?\nSavi Syth: No. That's extremely helpful. Thank you Barry. And then, if I might ask just on the moving the amply revenue target up from I think 63 to 65 here for about for 2023. Just you've heard a lot of airlines talking about demand for premium products being strong. It was already kind of a secular trend that may be strengthening. Is that, do you think driving some customer behavior or even a Frontier to just buy more ancillary and kind of treat themselves to kind of a better overall experience? Or is your kind of bullishness really driven by just what you're seeing on the credit card and loyalty sign-up standpoint?\nDaniel Shurz: Well, Savi, its a great question. It's Daniel. I think look, we've seen both. But we've seen a really strong ancillary performance for the quarter. And our core products led notably what I -- by what we do think of color with sort of the buy-up when you've got the money to pay for products. So of seats and bundles. And absolutely there we're seeing strength there that's our that's our premium. That's our equivalent for the premium products that some of the other airlines have been talking about. But it's also tied and I think it's the same thing. The credit card -- the strongest credit card applications, the strongest credit card approvals in the quarter. I think you're seeing all of these products working in long step in this sort of in this stronger market. And we've got our own premium products and yes that's part of what's driving this target. With it we've got lots of ideas in the pipeline for other things we can sell to customers as well. And when we think -- we think both discounts and the credit card product are going to continue to perform extremely well.\nJimmy Dempsey: Can I add to it. Let me just add too. I think we as an industry and I don't know probably spend 89 of our time on it over the last couple months on the negative bit. But people keep talking about inflation. And the positive or silver lining in this is the incomes. You just look at the latest reports that they're up more than they've been in a long, long time and we're seeing that extra money flow through to these extra products. You're seeing in all types of other industries. And so, while we're being relentless about eradicating waste and making sure that we manage down the cost side of inflation, the revenue opportunity is real. And so. we're going to make sure that we get our fair share of that as we move forward and more buying power translates to more pricing power for us. So we're really excited about it.\nSavi Syth: Thanks. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: We have your next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line's open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey thanks. So I guess drawn on a lot of the previous questions as you think about the 4Q you know starting weak and finishing strong. Can you just comment on the opportunity to improve RASM sequentially, because it just feels like the peak is very strong. I mean northeast of Florida and maybe I'm just whining here a little bit. I don't know that I've ever seen it like this. So, can you just say like again you got decent momentum on ancillary. And we're going to finish strong here. So is sequential improvement in RASM off the table?\nDaniel Shurz: Duane, its Daniel. No, absolutely not. We believe we can see sequential improvement. The challenges jimmy alluded to earlier is that we went into the quarter with a lot of bookings driven in the bottom of the deck and so the bad part of the delta spike. But we are seeing improvement. So overall, we expect to see the trajectory continue. It's going to probably be slight because of the impact of the delta variant. Because of how that impacted impact at the beginning of the quarter, but yes it's continuing to improve and we expect and as Barry said, we expect a lot of that is for future sales, future travel. And so we expect that improvement as the quarter goes on. And we expect to have that improvement to continue into 2022 as Barry was highlighting.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yep. That's helpful. And then on, again, given just the timing and the rhythm of how we started the quarter, maybe this is a little bit hard to measure. But you made a bit of a push on international. Can you talk high-level how the unit revenue profile of the international new markets compares to domestic new markets?\nBarry Biffle: Look, we're starting a lot of our new international ones for the fourth quarter right around now. So they're just starting. And as in any market there is ramp. But what we are seeing is demand is built demand is building each week for these international markets. We're seeing strong leisure demand for the peaks. And what we've saw is continued strength obviously in Cancun led us to announce more Cancun service for winter, which starts in December and January and we're seeing good early trends on those new markets as well. We're very comfortable with how we've deployed our international capacity this winter.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then, certainly appreciate some of the inflationary commentary and airports et cetera which we can't call it a dead horse at this point across the industry, but we've certainly had a lot of questions around that. Just to come at it maybe a little bit differently. As you look across your groups and your vendors, are you seeing any relief on labor availability yet any changes on that front to the better?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. I think that we've definitely seen that. I'm actually going to ask Jake Filene to talk a little bit. He's responsible for our airports where we had the most acute challenges, but Jake wanted to talk a little bit about what we're seeing now.\nJake Filene: Yeah. We've had - we've seen a material change in our retention attrition rates, if you look at year-to-date through June and then year-to-date through September, October, we've seen across the network, really improvement across the board in attrition rates coming down. A lot of that is due to we've done targeted, wage increases at the city level and those have been very effective.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks Duane.\nOperator: We have your next question from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Your lines open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good afternoon everybody. Most of my questions have been addressed, but try this one on. So in response to higher fuel, the levers one normally thinks about or tightening up capacity. Trying to push up yield just stating the obvious. I'm curious though, you know as a smaller entity and specific to recapturing fuel, is it possible to think outside of the box? I mean, do you ever sit around and throw around, I don't know, different pricing ideas internally maybe reducing the booking window something like a fuel club or selling advanced tickets without fuel included. And then re-running the car down the road. I'm only asking, because you're small, you're nimble and it seems like most of the industry evolution has come from smaller airlines, a simple no will suffice to be thick it's too goofy have a question?\nBarry Biffle: Well I couldn't answer no. That would be incorrect. We spend a lot of time on this. In fact we're sitting here laughing because there's a white board that has some notes from a week or two ago laying there talking about some of these various things in the room we're in. So look, here's the deal. First of all we get 100 miles per gallon per seat. And if you just do the math on that roughly a 1,000 miles, maybe about 12 gallons in your 80 percentile load factors. 12 gallons fuel. So just do the math at two and a half bucks, 30 bucks in fuel, We think about this all the time. But when you look at the broader industry especially the big four, they need like 35%, 40% more I think on average. So you just do the math. They need about 20 gallons. So right out of the gate, we've got eight gallons times, $2.5, that is the differential in the cost advantage that we have versus them. The industry needs that full amount of money. And we only need a portion of it. So that gives us a unique position where we're kind of structurally hedged against them. But we're not immune to economic pressures. And I'll tell you we have, like I said earlier, our revenue management team is acutely aware of the price of gas. They fill up their cars too. So we've been watching it. And I will start with we're at 63 on the non-ticket moving to 65 by 2023. If you do the math on that and you look at the increase versus what we paid in 2019 that will largely cover the fuel. We're looking at other ways to make sure that the non-ticket plus other fair initiatives brings our total revenue per passenger and ultimately our RASM to ensure that at some point in the very near future if these fuel prices stay at these elevated levels that we can cover it.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Very thorough. Thank you, Barry. And then second and it's just, because it feels like the call is winding down. But I understood in May given the IPO timing, but is there any internal consideration to pulling the reporting date forward a little bit. I'm just thinking about the periods when investors are most focused on the airlines. And it just doesn't feel like the second week of November is that period, small net?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes. Jamie, Jimmy here. I hope you're doing. Our anticipation is that we report at least a week earlier all the way through next year. There were some internal reasons why we were reporting this late and the previous quarter I think we were around the 3rd of August. And so we'd expect to report at least a week earlier than this going forward. Yeah, it's just -- we just have an anomaly this quarter.\nJamie Baker: Got it. Understood. Thank you for the thorough answers. Appreciate it guys. Take care.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks Jamie. Sorry if it messed up your travel schedule\nJamie Baker: No, no. Not at all. I'm thinking about the attention that I want Frontier to get and it's just -- it can be tough to break through on people's calendars a lot of outsiders are knee deep in other sectors right now and it's just sometimes getting hard again to see now.\nBarry Biffle: I was teasing you Jamie. We'll get it. We'll sort it out.\nJamie Baker: No, worries. Take care.\nOperator: We have your next question from Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is open.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good evening. Let's maybe pick up a little bit on detail of the fuel efficiency that you've been talking about the 100 gallons, excuse me, 100 ASMs per gallon. That's down about 4% year-on-year largely because of stage length I would guess, the 321neo comes in second half of next year. What should we be thinking about for fuel efficiency gains as you look into 2022 versus 2021, and is that a trend we can use going forward as the fleets more even leveled?\nBarry Biffle: So I'm not looking at the actual. I think you may be comparing to when we had some of the 321s parked possibly last year. Yes. Maybe some of the CEOs [ph]. So I think, look, our run rate for our fleet if we've got it fully operational is right around 100 miles per gallon. So it's -- I think there could have been a mix when we were looking at some of the historical through the pandemic. In fact, for example, in the heart of the pandemic we had all the 21s actually parked, which are very efficient in addition to the neo. So you go to the next year is that a couple of points.\nDaniel Shurz: Myles, just to add to what Barry's saying. Like if you looked at Frontier pre-COVID we were doing about 97 miles per gallon. We're close to 100 now obviously it's hotter in the summer, so sequentially it's a little bit lower than what it was earlier in the year. And you expect to see somewhere between 1% and 2%. 1% largely over the next three or four years inefficiency that comes into the [Indiscernible]. And so that's really what you see. It's not going to be 2%, 3%, 4%. You've got two-thirds of the fleet now operated as a320neos. You then see the introduction of the 321neo, which gives you an improved efficiency. But it's in the kind of just above 1% zone.\nBarry Biffle: And to give you specific, Myles, the 321neo when we bring that in next year with our configuration, it's going to have approximately 110 miles per gallon per seat. So it's a pretty good step function change. And as we flow those through the business that's why Jimmy's talking about gaining 1% to 2% a year. It's just math, because you're bringing in again the most efficient aircraft we've ever had.\nMyles Walton: Got it. And then the other thing that I should maybe just poke on a little bit to ask the question. It sounds like you're pointing more to the corporate reopening as sort of the next leg of recovery. And I'm curious if we -- can we completely separated from case counts. That sounds and vaccination levels and the magic pill coming through and really that the next leg is going back to the office somehow spurring your network as well as everyone else's?\nBarry Biffle: Well, it's not just that, right? When people are sitting around their house when they're not in their office they don't travel as much in general even further on their own dime. But I'm just saying in general you need -- for midweek travel for obviously you need business travel to take place. But I think it's a convergence of many issues. That's a structural one when people are not back in their offices. These are a lot of the same people who travel. And so that is a drag on the industry. The international has been a drag. There is still some drags and there's more and more positive announcements on this every day. But getting a PCR test to go to an international destination is not only kind of a pain and time consuming, it's expensive. And if you've got a family of four and you're spending a couple hundred bucks each to do that that's a drag on international leisure travel. So you've got that. You've got the pills. You've got just several things, the whole litany of it that points to you're going to have a lot better demand as we turn the clock and the calendar into next year. On top of we're already seeing, right? So that's additive.\nMyles Walton: Thanks.\nOperator: We have your next question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey. Good afternoon everyone. Hey just a counter point on Jamie's comment. I actually appreciate the fact that you guys go this late in the quarter. Because it's like a mid-quarter update and I think sort of last quarter, Barry when you're out kind of giving us an update and how things had materially worsened since everybody else had reported. So it was nice to kind of get that information in real time. So, definitely the counterpoint there, but at the end of the day I guess you got to do what's right for you guys?\nJimmy Dempsey: Just jumping over to a question here. When I look about at how you've done operationally, you've definitely outperformed your peer group despite the fact that you guys have been adding back a decent amount of capacity. And maybe some of it is that you got out in front of the whole vaccine mandate. I mean I think that's somewhat of an untold story. You guys were early with United and I believe Hawaiian. But as you think about growing the business what's the right number? Like how many domiciles do you have now? How do you think about pilots flight attendants aircraft per domicile. What's the appropriate number that will allow you to continue to put up these good numbers?\nBarry Biffle: So a lot in that. So operational design is a big thing that what we do. In fact, our head of network is -- his title is not just network, but his title is the VP of Network and Operational Design. And we spend a lot of time looking through what drives reliability. I mean our mission is low fares done right. And so, we look at things that cause challenges to reliability. We look at things that have caused controllable cancellations in the past and we've looked at the maintenance that it takes to support that, the crew that it takes to support that and then the actual schedule construction. And so the first thing that's probably and it was almost a requirement to be nimble through COVID. We had been working for years to move to a more modular network. And what we mean by that is that we are largely out and back with the majority of our trips being less than two days from a crew perspective having three and four day trips especially during thunderstorm seasons or snow seasons it's nearly impossible for them to not run into some kind of weather and trip up a multi-day sequence. So, we have moved to preferring out and backs. That has then necessitated the need to have eight operational crew bases across our system, which is a little more than many other carriers maybe our size would have, but we've made that investment effectively in excess reserve costs. Because you have to have reserves in each a minimum amount of reserves in those bases. But we believe that resiliency pays off in strong reliability. And then when you think about the maintenance that footprint we constantly debate this a lot and we're looking through right now what is the best way to make that efficient as we continue to grow. We've looked at more mechanics and more parts and more places or do you do the work in more concentrated places. And we'll see how that sorts out but we're trying to make sure that we offer the safe reliable operation at the lowest cost possible. And while we're not perfect, I think we've put together a pretty good recipe. And I think this year we were probably paranoid early on about the labor shortages. And I think we did a fantastic job. If you go kind of March, April, May and I think we were ahead of the curve. And then what we didn't realize is the entire rest of the country not just airlines, but restaurants and everybody was going to try to hire everybody in the month of June. And so kind of probably that last 10% to 15% of hiring was a challenge. And so now, I think the vaccine mandate that you have today that Osha just put out the final one. So you've got the some that are required to be vaccinated. And then you have large employers 100 plus that are vaccinate or test, which we fall in the second category because we are not a government contractor. And so we're working through that. There's 400 and some odd pages of rules. We're going to make sure that we're compliant with that. And that goes into effect I think January 4th and we are working through the process right now to make sure that we are fully compliant. But we run a safe and reliable operation and we'll do everything we can to do it in a smart and compliant way.\nMike Linenberg: Great. And just like that's super helpful, Barry. If I could just fit in a quick one here to Daniel, and maybe this is just sort of a little bit of a follow-up on Savi's question. I mean, again I look at the stats and your ancillary is up 11 on a year over two-year basis. Your departures though - excuse me, your stage length is down 7%, so when I usually think about stickiness of ancillary usually the longer the haul the more likely you're going to get that people to buy up for the extra comforts. And I'm just curious as you move into international and I realize it's early. Are you anticipating a higher take rate on ancillary as you move into some of these international markets. Any thoughts on that? And thanks for taking the questions.\nDaniel Shurz: Absolutely. I'll very quickly answer the first part. There's a lot less relationship but overall between state -- between stage length and I'm sorry the nodes between stage length and fare, there are different things that impact that. But if we look at international we do have experience in international markets. Obviously, we have long experience in both Cancun and Punta Cana. And yes we do see more of that sort of premium leisure trade up behavior. That's exactly the behavior we're describing for the overall system. This summer we tend to see more of that premium, that premium trade up. We do see our ancillary products performing better. It's a slightly different customer mix. It's a slightly different purpose of travel, Mike, and it does tend to work well.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Very good. Thanks Daniel. Thanks Barry. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Next one we have your next question from Stephen Trent with Citi. Your lines open.\nStephen Trent: Thank you operator and good afternoon Jensen [ph]. Thanks very much for taking my question. Most of my questions also answered and Mr. Linenberg beat me to it to ask about your crew stations. But just curious, when you think about Frontiers really had very little incremental debt addition during the pandemic versus most of your U.S. peers. When you think about coming out of the other side as many of your competitors are paying down debt. What do you see in terms of the opportunity to push the envelope on in terms of being a green airline? I think a lot of people love your otters and animal symbols on the planes and what have you. I know you guys thinking high level about sustainable aviation, fuel more aggressively or taking the next step in cutting the climate footprint with the wiggle room you guys will have versus others? Thank you.\nBarry Biffle: A lot going on there, maybe we'll follow up. I think you got a debt question there. Let me start with the green. Look, we're Americas greatest airline, we got 100 miles per gallon per seat and we've got a really good lead. We've got the youngest fleet in America highest concentration of new generation A320neo family aircraft, really proud of our position and I know there's a lot to talk about sustainable aviation fuels and we are interested and intrigued by it. But a lot of people talk about 2050. And if you're really excited even about 2030. If you get really excited about a 30% to 50% reduction in CO2, then great news. You can fly Frontier today. You don't have to wait 10 to 20 years to get it from a lot of the green washing people across this industry around this globe. And so, sustainable aviation fuel is an excuse to not reduce. Remember, it's reduce, reuse and recycle. And where we are today is we're in the unique position that we offer consumers the ability to save the planet and save money at the same time, which gives you kind of ESG without compromise. Now as far as the debt, I'm not sure I understood what you were talking about the debt versus everybody else. But jimmy is intrigued and staring at the phone.\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes, Stephen. I hope you're keeping well. Look, we're very proud of the fact that we've managed through COVID without adding substantial debt to the business. And we talked about this in the IPO and I've talked about it since. And we added about a dollar a passenger debt whereas the rest of the industry out of approximately $20 per passenger when you amortize their debt and then they have to service that over the next five years or so. Our objective at the moment is to actually clear out the government loan and pay it down. And that puts us in a very, very good and unique position across the industry. And then, one of the things that we've learned through the COVID process is the value that's inherent in the loyalty program that we have in our brand assets. And that puts us in a really, really strong position from a balance sheet perspective in the airline. As you emerge from COVID not having tap that liquidity and to bolster your balance sheet and operate through the pandemic. And so, our anticipation is you get to sustained recovery, get back to cash flow, strong cash flow generation as you progress through 2022. And that puts us in a really strong position to grow this business.\nStephen Trent: It's super helpful. Really appreciate the color guys. Thank you.\nBarry Biffle: Sure.\nOperator: We have your next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Just two quick ones from me. I guess first, Barry, do you have a sense of what percentage of your passengers connected onto you from an international destination pre-pandemic? I'm just trying to get a sense. What the easing of these international restrictions could mean for you?\nBarry Biffle: So internet -- I'm sorry international from other metal, another airline or international on us?\nAndrew Didora: From another airline.\nDaniel Shurz: This is Daniel. It's a tiny it's a tiny number of customers. On balance is it marginally helpful? Its very marginally helpful, but it's not meaningful to us in any way.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Makes sense.\nBarry Biffle: I would just add on international. The average consumer, I mean, we all follow it every day. But getting rid of these restrictions across the board is good for all international whether it be near international, wide body, long haul ,when people are confused especially less sophisticated leisure travelers they just stay away. So getting all these restrictions removed is good for all types of air travel.\nAndrew Didora: Nice. I hear you. Barry, just clarification from your earlier commentary around revenues getting back to 2019 levels by the spring. Did you mean total company revenues backed by the spring or were you talking about unit revenue or revenue per passenger metric? Thanks.\nDaniel Shurz: I'm done by RASM, unit revenue run.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We have your next question from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna. Your lines open.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So two questions both around RASM. The first, so the comment that you expect to be profitable by the spring assuming the current trajectory of demand continues. Curious, what are you assuming with respect to U.S. domestic capacity for the industry? Because it sounds like based on your prepared remarks from the COVID data with the vaccination data and new therapeutics that this sort of next bucket at capacity certainly with respect to long haul capacity going back to their natural markets. And it sounds like you're optimistic around business. Curious, what gives you the confidence at this point that fares will be strong enough to offset what will likely be a meaningful step up in domestic U.S. capacity into the first half?\nBarry Biffle: I think we're basing that off. What we've seen the last week, last two weeks and that what we've seen build up over the last couple months. And then adding on to that further acceleration in overall volume. And if we -- if the -- we're now touching 2019 fares and ancillary combined. So total revenue per passenger is starting to touch 2019 levels. So if that holds up, I think you can cover it. Then the difference becomes fuel effectively. And so, we think there's several more shoes to drop from a positive perspective when we look between now and spring break. And as I mentioned getting the five to 11 year olds vaccinated they're just now starting to get there. They're not off over fully vaccinated. The boosters are just now being rolled out. But the therapeutic pill is again additive and then you throw on that that you've got the return to office in January. You've got the wide bodies leaving going back to their natural international markets. And so, all of these should be constructive for domestic demand and capacity balance.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then the second question also a RASM question. Your decision to at least temporarily walk away from some of these higher cost airports. Obviously, that should help in terms of a per trip and I'm guessing a network CASM. But is there any impact with respect to network RASM. And I'm going to guess no, because you're more of a point-to-point carrier. But should we think about that being a positive or negative as we think about system RASM into 2022? Thank you.\nDaniel Shurz: So, this is Daniel. We think about this on a margin basis. So these cost -- the airports that we're pulling out of the costs are so far above our system averages, we believe it's margin accretive to move the flight to other airports. That's how we're making these decisions. And that's our opportunity. That's a significant lower cost airport, even if there's a slight RASM penalty in the process, the margin benefit is there.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Barry Biffle, President and CEO for any closing remarks.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks everyone for joining the call today. If you have any further questions please reach out to Susan and the team. And we look forward to talking with you again soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Please refer to our second quarter 2021 earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. With that I will turn it over to Barry for his opening remarks. Barry? \nBarry Biffle: Thank you, Susan, and thank you, everyone for taking the time to attend our earnings call. Although, this is only our second quarter as a public company, we recently celebrated our 27th year as an airline, and I couldn't be more proud of how we evolved as a company and the strength and resiliency of our ultra-low-cost business model underpinned by our Low Fares Done Right strategy. In a moment, I'll be turning the call over to Daniel and Jimmy to bring you through the details of the second quarter and our expectations going forward. But I wanted to first provide you with some high level thoughts. To start, we're very pleased that our expectation of pent-up demand as a result of widespread vaccinations proved to be true. Based upon this expectation, we had planned for and successfully completed the return of all our aircraft and employees into service across our stations during the quarter and consequently operated at capacity levels that were higher than the same comparable quarter in 2019. Utilization of our aircraft and load factors achieved during the quarter were significantly higher than last year and further improvement to the pre-COVID levels that is expected as we enter 2022. I want to personally thank our team Frontier members for their hard work, dedication and professionalism through the pandemic and bearing our return to pull operations, along with our commitment to our mission of Low Fares Done Right with the safety of our team members and customers continuing to be our top priority. Our success in navigating the pandemic and returning to full operations is the direct result of all our team's efforts. Looking forward, we're closely monitoring the impact of the Delta Variant. We expect any impact to be short-term in nature given the availability of vaccines and the likely increase in vaccination rates in response to the Delta Variant. We therefore expect a resumption of the pace of recovery, as the Delta Variant cases fall, similar to what was experienced elsewhere in the world. As we returned the airline back to full operations, we have remained financially disciplined. The resulting strength of our balance sheet and liquidity coupled with our low-cost structure, positions us well to address any delays in the timing and pace of the recovery resulting from the Delta Variant and to facilitate our planned growth as the recovery continues to unfold. Our growth since last quarter has continued in both domestic and international network. Domestically, this includes new service from Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, Orlando and Salt Lake City and the announcement of even more leisure destinations from Philadelphia and Burbank. We're pleased to have the governor of Colorado in our first flight to Grand Junction as well. Internationally, our Caribbean and Latin America presence continues to grow including expansion into Antigua, Aruba, Belize, Costa Rica, St. Martin and Turks and Caicos. To keep up with this growth, we've opened a new crew base in Tampa during the quarter and plan to add Atlanta in due course. We remain committed to being America's greenest airline as well. This is not only through the use of more fuel efficient aircraft, which generated over 100 ASMs per gallon during the quarter but also through other initiatives, including the campaign we launched this quarter, highlighting Florida animal conservation. We partnered with visit Orlando, representing four Orlando wildlife parks and preserves. Customers were invited to choose from among resident animals from the central Florida Zoo and Botanical Gardens, Cater land, SEA LIFE Orlando Aquarium and Wild Florida to determine which animal would be on the tail of new Frontier Airlines aircraft. Ted the turtle was our winner from this highly successful contest and will appear on a frontier aircraft in 2022. Our efforts are resonating with customers as well. With a number of new discount den members surging in June to the highest monthly level since the program was initiated. In June, we also reached the highest level of new Barclays Frontier credit card member sign-ups in our company's history. This performance helped us achieve $60 per passenger non-ticket for the first time. Overall, I'm encouraged by the pace of recovery we experienced during the quarter and our timing of the capacity deployment to meet that recovery. There may be delays in the recovery resulting from the Delta Variant but I expect those delays to be temporary given the existing availability of vaccines and observation of the movement in case levels experienced in other impacted areas of the world. Further, as the confusion subsides and Americans understand how powerful vaccinations are in preventing severe outcomes, we expect confidence to build and the pent-up demand will surge again. I'll now turn it over to Daniel, who will provide more details on our performance for the quarter. \nDaniel Shurz: Thank you, Barry. And I want to join you and also thanking all of our team Frontier members for continuing to take such a good care of each other and of course all of our customers. As the airline returns to full operation, we continue to be very focused on strengthening our loyalty and membership programs and have seen further success on momentum from our efforts. During the quarter, we enhanced our website to better highlight the benefits of our discontent program. And as Barry mentioned, we should have seen a resulting surge in discount on memberships in June. The month we saw our highest level of acquisition since the program started. In addition, we mentioned, last quarter working with our launch partner Barclays we will focus on attracting more card members to our Frontier Airlines Mastercard program. And I just like to highlight, the June set a new record sign-ups for the card and we've just exceeded that record in July. Our capacity during the quarter exceeded the levels to the comparable pre-COVID quarter in 2019. We've taken a balanced approach to our capacity growth with existing and new flight service and our overall goal is to stay in markets for three to 4 times a week flight service, which we think is ideal for our business model. Our Caribbean and Latin America footprint has grown to account for over 13% of our capacity this summer and we've recently announced new destinations to add to our existing capacity including Antigua, Belize and Turks and Caicos. Our goal by the end of 2023 is for flying in this region to account for 20% of our overall capacity. Domestically, we announced plans to further grow our footprint in the fall and winter with new routes out of Atlanta, Dallas, Las Vegas, Miami and Orlando. And these new domestic routes are almost exclusively taking advantage of our existing broad airport portfolio. We saw an increase in the recovery of demand as the quarter progressed. Operating revenues for the second quarter increased 184% year-over-year to $550 million as the recovery from the pandemic strengthened for leisure travel. We had over 80% more average aircraft in service during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the prior year, with average daily utilization recovering to over 10 hours per day and the fleet operating on an 80% load factor. Further recovery in our utilization and load factor is expected to the levels achieved in the comparable pre-COVID period as the recovery from the pandemic continues as Barry highlighted. On a per passenger basis, we generated total revenue for passenger of approximately $98 including $60 per passenger of non-fare and other revenue, which was 6% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. Our capacity levels are expected to continue to trend at or above 2019 levels, as we progress through the coming months. Our forward bookings were strengthening before the recent uptick in Delta Variant cases. The impact of the Delta Variant on bookings and the length of that impact are difficult to predict. We do expect that these cases decline we will see a positive impact on forward bookings. With that I will turn it over to Jimmy to provide more details on our financials.\nJimmy Dempsey: Thanks, Daniel. I first want to thank all of the team Frontier members for their hard work and dedication, as we restore the airline to full operation during the quarter while staying financially disciplined, generating approximately $70 million in cash during the quarter and ending with $936 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, the highest balance in the company's history. The cash at the end of the quarter reflects the $266 million of net proceeds received from the successful closure of our IPO at the beginning of the quarter and $171 million of additional payroll support program funding, under payroll support two and three. The strength of our liquidity position enabled us to allow the treasury loan facility drawdown date of May 28 2021 to expire without drawing any remaining funds under the facility. We expect to receive our $161 million of income tax receivable later this year and are focused on repaying the $150 million outstanding under the treasury loan at the appropriate time. This will enable us to an unencumber our co-brand credit card program and related brand assets that are currently collateralizing the treasury loan, providing standby access to substantial liquidity of needs. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $19 million. Our adjusted net loss of $50 million or $0.24 per share excludes a number of special items. These include $87 million of Cares Act credits a $2 million mark to market-related to the warrants held by US Treasury through our IPO closing date of April 6, 2021 and $6 million of costs associated, with the early lease termination of our remaining 319 aircraft.  We ended the June quarter, with 119 aircraft or 109 aircraft in our fleet after the addition of five new Airbus A320 new aircraft that were financed through sale in these part of transactions partly offset by three lease returns during the quarter. The lease returns during the quarter include two A319 aircraft associated with our early lease termination, with one of our lessors to complete our strategic objective of replacing all A319 aircraft with larger and more fuel-efficient A320 and A321 aircraft. To this end during July 2021, we signed a letter of intent with two of our leasing partners to add to an incremental A321 aircraft through direct leases, with deliveries expected to begin in the second half of 2022 and completed in the first half of 2023. The incremental 321 aircraft will enable the company to boost its ASM growth rate as the recovery from the COVID pandemic continues. We anticipate taking delivery of an additional five A320neos during the third quarter of 2021 with no deliveries expected in the fourth quarter. Looking forward to the third quarter we continue our focus on getting the airline back to full utilization as we enter 2022 while remaining flexible to address any impact from the Delta variant on our bookings. Within the last week we have noted softening in the level of bookings over seasonal norms that we believe is directly related to the increased COVID-19 case numbers associated with the Delta variant. The impact of the Delta variant on bookings and the duration of that impact are difficult to predict. As a result, the top end of our guidance range for net income is being adjusted to breakeven providing us with a third quarter net income loss margin range of 0% to minus 5%. We are confident that as cases decline we will see a positive impact on forward bookings. More details on our forward guidance can be found in our second quarter earnings release and our website. With that, I will hand it back over to Barry for some closing remarks.\nBarry Biffle: Thank you, Jimmy. It's been a year of enormous change for our company and we continue to thank all our team frontier members for going above and beyond as we navigate through the pandemic and the successful return of all of our aircraft and employees into service across all of our stations during the quarter, enabling us to take advantage of the strengthening recovery in leisure travel. While the timing of the recovery may be temporarily delayed due to the Delta variant we're in a very strong liquidity position for the proven and very resilient business model that positions us well for continued shareholder value creation as we grow the business. With that, operator, please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Hey, this is to Barry and maybe to Daniel as well. First off just kudos to the fact that you guys have this promotion out there this friends with vaccines fly free. So, definitely creative and so definitely my hats off to you on that one which is sort of a lead into my question thoughts on the Biden administration is talking about all arrivals overseas arrivals into the US actually having to be vaccinated. How does that in your thinking about new international destinations I mean if we just look earlier this week, you launched a whole bunch of new international destinations from multiple gateways where you have good presence. I think you've indicated in the past that you're probably going to see more international in 2021, 2022. Is it less focus on VFR and more on pure leisure destinations like Caribbean, Turks, and Caicos? How does that change? And also sort of as a follow-up question where are you with respect to your customer base? Do you have a sense of how many of them are vaccinated. I'm bringing this up because two other carriers in previous conference calls this quarter indicated that they gave some statistics. One said majority of their customers were vaccinated, another one said there're most frequent customers something on the order of 84% of them were vaccinated. Any thoughts on that since it will have some impact on people choosing where and when they can fly. Thank you.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks Mike. I'll try to -- I'll work backwards and try to remember all the questions you threw in there. But look--\nMike Linenberg: Sorry.\nBarry Biffle: If we look at who's traveling now and compare that to a year ago, I mean you got massive numbers of traveling and people didn't travel a year ago not because it wasn't fares being too expensive or anything else, they were scared to fly. And the vaccinations made them feel safe and that's what got people back out traveling. And so we've been quietly surveying over the last few days to actually get the exact latest number, but we believe it is the vast majority of everyone who is traveling today is vaccinated. And so I don't see a challenge to your international question. I don't see a challenge there either, in fact, that was with the Miami airport recently in the first month that they offered vaccinations in the airport in Miami. They had 50 some odd thousand people come there. People are coming off planes from everywhere to get it. So, the people that are going to travel and travel in the United States, I think you're going to see that they're vaccinated as well. And look we're in the safety business we would support and continue to support any measures or incentives that it takes to get everybody vaccinated. The facts are real clear. There's a lot of confusion over the last week or two talking about breakthrough cases and so forth. But there's three numbers that every American should know, 97, 99 and 100. 97% of everybody that's in the hospital with COVID is unvaccinated. 99% or more of every one dying of COVID is unvaccinated. It's time for 100% of everybody who is eligible to be vaccinated needs to get the vaccine and that's what's going to get us through this Delta variant and get us all back on the road to recovery.\nMike Linenberg: Great. And just one quick follow-up. The withdrawal from LAX, I was surprised presumably it has to do with cost or maybe it's moving to a new terminal which is less convenient. Thoughts on that because it would seem like that that would be a good market for you for the long haul. \nDaniel Shurz: Mike thanks. It's Daniel.\nMike Linenberg: Hi Daniel.\nDaniel Shurz: Look we consistently and constantly focus on keeping our costs low. And Southern California has a wide selection of airports. And we were seeing another significant -- so LAX wasn't a cheap airport to start with and we saw another significant cost increase happening there as a result of new construction opening at the airport. We've moved service to airports where we are saving on a CPE basis, a double-digit number of dollars per passenger. And look that gives us -- that gives us flexibility to use our low fares to attract customers and ultimately works better for the business. It's not that we're not serving LA, it's not that we're not serving Southern California. We're not. We're serving Ontario, we're serving Burbank, we're serving Orange County in the LA region and they're all markedly lower cost airports in our layout.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Make sense. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Maybe as a follow-up on some of the previous commentary on the previous question. Just your commentary on the Delta Variant kind of showing up in your booking activity. That seems a little bit different than some of the other airlines, probably all the other airlines so far, they've said that they're not seeing any impact so far. Is this just because you're reporting later on them? And so you have kind of more up to date information here, or do you think there's something different with the way where you fly to your type of customers that you're maybe seeing a slightly different delta impact than some of the other airlines?\nBarry Biffle: Look, if we would have report it two weeks ago, we wouldn't have had the Massachusetts study, we wouldn't have had the new CDC guidance and you wouldn't have had all this new information about the Delta Variant. And I hate to be the bearer of news that this masks and the resurgence is an impact on economic activity, but it is. And so if you want to look at the KAYAK search data. It's public. It's out there. You can look at it. It's been trending down for the last two weeks. This is very clear. If you compare that to what was going on in June compared to now, there's been a little slowing in the recovery. Nothing like we saw obviously a year ago. The most recent ARC data shows you an online travel agencies for example that we're seeing a little bit of a setback as well. And so we have factored that into our numbers that we're presenting today. I understand you're comparing it to carriers that haven't factored any of this in, but we fall - we were in a position where it's very clear with our data. We've seen some softness in future sales. We're still seeing great demand close in. But as we look beyond the summer peak, we have seen some softness and that is reflected in the public data as well. And so that's why we reflected in our guidance.\nRavi Shanker: Very good. Crystal clear on that makes a lot of sense. And just kind of shifting gears little bit from my follow-up, there was an executive order from the Biden administration a few weeks ago targeting a number of industries including the airline industry, particularly focused on increased fare disclosure as well as potentially looking at kind of slots in certain airports I would love to get your take on what do you think of that and kind of how much of that is actually actionable? Thank you.\nHoward Diamond: Yes. This is Howard Diamond. There's nothing in those executive orders that we are concerned about. We feel like we're already compliant. These have been in the works for quite a bit of time. So we're fully prepared to comply. We absolutely believe in transparency and providing the best customer experience.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Hey. How are you guys doing?\nBarry Biffle: Hi.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Barry. So is business travel coming back whenever it does? Does this travel came back good because it creates a pricing umbrella and alleviate some competitive capacity pressure, or is it bad because it gives network airlines revenue stream, they can use to subsidize low fares to compete against you in a way that you probably consider to be short-term irrational?\nBarry Biffle: It's good. It's very good. Look, if your cost structure requires really high fares to make money, they do irrational things when that's not available to them. So it's good for the entire industry as business travel come back. And I think what's exciting what we've seen I mean prior to the Delta Variant in the last week or so you've seen business travel coming back I think a lot faster the data supports a lot faster than any of us ever expected. I mean, I can't tell you how many business dinners and events and things I've been to in the last six to eight weeks. So I think it's good. And while we may take a little bit of temporary delay, the recovery is not canceled. I just think they may push back some of the office openings. But that just means that there's probably going to be more people travel in October than there was in September.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And then a couple of questions on capacity for you. The third quarter was a little bit lower than I expected it would be. Did you dial that back because of Delta Variant? And then second how did the new plans you just acquired in July impact the outlook for growth next year? Thanks a lot.\nJimmy Dempsey: Yeah. And I'll just deal with the second part of the question. Next year's growth rates it's going to head towards about 30% given the year-over-year change from having lower utilization this year. It doesn't really materially change our growth rate in 2022. What it does is it infills some growth hunter for 2023 that we talked about while we were doing the IPO, our growth rate at that time was around 10%, 11% ASM growth. We think that will rise to maybe high teens in 2023 because It gives us some confidence now given what we're seeing in our cost base where the efficiency that's coming through in a more modular network on the back of what we've learned through COVID plus also incremental 321s coming into the fleet that we think our CASM ex fuel actually will be modestly below $0.06 in 2023, which is a real positive move for the business from a unit cost perspective and it gives us better confidence in terms of getting the airline back to pre-COVID margins as we progress through 2023. \nHunter Keay: Right. The high teens that's a year-over-year. \nJimmy Dempsey: Sorry. Yes, high teens year-over-year. \nHunter Keay: Just clarify Jimmy. \nDaniel Shurz: Yes okay. That's right. \nHunter Keay: Sorry. Dan go ahead. Were you going to say something? \nDaniel Shurz: Hunter it's Daniel. Yes our capacity growth in Q3 is -- we've lowered it slightly. We expect we expect slightly low capacity in response to what we're seeing but it's a marginal change of a point or so. And we still expect -- we still expect to be growing fourth quarter ASMs more significantly. We're currently expecting fourth quarter to grow in the 12% to 14% range. \nHunter Keay: Okay. Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nDaniel Shurz: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: On lease payment deferrals you noted you're caught up on those. I wonder if you could give us the cash flow impact and the OpEx impact from the catch-up in 2Q in other words the amounts that will not be recurring?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes. Like the big payment wane in Q -- in lease repayments came in Q1. That was about $22 million if my memory serves me correct. In Q2 it was about $10 million. And so we've largely paid it back. It's the same for cash and net income and operating costs. So it's a relatively modest. There's a tiny stub of a couple of million dollars that needs to go out in the rest of the year but it's largely repaid at this stage. And then in addition to that we're normalizing our working capital around accounts payable. One of the big changes that we're seeing in the business is as we move back to full -- or towards full utilization in 2022, we're spending a decent amount of money on training and underutilized aircraft really. So effectively carrying rent across this year as you get the business back up and running going into next year. That's a significant cost headwind that the business is faced with but one that we can overcome as we go into next year. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful. And then my follow-up is on operations. As you take a look at what's going on across the industry what is your take on where the pain points are really emanating from? You've talked about the concept at least for your own network of a more modular network. Is there anything different about the way you have spooled up either your network or your planning that helps to insulate you from some of these issues we're seeing?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. So I'll start it and let Daniel talk. But look we're not immune to the workforce challenges that are happening all across America in just about every sector in the services. You've seen shortages of trucking, you've seen shortages of all types of things supply chain and shortages of people that want to work. But I'll tell you we've been heavily focused on this since January. It got more acute as everyone tried to get back to full operations this summer. It was almost like we're all stealing from each other the same employee pool. But I'll tell you there's silver lining. I mean when we talk to a lot of the recruiters and the feedback we're getting from the job fairs you're finally starting to see those people get off the couch and looks like they're getting ready to go back to work as their unemployment benefits are going to stop. So I think this is temporary in nature. And as I tell people look these are good problems to have. I think we're all blessed to have the demand recovery so we would even have these challenges. It's a lot better to have that conversation today versus what we're talking about a year ago. And as far as operational resiliency we've always been focused on that in our operational design. But I think we've gotten even better at that over the last year. And Daniel wants to talk a little bit about modular? \nDaniel Shurz: Yes. I think Duane it's definitely helped us to have gone more modular. We've seen -- we've seen some of the same challenges but what we're seeing in the network is -- what we're seeing in the network as we do things as we've obviously opened and expanded our new crew bases. What we're seeing is that when there's disruption particularly driven by weather we can actually limit it we can limit it more effectively than we used to be able to those parts of the network. And I think that's definitely helped us. And look going forward we've opened crew bases already. We're opening one in Atlanta recently. So we're going to be opening one in Phoenix in 2022. We continue to build out this modularity of the airline. It's better commercially. It gives us more flexibility gives my team more flexibility on how the network is designed. And it's better for operations on a daily basis and it's better for operational recovery. And as a result that of a cost. And as we as we expand in these cities where we have crew bases it's good for our high profit ancillaries as well. As we pointed out we have -- we had a good quarter on our ancillary performance. We got $60 and these -- as we make these cities bigger it's good for discount then and it's good for credit card acquisition. So it's got all-round benefits. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, appreciate your thoughts.\nDaniel Shurz: Thanks Duane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey good afternoon. Just given how international is going to be playing a bigger role in the network as you get to 2023. Just curious what you're seeing today? And if there's going to be any kind of change in the type of international market mix that you're seeing, or how much of your growth is going to be dedicated towards international?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. So I'm going to kick it off and then I'll let Daniel talk specifically about some of the region. I mean, you just mentioned the $60 in non-ticket and we're targeting $63 now by the time we get to 2023. That's going to enable us to have a breakeven fare at our target of about $30. So we believe that the ability to grow is exponentially better when we have such a low breakeven fare. And we're going to use it to the near international where we see considerably higher yields than we see domestically. And we think that that's going to give us a really big tailwind from a RASM perspective in the next few years. But Daniel, why don't you talk about the -- some of the shape and specifics.\nDaniel Shurz: So in the shorter-term, Savi, obviously, what we've seen and obviously as you've heard from some of our competitors is it's been a much better -- it's been a much better some of the near international leisure than it has been for VFR. And so you've seen -- we've seen the same trends. And so we focused our summer growth, and we focused our winter announcements in the last couple of weeks on leisure destinations. As vaccination rates rise through the region, and as therefore, travel fully resumes through the region, we absolutely anticipate continuing to add to our VFR portfolio as well. It's going to be a relatively balanced mix I believe. And it's -- while it's today focused very much on our two Florida bases, we do anticipate growth through the Frontier network internationally. And we've said before and I said in my earlier comments, we anticipate getting to 20% of our capacity by the end of 2023 being in the international and Caribbean market.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up on the Delta variant comments. Have you seen a difference in impact in kind of where that demand softening is, or is it just kind of broad based?\nDaniel Shurz: So, it's Daniel, again. We're seeing it reasonably broad-based for the moment. I think it's causing concern. It's causing concerns people look to book trucks further out. And I think it's -- that's a relatively general concern across the market.\nBarry Biffle: And I would just add, I mean, look, there's a lot of confusion out there right now. The last week it's probably -- it's days probably the worst time in terms of people's understanding. Again, I mentioned it earlier, I think, as people that are vaccinated are getting a little freaked out over the last week, as they understand the facts, they're going to settle down. They're going to realize as long as the data holds, up again 97% of everybody in the hospital is unvaccinated, and over 99% of everybody dying is unvaccinated. So I think everybody just got scared a little bit. They heard about these breakthrough cases, but they are extremely, extremely rare. And so as people start to understand that, we expect that people will get back to their normal life. \nSavi Syth: Thank you. Right. All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question comes from Stephen Trent of Citi. Your question please.\nStephen Trent: Good afternoon everybody and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch base a little bit on what you guys are seeing from weather events. I mean, we've seen kind of extreme drought in parts of the Desert Southwest and forest fires and what have you -- I'm just wondering is any of these occurrences have created any operational disruption versus what you would have previously anticipated?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. Look I can kick it off and some of the other shares we even talk to. Look, yes, we have seen some unprecedented weather events. Yes, setting records in the West, setting records in the East, thunderstorms lasting longer, we\u2019re seeing day after day of ground stops in airports, these seasonally happen, but yes, the intensity and some of the records are very difficult. I can tell you, again, we're blessed to have the modularity in our network, and it hasn't rippled through other parts of the business as a result of that design feature, but it is challenging. I mean, what it does in a world where we're largely staffed very well. I think on a relative basis maybe better than others, but weather stretches those folks, right? And you end up stretching duty periods on the crew. You end up stretching the day for people that work on the ground, if they have to sit there for hours on in and wait for the weather to clear to finish unloading an airplane. And unfortunately, our customers oftentimes get in that. I think thankfully though seasonally, we should be moving into better weather over the next couple of months. And hopefully, all the supply chain issues that are here in the US and all the other things normalize as well as the unemployment benefits run out. And so by the time we can get back to winter, everybody will have plenty of staff to deal with these issues. \nStephen Trent: Great. Very helpful, Barry. And then just my one very quick follow-up, I heard you mentioned the detail about some of the southbound routes into LatAm. Given the FAA's downgrade of Mexico to category 2, has that created kind of any incremental opportunities for Frontier, or is it way too short of a timeframe to have any meaningful benefit from that?\nBarry Biffle: No. It doesn't change the calculus for us. And as we look at the different opportunities in Latin America, especially Mexico, we've continued to add routes there, but I mean, I assume that's going to be short-lived. I understand the Mexican authorities are working on this and they're going to work through that. And I don't -- I think this is just temporary. I don't think it creates any long-term strategic opportunity for anyone on the US side.\nStephen Trent: Okay. Very helpful. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.\nIan Snyder: Hey. This is Ian Snyder, JPMorgan, with two quick questions on behalf of Jamie. I'll jump right in with it. On the last call you mentioned that work from home flexibility could theoretically lead to people taking more trips each year. Obviously, it's too early to know if that's happening, but are there any interesting trends you're seeing when tracking repeat customers?\nDaniel Shurz: This is Daniel. It does seem a little bit too early to see. We were actually expecting -- so we were actually expecting this sort of towards the end of this year to start to see as we were waiting for the sort of main return to office to see what amount of additional flexibility and that's -- it's the period when offices return to whatever the new normal is, that we will really get the indication as to what it does to travel patterns. And, obviously, we're not there yet.\nIan Snyder: There's no -- go ahead.\nDaniel Shurz: But we still do believe that it's going to happen. I mean, there's a lot of permanent remote working that's going to take place, it's going to cause conferences and meetings and training, travel that's going to be necessary, but it also just gives them a lot of flexibility. So I haven't seen any indications that we're not going to move to more flexibility. So I think the theory still holds.\nIan Snyder: Great. Thanks for that. And then just one more quick follow-up. On the leasing side, I know, we've gotten just a little bit with the lease payment deferrals, but we have had a lot of discussion with appraisers on this, could you give some color on the sort of 320neo offers you're getting, perhaps on a percent of basis of how current offers compared to your average lease rate for aircraft already in service? Are they 10% lower, or 30% lower? Just some order of magnitude would be helpful for us.\nBarry Biffle: Yes. I mean, there's -- look the market during 2020 got challenged in the leasing world, largely because of the liquidity squeeze that came from airlines into leasing companies to fund their businesses in the short term and you saw pricing expand. You're seeing pricing head back or actually in some cases go below what you saw pre-COVID, which is really, really helpful. I'm not going to start getting into exact numbers in terms of what we're achieving on lease rates, but we will be considered one of the better end credits in the leasing world for leasing companies in order to place their aircraft into or buy our aircraft office and lease them back from. So we feel in a really, really good shape in terms of how we progress into next year from a leasing perspective and financing the fleet. I think, it's very helpful that it's returned to pretty much pre-COVID levels, but in some cases not quite, but we're seeing some aggressive pricing out there and that's driving below our pre-COVID levels, which is very encouraging.\nIan Snyder: Great to hear and appreciate the color there. That\u2019s it for me.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos of Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So I appreciate the color on the impact you're seeing from the Delta variant, it looks to be more to the system as a whole versus any specific areas. But I'm wondering if you could comment prior to the acceleration in the Delta cases over the last two weeks, what your guidance might have looked like for adjusted net income margin?\nJimmy Dempsey: Hi, Chris. It's Jimmy here. So, look, we expected to deliver to you a guidance range maybe 2, 3 points higher on the top end on what we gave you today from a net income perspective. So we gave you a breakeven to minus 5%. And we probably were 2%, 3% positive on that about a week-and-a-half ago. As we saw things progress over the weekend and we made a revision to our guidance. If you want to look at that in dollar terms, it's probably somewhere in the region of $20 million to $30 million in terms of revenue, that it hurt or it's going to hurt the business in the next couple of months. But we think -- we feel pretty good about the progress that we're achieving on recovery. If you look at the business, we had a negative EBITDAR through last year, into the first quarter this year. We have a positive EBITDAR of 13% in the second quarter. Our anticipation as to the EBITDAR levels will head back above 20%. Not sure how much above 20%, but a really positive trajectory for the business as it recovers and heads into 2022. And that's probably stalled a little bit. We'll probably end up slightly below 20% from an EBITDAR perspective in the third quarter. And then, we'll see how things develop from the Delta Variant and have behavior changes in the next couple of months, as we assess the rest of the year.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you for that color. If we do start to see these vaccination requirements for inbound travel or any renewed measures reinstated domestically. Could you walk us through some of the ways that you could perhaps get agile with the network, whether that's reallocating flights or aircraft? But just what have you learned over the last 18 months of having to constantly adjust the network? And if you do have to make these changes, how perhaps you can be more efficient now into the fall versus where we were last spring? Thanks.\nBarry Biffle: Yes. Look, I mean, we're not here to speculate about the future. And I think, we all need to remember something, let's not get distracted with the Delta variant. This is a temporary issue. We always knew these things could happen. It's going to take six to eight weeks as it did in the UK, as it did in Southwest Missouri. If people enact some new things like requiring a vaccine, I actually think -- you look at the broad way and they're sold out. So everybody is worried about protecting the unvaccinated feelings. Let's start talking about the vaccinated. Vaccinated people feel better about everybody on the plane or at their destination or at their restaurant or their cruise ship they feel better about it when they know it. So, it's actually -- we believe and why we've been studying it, we believe it's actually an accelerant for demand. So I don't think you would make any long-term strategic decisions on your network just off a six to eight-week issue.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good afternoon. Could you comment a bit on through the quarter trends, particularly as it relates to load factors maybe comparing June to April or May and what July is looking like?\nDaniel Shurz: Hi, Myles, it's Daniel. We saw traffic recover sharply during the quarter as capacity continued to increase. And we saw lot of factors continue to grow during the quarter we've seen that trend continue into July. And obviously the peak of some of the peak month for summer travel.\nMyles Walton: So are you anticipating the 3Q loads to be similar to 2019 3Q loads?\nDaniel Shurz: We are not yet recovered to 2019 load factors. While we are seeing recovery, we're not yet recovered to 2019 levels.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And then maybe Jimmy, the size of the sale-leaseback gains in the quarter was it $25 million on the five deliveries? And is that a similar number that's baked into the 3Q guidance as well?\nJimmy Dempsey: I think it was a little bit less than that. But yes it's consistent. We have actually five aircraft in Q2, five aircraft in Q3. We actually have no aircraft in Q4, just to point out to all of you. And so you won't see any leaseback gains in Q4 related to aircraft. But yes, it's effectively five aircraft in the last two quarters.\nMyles Walton: Okay. All right. I\u2019ll leave here to. Thanks.\nJimmy Dempsey: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Eric Morgan of Barclays. Your line is open.\nEric Morgan: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask one a little bit longer-term on your growth plans in the context of what your fleet is going to look like in a few years. So, you'll have the larger mix of the 321s as we get to 2023 and beyond and you had the letter of intent announced today as well. So, just wondering if you could speak to how this change in mix of aircraft size impacts your growth strategy if at all, just in terms of markets you can enter and any limitations or otherwise on your ability to stimulate demand? Thanks.\nJimmy Dempsey: Okay. So, what we're expecting in terms of growth rate in the next couple of years, as I said earlier, as Hunter asked the question. In 2023 will be, just under 20% somewhere around high-teens in terms of percentages. And the way the delivery profile works in the next four or five years beyond that, it starts to slow down in 2025, 2026, 2027 and as you deliver aircraft. And we have some optionality on incremental aircraft that we could bring from leasing companies that we've talked about before and we've displayed today that we have 10 aircraft, but also the potential to extend the series of aircraft that we have that are on eight-year leases that kind of expire in the 2026-2027 period and that gives us an ability to tip some of those growth rates up a little bit. In relation to the size of the aircraft, yes, our average seats per departure, from today's announcement for example, that we -- out of 10 aircraft. Our average seats for margin 23 will go to just over 200 seats. I mean that's really positive from a unit cost perspective in the business. And it actually opens up opportunities for us in destinations around the United States that we think are interesting. And maybe Daniel you want to talk about where we place at growing aircraft.\nDaniel Shurz: Absolutely. No, thanks Jimmy. Look, we've deployed three -- we deployed our current rate 321, for example, across most of our network, we've tried in various markets. They work in big markets. They work in small markets. They bring lower unit cost. The marginal cost on the fleet as module cost and the extra seats is very low. We think -- we believe we can successfully deploy the additional 321s in almost every airport in our system. There are a few airports where operationally we have to use the 320. But broadly speaking, the 321 comply almost everywhere in our system. And we -- as the mix of our fleet continues to move towards the 321, and that's what you'll see us deploying it system-wide.\nEric Morgan: Great. Appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a follow-up from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of quick clarification questions. On the 30% growth in 2022 that was a year-over-year growth rate or year over two year? I realize it's almost the same thing, but just to get this. \nJimmy Dempsey: It's year-over-year. \nHunter Keay: Okay. Thanks, Jimmy. And then I'm sure, I know you answered this question too, but I just want to clarify the sub $0.06 CASM in 2023 that's obviously CASM ex-fuel not CASM ex-fuel and interest expense correct? \nJimmy Dempsey: Yes. Look we anticipate CASM ex-fuel in 2022 will be like slightly above $0.06 and $0.23 it will be slightly below $0.06 largely on the back of adding these aircraft into the business and also some of the things that we've learned as we emerge from cohort with the modular network. \nHunter Keay: Great. Okay. That\u2019s it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a follow-up from Chris Stathoulopoulos of Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just if you could comment on the fair dynamic that you're seeing and if there's anything notable perhaps at the system-level or specific areas of your network? Thanks. \nDaniel Shurz: Well, in brief we've seen the fare environment is improving as demand improved unsurprisingly as summer demand came in and as demand kept improving. We saw system-wide fare improvements both for ourselves, but also for the industry more broadly. And both -- and I think what we're seeing right now is we're coming towards the end of summer. We obviously see every year industry has drop-off as we head out of the summer peak into the fall shoulder. And we're seeing a bit -- we certainly a bit of promotional evidence in the last week in particular as Barry has mentioned that sort of some of those offers are getting more aggressive which we think again is also tied to the relative weakness in demand that delta is closing. Delta Variant is closing to be clear\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I show no further questions in queue at this time. Are there any closing remarks?\nBarry Biffle: No, I just want to thank everyone for joining the call today. We're really pleased with our results in the second quarter. We remain very encouraged about the business going forward, especially, as we look to 2023 when we expect to be sub-6 CASM heading to $63 in non-ticket to our breakeven fare we're targeting at $30 which we think is really powerful for our business. I just want to thank all of our employees and partners at team Frontier for helping us produce great operations and continue to get things back to normal as we get into 2022 and have full utilization again. Thanks everybody for joining the call. We'll talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

My name is Cherry, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on flyfrontier.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Susan Donofrio, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nSusan Donofrio: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Frontier's first earnings call as a publicly traded company. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call can be found on our website. On the call with me today are Barry Biffle, Frontier's President and CEO; Jimmy Dempsey, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Daniel Shurz, Senior VP, Commercial, as well as other members of the management team. [Operator Instructions] We also wanted to remind everyone on the call that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our first quarter 2021 earnings release, which is available on our website, for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. With that, I will turn it over to Barry for his opening remarks.\nBarry Biffle: Thank you, Susan, and thanks, everyone, for taking the time to attend our first earnings call as a public company. In a moment, Daniel and Jimmy will bring you through the details of the first quarter and our expectations going forward. First and foremost, we're pleased with what we're seeing in the demand for travel. The vaccine is truly unlocking the pent-up demand everyone anticipated, and bookings are getting stronger every week. We believe our focus on leisure travel, coupled with our Low Fares Done Right strategy, positions us as an industry leader in this recovery. While this has been a challenging year across the industry, we're very thankful to all of our Team Frontier members for their commitment and diligence to ensuring our successful navigation through the pandemic, and they have helped us ensure we are well positioned to succeed in the recovery. I also want to thank our union leadership as they have partnered with us on a range of solutions to help keep our employees and customers safe over the past year. One thing is certain, Team Frontier is stronger than ever as we emerge from this crisis. As we position the business to maximize the rebound opportunity, we're adding routes to both new and existing cities in our domestic network and growing our near international network footprint as well. As an example, we added leisure destinations for the summers that include Nassau, San Jose, Costa Rica and St. Maarten. These additions come on the heels of new service already introduced to Guatemala City, San Salvador as well in Central America. We've also added new nonstop routes from Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. Further, our commitment to being America's greenest airline was enhanced by the addition of 3 new A320neo aircraft added to the fleet during the first quarter of 2021. In addition to the fuel efficient engines, they were the first aircraft in our fleet to feature our new Recaro lightweight seats, which are 30% lighter than our existing seats and considerably more comfortable. We achieved significant milestones during the quarter, including executing an IPO to enhance our liquidity, becoming cash positive in March 2021 and getting our departures back to 2019 levels in March 2021. We're now focused on moving the business back to profitability in the second half of 2021 and operating at full utilization next year in 2022. Overall, there's positive energy across Team Frontier as we move beyond COVID. Our momentum aligned with the growth trajectory of the fleet position Frontier to maximize shareholder value and the recovery ahead. I'll now turn it over to Daniel, who will provide more details on our performance for the quarter.\nDaniel Shurz: Thank you, Barry, and I want to join you in thanking all of Team Frontier for continuing to take such good care of each other and our customers. I also want to reiterate how pleased we are that all our first on right travel model has resonated so well with our customers. We firmly believe you shouldn't have to pay a high price to get a high-quality family-friendly travel experience. Our low-cost model has allowed us to roll out reasonably priced unbundled and bundled options, and we continue to listen to our customers and fine-tune these offerings. This content subscriptions providing members with exclusive access to Frontier's lowest available fares continue to grow. Working with our loyalty partner, Barclays, we just launched some new offers to attract even more card members. The benefits offered by the Frontier Airlines World Mastercard have already been recognized by Money.com as the best airline card of 2021. And we were one -- among the first to initiate a variety of heightened health and safety initiatives early on in the pandemic, and we will continue to make our customers our foremost priority with respect to comfort, safety and operational performance. As Barry mentioned, we continue to increase our Caribbean and Latin America footprint. And this summer, the region is expected to account for over 13% of our capacity. We're also targeting additional new international growth over the next few years. We're also excited to be adding 5 new domestic cities to our summer 2021 schedule, including the return of Frontier service to Alaska. Now on to the trends we are seeing within our quarterly results. Similar to other airlines, our January and February performance reflected the third COVID wave across the United States and the impact of new travel restrictions. After President's Day, we saw demand for our travel improve as we moved into the spring break and Easter booking window, with a significant step-up in March demand. Operating revenues for the March quarter declined due to the impact of COVID, causing a 36% decline in capacity year-over-year, which led to a 50% year-over-year decline in operating revenues. On a per passenger basis, we saw ticket revenue declined 30% in the quarter, while nonfare and other revenue declined 19%. We saw the nonfare and other revenue remained strong overall at $52.55 per passenger, and our total revenue per passenger for the quarter was $83.38. Our capacity levels are trending at or above 2019 levels as we progress through the coming months. We're seeing a recovery in load factors as the appetite for travel continues and demand returns moving into the summer months. With that, I will turn it over to Jimmy to provide more detail on our financials.\nJimmy Dempsey: Thank you, Daniel. I share Barry and Daniel's optimism on the demand recovery we are seeing. I want to thank all of the Team Frontier members who rolled up their sleeves in challenging times during the pandemic and put Frontier at the forefront of the recovery in air travel. Our growing confidence in the recovery enabled us to begin hiring pilots and flight attendants in February and restart projects that were paused as we managed through COVID. In addition, our IPO strengthens our balance sheet and puts Frontier in a strong liquidity position, enabling us to emerge from COVID with limited incremental debt. Now turning to the quarter. Our GAAP net loss was $91 million. Our adjusted net loss of $173 million or $0.86 per share excludes a number of special items. These include $136 million of CARES Act credits, a $20 million mark-to-market related to the warrants held by the U.S. Treasury and a $4 million cost associated with the early lease termination of our remaining A319 aircraft. With respect to our revenues and liquidity position, we timed our capacity deployment as the quarter progressed to take advantage of our expectation of a recovery in air travel leading up to spring break. This enabled our revenues and cash receipts to finish the quarter on a strong note. As of March 31, 2021, we had $853 million of total available liquidity, inclusive of the $424 million of undrawn amounts under the Treasury loan facility. The liquidity as of March 31, 2021, excludes the net IPO proceeds of $265 million given its April 6 closing. Our liquidity was enhanced in April by the receipt of $96 million in payroll support funding from PSP2 and 3. We expect to receive the final payment of $75 million relating to PSP3 in the second quarter. This puts Frontier in a very strong liquidity position. As such, we are unlikely to draw further funds under the Treasury loan facility. We have a current tax receivable of $161 million that provides us with an opportunity, when received, to assess the repayment of the $150 million currently outstanding under our Treasury loan without utilizing other existing liquidity. The repayment of our Treasury loan will unencumber our co-brand credit card program and related brand assets that are currently collateralizing the facility.  We believe that our loyalty program, encompassing our co-brand credit card and discount den subscription program, together with the Frontier brand, could generate substantial liquidity should the need arise. We ended the March quarter with 107 aircraft in our fleet after the addition of 3 new Airbus A320neo aircraft that were financed through send leaseback transactions. In addition, in early May, we executed a contract with one of our lessors to accelerate the return of 4 remaining A319 aircraft from the company's fleet. 3 of the A319 aircraft will exit Frontier's fleet during the second quarter of 2021, and the fourth aircraft will exit the fleet in the third quarter of 2020. This is the completion of an early objective of the transformation of Frontier into an ultra low-cost carrier by replacing all 319 aircraft with larger and more fuel-efficient A320 and 321 aircraft. We anticipate delivering 10 A320neos and 2 spare engines during the remainder of the year, with 5 aircraft delivering during the second quarter and 5 aircraft in the third quarter. As we look forward into the second quarter and reflect on the improvement in demand, we expect our net income margin to range between minus 10% and minus 15%, reflecting total adjusted operating expenses, excluding fuel, ranging between $480 million and $490 million, an average fuel cost per gallon of $2 and an effective tax rate of 22%.  Our expectations for Q2 exclude any adverse operation impacts or fuel price spikes caused by the cyberattack on the Colonial pipeline. To close, our financial discipline and Low Fares Done Right strategy has positioned us well as the recovery strengthens the demand for travel returns. 2021 is the year that we continue to invest in the recovery of the business and position ourselves for successful growth in the coming years, with the immediate focus on getting our airline back to full utilization as we enter 2022. With that, I will hand it back to Barry for some closing remarks.\nBarry Biffle: Thanks, Jimmy. It's been a year of enormous change for our company, and we continue to thank all of our Team Frontier members for going above and beyond what was expected of them. We've got the right team in place to navigate what's ahead, along with the right cost structure and the right low fare product. With that, operator, please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: A couple of questions on the current environment as you see it. When you look at the incremental traffic that they're coming on right now, do you have any data on whether you are expanding the pie and the traveler you're seeing right now are like new to air travel, if you will? Or are you just taking share from other airlines in ULCC and legacies?\nBarry Biffle: Daniel, why don't you take this one?\nDaniel Shurz: Thanks, Ravi. I think what we're seeing right now is a pent-up return of travel in the U.S. I think we're seeing lots of customers come back to travel. And I think, as always, our low costs are allowing us to offer extremely low fares and continue to stimulate demand. And that's a combination of new customers and also key to the ULCC model, key to our model is customers flying more frequently because they can afford to do so because we deliver lower fares in the marketplace.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. Just a follow up to that, I mean do you feel like there's an environment where the ULCCs can meaningfully grow their market share and kind of close the gap to maybe the kind of share that you have in -- that ULCC have in Europe, or do you think it takes a little while longer for the market to go in that direction?\nDaniel Shurz: Go ahead. Sorry.\nBarry Biffle: Yes. Well, look, I think if you look at our share in the United States, I mean we're just getting started, right? We're at 10% of all the ULCCs compared to approaching half over in Europe. So yes, there's a lot more room ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Good job on the first quarter here, gentlemen. I guess a couple here. Barry, when you were on the road on the deal, what, 5, 6 weeks ago, I mean you were -- you had a pretty encouraging -- I mean a positive outlook. I mean trends look like that they were moving in the right direction and things seem good. And yet, here we are 5 or 6 weeks later, and yet you have a much higher fuel price, and I would argue a more favorable margin guide than I think what we saw as recently as 5 or 6 weeks ago. Is the right interpretation that things have maybe gotten even better than sort of what you were seeing 5, 6 weeks ago when you're on the road? Because it -- the guidance would suggest that it does seem like that maybe we're seeing some acceleration here. Is that the right interpretation?\nBarry Biffle: I think that's right, Mike. I mean look -- I mean I feel better today than I have probably since, I guess, last January when I first heard of coronavirus, right? And I feel better than I did yesterday, and I feel better than I did last week. Look, it's real, right? You're seeing it every day. The vaccine is slowing the cases. It's slowing the hospitalizations, and people are feeling free. I mean this last question, we were talking about stimulation. But I think what's happening is the demand is just being let loose from the vaccination. So it just keeps getting better. And so yes, we're feeling really good about the world and couldn't be more excited about the recovery.\nMike Linenberg: Great. And then just my second question to Daniel. Look, I get the whole story about getting away from the A319s. You'll have higher gauge. It's going to help your unit costs on one hand. But then on the other, I guess there's an argument that maybe it precludes your ability to fly into some of the smaller markets. And you do fly into a lot of smaller cities right now. You look at some of your competitors, and they have stayed with whether it's the A319s or even the 737MAXs in the case of Southwest. Do you think that getting out of that smaller gauge, and as your gauge moves up, that there's just going to be a whole slew of city pairs that either don't work or maybe it's a less than daily strategy? How do you think about that? Just your response to that.\nDaniel Shurz: Thanks, Mike. You're absolutely right. As we go to a lot higher gauge, we get lower costs. And we already have a strategy of applying the right frequency to the right market. We fly low frequency markets. We fly our smaller markets in general today on the A320neo, which is the bulk of our fleet today -- majority of our fleet today. And we found that worked. We fly some small markets at low frequency on the 321 and find that worked. We have the lowest cost. We are going to be a low cost leader, and that enables us to fly a lot of -- to fly as many markets as we can. And I think that's the right strategy to maximize our opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Question on aircraft leases. I know you've engaged in sale leasebacks at various lessors. But for future deliveries -- for the pipeline, do aircraft have to be sourced from the Indigo pool? I mean the order -- the big order back from 2017. Or if somebody like, I don't know, pick a name, AerCap came to you with a more attractive lease rate, could you take it?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes. Jamie, it's Jimmy Dempsey here. Yes. No, like in 2017, we were part of a joint purchasing initiative that delivered 430 aircraft into airlines in the Indigo portfolio. We contracted for our aircraft, like all the other airlines in the portfolio, separately. And so Frontier contracted for 134 aircraft. We're committed to those aircraft, and they deliver over the next kind of 7 years or so. We could look at aircraft that pop up beyond that order book like any other airline can. And if there are opportunities, we'll certainly look at it. And we are looking at potentially adding 321s -- incremental 321s to our fleet, and they could come either directly off the manufacturer or through leasing companies. And so yes, we have absolute flexibility to do that.\nJamie Baker: Okay. All right. That helps. And also second question, do you have any ability to track how much basic economy competitors are putting in your markets against you? Given the strength in summer demand, I would think that they'd be allocating less than usual, and United said as much on its call. I'm just wondering if you had a way to actually measure it and if you have any idea as to how those trends might look.\nBarry Biffle: Yes. Look, I mean I think if you look at basic economy, I think there's a lot of confusion out there. So basic economy is a product, and then there's price points, right? So it doesn't matter how much basic economy is out there. What matters is the prices that they're charging. But I will tell you, both the product is less than it was. There's less of it out there. And the price points, as -- I mean many of you report on -- I mean they're slowly moving up. I mean the demand is coming back. ATLs are filling up. Load factor is going up. It's just how revenue management work, right? The fares are going up. And so I think everybody is looking at this and realizes in the next few months, your demand is going to outstrip supply.\nJamie Baker: And if I could just sneak in a third. We're in the middle of May now. Between now and the end of June, how much inventory hasn't been sold? And how much higher would fares have to be on that remaining inventory for you to break even in the quarter? I mean are we talking $5, $50? I'm just trying to get a feel for how close you might actually get. But if you don't have that at your fingertips, I get it.\nJimmy Dempsey: Well, it's algebra. I'm sure we can calculate it real fast. I'm not sure we would disclose that.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Fair enough.\nJimmy Dempsey: But look, I will tell you, we said it in the opening remarks, we feel very confident with the trends that we will be profitable in the second half of the year and feel pretty good about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Congrats to the IPO. The -- Barry, what would you say your top 1 or 2 financial targets as you think about the next couple of years? Just running the business for the long term, would you -- is it just raw dollar profits? Would you trade a little bit of margin to drive more EPS? I mean obviously, it's a balance. But what are the top 1 or 2 of the year are going to prioritize over the next couple of years?\nBarry Biffle: Well, profitability and costs, all right?\nHunter Keay: Just raw -- yes. Just like absolute raw profit dollars.\nBarry Biffle: Well, I mean I would actually expand it, and I would say there's 1 and 2. So profitability, one; and cost, #2. But within profit, there's a 1a, which is margins themselves in those levels; and 1b is aggregate profit, which drives EPS.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Cool. And then a couple of quick ones here. When you talk about full utilization you said in your script in 2022, are you talking about you're -- at one point, you're going to hit 12.2 hours per day? Or are you actually going to average that over the course of the year?\nBarry Biffle: We expect by the end of the year to be in a position to begin and operate all of '22 at full utilization.\nHunter Keay: Okay. So you'll be exiting '22 at full utilization is what you're saying, basically?\nBarry Biffle: No, no, no. '21. We're investing today, we're investing today and -- in hiring and ramping everything up so that we can be ramped up to full utilization by the end of the year, such that 2022 will be a full operating year.\nHunter Keay: I got you. Okay. And then just a quick one here. What are your thoughts on potential PSP4 program? Is that something you would support?\nBarry Biffle: I doubt it's going to be necessary.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Could you characterize -- I'd love to hear your answer on what inning you think we're in from a leisure recovery perspective -- domestic leisure recovery. Some have suggested bookings are kind of all the way back to 2019. It feels like there's more recovery still on the table here, even in the U.S., certainly in places here like New York. And of course, part of that view is going to depend upon how folks are revenue managing. So maybe just to follow on relatedly to Jamie's question, how are you managing inventory now versus, say, this time in 2019? And how do you think the industry is? In other words, is the industry opening up more future inventory now at low price points?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. So look, I don't know what inning -- you're somewhere between, I guess, the second and third inning. And what I would mean by that, Duane, is we've started -- we started trickling bookings up in February, and they continue to accelerate through March. They're accelerated through April. We're now seeing them just continue to build. But there's another factor, right? So as the demand recovers, then capacity recovers, right? Everybody talks about pent-up demand, but there's also pent-up capacity. The good news is now you're starting to reach pretty close to 2019 levels this summer. And so you're now going to probably -- if the demand continues to go, you're going to see demand outstrip supply. And so that will move us to, I don't know, inning 4 or 5, and that's what's going to cause fares to go up and yields to go up. And that's revenue management. And so I think you probably -- you don't get to inning #7 until you get towards the end of the year. And you're probably going to have pretty aggressive Thanksgiving and Christmas just because so many people missed it last year, right? So you're going to have way more demand than you're going to have seats. As it compares to last year at this time, well, there was 0 inventory management.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Sorry, 2019. The basic point being\u2026\nJimmy Dempsey: 2019.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Exactly. Like how are you managing your inventory in May 2021 versus what you might have been doing in May 2019?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. I think we're still behind because not everyone has reflated their booking curve completely, and I think there's also still certain segments that aren't quite there. Order may be great, but certain cities aren't quite there. But I think if you look at even today, I mean just this recent announcement, if you can have your mask off in the last few hours from CDC, if you're indoors, well, that's big news. There's also now another leg of demand. You've now got 12- to 16-year-olds eligible today for the vaccine. So I think there's more to come, but I think we're still a little bit soft versus where we were, right, because the fares aren't back to where they were in 2019. But again, I think in the next few innings, if you will, call it, the next 6 to 12 weeks, you should start seeing that.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's great. Makes a lot of sense. And then just for my follow-up, I'm sure you got asked this question a lot when you were on the road. I didn't get to hear your answer to it. So I'm curious if you could share it now. Can you provide your views on industry consolidation, how likely that is, specifically in the low cost sector?\nBarry Biffle: Okay. Well, look, we're focused on profitability and starting to hit that in the second half and focused on shareholder value. And for that reason, obviously, we're leaders in the industry, and we'll look at any opportunity that presents itself. But right now, we're focused on returning to profitability.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Congrats on the first public quarter here. So Barry, I guess following up from that question and the target to be at full utilization, I think, by the end of this year, right? Are you managing towards reaching -- I mean you do have a goal of profitability in the second half of the year, but are you managing towards a certain profit target right now? Or is it just that we can be in the black in 2022 is where we readjust and focus on getting margins up? Is that the right way to think about it?\nBarry Biffle: Well, I mean yes, you've got to cross over the line and move to the black first and then you start focusing on increasing that and getting back to previously expected levels, if you will, from profitability. But like right now, we're just really excited across that mark, and we feel like we're on the eve of it, as I just kind of answered in that last question. We feel like we're on the eve of it, given the way that the demand is recovering and starting to shape up. And I think that will drive it in the second half. And look, '22 is still a ways away, but there's a lot of positive things to happen before then. But yes, we'll be focused on maximizing margins in '22.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. And Jimmy, do you mind helping us with the fleet changes that you announced? So I think you're going to take delivery of 10 additional aircraft this year. So are you going to end the fleet in the year with a fleet of like 115, is that about right?\nJimmy Dempsey: No. There's no real change in the total fleet count for the year. We're just laying out that there's 5 in this quarter and 5 in the following quarter. So 10 for the rest of the year. We'll end the year with about 110 aircraft. And just to recap what Barry said, one of the things that you got to be focused on for our business is at the end of '19, we had 98 aircraft. At the end of 2022, we'll have 120 aircraft. So the business is significantly bigger between pre-COVID and post-COVID size. So I just want to point that out. But no, there's no change to our fleet plan right now. What we did with the 319s was effectively accelerate them from redeliveries at the end of the year towards the early part of next year to remove them from the fleet now.  Clearly, we're removing fleet from storage and bringing them back into service. And our view at this stage was it didn't make a whole lot of sense to redeliver -- or to return those aircraft to full service across the summer months and suffer some of the maintenance costs associated with them. So it made sense to actually remove them from fleet early, and that's something that we did and took advantage of something that cropped up very quickly.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I appreciate that. And then I guess the last one for me. You guys did announce a couple of new international destinations. Is that looking more lucrative in the future here? Or is domestic and international kind of an equal opportunity at this point?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. Look, I mean if you look at international versus domestic over the last several years, not -- let's go prior to the pandemic, and we had seen that yields were considerably higher, and we had begun investing and going back in the '18, '19 period in the international. So as we recover, we are looking back again at making that happen. And we think the dynamics will actually be even better than pre-COVID just because of the competitive landscape and our relative cost advantage in the near international, but also just the fact that the international is being delayed, if you will, from a recovery compared to the domestic. And so when it does come back from a demand perspective, we think it's going to come back with a vengeance. So we're positioning ourselves so that we can exploit this in '22 and '23. And we think that, that really does a lot to position our revenue backdrop to be a lot stronger than even what it was before.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Let's see. When you talked about cash burn being positive in March, did that -- did you say that, that continued at that same rate in April and May? Or is it continuing at that same rate? Or is it accelerating?\nJimmy Dempsey: Thanks, Helane. It's Jimmy here. Yes. Look, we turned cash positive just as we turned into March. Really, bookings started to improve, a big change post President's Day. The airline performed reasonably well through March, and the ATL started to fill out for forward bookings. That's continued. Our anticipation is that we're cash positive through the quarter and really moving on from a liquidity discussion and back into really getting the airline back up to full utilization.\nHelane Becker: Perfect. Is there -- my next question is, is there a choice or is there a time when you would -- when it would make sense for you to switch from a fully leased fleet to a partially leased fleet and a partially owned fleet? Would you consider that?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes, we would. We talked about this a lot when we were doing the IPO. It's something that we can look at as we develop like this year, and we've chosen to use operating leases all the way across this year. We've actually 1 aircraft left to finance at the end of Q3. We can look at it in terms of how we shape going forward. It's really a commercial decision around tax, whether you have to put any equity into the aircraft and what the cash position is at the point of delivery of the aircraft. And for us, commercially, we haven't found anything that makes commercial sense on an NPV basis, like an operating -- sale-leaseback transaction for us. And so we'll continue to do it and benchmark against other forms of financing. But at the moment, operating leases make a lot of sense, particularly when you're growing the business quite dramatically like we are and not burdening the cash flow in the business with funding that growth. We have been funding a big portion of the business in our PDPs into delivering these aircraft. And so that's the focus of some of our cash flow that's over the last like 5 or 6 years has been to manage our pre-delivery payments to Airbus as opposed to managing the actual delivery itself. And so it's been quite successful for us.\nHelane Becker: Right. Right. I'm not sure it ever makes sense to own an aircraft, but that question does come up -- now. The other -- my last question is, are your aircraft ETOPS certified? And is Hawaii a realistic option for you at some point in your future?\nDaniel Shurz: Helane, it's Daniel. No, our current aircraft are not capable of flying to Hawaii with a full passenger load. And therefore, we don't -- we're not ETOPS certified as a result. There's no need to be across the business. We do have A321XLRs on order. And when they join the fleet in a few years, we will look at Hawaii, amongst other opportunities, for deployment of that aircraft. And it may become part the network at that time, but it's not a short-term possibility for the airline.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora from Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Congrats on the IPO. I guess first question, Barry, where do you think your pretax margins can go over your growth period? Is this a -- I think 2019 pretax was like 14% or so. Is this a mid- to high teens business? Or are you at some level below that? What are your thoughts there?\nBarry Biffle: Well, look, I mean when we get back to 2019 levels, we will then focus if we can make it bigger. But I think our focus right now is to just get back to 2019, and we feel good about our cost relative advantage and where that's headed. And we think that expands over the next year to 2 years. And so we feel good about getting it. And once we get to '19, then we can probably talk about if we can exceed it.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. Fair enough. And then, look, I guess when you think about the leisure recovery, clearly, you see kind of this pent-up demand environment extending into the holiday period. But when you think about kind of beyond that, do you think leisure reverts to the growth rates we're seeing, say, prepandemic? Or is there something that you're seeing or you believe in that -- you think there's some maybe more positive structural change going forward here from the leisure passenger? We'd love to get your thoughts on that.\nBarry Biffle: Yes. Thanks. So look, listen, we talk about this all the time, and all we have are a bunch of anecdotes at this point, but people are starting to form judgments and views. And look, I mentioned I think Thanksgiving is going to be the best Thanksgiving we've ever had in the industry; same thing for Christmas and same thing for New Year's. And I think you're going to see the same thing for President's Day and even spring break. By the time we get to spring break next year, there will have been some people that didn't go on spring break for -- basically, they missed 2 in a row. It's almost 3 years. So I think you're going to see the surge continue for at least 12 to 18 months until people get caught up on vacations, caught up seeing family and friends. And so I feel very good about it. And then when you think about getting past kind of the pent-up demand component that I think the last 12, 18 months, then you get to this new phenomenon of all this work-from-home that's going on, and -- which is really translates to work-from-anywhere. And we're seeing more and more people traveling midweek, changing cities and working off their parents' couch in North Carolina this week. And then next week, they're in California. And so that's just a whole new travel segment that we didn't have, plus with the additional flexibility, people can travel more. And Jimmy and I, we've debated this in the past. And when we look at carriers in Europe, like Ryanair and easyJet and Wizz and all those, when you look at the vacation that the average European has, how many days is off they have per year, and you compare that to the average American, how much we have, they literally have double -- more than double the vacation days. And so I look at what that does for us in terms of all this additional flexibility that people are going to have, that's just going to create much more leisure travel. So I think this can last for several years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Congrats on the IPO. First question for me is actually a math question. Are you implying the revenue for 2Q is down about maybe around 16% on a year-over-2-year basis, if I'm doing that math correctly?\nJimmy Dempsey: Sorry, Savi. We'll have to come back to you on the exact math on that. Like we gave you a range of outcomes of a nice income of minus 10, minus 15 and gave you the operational costs associated with that. We're not guiding the exact revenue numbers at this stage.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Understood. And then just on the comment about getting back to utilization by the end of this year, that's faster than I had anticipated, what does that mean from your ability to kind of get back to maybe precrisis trend on unit cost? And how should we think about that unit cost trend?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes. Look, our view hasn't changed since we talked about the -- or during the IPO when we talked about unit costs. There is some inflation across the industry that we had to deal with. We're very focused on our total costs. And so our CASM plus net interest, we continue to invest very heavily in the fleet, and we're very different to other airlines in terms of how we finance the airline through 100% operating leases. And so therefore, our CASM ex fuel gets slightly inflated by the fact that we pay rent as opposed to having some of the ownership costs down in the interest line. And then we get a huge benefit from the fuel efficiency that the neo aircraft is delivering into the fleet. By the time you get to midyear next year, we start delivering 321s again. And so a change in the business that has happened in the last 2 years or 3 years or so is the fact that 321s have become less than 20% of our fleet. They will actually start moving back up in terms of a percentage of the fleet as you progress beyond 2022 and into '23 and '24, and we get to about half the fleet operate as 321s by the time you get to about '25 or '26 -- 2025, 2026. Our anticipation is that our unit costs are similar to where we talked about them a few weeks ago. And there's no real change in our utilization that went into our thoughts during the IPO process. So we think we'll be on track for that.\nSavi Syth: I appreciate that. And if I might ask one last question just on -- I know business demand is not a big component, but you do carry some business, and it tends to be SME where I think the recovery is faster. Curious what you're seeing on that front and if you're seeing any improvement, along with the improvement you're seeing with leisure here near term.\nDaniel Shurz: I'll take that.\nBarry Biffle: I'll take -- go ahead, Dan.\nDaniel Shurz: Yes. Savi, it's a very small portion of our traffic. We've seen from the data we've got, we've seen a little bit of an improvement in that in the last couple of months. Yes.  Yes, definitely, it seems to be recovering a bit. We obviously don't have a lot of data on the rest of the trends in the industry. So I don't know if our recovery is any better than anyone else's. But it is a small portion of what we take. And obviously, the much bigger story is how much the leisure demand is recovering.\nBarry Biffle: I would just add one other thing to -- just on this business discussion is -- I look at my calendar, and I'm traveling almost every week for the next 6 weeks. And I'm starting to hear more and more of this. And as offices reopen -- I've joked about this a lot, but do you really think people are going to be sitting in a cube or do you think they'll go back to Marriott? And I think you will see business travel return. But in our case, it's going to be small business. It's not corporate managed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from UBS.\nMyles Walton: I was wondering if you could maybe touch on the ATL performance in the quarter. And when you talk about the recovery to normal breaking curve, should we expect that to expand towards sort of where you were in 2019 from an ATL perspective, maybe adjusted upward given the larger fleet towards $300 million by the end of the year?\nJimmy Dempsey: Yes. Myles, it's Jimmy here. Look, our ATL has been recovering. At the end of December, it hit its -- the lowest point given the seasonality but also the effect of COVID. And it's been slowly and gradually improving. It certainly accelerated in March and the run-in to spring break. And you'd expect it to recover across the year. Really predicting where our ATL is at the end of the year is difficult to do at this stage, but you would expect it to somewhat normalize as the year progresses, and there's still a ways to go on that.\nMyles Walton: Okay. Okay. And Barry, I guess in the -- I don't know who asked the question around innings, but I think seventh inning was when you put the line towards pricing has normalized to 2019. Is that -- is that sometime towards the end of the year where yields have filler -- baked in and recovered?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. I mean I think in the United States domestically, for sure. The international will obviously, I think, lag that. I think it's going to take you till probably mid-'22 or even to '23 for certain regions, just depending upon how they're able to control the coronavirus. But I think domestically, I think you should be by the end of the year. And I'll even go back to your earlier question about ATL. In the back of my mind, I'm looking towards the next few holidays and peak periods. And I think there's a risk for the consumer that they're going to get shut out of where they wanted to go or they may have to fly a day or 2 earlier or later for Thanksgiving, and that's going to cause them to book further out when they get burned. And so look, I mean when they're not able to -- it's one thing to say fares are likely to rise. It's another thing to say, well, they may not even get a fare because there's going to be more demand than there is supply. So if you're thinking about traveling, you're going to want to do it sooner rather than later. And I think when that happens this summer, they're going to start booking the holidays. And then when they get burned at the holidays, they're going to start booking the next summer and spring break. So I think you can see ATLs across the industry go up just from that phenomenon. But as far as pricing firming up, look, you got to be full before you can focus on price. And I think that takes to -- for the industry, I think that takes to the latter part of the year for all the industry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Trent from Citigroup.\nStephen Trent: Just two quick ones for me. I know you guys don't have a massive exposure to the Southeast. But given the disruption we saw with the gasoline supply in parts of the country, did you guys feel any of that in any of your operations? Or was it not really an issue for you?\nBarry Biffle: Yes. So we had some challenges. We did some tankering, but -- and -- but we didn't have to do any tech stops, and we think it's largely -- it looks like it's going to be largely resolved now.\nStephen Trent: Okay. Great news. And just very quickly, during the IPO, a number of investors were intrigued by how high your ancillary revenues are. And when we go forward, you mentioned the Barclays co-branded card and what have you. Do you see kind of additional opportunities to kind of push the envelope even further than you have?\nDaniel Shurz: This is Daniel. We -- look, we see -- we do see continued opportunity. And we're focused on ancillary on the highest profit margin with our ancillary offerings. And as the airline gets bigger, the relevance of both our credit card program with Barclaycard and our discount then continue to get better, the more customers, more routes, more opportunity to take advantage of the benefits. We're focused on continuing to work with Barclays, as we said in the opening remarks, on improving offers. And on the Discount Den, we're looking to continue making enhancements to the program to increase the value with offers, to increase the number of customers who sign up for it. It's a paid loyalty program, and it's a very good program as a result, and there's a lot of opportunity to continue to build it.\nOperator: At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over  to Barry Biffle for closing remarks.\nBarry Biffle: I just want to thank everybody for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on our next quarter. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect."}]
