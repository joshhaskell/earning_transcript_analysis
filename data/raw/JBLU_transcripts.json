[{"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 3, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-10-31 14:23:02", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Joelle. I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, [Indiscernible] Patel. Please go ahead, sir.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you, Joelle. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on our third quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning we issued our earnings release and a presentation that we will reference during this call. All of those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov. In New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ursula Hurley, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A are Dave Clark, our Head of Revenue and Planning; and Andres Barry, President of JetBlue Travel Products.

Finally, I\u2019d like to add an important note for today\u2019s call regarding our proposed transaction with Spirit Airlines. Given our trial has now begun, we will not be taking questions or commenting on Spirit beyond what is in todays prepared remarks. We appreciate your understanding and look forward to answering your questions once the trial has concluded. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue\u2019s CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I\u2019d like to start by thanking our incredible crew members for their hard work, dedication, and service to our customers. This summer, airlines faced an exceptionally high number of disruptions given air traffic control and weather challenges, and our outstanding crew members rose to the occasion each and every day to support our operation and deliver the JetBlue experience. Before getting into the results, as many of you are aware, the antitrust trial related to our proposed merger with Spirit Airlines began today. We look forward to presenting our case to court over the next few weeks, as we strongly believe our combination with Spirit is the best opportunity to disrupt the industry by increasing competition and choice, creating a long overdue national low fare challenger to the dominant Big Four Airlines. We expect the trial will proceed according to the process the judge laid out and is currently scheduled to conclude during the first week of December. Assuming a successful outcome, we remain on track to close the transaction in the first half of next year. For obvious reasons, it would be inappropriate for us to comment on any matters relating to this transaction while a judicial proceeding is underway. And therefore, as Kush [Ph] mentioned, we won\u2019t be answering any questions related to Spirit on today\u2019s call or making any other public comments while the trial is underway. Now moving to the results and slide four of our presentation. We reported a third quarter adjusted loss per share of $0.39. We planned and prepared for several challenges in the quarter, including the winddown of the Northeast Alliance, air traffic control delays, and shifts in post-COVID customer demand. However, weather-related disruptions were significantly greater than expected, and increases in jet fuel costs also weighed on results. While we are certainly not satisfied with these results, our team is working hard to mitigate these headwinds while also working to protect the customer experience. Turning now to slide five, we are updating our four-year outlook to reflect the impact of these near-term headwinds, including higher fuel prices and industry capacity that is outpacing domestic demand. We now expect a full loss per share of $0.45 to $0.65 per share. Our team remains focused on taking steps to control what we can control while identifying additional levers to deliver value to shareholders. First, with respect to weather and ATC staffing challenges, we are pleased that the FAA has extended its 10% slot waiver in New York through to October 2024, which we will be taking full advantage of. This is a critical step in affording much-needed support to a fragile ATC system. Importantly, the waiver was announced well ahead of the 2024 planning cycle, providing time to efficiently reallocate capacity, which we were not able to do in 2023. Secondly, as customer travel patterns continue to evolve, we are taking steps to better match capacity with demand. While overall demand remains healthy compared to pre-pandemic levels, inflationary pressures, including the recent uptick in fuel prices, are impacting margins in certain markets. We recently announced the closure of two blue cities and other capacity adjustments. As we look ahead, our capacity growth is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter and will be driven primarily by international markets, which have demonstrated yield resiliency this year. Finally, the NEA winddown continues to progress. We began returning LaGuardia slot pairs to American, and as we head into 2024, we plan to continue reallocating capacity out of LaGuardia as we return additional slot pairs. These changes are expected to benefit revenues and costs in 2024, as LaGuardia is one of our most expensive airports. Turning now to slide six, while we continue to face challenges in the near term, we firmly believe we have the right building blocks in place to position JetBlue for success. A large footprint in the slot constrained New York market is a key competitive advantage. New York remains our largest focus city with well over 200 departures per day, and has historically been a profit engine for JetBlue. While margins in New York have not recovered from their pre-pandemic levels as quickly as the rest of the network, we\u2019re encouraged by the continual progress we are seeing in the market. We clearly have more work to do, but our competent margins in New York will fully recover to pre-pandemic levels over time. We\u2019re also driving long-term structural improvements in our profitability from JetBlue travel products, where we have seen a 30% year-over-year increase in commission revenues for hotels and cars year-to-date. In addition, our redesigned TrueBlue program continues to be an important source of loyalty revenue, which increased as a percentage of total revenue by approximately one point year-to-date compared to 2022. Finally, we continue to deliver steady progress I should say on controllable cost execution this quarter. We\u2019ve seen great success in our structural cost program, which is on track to deliver $150 million to $200 million savings by the end of 2024. We also continue to make strides in our ongoing fleet modernization program as we benefit our E190 fleet with the margin accretive fuel efficient A220s. In conclusion, I\u2019d like to thank our crew members again, as they continue to go above and beyond to deliver for our customers and for each other day in day out. While near term headwinds persist, including the Pratt & Whitney GTF engine issue, which Ursula will provide an update on, we are focused on controlling what we can control. I am confident we have the right foundation in place to navigate the current challenges and work towards improving margins and driving profitable growth. With that, over to you, Joanna.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. I\u2019d also like to thank our team as we continue to navigate a challenging operating environment. We very much appreciate your unwavering efforts to take care of our customers and support each other. We continued to experience greater than expected operational disruption during the quarter due to unusual September weather, far worse than we\u2019ve historically seen, coupled with unprecedented ATC restrictions. In the third quarter, we had 68 days of significant operational disruption versus 40 days in the third quarter last year. Often these events occurred on multiple consecutive days, causing extended delays and cancellations in subsequent days as we recovered. The severity of ATC constraints was also worse than previous summers based on airborne holding, diversions, taxi time, and cancellations seen throughout the industry due to ATC. However, our investments enabled us to recover faster and better protect completion factor. As a result, for the third quarter, capacity grew 7.1% year-over-year. As Robin mentioned, we are pleased with the FAA\u2019s recent decision to extend the 10% slot waiver in the New York City area through October of 2024, and we are taking full advantage of it. However, given that the extension was announced after our Q4 schedules were published, this resulted in close in and therefore less efficient schedule changes for the fourth quarter. For 2024, we will be able to better plan our network, proactively address associated costs, mitigate customer disruptions, and appropriately manage our hiring plans. While the slot waiver is a good initial step, we recognize that there is still a long way to go in terms of getting the right level of staffing and experience within ATC to drive substantial improvements in their performance and minimize the number of cancellations. We expect ATC disruptions to continue for the foreseeable future, and we continue to plan the operation with conservatism and with elevated crew reserve levels. With Mike Whitaker\u2019s recent appointment, we are hopeful that we will see progress as a permanent FAA administrator can serve as a champion on these critical infrastructure issues. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting capacity to grow between a half a point to three and a half points\u2019 year-over-year, a five-point sequential reduction in scheduled capacity growth versus the third quarter of 2022. We are proactively managing our capacity in light of higher fuel costs and aircraft constraints, and have temporarily reduced flying in certain markets in off-peak periods. Our fourth quarter growth will be driven by international markets where we have seen yields holding up relatively well. For the full year, we are narrowing our capacity growth outlook to 5% to 7% year-over-year. Turning to revenues, third quarter revenues decreased 8.2% year-over-year and were impacted by the challenging operational backdrop as well as softer than expected off peak and close in leisure demand in September. Our premium offerings remained a bright spot with year-over-year Mint RASM outperforming CORE by 4.5 percentage points during the quarter. We continue to see strength in Mint, even with our Mint capacity up 19% year-over-year. All of our A321 neo deliveries for the foreseeable future will be in the Mint configuration, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our strong premium leisure offerings. We are also seeing strength in even more space with revenue growing double digits in Q3 year-over-year on roughly equivalent load factors. And we look forward to the continued expansion of even more space as our A220s have 30 even more space seats compared to 16 on the E190s that they are replacing. Transatlantic also continues to deliver strong results as we continue to ramp. This quarter we launched service to our third Transatlantic Blue City Amsterdam from both New York and Boston. And we look forward to continuing to expand our Transatlantic network as we take delivery of additional A321LR aircraft. This includes the new summer seasonal service announced last week to Dublin and Edinburgh. And in New York City, as we continue to winddown the NEA, we are rebalancing our capacity to better match supply and demand. We are meaningfully reducing our footprint at LaGuardia, reallocating this capacity to geographies with stronger performance, such as the Caribbean, where we are launching new services in the fourth quarter from Orlando to Punta Cana and Santiago in the Dominican Republic, and from New York to Belize and St. Kitts and Nevis. In addition, we are also taking full advantage of the FAA slot waiver extension to allocate capacity away from New York. These changes will drive continued improvement in our New York performance in 2024 and beyond. Looking to the fourth quarter, we continue to see healthy travel demand during peak periods. Specifically, demand for travel around the fourth quarter holidays is in line with our expectations. However, during off-peak periods, we are seeing elevated industry capacity significantly outpacing demand. That being said, we have seen an acceleration in corporate booking since Labor Day, an encouraging sign that recovery and business travel is picking back up after notably dropping off through the summer. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be down 6.5% to 10.5% year-over-year. For the full year, we now expect revenues to grow between 3% and 5% year-over-year. Finally, we remain pleased with the strength in our loyalty program, as active members have grown nearly 10% year-over-year, and member engagement has more than doubled across all customer levels following the launch of our redesigned TrueBlue program earlier this year. Co-brand card spend has increased double digits year-to-date and we expect to reach record contributions from our Barclays Co-brand portfolio this year as engagement grows. We recently introduced the ability to redeem TrueBlue points on key partner airlines directly on our website. We are excited by the growth these enhancements have delivered so far and are expected to deliver as part of our multi-year journey in evolving our TrueBlue program and closing the gap to our peers. I\u2019d like to close by once again, thanking our crew members for everything they have done to serve our customers amid a challenging operational backdrop. With that, over to you, Ursula.\nUrsula Hurley: Thank you, Joanna. I\u2019d like to add my thanks to our incredible team for their hard work and commitment to ensure we are delivering for our customers, our fellow crew members, and our owners. As Robin mentioned, we delivered a third quarter loss per share of $0.39 as we faced unprecedented levels of weather and ATC-related disruptions and rising fuel prices. CASM ex-fuel was up 5.9%% for the quarter, just above the high end of our guidance. Our proactive planning and operational investments to boost resiliency through additional pilot reserves and capacity pull-downs drove four points of CASM ex-fuel pressure in the third quarter. However, a greater number of, a greater volume of extended ATC delays versus plan resulted in higher labor premiums, hoteling and disruption-related costs, driving an incremental 1.5 points of CASM ex-fuel headwinds in the third quarter. Excluding these unprecedented headwinds, we would have delivered CASM ex-fuel near the midpoint of our guide. Looking ahead, for the fourth quarter, we are forecasting CASM ex-fuel to increase 8.5% to 10.5% year-over-year. As a reminder, the uptake in expected Q4 CASM ex-fuel includes four points related to the additional compensation step-up tied to our pilot agreement and two points related to the timing of maintenance events. In addition, we\u2019ve made a number of near-term capacity cuts to utilize the New York slot waiver. However, as Robin and Joanna mentioned, the waiver was announced shortly before the start of Q4, so many of the costs associated with that fine were already fixed, resulting in an incremental three-point headwind to our fourth quarter CASM-ex fuel. For the full year, we are raising our CASM ex-fuel outlook to up 4.5% to 5.5%, just above the high end of our prior range. This includes two points of headwinds from the challenging operational disruptions we have faced this summer and the proactive investments we made to more quickly recover from these challenges. While we have been successful in identifying levers to offset some of these incremental costs, the sheer magnitude of the ATC and weather-related delays has been staggering. Our team is continually looking for opportunities to mitigate additional costs. With respect to the GTF engine issues, we continue to have conversations with Pratt & Whitney to assess the longer-term impact, and discussions around compensation are ongoing. Based on Pratt & Whitney\u2019s initial analysis, we expect to end 2023 with up to six of our aircraft grounded due to GTF engine issues, and we anticipate the number of out-of-service aircraft to increase throughout 2024, ending the year with high single digits to low double digits of aircraft out of service. These issues are also driving an elevated number of engine changes, and despite introducing a number of self-help measures over the last 18 months, we expect our 2024 capacity plans and cost outlook to be meaningfully impacted. Given the increase in unscheduled GTF-related downtime, coupled with the aircraft delivery delays and aircraft retirements, we are planning capacity in the first quarter of 2024 to be slightly down on a year-over-year basis. With the slower capacity growth, we remain laser-focused on executing our structural cost program and delivering efficiencies. We expect to drive approximately $70 million in cost reduction this year, and $150 million to $200 million in run rate savings through 2024 under our structural cost program. We expect these savings to ramp quickly throughout 2024 as we streamline input costs for onboard offerings and ramp up our use of technology-based solutions to enhance productivity. Additionally, through our fleet modernization program, we have achieved $55 million in cumulative cost savings to date and remain on track to achieve $75 million of maintenance cost avoidance through 2024 as we replace our E190 fleet with Margin Accretive\u2019s A220. Additionally, the A220 is 20% more efficient compared to the E190 on a unit cost basis, which will be a long-term benefit to our cost structure as we transition out of the E190s. 18 E190s have already exited the fleet, and as a reminder, we continue to plan for all our E190s to be retired by the end of 2025. Turning to slide 11, we ended the third quarter with $2.1 billion in liquidity, including our $600 million revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn and which we\u2019re pleased to announce we recently extended by one year. We continue to take a conservative approach to managing liquidity as we step up our fleet modernization efforts. We have been actively financing and have committed financing in place for approximately $1 billion year-to-date, of which $600 million is reflected in our quarter-end liquidity position. We took delivery of five aircraft in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 11 new aircraft. We expect to take delivery of six additional aircraft through year-end for a total of 17 new deliveries this year, with two deliveries now pushed into early 2024. As a result, we now expect our full year 2023 CapEx to be $1.2 billion. Finally, rising oil prices have led to increased fuel prices. We continue to look for opportunities to layer in hedges to help mitigate this risk. As of today, we have hedged approximately 30% of our expected fuel consumption for the fourth quarter, which we expect to provide a $0.05 per gallon benefit to our fourth quarter fuel price. In closing, while we continue to manage through an exceedingly dynamic and challenging operating environment, we are focused on controlling what we can control and executing our plans to mitigate these challenges. We have reduced our Q4 capacity and markets will yield remain pressured. And as we trim our New York schedules, we are reallocating that capacity to merge in accretive leisure and VFR opportunities. In addition, we are aggressively focused on pulling the levers at our disposal to manage costs, including our structural cost program and fleet modernization plans. We are confident in our strategy and believe these actions, coupled with the strategic initiatives we have in place, are creating a strong foundation positioning us to drive profitable growth, return margins to historical levels, and deliver long-term value to our owners and all of our stakeholders. With that, we will now take your questions.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks everyone. We\u2019re now ready for the question-and-answer session. As we mentioned we will not be answering any questions related to Spirit on today\u2019s call. With that Joelle, please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good morning, everyone. If I might, on the kind of next tier, excluding what the earnings contribution or any merger-related spend, how should we think about some of the key cash outflows and inflows as you think about CapEx and then maybe financing and debt payments?\nUrsula Hurley: Good morning, Savi. Thanks for the question. So as a reminder, we continue to work through our fleet modernization program. So next year we do have a step-up in terms of the number of aircraft deliveries. So we\u2019re expecting 28 aircraft to deliver next year. The majority of those are the margin accretive A220. So we will have a step-up in our CapEx profile related to that fleet modernization program. We also have a manageable debt tower next year as well, and we continue to have a really healthy balance of unencumbered assets. So, the debt raises that we have done thus far this year is inclusive of not only deliveries this year, but previously purchased aircraft that we did with cash. So, I think the headline is I feel comfortable about where the liquidity number is. We do have a step-up in CapEx next year. The debt paydown is reasonable, and we continue to have a healthy unencumbered base to support a healthy liquidity level as we navigate through 2024.\nSavanthi Syth: That\u2019s helpful. And just to -- if you can provide the unencumbered assets, and I would also kind of like to ask the -- just the timing of the LaGuardia wind-down and how you\u2019re thinking about it. I know you shared plans earlier, but I wonder if that\u2019s changed given the kind of new capacity view.\nUrsula Hurley: Sure. So in regards to the unencumbered assets, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have a billion dollars of liquidity coming in the door. Six hundred of that has already hit through the third quarter, and the remaining will come in the door through the end of the year. Once we complete that cash inflow, we\u2019ll have about 50 aircraft that will still be unencumbered. And as a reminder, we have the bridge facility currently in place to support the Spirit transaction. That bridge is encumbered by our loyalty program. We have aircraft. We have engines, and we also have our slots, gates, and routes. And so once that bridge is taken out, we will also have some of those unencumbered assets fall back into the portfolio that we could use in the future to raise additional liquidity. And I will hand it over to Dave to answer the LaGuardia question.\nDave Clark: Hi. Good morning, Savi. For LaGuardia, we\u2019d flown as much as 52 departures a day at the height of the NEA. We handed back six slot pairs as we entered the winter season here, so we\u2019re about mid-40s in terms of departures per day from LaGuardia as we go through this winter. And then in late March, we\u2019ll step down to roughly 30 per day and continue that pace through next summer.\nSavanthi Syth: Very helpful. Thank you for all the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nDaniel McKenzie: Oh, hey. Good morning. Thanks guys. Just kind of looking at the stock here, there\u2019s a lot of skepticism. I\u2019m just hoping you can help us understand the path, and the timing back to profitability. Maybe not necessarily in 2024, but, say 2025. And so I guess high level, can you just help us size the hit to pre-tax profits, say from the slower than expected recovery in New York City, the ATC cancellations and the Pratt & Whitney engine issues? It just seems like there\u2019s a huge chunk of revenue, huge chunk of costs that at some point, go away. And just, how can we size that?\nUrsula Hurley: Yes, thanks for the question, Dan. I mean, our goal is to get the business back to consistent profitability. And we believe that we have specific tailwinds to JetBlue that are going to come to fruition as we navigate through 2024. The New York recovery has been slower than we anticipated. However, we continue to see meaningful progress in New York profitability levels. We still need to get them back up to pre-COVID levels, but we\u2019re seeing progress. The 10% slot relief obviously provides us meaningful runway to redeploy capacity to more margin accretive opportunities. The second issue is ATC. And as I mentioned, the slot portfolio reduction of 10% allows us to plan more effectively as we build the 2024 plan. And so that will definitely provide some relief from a cost perspective. And then our continued execution of structural costs in our fleet modernization program. We\u2019re still in the very early stages of our fleet modernization program. We\u2019re about a third of the way in. And so that will continue to deliver meaningful value given the A220 provides a 20% unit cost benefit compared to the E190. And then I\u2019m pleased with the structural cost program progress. We\u2019ve achieved $70 million a date. And our 2024 plan will assume that we achieved $150 million to $200 million commitment that we made. So on the whole, I believe we have the right foundational pillars to bring the business back up to consistent profitability.\nJoanna Geraghty: I\u2019ll also add just loyalty and JetBlue travel products. Those are continuing to expand with profitable growth. And I think you could expect, one to three incremental points of margin tailwind as we move through 2024 to 2025. And then just to kind of reemphasize Ursula\u2019s point on New York, New York is progressing nicely. It\u2019s not back to where it was pre-COVID. And pre-COVID, it was a margin engine for JetBlue. It will get back there. It\u2019s a constrained environment. And over time, we think it\u2019s strategically an important, incredibly important part of our network and our efforts here.\nDaniel McKenzie: Yes. And I guess to that point, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a second question here, if you\u2019d be willing to address the credit card competition act of 2023. And so I guess maybe this would be for Robin. We are seeing other CEOs predict that these, the programs would go away. But I\u2019m wondering if you can elaborate what that would mean for JetBlue. Is, and I guess, just in particular, is this revenue that would necessarily disappear? Or I guess, how should investors think about this at that, think about that at this point?\nRobin Hayes: Yes. So thanks for the question, Dan. And in case everyone isn\u2019t aware of the issue, this is a proposal to basically bring more competition into the interchange space so that merchants have an alternative to either Visa or MasterCard to process the transaction. It\u2019s really a follow on to the -- what we saw on the debit card side, 2010. Personally I think that this is likely to continue to face a lot of opposition. The majority of Americans have a reward card, whether that\u2019s a travel card or another sort of benefit. And that would be lost if this act passes because the, the, the value of those consumer benefits come through that, that interchange network. And so, the argument goes that price reductions would get passed on by retailers to consumers. I think there\u2019s a healthy level of skepticism whether that would happen. I think it\u2019s, it\u2019s far from clear that there were benefits to consumers when we saw the debit card changes back in 2010. And frankly, if consumers want the cash option, there are plenty of 2% cash back cards available now that they can go and get. So whether it\u2019s kind of cash off or whether it\u2019s travel, whether it\u2019s hotels or airline or these travel cards, these are very, very popular. And I think that, if this thing progresses then I think members of Congress across both sides of the aisle will hear a significant number of complaints from their constituents, because these cards are popular and they make vacations and they make other things more accessible for people than they would be otherwise. And I think people want to keep the benefits rather than see them be passed to big box retailers who, could decide just to keep the profit for themselves. So I\u2019ve got a great level of skepticism as to whether this would pass.\nDaniel McKenzie: Okay, thanks for the time, you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Oh hey, good morning, everybody. So obviously lots of talk about air traffic control, weather and oversupply and all that, but one thing that Mark and I have been thinking about is the remuneration from your credit card partners, from loyalties. So if we tie loyalty back to earnings, and if we think about your margins relative to just pick one, Delta or United, and I know Joanna talked about closing the gap, but do you have an internal estimate as to how many points of margin differential loyalty might currently be driving?\nRobin Hayes: Yes hi, Jamie. Look it\u2019s clearly a margin gap for us, right? I mean I think all these airlines report sort of roughly what their percentage of revenue is, and then if you assume that the margin on these programs are high, it\u2019s definitely, it\u2019s definitely single digit, low single digit percentages of difference. This is why actually, we\u2019ve been so focused on not just building our travel, build our own loyalty program to sort of play catch up, but also creating JetBlue travel products. We know that we do not have the same exposure to business travel as some of these global leisure airlines, and so how do we gain more exposure, more share of wallet for leisure customers as well? And so our goal over time is to get to a point where our JetBlue travel products and our loyalty program together can be the point where they can compete for what I\u2019d call a legacy airline type margin. So that\u2019s the road we\u2019re on, Jamie. We\u2019re not there yet, but we\u2019re I think, making really good progress.\nJamie Baker: And thank you, Robin. And as a follow-up to that, you\u2019ve talked about loyalty as a means to fund the business, particularly if you do find yourself, hypothetically, with greater leverage a year or so down the road. Spirit and Hawaiian Loyalty is now trading north of 20%. I guess, how are you thinking about loyalty as a funding option going forward? Do you need to identify some contingencies in terms of funding potential?\nRobin Hayes: Hey, Jamie. I think we\u2019re just going to kick that question to following the trial, not really addressing any of the Spirit-related questions today on the call.\nJamie Baker: Well, it had more to do with leverage than Spirit, but fair enough. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Could you speak a little bit to the puts and takes as you think about the cost structure in the 2024? It seems like maintenance is going to be up a fair bit. You have the flight attendant deal, but you also have some self-help initiatives. Just curious on how you\u2019re thinking about it in the context of you\u2019re talking about 1Q capacity being down your rear. It just seems like CASM ex is starting to track up year-over-year for 2024. Just curious on how you\u2019re thinking about it now. Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, thanks for the question, Connor. So maybe at the highest level, JetBlue typically is targeted mid to high single digit growth rate and then flat CASM ex-fuel. That profile is going to look different next year because of aircraft delivery delays. We have GTF aircraft that will be grounded, and also we\u2019re continuing with the E190 retirement plan. And so the growth profile will look different. As you mentioned, capacity will be down in the first quarter, slightly down year-over-year, and we\u2019re still working through our 2024 planning assumptions. You should assume that we will pinpoint CASM ex-fuel to be competitive compared to where we put, depending on where we put capacity. The headwinds, which we\u2019ve always known about, is maintenance next year, just given the aging fleet, and also continued pressure on labor, right? And just the inflationary environment, which is consistent with what others have been seeing. We obviously have another pilot step up in August of next year. So those are the headwinds, but those are really the reasons whereby which we put in place the structural cost program. And so the structural cost program is meant to offset some of these headwinds. So working through the planning process, you can expect us to have a competitive CASM ex-fuel number next year once we pinpoint capacity.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then on premium products, are you needing to discount those in the current environment? The reason why I ask is you\u2019re seeing a sequential deceleration, versus 2019, from 3Q to 4Q, and I would have thought that maybe even more space would have protected you a little bit. Is that, I think you called out four points of RASM benefit from Mint. Is that continuing into 4Q? Just curious on how those products are specifically holding up. Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. Thanks. This is Joanna. A great question. Yes. We are really pleased with how well premium continues to hold up, and we would expect those trends to continue into the fourth quarter. As we mentioned in the scripted remarks, as you look at next year, we\u2019re actually taking all 321s in the Mint configuration, and the 220, 190 retirement will be going from 16 EMS seats to 30 EMS seats. So we\u2019re very pleased with the strength that we are seeing in the premium sector moving forward.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Lindenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nShannon Doherty: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Shannon Doherty on for Mike. Just a quick one. We are hearing that the GTF engine inspection requirements are not based on aircraft manufacturer dates between mid-2015 and mid-2021, but rather the production and the timeline of the contaminated parts, which could be spilling into newer aircraft deliveries. Can you confirm this? And at this point, do you think that your A220s are going to be affected by this issue?\nUrsula Hurley: Thanks for the question. So Pratt has given us an initial assessment of JetBlue\u2019s exposure. So we highlighted on the call today we\u2019ll have up to six aircraft grounded by the end of this year, and then that will increase as we navigate through next year. So we\u2019ll end next year with high single digits, low double digit number of aircraft on the ground. So in regards to your specific serial number question, so on the PW1100, so that\u2019s the A321 aircraft, a service bulletin is coming out imminently. And that\u2019s important because it will give a very detailed view of serial numbers and it will solidify what we believe to be our exposure in 2024 and beyond. In regards to the 1500, the majority of our engines were manufactured post-2021. We have a very small amount of engines that were manufactured pre-2021. And so I think that\u2019s what you were referencing in terms of the handful that are pre-2021 are going to need full part replacements. We do have a view on how the A220 PW1500 will impact us next year, and that is built into the mid or high single digits, low single digit number by the end of next year. It\u2019s very small compared to the A321 aircraft in terms of exposure. So hopefully that helps.\nShannon Doherty: Yes, that is. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks, Ursula. And we saw that you pulled eight percentage points of capacity growth in the March quarter schedules over this past weekend. Was that driven by the anticipated acceleration of the groundings? Or was that a demand-driven cut, maybe something that you\u2019re seeing in the off-peak period before spring break or something? Thank you.\nDave Clark: Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Dave. Thank you. The Q1 2024 capacity cut is driven by aircraft availability constraints. So largely, the engines and the delivery delays. And we expect that to remain the case throughout 2024.\nShannon Doherty: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey thank you. Can we talk a little bit about the revenue outcome, capacity up 7%, revenue down 8%. Obviously, you\u2019re taking some steps on capacity into 4Q and into early next year. But maybe within domestic, can you speak about relatively stronger versus weaker markets within the domestic entity, how does your Latin RASM compare with that domestic decline? And obviously, many of these NEA changes were forced on you without much lead time and I guess, over time, you\u2019d be able to plan for that a little bit better. Can you quantify how much the NEA wind-down acted you in the quarter?\nDave Clark: Sure. Thanks, Duane. This is Dave. I\u2019ll take that. So clearly, it\u2019s been a challenging environment as we\u2019ve seen demand sort of transition out of the domestic space in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis while at the same time, a lot of capacity was coming in from the industry. Where we\u2019ve been reallocating capacity out of and have seen, I think, the most acute demand challenges have been in some of the shorter-haul markets in some of the business markets. So we\u2019ve really focused there to right size that capacity to the new reality in those markets. The corporate side continues to recover for us, but it\u2019s still well below about 20% below the revenues of pre-COVID. Latin continues to be pretty resilient, and we\u2019ve been growing there and traditionally have done extremely well there. And then some other places like Florida has a lot of industry capacity right now. Demand is healthy. We have no concerns there, but it\u2019s a bit, I\u2019d say, temporarily pressured by industry capacity, which should, I\u2019d say, absorb over time. But we\u2019ve really been focused on the places where we\u2019ve seen demand roll out and making sure that we\u2019re aligned. With regards to New York City, the NEA for the first -- for the third quarter was about a one-point headwind. We did have a partial quarter there as we didn\u2019t terminate until late July. So we did have some sales for the quarter. It grows to about two points this quarter, which we expect to be the biggest impact and then starts to get better next year as we can allocate more capacity out of New York City and take advantage of the redeployments we\u2019ve done recently.\nJoanna Geraghty: I\u2019ll also add on transatlantic. Also some very strong performance there. 140% ASM growth with flat year-over-year RASM and I think you see some of the moves we\u2019re making in terms of Dublin and Scotland trying to take advantage of that leisure seasonal flying.\nRobin Hayes: Yes, Joanna, you had the honor of having all three of us to answer a question. I think that what we\u2019re trying to be very -- it is very easy to reallocate capacity in this industry. It\u2019s very mobile, it moves quickly. And sometimes things become hot very quickly and everyone moves towards it and then ends up being oversupplied. And so what we\u2019re trying to do is kind of be very thoughtful around not just sort of the immediate trends that we\u2019re seeing now and some of the commentary. But what do we think kind of sits behind that because the really good news for us is the new slot waiver, which we know about now means that we can be much more considered about these changes rather than sort of having to pull latest short notice, order of [Indiscernible]. We\u2019ve got the cost embedded in the business, not really an opportunity to efficiently redeploy that. It\u2019s a very different chessboard we have in front of us for 2024.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thanks for those thoughts. And just for my follow-up on 2024 CapEx. It looks like you have a contractual delivery table and then some footnotes with kind of likely deliveries. Simple question. Does the aircraft commitments CapEx of roughly $2.2 billion reflect your contractual or likely deliveries, a very long-winded way of asking you what your total CapEx will be next year?\nUrsula Hurley: So there\u2019s definitely a difference between our contractual commitments and what we\u2019re planning. So we\u2019re planning to receive 28 aircraft. However, the CapEx number you referenced is ballpark where we should end up.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And what would we add to that $2.2 billion? What would your total be?\nUrsula Hurley: It will be slightly less than that. Actual commitments are higher.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. I just wanted to dig in on New York a little bit more. Now you have the advanced notice of the slot relief in New York this upcoming summer, how should that impact profitability? And I guess, longer term, do we need to get back to full ability to fly your New York slot portfolio was like pre-COVID operational reliability for those New York margins to recover. I guess, how do you think about getting back to 2019 margins on a system basis without a New York recovery -- full New York recovery? Is that possible?\nJoanna Geraghty: So we do expect a full New York recovery. It\u2019s just a bit slower than I think anybody would have hoped. But if you look specifically at JFK, for example, we\u2019re really pleased with the progression that JFK is making. In terms of the operational impact in ATC, our hope is now that there\u2019s an administrator we\u2019ll see even greater focus on how to ensure that New York is staffed appropriately from an air traffic control perspective. And that\u2019s a couple of years in the making. It takes a little while to fully bring on staffing, but we\u2019re hopeful that with the slot waivers, that\u2019s not something that\u2019s sustainable. And at some point, the underlying issue has got to be addressed in a more thoughtful way. And so making sure that we\u2019re prepared to take full advantage of that with the slot portfolio that we do have here. It\u2019s constrained that\u2019s a good place to be, particularly when you\u2019re a leisure carrier, and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing New York fully return. But it will take a little while to get there. But on pace for probably, call it, 2024, 2025.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Got it. And then how should we think about the puts and takes between aircraft on the ground, increasing over the course of 2024 against aircraft deliveries. It sounds like we should stay tuned for official guidance. But just high level, is down slightly year-over-year in the first quarter? Is that the high watermark with declines getting deeper through year-end? Or just anything high level on where year-over-year capacity goes from 1Q? Thanks.\nUrsula Hurley: Yes. So I think the first quarter is probably close to a representation. I mean, just to put a high level, right, we take 28 deliveries next year. We\u2019re retiring 24 and then we\u2019ve got grounded aircraft due to the GTF. So in the mid -- the high single digits to low double digits. So that progresses throughout the year. So we start with six at the end of this year, and then that will end the year at low double digits. So I think that the first quarter is a fair representation. We are still working through our 2024 planning process. So we\u2019ll obviously provide you more color on the next call.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning everyone. So Robin, just seems like a lot of the capacity hold down that you talked about on the call is coming from like external factors in the GTF slot extensions at JFK. Can you speak to maybe some of the more proactive capacity adjustments you\u2019re making? What markets make the most sense for your product now? I know you\u2019re looking at moving capacity to international markets, but what are the real structural changes you\u2019re considering right now to kind of help the margin profile going forward?\nRobin Hayes: I said I\u2019m going to start and then hand over to Joanna and Dave. I mean we\u2019ve actually been extremely proactive over the last couple of quarters in reallocating capacity. Clearly, we\u2019ve seen the strength in international that others have seen. We just don\u2019t have as much exposure to it. But I think we\u2019ve got to be really thoughtful around what trends do we see into 2024. If everyone starts pulling domestic capacity, and that\u2019s some of the commentary has been made, we could see a bounce back to domestic much more quickly than we think, and then you may have too much exposure to international. So the team is kind of constantly reallocating and moving things around. And we\u2019re going to continue to do that. I think the other thing that\u2019s going on with our fleet renewal is that with the 220, there\u2019s a broader set of markets that would work compared to 190. The 190 historically had some range considerations and the 220 remove that as well. And so that also creates the opportunity of redeploying outside some of the shorter, more business markets that have sort of been really served by the 190 into sort of more leisure-focused markets as well. So I don\u2019t know if you, I don\u2019t know, Joanna or Dave, you want to sort of...\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll just add on the leisure front. I mean, I think as you look at JetBlue overall, knowing that this is our core bread and butter and what we were built for. We\u2019ve got the point-to-point network. We have the product offering that covers an array of customers who want different things from a more basic unbundled product to a premium product and then our strength as we see it growing sort of the premium sector. And then you look at that overlaid with being in these constrained environments, whether it\u2019s Boston with gate constraints, or JFK, Newark in places like that. We\u2019ve got a network over the long term that should perform very well in these leisure markets and a product that also perform as well. And then you wrap that with loyalty and just with travel products creating that leisure ecosystem, over time, we expect it to produce some nice results. We\u2019re just in a more challenging environment right now as we navigate through this quarter into next year with some of these external headwinds facing us around engines and excess capacity in some of the leisure markets.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I know you mentioned corporate travel has improved, and sorry if I missed this, but can you quantify that quantify the corporate travel improvement? And is this more of a New York comment? Or are you seeing it more broadly across your network? Thank you.\nDave Clark: Sure. This is Dave. So corporate travel has had a very nice step up since Labor Day. We\u2019ll admit it had sort of softened over the summer and appear to be a seasonal thing that happened at beginning of the summer and then it bounces back to the end. But if you look at, say, since COVID, if you look at our best 7 booking weeks since COVID started 3 to 4 years ago, 6 of them in the past 2 months. So we\u2019ve seen a real nice pickup here. I mean in terms of personal recovered, we\u2019re still sort of 80% or low 80s, but we are seeing that sequential improvement also seeing some areas like media and entertainment, which has seen some softness over the summer with strikes picked back up in the fall. So feel good about how we\u2019re progressing on the corporate side, but still feel it\u2019s largely in steady state, and we\u2019ll just grow sort of with the economy going forward.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Helane Becker with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Hello, hi everybody. Thanks very much for squeezing me in here. So I just have a clarifying question. I have two questions. One is, I think, Ursula, you mentioned competitive CASM ex. Can you just say what competitive CASM ex means?\nUrsula Hurley: Yes. I think we\u2019re obviously going to have a much lower growth profile than we have historically. And so if you look at competitors\u2019 performance at a lower growth profile, I would envision us being in that same realm. Again, we\u2019re still going through our planning process for 2024. But I guess you can expect us to ensure that we\u2019re building a plan with a CASM ex that is competitive based on the growth rate that we pinpoint compared to historical competitor performance.\nHelane Becker: Okay. I think that\u2019s helpful. And then just my other clear question. On corporate, where you\u2019re talking about New York being slow to come back. Actually, can you parse out how many a way, is there a way to parse out trips that are just one day, like are those the ones that aren\u2019t coming back versus trips that are two or more days?\nDave Clark: Yes, thanks Helane. So certainly, yes, we\u2019re seeing the most pressure on the short-haul day trip market, and we\u2019re seeing that in our network and sort of the global data seems to be indicating that in other parts of the world as well. And that\u2019s one of the places we\u2019ve been rightsizing is on those sort of day trip markets, keeping still a robust schedule, but some places we\u2019re hourly. We\u2019re now sort of hourly when it counts at the key times a day and then every couple of hours, the rest of the day. So that\u2019s certainly been our experience to sort of the hall of the sorts going to come back.\nHelane Becker: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Trent with Citi. Please go ahead.\nStephen Trent: Good morning everybody and thanks for squeezing me in. And thank you very much for taking my question. Just one clarification here. I appreciate a lot of this whether stuff is out of your control but you mentioned taking some steps to try and ease the disruptions. And could you just give a little color if that was adding crew bases or doing something in your schedule, maybe AI in your flight scheduling or something? Would just love to hear that. Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. Yes, I can speak to that. So a few things. I think number one, how do you make sure the day is more resilient. You do that by ensuring you have adequate reserves in place, whether that\u2019s pilots or in flight. And so we\u2019ve done that. I think the good news is we\u2019re getting smarter about how we do it, so it\u2019s more efficient. But for the foreseeable future, we will have additional reserves in place during peak and summer periods to protect the operations so that when you experience long delays and crews bump up into their hours limit, we can replace them. That\u2019s kind of the first thing. We\u2019ve also gotten, I think, much smarter around how we think about the day, so AI tools that can enable our system operations team better plan today, and we\u2019re in the process of introducing a number of these. So one example, when you have lengthy delays and long air traffic control initiative that can be longer to fly from New York to Caribbean, for example. And so you may protect that flight by double crewing it. We want to make sure if we double crude these things, we\u2019re doing it in the most efficient way, so we save costs. So we\u2019re getting smarter about making decisions on which flights to double crew and which flights not to double crew by way of example, also how you cascade the lease through the day and making sure that we understand when we do see aircraft control delays earlier in the day that cascade through the day. We\u2019re making smart decisions on what flights to hold on to versus what flights we may want to proactively cancel. We\u2019re not there yet, but well underway in terms of building tools to better enable our team to make decisions day of as we address this more challenging operating environment that JetBlue operates in.\nRobin Hayes: And if I could just add to that. I do think that -- we\u2019ve got a whole sum of experience to look back on and really partner with the FAA, who are absolutely committed. We have a new administrator who is the perfect person for the job in Mike Whitaker. And whilst the staffing challenges won\u2019t go away, we can accomplish a lot by mitigating. Now we\u2019ve got the 10% slot waiver. It\u2019s been done ahead of time, which is terrific. We\u2019re -- JetBlue is going to continue to advocate may not be enough or 10% should be mandated. 10% should include international carriers. Now this is our view. Ultimately, the FAA is the final decision-maker on that, but we can advocate for our perspective. And also as the summer went on and as the airlines and the FAA kind of built sort of ways of working to do with these issues, we saw better performance overall as well. And so I think we -- a whole year nearly to [indiscernible] his team do and give a better job. When we kind of -- at more things on time, out revenue from ad and post business quickly, if you\u2019re protecting [Technical Difficulty] impact . So we\u2019re going to continue to -- it\u2019s our really number one operating priorities to kind of improve, try and make sure next summer is better than this summer.\nStephen Trent: Many thanks Robin, you were breaking up a bit there, but I think I got the gist of what you were saying. And thanks for the time.\nRobin Hayes: Operator, can we move to the next question? Operator, can you hear us? Operator, if you can hear us, we are -- we can go ahead.\nOperator: I\u2019m so sorry about that. Your next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Karan International. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Thank you this is Susquehanna International. I\u2019ll keep it to one question. It\u2019s been a long call. So Robin, I want to go back to your comments you made around this chessboard as it relates to thinking about your network for next year, Ursula spoke about reallocating capacity to margin-accretive leisure and VFR markets. I\u2019m curious where those are. We\u2019ve heard from another competitor that sort of the plan here. It doesn\u2019t seem that there\u2019s sort of areas that are perhaps untapped and kind of looking at some of these more leisure-focused destination capacity as it stands today is up double digits. I realize you had a midpiece here, but trying to square that away with how, for instance, the travel products might kind of fit into all of this. So is this sort of a wholesale we look at geography or kind of fine-tuning, just would love to hear some your thoughts there on this...\nRobin Hayes: Yes, I\u2019m going to Dave to maybe pick that up. Thank you.\nDave Clark: Sure. Thanks, Chris. This is Dave. As mentioned before, we\u2019re increasing our mix of leisure even more heavily as we reallocate out of some of the shorter haul business, but we feel very confident in our ability to compete and win. I mean these are the markets JetBlue was founded to and designed to serve 23 years ago. These are the markets we had in mind. We built our loyalty program when we updated it earlier this year to introduce things like tiles like you have increasing customers, even more rewards and more incentive than they get through other loyalty programs. It fits right into our JetBlue travel product, which is designed provide a holistic experience and drive a lot of ancillary revenue. It goes with our point-to-point network, it goes with our customer service. So we have our six focus cities in our leisure focus, and we\u2019re going to compete hard and we\u2019re going to win in those markets. And of course, there\u2019ll be tweaks around the corner or around the edges, and we\u2019re doing that very actively with -- we had about a dozen markets we\u2019ve closed or announced closure over the last two months. We\u2019ve closed two cities. But for our bread and butter for Florida and the Caribbean and Transcon, we\u2019re going to fight, and we\u2019re going to win market.\nRobin Hayes: Yes, I think the point yes, just -- I mean, the point I was trying to make as well is that obviously, the industry far data we have is historic. We see short-term sort of trends. It\u2019s also trying to kind of get ahead of that and think through what markets may be -- there was lots of commentary last week about Las Vegas. And so there\u2019s now so much capacity to get put out of Vegas, Vegas becomes a stronger pro forma gain. So -- all I\u2019m saying is we\u2019re trying not to just respond to what\u2019s in front of us, but be thoughtful and think through what are the things we need to do that more closely aligned with our strategy to drive margin recovery. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be focused on and more news to follow as we get into next year. But I think that the message for 2024 is going to be capacity constraints because of the engine issues and the delivery delays we have. And so we want to make sure we\u2019re flying the most margin accretive markets given those constraints.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Please proceed.\nRobin Hayes: And that concludes our third quarter 2023 conference call. Thanks for joining us, and have a great day.\nOperator: And again that will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-08-01 15:11:04", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Lara.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's CEO. \nRobin Hayes: Thanks [Krish] and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by offering a resounding and heartfelt thank you to our 25,000 crew members for their incredible dedication, patience and perseverance. I've been at JetBlue now nearly 15 years and this is the most exceptionally difficult summer that I can remember and our crew members have worked tirelessly to serve our customers as air traffic control challenges and weather issues have affected tens of thousands of flights industry-wide. Our crew members have gone above and beyond in helping our customers deal with this summer's problems and we very much appreciate their efforts every day but especially during this very challenging period. For the second quarter we delivered revenue and cost performance within our guided ranges. I am particularly pleased that we delivered all-time record quarterly revenues including record revenues in each month of the quarter as well as our sixth consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding our cost expectations. As a result we reported adjusted pre-tax income of $236 million, adjusted pre-tax margin of 9.1% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.45 which was at the top of top end of our guidance range. These strong results demonstrate our momentum in this post-COVID era. Turning to Slide 5, on our first quarter earnings call in April we predicted the summer would be very challenging. To prepare we made significant investments to build resiliency into operation which helped us to manage costs related to unexpected scheduled disruptions and enabled us to deliver our second quarter results. We also received the very disappointing NEA decision during the quarter and have been working to adjust to the loss of that agreement. And finally as you've heard from others the transitory shifts in post-COVID customer demand are also affecting our results. Therefore as we look ahead we've recalibrated our expectations for the remainder of the year. While the current environment is extremely dynamic we are executing plans to offset these challenges as we'll discuss. Firstly and as previously disclosed we made the difficult decision not to appeal the unfavorable NEA court order. This allows us to turn our full focus to our combination with spirit which we believe is the best and most effective way to increase competition in the industry and bring the jet blue effect to more customers across the country. However our decision to terminate the NEA will result in a near term drag on margins as we lose key co-chair revenue. But certain NEA costs will linger due to the necessary gradual wind down of our NEA driven capacity growth. We expect a $0.20 to $0.25 EPS headwind to our full-year outlook and we expect to see the biggest impact in Q4. As we head into 2024 we will be able to mitigate the impact as we are increasingly able to redeploy capacity currently underperforming in NEA markets to high margin leisure opportunities throughout our network. We've already begun to reflect this initial capacity redeployment in our selling schedules and we are planning an orderly but gradual wind down of the NEA driven capacity growth through next summer to ensure that we continue to support our customers. As I mentioned, we are facing headwinds from weather and ATC in the northeast which have been much-much worse than we planned for when we reduced our New York departures by 10% for this summer and we are seeing ATC programs stay in place longer than we've ever seen before for similar weather events. Which is driving hundreds of delayed flights a day for JetBlue alone. To put it in perspective when we look at the FAA's data on the worst industry cancellation events for thunderstorms at JFK the worst four events since 2014 happened in late June and early July of this year. And while we don't know what the ATC impacts will be in August we have assumed that they will be similar to July. These real-time disruptions generate cost pressures beyond our initial planned investments and also impact revenue due to higher cancellations which drive refunds and reduce sellable capacity. Taken together we expect ATC constraints through Q3 to result in a $0.20 to $0.25 headwind to our full-year EPS outlook. Our Q2 results though do show the investments we made are making a difference as our June completion factor in New York outperformed the average of other airlines with a more significant footprint in the market. But it is coming at an incredible cost that is not sustainable over the long term and as we are pulling all the levers under our control to help drive improvement. As we look to next summer while the wind down of the NEA driven growth in New York will help reduce our northeast exposure we wouldn't also need to substantial improvements in ATC performance and additional industry slot relief to ensure we can deliver the operational experience our customers deserve. Finally, we've seen a greater than expected geographic shift in pent up COVID demand as the strength in demand for long international travel this summer has pressured demand for shorter haul travel. We estimate the shift away from domestic travel is negatively impacting our full-year EPS by $0.15 to $0.20. However we expect this trend to improve as we move out of the peak summer travel period and into Q4 particularly around the winter holidays when demand typically favors VFR travel which is not as susceptible to these shifting trends. As we head into 2024 we will be more aggressive in redeploying capacity to expected pockets of future demand areas where our VFR and leisure orientation give us an advantage in the marketplace. Given these revenue headwinds we are updating our full-year earnings outlook to $0.05 to $0.40 of EPS. Let me be clear we are not satisfied with this change and as I've described we are taking action on all of these issues. I also want to emphasis that our first that our full-year unit cost outlook remains intact as our team has been successful in offsetting the incremental costs associated with these challenges. We consider the coming quarters a reset as we adjust for the loss of the NEA and for the overall shift we and others are seeing in post-COVID demand. Over the longer term we continue to believe we have the right building blocks in place and we remain laser focused on rebuilding our earnings power and adding incremental value for our shareholders. Moving to Slide 6, I want to spend a few moments reviewing these building blocks for the positioning JetBlue for long-term success. First and foremost is the transformational nature of our planned acquisition of spirit. Combining with spirit will not only turbocharge our organic growth plan creating a truly national low fare challenger to bring more competition to the industry but it will also add geographic diversity to our network which will improve our network relevance and increase our operational resilience. We look forward to bringing more of JetBlue's low fares and award-winning service to more customers and more markets. Next a large footprint in the slot constrained New York market is a substantial long-term asset for JetBlue and even as we wind down the NEA New York will still remain our largest focus city with well over 200 departures per day. While New York was significantly impacted by COVID and therefore has taken longer to recover it has historically produced long above system average margins and is now improving faster than our network average. The closing of the gap will drive continued improvement of our red venue and margin performance. We're also driving long-term structural improvements in our profitability from our redesigned TrueBlue program which continues to see double digit membership growth and of course JetBlue travel products. Finally, we continue to deliver outstanding progress on cost execution. We have seen great success from our structural cost program which is on track to deliver $150 million to $200 million in savings by the year end 2024. We also continue to make strides in our ongoing fleet modernization program as we replace our E190 fleet with the margin accretive A220s. I'd like to close by again thanking our crew members for delivering our second quarter results. While we face near-term headwinds we remain focused on controlling what we can control and work towards improving margins and driving profitable growth. I remain optimistic about our future as our unique combination of low fares and great service continues to distinguish us in the market. With that over to you Joanna.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you Robin. I would also like to thank our crew members for their continued commitment to our customers as we navigate this difficult operating environment, although the summer has proven challenging your hard work is making a difference. Through early June we saw nice operational improvements year-over-year. Our completion factor and on-time performance were middle of the industry and we were beginning to see improved productivity. However as we stepped into June despite meaningful structural investments including substantially more pilot and in-flight reserves, more spare aircraft and more improved SSC tools in addition to our 10% schedule reduction in the New York area airports it was still not enough to overcome the combined weather and more restrictive ATC programs. Of course we know how to manage extreme weather conditions and are performing as well as others in the northeast during these events but the sheer number of these events and their duration is among the most challenging that we've ever seen. Our teams are doing an excellent job navigating this environment and our investments are enabling us to recover more quickly. This in turn allows us to better protect completion factor coming out of these events. However the factor remains our network exposure to this challenged geography is the highest in the industry. Turning to Slide 7. Sorry Slide 8. For the second quarter of 2023 capacity grew 5.8% year-over-year around the midpoint of our guidance. This capped a strong first task in which we delivered a three-point year-over-year improvement in our completion factor and a six-point improvement in our on-time performance. Our strong operational performance in the first half of the year helped offset the more than half a point of adverse impact from the severe ATC led restrictions beginning in mid-June. While our proactive operational investments and anticipation of a challenging environment this summer enabled us to mitigate 30 days in a row of irregular operations during the months of June into July they have not been enough to overcome even greater challenges in July which reduced our July completion factor by four points. We are assuming a similar level of operational disruption will continue in August and now expect third quarter capacity to be up 5.5% to 8.5% year-over-year. We'd like to thank our colleagues with the FAA for the close partnership and transparency as we work to plan for the operation on challenging ATC days and better understand what is behind decisions to implement severe ATC restrictions on certain days. While we are not alone and expect these delays to ease in the coming years as the FAA works rebuild staffing and experience to more appropriate levels our northeast centric footprint makes us disproportionately exposed to these challenges. Turning to revenue, in the second quarter we grew revenue by 6.7% year-over-year above the midpoint of our guidance range and driven by strength in Latin leisure, VFR and transatlantic demand. The demand environment remains healthy overall characterized by double digit growth in RASM compared to 2019. Our transatlantic service in particular has performed extremely well and driven the strongest year-over-year revenue of all geographies in our network. We look forward to continuing to diversify geographically by expanding our transatlantic network and later this month we will launch service to our third transatlantic blue city Amsterdam. We expect to continue on this path in the coming years as we take additional deliveries of our A321LR aircraft. We also continue to see healthy demand across much of our domestic networks however the demand recovery in our largest market of New York City while showing sequential improvement continues to lag that of other geographies in line with the area's slower economic recovery compared to the rest of the country. This slower recovery coupled with our NEA driven capacity growth and reduced schedule flexibility due to slots has pressured our New York margins. While the gap is improving our New York margins are still lagging 2019 levels by high single digits. This is a sharp contrast from the rest of our network which exceeded 2019 margins during the second quarter. To be clear we do have many attractive opportunities and will redeploy capacity into these higher performing geographies as we unwind our NEA growth in New York. As we head into the third quarter we continue to see many of the same trends including strong demand during peak periods however during off peak periods we are now seeing demand trends normalize. This contrasts with the same period last year when we saw extremely strong pent up COVID demand across our entire network during both peak and off peak periods. As a result while low factors remain very strong we have seen fairs normalizing back towards 2019 levels. In the third quarter we expect revenues to be down 4% to 8% year-over-year. In addition to the revenue pressures from the NEA unwind process, ATC challenges and demand shifts to long haul international travel we are also cycling against a very difficult revenue comparison. As last year in Q3 we delivered revenue 23% above 2019 levels more than double the industry average. For the full year we are now forecasting revenue to be up 6% to 9% year over year. Finally our loyalty program is an area of continued strength as loyalty revenue hit a record level of 21% year-over-year in the second quarter and continues to become a bigger piece of our revenue story.  In the second quarter, we relaunched our redesigned TrueBlue program which offers even more ways for our customers to engage with us and earn points. And we saw double digit year-over-year increases in active members, enrollments and CoBrand acquisitions. CoBrand spend had its best quarter ever and we expect to reach record contributions from our Barclays CoBrand portfolio this year as member engagement continues to grow and as we continue to expand our loyalty ecosystem. We're excited by the growth these enhancements are delivering as part of our multi-year journey in evolving our TrueBlue program and closing the gap to our peers. I'd like to close by once again thanking our crew members for everything we have done to serve our customers in very stressful situations. While we are facing near-term headwinds amid a challenging operational backdrop we are focused on taking action and pulling all levers at our disposal to minimize the impact to our customers and to our crew members. Together we will build a better and stronger JetBlue for all stakeholders. With that over to you Ursula.\nUrsula Hurley: Thank you Joanna. I'd like to add my thanks to our crew members for all their hard work and dedication. Our second quarter results are a testament to the impact their efforts are having on the operation and on the cost side. Turning to Slide 10. As Robin mentioned I am pleased that this quarter marked the sixth consecutive quarter where we met or exceeded our quarterly cost guidance. In outcome, I am particularly proud of given the increased cost pressures we faced as we navigated an exceptionally challenging operational environment in June. Specifically the second quarter faced one point of CASM-EX fuel pressure from the significant investments we made across our operation to boost resiliency as well as an incremental one point of CASM-EX pressure as the ATC challenges we faced in June were more severe than expected which resulted in lengthier delays, increased cancellations, and a lower completion factor. Despite these headwinds our team's laser focus and execution enabled us to deliver second quarter CASM-EX in line with our expectations as our investments to enhance operational planning and build resiliency into our schedule successfully enabled us to exert greater control over variable costs such as label premiums and disruption related costs. We also continue to successfully implement our structural cost program supporting efforts to mitigate cost pressures related to maintenance and rents and landing fees. We remain on track to drive approximately $70 million in cost reduction this year and $150 million to $200 million in cumulative cost savings through 2024. We expect structural cost program savings in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024 to be driven by three main areas enterprise planning initiatives technology-based solutions aimed at enhancing frontline productivity and maintenance optimization of our midlife aircraft. Additionally, we continue to expect our fleet modernization program to generate $75 million of cost savings through 2024 as we replace our E190 fleet with margin accretive A220s. We have already achieved over half of the expected savings from this program with 12 E190s retired to date including seven currently parked and five that we have sold. Looking to the third quarter we are forecasting Chasm Ex-fuel to increase 2.5% to 5.5% year-over-year. As Robin noted unwinding the NEA will result in a law in a near term drag on margins as the cost benefits will lag the immediate loss of co-chair revenues. As we gradually redeploy our NEA related capacity and optimize our schedules for this new normal we expect to see a corresponding improvement in cost. For the full year, we remain on track to execute on our chasm x-fuel target of up 1.5% to 4.5% despite an additional 1.5 points of Chasm-Ex headwinds for the full year from the ATC challenges versus our original expectations. We are seeing exceptional cost headwinds but we are working hard to find offsets and to ensure we are delivering on the cost guidance we've set out at the start of the year. As a reminder our full year cost outlook implies a step up in year-over-year Chasm-Ex in the second half of the year primarily driven by two factors an additional step up tied to our pilot agreement which is about three points total year-over-year in the third quarter and four points in the fourth quarter and the timing of maintenance which is about two points of year-over-year in the fourth quarter. As Robin mentioned, we now expect to generate earnings per share between $0.05 and $0.40. This is not an outcome we are satisfied with and I want to reiterate that we are taking action to offset these temporary headwinds as we work towards restoring our long-term earnings power and delivering profitable growth for our shareholders. Turning to slide 11 we closed the second quarter with $2.4 billion in liquidity including our $600 million revolving credit facility which remains undrawn. We continue to take a conservative approach to managing liquidity as we step up our fleet modernization efforts. We have been financing recent aircraft deliveries and have committed financing in place for approximately $550 million year-to-date of which approximately $300 million was raised in the first half of the year. We took delivery of four new aircrafts in the second quarter and one in July bringing our year to date total to seven new aircrafts. We expect to take delivery of 12 additional aircrafts through the end of the year for a total of 19 new deliveries this year. Finally, we continue to look at hedging opportunities to manage risk. In the second quarter, we took advantage of renewed price weakness to layer on some additional protection for the fourth quarter of 2023 and as of today we have hedged approximately 30% of our expected fuel consumption for the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 12, our updated earnings outlook reflects the near-term headwinds we are facing. The NEA termination, ATC constraints and a temporary shift to long haul international travel this summer. However, we are not standing still. We are focused on controlling what we can control and executing our plans to address these challenges. On the revenue side, we are leveraging the strength of our network to shift capacity from New York in the near term where we can. On the cost side, we remain acutely focused on pulling every lever at our disposal, efficient utilization and planning, technology upgrades, fleet modernization, and our structural cost program. And we are also working closely with the FAA to identify solutions to help ease disruptions next summer. Despite the headwinds I'm optimistic about the trajectory of the business. Our team\u2019s ability to continue to execute under these very challenging circumstances coupled with the spirit combination puts us solidly on a path towards creating significant long-term value for our owners and all our stakeholders. With that we will now take your question.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thanks everyone. Lara we're now ready for the question and answer session. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nMike Linenberg: Yes, hey good morning everyone. Two here. Can you just -- how many of your A321 NEOs with the GTFs are potentially subject to the issues that that fleet is now facing? And is there any risk that this is an A220 issue as well? Just your thoughts. Really it's very early so you may not have much information on it but whatever you can [speak] then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Good morning Mike thanks for the question. So we have had two A321 NEO aircrafts on the ground for the last few months due to various engine issues. We have been notified by Pratt & Whitney over the last few weeks that we have a handful of engines that will be impacted and have to come off wing by mid September. So we expect the number of aircraft that we have on the ground through the end of the year to approximately double from what we have today. And as a note, we did not include any of that impact in our guidance today, given that we're still assessing the longer-term impact with Pratt & Whitney. In regards to the A220, we're still working through a potential, if any, impact on that GTF engine with Pratt & Whitney.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, if I could just add, this is Joanna. So we are trying to take whatever self-help measures are available to attain additional engines on the leasing market, but as you know, that supplies is pretty constrained at this point.\nMike Linenberg: Great. And then just my follow-up is, as you wind down the NEA, obviously the schedules will change, but when I do look in the forward schedule going all the way out next year, it does seem like you are planning to operate, or at least in the schedule, that a good amount of additional LaGuardia flights. Is that the plan, or are we going just see everything wind down and you'll be back to, I don't know, it was about a dozen departures a day from LaGuardia? Just any insight you can give on that, if possible. Thanks for taking my question.\nDave Clark: Sure, thanks Mike for the question. This is Dave. With regards to the NEA wind down, we've already made some initial adjustments in Boston, where we don't have to work through slot issues and constraints there, so we've been able to move a bit more quickly. On New York, we have a plan coming together, but have not yet changed it in our selling schedule. Just as a reminder, LaGuardia, we flew before the NEA 16 round trips a day for LaGuardia. That went up to 52 during the NEA, so an incremental 36. As we go into this winter season, you'll see us step down by about a handful of flights in LaGuardia, and then next summer, so beginning in the mid spring for the summer season, you'll see us flying less than half of those 36 growth round trips with LaGuardia. So it'll be an orderly wind down that takes the first step down late October this year and second step down in late March of 2024.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie from Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, good morning. Going back to the script and the commentary about having the right building blocks in place for better earnings power, you referenced some of the moats that JetBlue has, but one, are they enough to get the airline back to 2019 margins, I guess, first? And then secondly, how quickly can you turn things around? Is it reasonable to assume we can get close in 2024, for example, all sequel?\nRobin Hayes: Yes, I'll take that. Thanks, Dan. It's Robin and good morning to you. I think when I think about our progress against 2019, on the revenue side, I think that quarter two was very important, because we were, other than New York. We were above system margins, 2019 system margins, and all of our other focus cities. And so, the ramp up in New York is extremely important to our recovery to 2019 margins. And whilst this summer has been a significant setback for reasons that we've described, we were continuing to see recovery in New York. And I believe as we go into next year, we're going to continue to see that recovery. So, I think overall, the New York recovery has to deliver as Dave and Joanna mentioned, or one of the -- Joanna mentioned earlier, I'm sorry, the fact that we have such a strong presence in New York, even post NEA in a slot in the environment, we believe becomes a tailwind at some point. Then on the other revenue side, I think continuing rolling out of the revenue initiatives, very pleased with TrueBlue, very pleased with JetBlue travel products. One of the areas that's been constrained with our fleet delays is Mint. I'm pleased to say that the airplanes that we're now taking from Airbus the 321s are main configured airplanes that we can catch up. That continues to be part of our business that's not performing. I think continuing to develop more geographic diversity, I think is important. So, you're going to continue to see ramp up to European markets next year very, I mean, other airlines have talked about how strong Europe is. We're seeing that too. We just don't have very much of it. And then on the cost side, I'm really pleased with the progress on the structural cost program. This is a different JetBlue two years ago. And the fact that we can take the punches that we're taking both in Q2 and Q3 around very, very significant operational costs and headwinds. I mean, when you are flying one day schedule with hundreds of flights that are running significantly late due to ATC programs, and you have -- a lot of that flying has to be recruit, we're absorbing all of that. And so, I'm very confident that continuing execution on the structural cost program is underway. And of course, the last thing I mentioned, Dan, is the fleet transition. This has been a much longer fleet transition than we would like. But, 2024 is game time. We take the most to 20s next year. We retire most 190s next year. And by the time we get to end to 2024, we really be left, I think with maybe a dozen 190s that would then sort of start to retire by summer 2025. So we're really now getting into that part of the fleet transition that other airlines have demonstrated is a significant tower wind to unit cost improvement. So overall, I think we've got the right building blocks in place. We do have some challenges to work in the near term. We do have actions to take to mitigate some of the challenges in the near term. And that's what we're doing.\nDan McKenzie: Yes, very good. And then I guess for the second question here, the full year revenue guide implies a pretty strong reversal of revenue trends in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And you guys did touch on that in the script a little bit, but I want to be just elaborate a little bit more. What is it that snaps back in sort of a seasonally weaker quarter?\nDave Clark: Hi, Dan. Thanks for the question. This is Dave. It really ties to the timing of these three big headwinds we've called out. Two of them improve markedly as we head out of the third quarter into the fourth. So first with ATC, we expect that entire impact to be limited to the third quarter. And we're expecting no ATC impact in the fourth quarter. So that's a full three plus points of revenue in the third quarter that dissipates before the fourth. And then secondly, the geographic shift is much more pronounced in the summer, especially as Europe's in their peak season. As we head into the winter travel, we expect a point or more of improvement as we go from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of that geographic demand shift. The one piece that does get worse, is the NEA headwind will grow from about one point, a bit more than one point, but roughly one point in the third quarter to two points in the fourth quarter. And that's just getting the full impact of sort of the ramp up. Since codes share sales turned off in late July, we did get a partial quarter in Q3. And then that will begin to improve with the capacity to redeploy as we go through the winter and into 2024.\nDan McKenzie: Thanks for the timing, guys.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. Just on -- it looks like you're only expecting about 30 of the kind of 60 contractual kind of aircraft next year and GTF issues seem to be continuing. I was just kind of curious what your early thoughts on 2024 capacity are? And if you'd still lean a little bit more international or how you're thinking about it?\nUrsula Hurley: Thanks, Savi, for the question. It's still really early given the fluidity of Airbus and the Pratt & Whitney conversations and evolutions. So contractually, we technically had over 40 deliveries expected in 2024. Our current planning assumptions are using 30 deliveries and that does not include any impact to the recent GTF issue. So, we are still working with Airbus and Pratt & Whitney identifying 2024 impact. And as Robin highlighted in one of his answers, a good portion of those deliveries are 220s, but also Mint configured aircraft to help support our European aspirations. So, more to come on 2024 capacity. There's just a lot of puts and takes right now. Obviously, we strive to the mid to high single digit and we'll continue to work with our partners to refine what we think that growth rate will be.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. Thanks, Ursula. And just if I might, on the New York region commentary, is that more of a kind of -- is that more short haul business markets that are lagging? Or I was just kind of curious if there was any kind of smoking gun or whatever that's driving the slower recovery in New York margins versus the rest of the system? I was curious how much your business demand has recovered and if that's driving it. \nDave Clark: Yes Hi, Savi. This is Dave. Great question and you're spot on. We're seeing the largest impact in terms of revenue recovery in two areas. One is the business markets which are recovering much more slowly than leisure. And second is short-haul. So a short-haul business market sort of the most impacted type of market. And obviously we fly some of those, and then the industry flies some of those and has been redeploying some capacity out of those and into other leisure markets that have competitive capacity to us. So that's sort of the general type of market that's most at risk. And whether it's something we fly or a competitor is redeploying capacity out of it into our markets. We feel the impact both ways.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning everybody. So when you think about more aggressively redeploying capacity to expected pockets of future demand, your words. I mean, that's pretty much what Southwest is also planning to try. And I suspect we may hear something similar from Frontier and Spirit. I realize your networks aren't carbon copies of one another. But if everyone is trying to optimize their network and shifting capacity to peak days, I mean, does that factor into your expected returns? I'm not saying you shouldn't try to optimize. I'm just thinking if everybody tried the same thing, well, then that really doesn't drive much optimization\nDave Clark: No, it's a great question, Jamie. This is Dave. A couple of things. One, we think about not only what's underperforming and what is performing better today, but then we think a lot about what our natural sort of model advantages are, our business model advantages are versus these other carriers. So for example, we know JetBlue as well, especially on longer haul flying because the onboard product is excellent and certainly far superior to the ULCC. So, as we redeploy, we not only think about current capacity, but competitive capacity and how structurally advanced we are over the long-term.\nJamie Baker: Okay.\nRobin Hayes: And I think, Jamie, to give you an example, we touched on Mint a little bit. Mint continues to perform very well, and it's both the front of the airplane and the back of the airplane. And what we haven't been able to really do in the last year or two is add any Mint capacity, because those airplanes have really not been coming at us in any volume and the ones we've had have been flying to Europe. And so, I think we expect next summer to be a very strong seasonal, another strong European summer. We think Transcom will continue to perform sort of with both the Mint franchise and the products at the back of the airplane. And again, I think that New York, New York flying is going to have to look different. But New York is coming back and will continue to come back. And those are markets, of course, because they're slot constrained are going to be tough to get into. But also we don't know what the FAA is going to have to do next year on New York slots either. I mean, as there was that 10% slot waiver this year, if you want Robin's personal opinion, that was not enough from what we've seen. And so, how should we think about New York capacity going forward in terms of total industry capacity as well? So I feel really good that given the number of airplanes that we have, we have a lot of good options. But I take your point, everyone's going to be looking for that pot of gold, but we're going to focus on our plan and improving our network returns.\nJamie Baker: That's helpful, thank you. And obviously, part of JetBlue's challenge is market concentration, the exposure in New York. You talked about this in your prepared remarks, Robin. And the merger will obviously help with that. But just for argument's sake, if the merger doesn't close for some reason, have you started to develop a plan B, which I assume would include trying to find an additional hub or focus city, somewhere else, presumably not in the Northeast?\nDave Clark: Yes, Jamie, look, how I'd answer that is we're very focused on getting the spirit deal done. It is our number one priority. It's going to a turbo charge organic growth. Having said that, and the next team, network team is always looking at opportunities that might be out there. And they've done that in the past. They'll continue to do that.\nJamie Baker: Okay, thank you very much, gentlemen.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. So just that, I guess, historically, you've targeted sort of that mid to high single digit type of capacity growth. When we think about the continued unwind of the NEA, I think you said it goes through sort of next summer. Does that, does it change your growth expectations for 2024 at all? And just as a follow up to that question, based on your answer to that question, I guess, what are the puts and takes on CASM-EX next year, particularly as the additional pilot flow through any color there would be helpful? Thanks.\nDave Clark: Sure, thanks, Andrew. This is Dave. I'll start it off and then kick it over to Ursula. In terms of the NEA wind down, given the strength we're seeing in our non-New York geography, as mentioned in Q2, our non-New York flying significantly outperformed 2019 in terms of profit margin, we feel good about our redeploy options and sort of the larger ability to properly deploy the fleet. So from that perspective, no impact on 2024 capacity. Obviously, as Ursula mentioned, delivery schedule engines, ATC, those things may have an impact, but from a pure customer demand perspective, we feel good. Over to Ursula.\nUrsula Hurley: On the CASM-EX side, so as we ramp down the NEA, you will start to see some CASM relief in 2024, depending on how quickly and at what rate we ramp down. We're going to, as Dave mentioned, redeploy that capacity and obviously the average rent and landing fee across the country is typically lower outside of New York. So you will see some benefit there. In regards to the pilots, so we actually have a step up in pilot rates here in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2023. So in the third quarter, it's a three point impact to CASM-EX and a four-point in the fourth quarter. Those obviously will impact one age of 2024 and then we'll lap it in the back half of next year.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catherine O\u2019Brien from Golden Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey, good morning everyone, thanks for the time. Maybe just a bit of a follow up to Jamie's question. So on the leisure routes you're reallocating to, are these routes JetBlue has historically served and had to pull down to feed the NEA? If historical JetBlue, how has the competitive landscape changed since you last served them or maybe it hasn't? And then, or are there some new markets? I'm just trying to get a sense of how we can expect these routes to ramp versus system performance? Thanks.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, thanks. This is Joanna. So it's a combination of routes we previously served but also new routes exploring some of the seasonal markets, really refining our day of week flying as well to target specific demand pockets that may be there for vacation and high peak periods. So it's a combination of both.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Got it. And then -\nDave Clark: Yes, I think, what I'd say is just what I'd be, is that historically, leisure markets have ramped up more quickly and we know that there is a, many months a year, there is a demand that can't be satisfied. So I think the question is going to be in terms of some of the off-peak capacity. And in a world where corporate travel is 20% down, how do airlines sort of meet that off-peak need? And I think it's far broader than network. I think it's resourcing strategy. I think it's maintenance planning. I think there's a whole number of things that in a world where business travel may not be coming back, we're going to have to work through and think through and just rest assured that we have a lot of actions on focus on that area. So it's far broader than just network in terms of how we manage these off-peak periods.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Got it. Super interesting. And maybe just, the last FAA outlook on air traffic controller headcount, I saw, it didn't show a big improvement anytime soon. Just given your geography in a more constrained operational environment and the investments you've had to make to deal with that, should we expect the headwind you're pointing to in the slides, I think the entirety of your 2.5% to 5.5% year-over-year growth for the full year driven by that. Is that just part of the base now? And like into next year and going forward? Or, we got to wait until there's more air traffic controllers or do you see a pass to any release into next year? Thanks.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, let me, I just want to make sure I'm answering the right question. I don't know if you're talking about capacity on CASM in terms of what's baked into the. - \nCatherine O\u2019Brien: CASM-EX.\nJoanna Geraghty: CASM-EX, yes. You should expect that we will continue to carry an elevated number of resources as we go into the summer. You should think of air traffic control sort of through the lens of high volume and convective weather. So summertime is when we see the most challenging time. That abates in the fall and it abates in the winter. So, in terms of the longer term trajectory, it will improve. It just won't improve in the next couple of years. There are a few things that were focused on what the FAA. They've been a very collaborative and transparent partner this summer in terms of collaborating with us and letting us know when there are staffing challenges going into events. But what that has translated to is longer events and more restrictive events. And that has impacted obviously, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, July completion factor by four points. As you think about the other things that we can do to help mitigate some of the near term challenges given our exposure, additional slot relief next summer is going to be something that we're working on with the FAA. Obviously, the sooner the better on that slot relief, because it will enable us to pull costs out. The way the slot relief came in this year was too close in and we'd already hired pilots and in-flight and we just kind of reabsorb those in as additional operational protections. But if we can address the slot relief earlier, that will enable us to pull capacity more efficiently. And then we're going to have a smaller footprint in LaGuardia next summer as we think about stepping down the NEA. And so, that should provide some relief as well. And then hopefully with Spirit, that will help us diversify the network longer-term out of the Northeast in New York more quickly.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: All that color is super helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. It's Helane. Just a question on the weather-related issues. They've been getting worse every summer for the past decade. And I heard your answer to Catherine's question about ATC and I appreciate that. But as you think about whether in three of your biggest markets, Boston, New York and Fort Lauderdale, how should we -- how should you think about adjusting capacity for summer months to not get into a situation where you're continually having 30 days in a row of irregular operations? And then the other question I have unrelated a little bit is I'm just kind of trying to figure out when you figured out that Europe was going to be the strong place this summer, because as part of the Northeast Alliance, you should have seen where your passengers, the passengers you were putting on American flights were going. So kind of trying to rationalize this to Europe being so strong, yes, but shouldn't you have seen it?\nJoanna Geraghty: Hey, Helane, I'll grab those and then Robin might have some additional commentary on the weather as he's been spending quite a bit of time studying it on the weekends. So, in terms of capacity reductions in the Northeast to address potentially more challenging weather environments, as a reminder, New York is slotted and so reducing capacity without FAA relief is going to be a challenge for us. And as we've mentioned New York was an incredible margin producer for JetBlue pre-COVID. And so, New York continues to be a very strategically important part of our network. And even in the face of weather, we need to operate within that environment. We know weather, it has been worse this summer, but in terms of the magnitude of the challenges, this really requires the FAA to continue to pursue its plan to hire more controllers and also address the inexperience issue during COVID, as we know they lost a number of experienced controllers. And so that plays into events on the weekends when weather typically hits. And the FAA has done a number of things over the last few weeks to try to address that experience gap issue. So that we hopefully can avoid some of these more restrictive programs when you have weather that, maybe slightly worse than year's prior, but not the magnitude that we're seeing this summer in terms of the restrictive ATC programs. And then with regard to Europe. As you think about last summer and our revenue performance last summer, demand was incredibly strong in our domestic and our Caribbean franchise, our belief was that some of that would come out and we addressed that in how we planned the year, but that some of it would actually spill over into this summer. If you remember, April, we had a very strong Easter break, we had a very strong spring break, and we believe this summer we would see some of the extra COVID pent-up demand play out for those customers who were limited in being able to fly last year because fares were higher and capacity was more limited. Obviously that hasn't played out quite as we expected, but hindsight's 2020. And while they're all in Europe and Asia this summer, we expect that to cycle through as well just as that extra COVID pent-up demand we saw last summer cycles to a different geography this summer. Robin, I don't know if you want to answer this.\nRobin Hayes: Yes, Helane, the other point I would just add on the demand, what we've seen is. I'm going to give you some examples. I mean, markets like New York, Nantucket, Masters Vineyard and markets like that have always been extremely strong performers for us in the summer. People look at the ATC environment, they look at the weather and they drive and get on the ferry. And so, I think these things are also to a certain degree, commingle. So, people may take less trips or they want to do one trip and it's a longer trip. I think Joanna's point, I mean, the demand, I mean, there's a lot of people traveling. Our load factor today is well into the 90s. So it's not a -- it's not that people aren't traveling. It's just on the domestic system, as you know, the fairs this summer have come in lower than I think everyone in the industry had expected. I mean, on the weather that you asked, I mean, we have a team of meteorologists. I think we are really good at this, given how important it is to JetBlue being so focused in the Northeast. We spend time, and actually we work with a company called Tomorrow.io, which was one of the original JetBlue Ventures investments that we made as well. And it's been amazing to see how their business has evolved over 10 years. But, we look at various measures in terms of the synoptic analysis, the participation, the surface analysis of pressure. And there is no doubt that the conditions this year have set us up, at least for July, for a more challenging environment. Having said that, it still compares in terms of severe weather, 2016 was worse. So it's been worse in recent years. However, as Joanna said, it's not just the weather. We are seeing -- when weather comes in, we're seeing programs earlier, we're seeing them lasting for longer. You look at LaGuardia last Friday night for anyone who was flying, I think we had 50 -- there were 50 industry airplanes out there, and it gets very challenging to recover from those events, and then it bleeds into the next day. So, I think we made a good call on the amount of disruption that we would see this summer. What we underestimated is the ATC impact to these weather delays. And again, Joanna stressed important point, the FAA, they accept the challenge they've got. They've been extremely collaborative. There no one is interested in finger pointing. People just want a system that works. That's what we want to. And I'm confident that as we get to 2024, whatever, however we do it, whether it's more controllers, whether it's different work resources, whether it's slot waivers again, that we have to get as an industry, an FAA, to a better operating solution for the flying public. And at JetBlue, we will be vocal in making sure that that happens.\nHelane Becker: That's really helpful. Thank you. Well, hopefully we get a budget. And I think it was actually 61 planes at the peak last Friday night at LaGuardia. But thank you. Thanks for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just taking a step back, can you remind us how much of your revenue and your capacity touched the NEA at peak? And is there any potential fleet implication here? In other words, could some of this capacity get parked or will it all be transitioned to markets away from New York and Boston?\nDave Clark: Hi, good morning, Dwayne. This is Dave. I'll take that. As noted, we are very exposed to the Northeast and concentrated there. Our New York and Boston is 75% to 80% of our capacity just to sort of put it in terms of order of magnitude. So it's the vast majority of what we do. As mentioned though, we see certainly opportunity for redeploy. We've already started to execute that and we'll be continuing to execute that over the coming period. But with the non-New York part of our network driving above 2019 margins in the second quarter, we feel confident that we've got a number of good options to redeploy this capacity into. So don't expect it to impact the overall level of capacity but certainly the geographic deployment of airport.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I guess not the 75 to 80 that needs to be redeployed but what percentage touched the NEA specifically if you have there. And just for my follow-up, can you remind us what JetBlue committed to with respect for labor to be able to implement the NEA. Was there a rate bump specifically tied to that?\nRobin Hayes: Yes. So, there was, I would say that was before the last extension that we did. So, to a certain extent not sort of in the past line because that kind of just kind of where we started from and thus where we got to. And that was for the pilot group. Another thing I just wanted to add to what Dave said is that a lot of the La Guardia flying that we talked about getting redeployed is those is short stage flying. So, what you're going to probably see is that get deployed to longer stage market, 190s are disappearing, A220s are arriving. So, you're going to see a stage engage bump on that. So, it might be like a larger number of flights being redeployed to a fewer number flights in stage, and the flights is going to go up. So, it\u2019s not and from an ASM perspective it won't be that material, it will be from a sort of New York flight count and exposure to flight per flight cost in New York and the ATC issues that are obviously per flying New York.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I appreciate the thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Trent from Citi. Please go ahead.\nStephen Trent: Good morning, everybody. And thanks for taking my question. Most of them have been answered. But I was curious if you wouldn\u2019t mind providing any color on what sort of competitive dynamics you're seeing south bound into the Caribbean and Latin for example we hear for instance a carrier called Arajet that recently started and I'm wondering to what extent you guys are bumping short shortages with them, thank you.\nUrsula Hurley: Yes thanks, I'll take that. I think in terms of industry capacity, there's most certainly industry increased industry capacity into Latin and Caribbean. But it's also a market that tends to be quite resilient. I mean, as you think about last summer and just a sheer volume to pent up demand and to go to some of these VFR market, will most certainly seen that translated into summer. That's what our capacity has largely been more up that capacity for domestic but up in the Latin leisure market. In terms of competitive new entrants and what not, I think JetBlue as a strong franchise down there, we do Latin and VFR traffic very well, we do leisure very well. It's sort of our bread and butter and one that we will continue to grow and redouble our effort with that segment.\nStephen Trent: Super, I appreciate that. And actually there's one quick follow-up to the Duane Pfennigwerth's question one. You're thinking about the shift from E190 stage A220s I believe are definitely going with a bit of a bigger plan. But should we also assume that you'll also be maybe getting rid of some of those smaller destinations or have those routes that were adequate for E190s 20 years ago having now kind of split up to accommodate larger gigs flying. Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Yes, thanks Stephen, it's a great question. All the cities we serve today with the E190 can be served with the 220 from sort of operational perspective. And from a demand perspective, we believe the same. So, I would not expect a new market exit as we go through the transition.\nDave Clark: And I'd just add. I think and once have here the reduction in some of that TrueBlue business line which being and one recognizes and send a we'll do from the trips that we used to do and don\u2019t do now, but the ones most on the pressure. To a certain extent that coincided with the replacement of the 190s with the 220s, and the 220s the course, and can but do it a lot more mission in terms of length than the 220 -- the 190. So, I think to a certain extent that as we whether this was the NEA or not, we may be looking to redeploy from business market into other market -- the 220, as you give this much more flexibility to do that.\nStephen Trent: Okay, very helpful. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, the maintenance step up in Q4, I'm just wondering does that continue into '24, I'm just no you said for first half of pilots and we get some benefit from NEA coming down. But just overall, like do you see a pass to CASMx being down next year?\nUrsula Hurley: Thanks for the question, Scott. In regards to CASM ex-fuel for 2024, a meaningful input to that is the actual capacity growth expectations which I kind of highlighted earlier, it's pretty fluid given the airbus delivery delay as this well is Pratt & Whitney. So, if we were targeting mid-to-high single-digit, capacity the goal would be to deliver flattish CASM ex-fuel over the next few years. Specific to your question on Q4, this is just the timing of maintenance spend and specific to the year-over-year comp. we have highlighted that maintenance will continue to be a headwind over the next few years just given the V2500 fleet but that's also why we have this structural cost program in place which I'm very pleased on the progress that we're making on that program in order to continue to mitigate maintenance pressures over the next few years.\nScott Group: Okay. And then, Robin, the NEA ruling and then your decision to withdraw, how does that you remind bolster or not your confidence around getting this Spirit deal done?\nRobin Hayes: Well, the first with the folks on the Spirit deal but also if you read the complaint, there's they talk about the DOJ talks about the NEA. And certainly it came a lot, it came up a lot during the call so the last year. And so, we've completely taken off the table. When we went into the sort of the beginning, we felt the NEA was pro-competitive. We still do, we lost the case and as such we're moving on. And so, this is now and I think if you look at the strength of the legacy airlines at the moment and just the benefit of this go and the geographic diversity, I think this plays extremely well into our argument about pricing, a pro-consumer national low-fare high-quality airline as the best catalyst the competition that we have. And so, we're going to focus on now making that case.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Nikhil Mittal for any closing remarks.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thanks, Lara. And that concludes our second quarter 2023 conference call. Thank you, for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask to please disconnect your lines. Have a lovely day."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 1, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-04-25 14:14:07", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sylvie, and I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. And at this time all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue\u2019s Director Assistant Treasurer and Fuel, Joe Caiado. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoe Caiado: Thank you, Sylvie. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning we issued our earnings release and a presentation that we\u2019ll reference during this call. All of those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and have been filed with the SEC. In New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ursula Hurley, our Chief Financial Officer.

Investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Also during the course of our call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For an explanation and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue\u2019s CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Joe, and thanks to you for continuing to do double duty in two different jobs. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our thoughts are with those affected by the recent storm and flooding in South Florida. I\u2019d like to start by thanking our 25,000 crewmembers, particularly those down in Fort Lauderdale as well as all of the employees of Broward County Aviation Department, for supporting our customers and each other while prioritizing safety above all through a very challenging event. I\u2019d like to thank Mark Gale for his leadership down at the airport and also all county, state and federal agencies with incredible work to get the airport reopen again. We stay true to our mission to inspire humanity now for 23 years and counting. We recently celebrated our birthday in February. And as I reflect on our progress, I could not be more proud of the exceptional brand and experience we\u2019ve cultivated that continues to disrupt the border industry. With JetBlue, customers simply do not have to choose between low fares and great service. Before going to our quarterly results, I\u2019d like to provide a quick update on our combination with Spirit. We are fully committed and forging ahead with our planned acquisition. In fact, we are more convinced than ever of the strategic logic of the combination. We firmly believe that creating a stronger JetBlue is the best solution to transform the industry creating more competition and loosening the dominance of theBig 4. Over the past several months, support for our combination and recognition of its pro-consumer benefits have continued to grow, including from the State of Florida, who declined to join the Department of Justice lawsuit and instead views this as an opportunity to grow high-quality and low-fare air service. Indeed, the State of Florida has helped promote the combination which is expected to result in the biggest transformation in air travel that Florida has ever experienced, including at our Orlando and Fort Lauderdale focused cities, and additionally entails strong job creation across multiple airports in the State of Florida. It\u2019s disappointing, though not surprising, that the Department of Justice is trying to block this transaction and by doing so, protect the status quo and enabling the largest airlines to continue operating unfettered in setting high fares and limiting competition. However, these actions do not change our conviction in the merits of this transaction. JetBlue is one of a kind. There\u2019s no other airline that disrupts the market like us. A fact the Department of Justice is recognized and applauded and combining with Spirit, this will give us the scale to keep the Big 4 on their toes in even more markets and with all travelers. As you\u2019ll hear, we all feel good about the process \u2013 about the progress, I should say, we are making on our organic plan. But as we said at the outset, our combination with Spirit will turbocharge our plan, enabling us to serve more customers at lower fares and great service while delivering increased value for our stakeholders over the long-term as an even better JetBlue brings even more competition to the industry. We are confident in the pro-competitive merits of the transaction, and we look forward to demonstrating that in court this fall. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 4 and our organic business and our first quarter results. For the first quarter, we reported a GAAP loss per share of $0.58 and adjusted loss per share of $0.34, above the better end of our guidance. Throughout the quarter, our team delivered excellent operational performance against a very challenging ATC backdrop. The FAA starting shortcoming, years in the making has brought over, especially in New York, and they require for 10% voluntary reductions by carriers creates a significant headwind for the American travelers flying this summer. While we cannot control the ATC staffing issues nor what happens in the economy, we are focused on successfully managing everything we can control. We\u2019ve made significant progress in building resiliency into our schedule, buffering our operations and continuing to make strategic investments in improving operability. By aligning all of our efforts and minimizing operational challenges, we\u2019re able to generate more revenue, better control of our costs and importantly deliver for our customers. Looking ahead, we expect to carry this momentum forward with strong sequential pre-tax margin improvement into the second quarter. We remain well on track in executing our comprehensive plan to enhance long-term profitability and restore our historical earnings power. In 2023, we\u2019re poised to deliver another year of record revenue performance as we continue to expand our product reach and value proposition to more customers across more destinations. These efforts combined with the success of our structural cost program, gives me great confidence in our full year\u2019s earnings outlook. Having said that, looking 2023, we recognize that we have more work to do to return our margins back to pre-pandemic levels. Moving now to Slide 5. Looking ahead, there are four key margin builders that are critical to the JetBlue investment case: The Northeast Alliance, our ongoing evolution of our TrueBlue Loyalty program, JetBlue Travel Products and our structural cost program. Joanna will provide some additional color on the progress we are making with the NEA and TrueBlue, and Ursula will provide an update on our structural cost program. I\u2019d like now to take a minute to talk about the success of JetBlue Travel Products. Since 2019, Travel Products has achieved profit growth seven-fold. JetBlue Travel Products continues to provide a platform for profitable growth, while deepening our relationship with customers. Recently, we announced a very important milestone opening access to Paisley, our homegrown travel booking website to all travelers, not just those who have a JetBlue flight, greatly expanding our addressable market. We have already seen a meaningful step change in Paisley bookings in the first few weeks. As we continue to grow as well as to our planned acquisition of Spirit, these traveler offerings beyond flights will become increasingly relevant even more customers and will fuel profitable growth for JetBlue. Turning to the second quarter, we do expect strong revenue growth to continue as demand remains robust. And our multiyear structural cost program continues to deliver as we remain on track to hit our full year CASMx target, giving us confidence to reaffirm our EPS guidance of $0.70 to $1 for the full year 2023. Finally, we continue to solidify our sustainability commitments and demonstrate our leadership in aviation decarbonization. Last quarter, we announced a leading agreement with Shell Aviation for delivery of ten million gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF at LAX over the next two years, starting this quarter, and option to purchase more. The deal with Shell is a strong signal of the growing engagement of the oil and gas majors in SAF production and something that we welcome. I\u2019d like to close by thanking our crewmembers once again for delivering solid first quarter results. Our collective hard work has positioned us well for long-term success. Despite an uncertain economic outlook and a challenged ATC environment, I am optimistic about our future. We\u2019ve built a solid foundation to succeed based on the unique JetBlue combination of low fares and great service. With that, over to you, Joanna.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. I would also like to add my thanks to our crewmembers for all that you do to ensure we deliver for our customers. I\u2019m pleased with the success that we are seeing as a result of the efforts from our teams, as well as the operational investments and enhanced planning that we\u2019ve implemented. Despite the highly congested airspace that we operate in, we achieved our operational goals for the quarter and ranked third in the industry in the first quarter for completion factor. Turning to Slide 7. For the first quarter of 2023, capacity grew 9% year-over-year, above the high end of our initial expectations, driven in part by fewer-than-expected weather events. However, we do continue to experience ATC-related challenges across our system. As widely reported, the FAA has announced that their New York Air Traffic Control staffing is at 54% of their 2014 target, far short of where it needs to be to avoid significant disruptions and accommodate the industry\u2019s growth. I\u2019d like to thank the FAA for acknowledging the issues and for their close collaboration to ensure the industry minimizes the impact to customers. In line with FAA\u2019s slot waiver incentive to carriers, we are fine-tuning our summer capacity plans to help mitigate delays we can control and provide a better customer experience. Even with the slight cutbacks, we still expect challenges in the operating environment this summer. The FAA has said that delays are expected to vastly increase year-over-year. With our large footprint in the Northeast, JetBlue is disproportionately exposed to these challenges. So we are focused on what we can control, like protecting scheduled over maintenance time so the fleet can lunch on time. We also continue to invest in technology to aid recovery during irregular operations. And we\u2019re enforcing our schedule and network planning processes to support operational success. We continue to plan the operation with conservatism, with schedule buffers and elevated crew reserve levels. We expect capacity to be up 4.5% to 7.5% year-over-year in the second quarter. And for the full year 2023, we are reiterating our expectations for capacity to be up 5.5% to 8.5%. As we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past few years, we will maintain a nimble approach with capacity should conditions change. We have many exciting opportunities across our network, and we are focused on restoring targeted capacity across our non-slotted focus cities. Later this quarter, we expect to launch service to Paris from New York. We are also thrilled to announce this morning that tickets to our third transatlantic Blue City, Amsterdam, are now for sale, with service beginning in August as we continue strengthening our relevance in our largest focus city and building on our successful Mint platform. And over the longer term, we are delighted to have announced our growth plans in Florida, enabled by our combination with Spirit, including reaching 200 daily flights at Orlando and more than 250 daily flights at Fort Lauderdale as we bring more low fares, more choice, more high-quality service and more jobs to Florida. Turning to revenue, in the first quarter, we grew revenue by 34% year-over-year, driven by leisure and VFR demand strength across our network, with load factors increasing throughout the quarter. For the second quarter, we are forecasting revenue to increase between 4.5% to 8.5% over year \u2013 year-over-year. This includes 0.5 point impact from the recent closure Fort Lauderdale Airport due to flooding and the immediate aftermath. That said, demand trends remained very robust into the second quarter, particularly during peak periods. And our Latin franchise continues to drive very strong revenue generation with higher year-over-year loads and yields. Our revenue guide is based on a continuation of current trends. We are seeing a strong domestic demand environment throughout the U.S. and are particularly pleased with the continued improvement in our New York City performance. We\u2019ve also seen a steady recovery in business travel, which was roughly 80% recovered in the first quarter with sequential improvement expected into the second quarter. While we did see a brief drop in demand immediately following the banking sector scare, it is now recovered. We continue to manage the business to margin and have great confidence in our full year earnings outlook on the back of our better than expected performance in the first quarter. Our revenue outlook for the remainder of the year is bolstered by strong revenue streams from the NEA, our TrueBlue Loyalty program and JetBlue Travel products. Starting with the NEA, which is already a meaningful revenue generator for JetBlue as we\u2019ve grown daily flight offerings in New York City by over 25% versus pre-pandemic levels generating significant benefits for consumers in the process. We expect a year-over-year margin tailwind in New York as the NEA markets continue to mature. Recall, for example, that we roughly tripled our service at LaGuardia in 2022 compared to pre-pandemic levels. We\u2019re already seeing meaningful margin improvement as our service matures. Our TrueBlue Loyalty program also continues to show exceptional growth. Co-brand card spend and active membership increased by over 20% in the first quarter, and we forecast continued strength as we launch our newly redesigned TrueBlue program later this quarter. We\u2019re expanding the ability to earn and redeem points, the addition of benefits for less frequent travelers and increased value for our most loyal customers. Through these value enhancements, we expect engagement with the loyalty program to continue reaching all-time highs this year and beyond. In addition, as Robin mentioned, we recently enabled travelers to earn TrueBlue points when booking travel beyond just flights through Paisly. Paisly is fully integrated into JetBlue, TrueBlue, and customers who book travel on Paisly will earn points and achieve TrueBlue perks. These enhancements are all part of our multi-year journey in evolving our TrueBlue program, helping us close the gap to our peers. I\u2019ll close with another thank you to our crew members for delivering for our customers. While we do expect a challenging summer ahead, I\u2019m very excited about the incredible path we\u2019ve paved to set us up for success. Together, we\u2019re focused on executing our plan to generate solid revenue growth and deliver on our cost goals, building a better JetBlue for all stakeholders. Ursula, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to you.\nUrsula Hurley: Thank you, Joanna. I\u2019d like to add my thanks to our crew members, through their tremendous efforts and discipline we\u2019re well on our way to delivering on our comprehensive plan to create value for our stakeholders this year and beyond. We continue to anticipate closing our acquisition of Spirit in the first half of 2024 with a dedicated team running our integration management office. We\u2019re ensuring that we are thoughtfully and appropriately prioritizing our efforts to ultimately create significant long-term value for our owners and all of our stakeholders. Turning to Slide 9, as Robin mentioned, our first quarter results were ahead of our initial expectations with strong improvement in revenue and non-fuel unit costs throughout the quarter, somewhat offset by fuel prices. I\u2019m especially pleased with our team\u2019s continued cost execution as this quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter where we met or beat our quarterly cost guidance. First quarter CASM ex-fuel performance was also aided by one point from higher capacity, given fewer than expected weather events and roughly half a point from operational efficiencies. Through better operational planning going into the quarter, we were able to deliver a better outcome by controlling for factors such as labor premiums and disruption related costs. We have been successfully implementing our structural cost program, which is supporting our efforts to mitigate cost pressures related to maintenance and rents and landing fees. To-date, we have already achieved roughly $35 million since launch, putting us well on track to drive approximately $70 million in cost reduction this year, and $150 million to $200 million in cumulative cost savings through 2024. In addition, we continue to expect our fleet modernization program to generate over $40 million of savings this year and $75 million through 2024 as we replace our E190 fleet with the margin accretive A220. We\u2019ve already achieved over $30 million in savings with 12 E190s retired to-date, including 10 currently parked in the desert, and two that we\u2019ve sold. For the second quarter, we\u2019re expecting to generate earnings per share between $0.35 and $0.45, driven by strong revenue and continued execution on cost. For the second quarter, we\u2019re forecasting CASM ex-fuel to increase 1.5% to 3.5% year-over-year, which includes a point of impact from our reduced summer schedule tied to ATC constraints and half a point impact from the closure of Fort Lauderdale Airport. We remain on track to meet our full year CASM ex-fuel target of up 1.5% to 4.5%. This does imply a step up in CASM ex in the back half of the year, which is primarily driven by two factors. An additional step up tied to our pilot agreement, which is about four points total year-over-year in both the third and fourth quarter, and the timing of maintenance events, which is about two points year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Turning to liquidity and balance sheet on Slide 10, we closed the first quarter with $2.3 billion in liquidity, including our $600 million revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. We continue to take a conservative approach to managing our liquidity, especially in light of the step up in aircraft CapEx this year, and our ongoing shareholder \u2013 our ongoing Spirit shareholder prepayments. To that end, we\u2019ve previously shared our intention to finance a portion of our aircraft deliveries this year and we\u2019ve raised $116 million in aircraft financings year-to-date. We will continue to evaluate a variety of different products and structures for our financing needs, including leases, bank debt, and capital markets transactions. Before closing, I\u2019d like to touch on fuel. Volatility in New York Harbor Jet fuel prices impacted our weighted average fuel price in the first quarter by approximately $0.26. That said, New York Harbor pricing has since eased, and we expect the impact in the second quarter to be approximately $0.16. Importantly, we continue to look at hedging opportunities to protect our earnings outlook. As a reminder, our approach to fuel hedging is to enter into hedges on a discretionary basis to mitigate the risk from significant volatility and price spikes, and we actively monitor the market to take advantage of opportunities when conditions are favorable. As of today, we have hedged approximately 23% of our expected fuel consumption for the full year. In closing, I want to thank our crew members for helping to build a stronger JetBlue as we significantly improve our financial performance. Coming out of the first quarter, I\u2019m excited about the trajectory of the business in the coming quarters and years. Based on everything we see today, we have confidence in our full year earnings outlook of $0.70 to $1, which implies margins approaching 2019 levels as we move through the year. We are well-positioned to continue navigating uncertainty around the economic backdrop later in the year, as well as ongoing ATC challenges. We also look forward to closing the Spirit transaction to turbocharge our organic plan and create even more long-term value for our stakeholders. And with that, we will now take your questions.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks everyone. Sylvie, we\u2019re now ready for the question-and-answer session. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Savi Syth at Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning, everybody. This is Matt on for Savi. My first question, when I look at the implied margin guide for 2Q, you\u2019re still laying 2019 levels by several points, so maybe could you provide some color on any specific cost lines that might have moved structurally higher and how you think those items could be improved to close the margin gap versus peers?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, thanks for the question, Matt. So the \u2013 so our objective is to get the business back to consistent profitability while approaching 2019 levels of profitability. Our Q2 guide is the first step in that process. I\u2019m actually significantly pleased with the CASM ex-fuel guide for the quarter, so it\u2019s up 1.5 to 3.5, and we essentially called out 0.5 of headwinds. A point is associated with the investment that we\u2019re making in pulling down capacity driven by ATC constraints in New York, and the other half point of CASM ex-fuel is driven by the Fort Lauderdale airport closure. So net-net, if you back out that 1.5 points I\u2019m pleased and with our controllable cost guide and essentially, we would beat I think what the consensus is out there on the cost side of the equation. So we\u2019re confident in the $0.35 to $0.45 EPS for the quarter, and it puts us on a path to more closely come in line with 2019 profitability levels as we navigate through the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks for the additional color there. Now also in the presentation you\u2019ve referenced the return to seasonality, so maybe could you provide some additional color on the impact you think that\u2019ll have on 2Q and any additional color on how 2Q is trending in terms of booking rates to date and/or materialization rates changing or increases \u2013 increasing, like we\u2019ve heard on other calls? Thank you very much.\nDave Clark: Hi, good morning, Matt. This is Dave. I\u2019ll take that one. Overall, we feel really good about the demand we\u2019re seeing out there. Very strong internationally, strong domestically as well. The peaks remain very strong driven by this leisure demand, so whether it was holidays at the end of the year or spring break we\u2019ve seen very strong demand in the peaks and we expect the same for this coming summer including June at the end of this quarter. So very strong April with the peak stronger \u2013 strong June at the peak, May will be \u2013 it\u2019s a bit of a shoulder period, so it\u2019ll probably be a bit lower, but that\u2019s what we experience just about every year. And in general, the seasonality is returning towards normalcy with just the peaks a bit higher, and then the troughs obviously have a bit of a headwind from the corporate travel, which is as mentioned before about 80% recover. So it\u2019s creating a bit more of a peak to trough ratio than we saw before, but in general, feeling really good about demand throughout the network.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks for that. And quickly, could you touch on how much in 2Q has been booked to date or changes in materialization rates in that quarter as well?\nDave Clark: Sure. We\u2019re about two-thirds booked to date for the second quarter. That\u2019s normal for us. We have seen the booking curve elongate somewhat over the past couple of quarters, but still roughly two-thirds.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Andrew Didora at Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the questions. I guess just in terms of kind of the change in New York capacity, given the ATC issues in the market, how should we think about your potential being able to reallocate some of that flying and yes, I guess in terms of how much of the cut capacity in New York do you think you can backfill into other markets?\nJoanna Geraghty: Hey, Andrew, this is Joanna. Thanks for the question. Maybe I\u2019ll provide sort of a broader answer and then get specifically into your capacity redeployment question. So we\u2019re obviously very concerned about New York City for the summer. The FAA continues to be significantly understaffed, as we said in the prepared remarks. This is a continuing issue. And frankly, I\u2019m only getting worse this summer. So we do appreciate the FAA\u2019s transparency around their staffing challenges. It\u2019s obviously a concern across the NEA but more acute in the New York region. And while we are pleased that the FAA has given carrier\u2019s relief on the slots, this is obviously something that\u2019s not good for customers and it\u2019s not good for JetBlue coming with a pretty significant financial impact into Q2 and potentially into Q3. So while this is the right decision for us given the need to protect the operation, this is going to be a most challenging summer ahead. We are not going to be redeploying the capacity that we pulled. If you look at our network footprint, because we are so concentrated in New York and the Northeast, and because there are staffing challenges across the entire NEA. Our decision is to reinvest those crews in higher reserves and reinvest that aircraft in additional aircraft time to help mitigate the delays that we expect that we\u2019re going to see this summer. This is definitely a challenging environment. We\u2019re frustrated. Our customers are frustrated. We do appreciate the fact that the FAA is working with us and being transparent. But this is something that needs to get fixed, and unfortunately, there is not a short-term fix to it. So that\u2019s the decision we\u2019ve made for the summer. And we\u2019ll navigate as best we can as these challenges arise.\nAndrew Didora: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then just a second question, Robin, when I think about kind of strategically over the longer term. Just in terms of the fleet, given everything going on with the OEMs and whatnot. Just in the event, the Spirit deal does not go through, how do you think your long-term growth profile changes given kind of your order book shrinks a little bit starting in 2024 and 2025?\nRobin Hayes: Thanks for the question, Andrew. And of course, I\u2019m going to start by giving you the straight bad answer saying, we\u2019re confident in our case and the Spirit transaction closing, because it\u2019s great for consumers. But if it doesn\u2019t, then I think clearly, we still have an order book. We are challenged by delays as other airlines are, and we would have to look at opportunities both short to medium term in the leasing market and then longer term to layer in sort of additional positions. But I think everything we\u2019ve got is focused on the Spirit transaction. I think, when I look at the government challenges in keeping FAA staff, which is a problem years in the making, and as Joanna said, has just been getting worse. I think it just adds the importance of JetBlue expanding its national footprint. And we want to do that not by pulling down New York, because New York is home, where the hometown airline in New York, we\u2019re proud to be based here in New York City, but by building a more national presence and Spirit is going to help us do that much quicker than we would be able to do ourselves and bring those benefits to consumers and the employees both airlines, our crew members and their team members more quickly.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Jamie Baker at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. Actually, I was thinking what you should do for your earnings deck in the future is feature analyst photos taken from JetBlue flights. I mean, Ursula\u2019s picture is great, but it would be a lot of fun to \u2013 try to give her a run for the money. So Ursula, the second quarter question that was asked before about the margin deficit relative to 2019, obviously something that jumped out to us as well. But I think I\u2019ve missed something at the end of your prepared remarks, you said margins for the year would be approaching those of 2019. I mean, did you mean moving in the right direction?\nUrsula Hurley: Correct.\nJamie Baker: Or actually starting to rival those margins? I\u2019m just trying to square what I think I might have misunderstood against the $0.70 to $1 EPS guide.\nUrsula Hurley: Thanks for the question, Jamie. And I\u2019ve been telling everyone that it\u2019s fair game. Anyone can submit pictures to get on the cover of our earnings presentation. So thanks for the question. I think as we navigate through the year, we\u2019re making progress towards achieving 2019 margin levels. I feel good about the momentum that the business has heading into the second quarter. The revenue and demand environment continue to be really strong. As we navigate in the back half of this year, we actually are in a position where unit revenue could be slightly down year-over-year as we cycle against some very strong comps. And that seems reasonable and achievable, especially in light of the revenue initiatives that we have. We\u2019ve got the NEA and New York continues to recover. We\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve been seeing, but it continues to be a tailwind. As we roll out our TrueBlue Loyalty program, we\u2019ll continue to make progress and as well as JetBlue travel products. And I\u2019m extremely pleased with the cost execution and the progress of the structural cost program. So that\u2019s what gives us confidence in the full year EPS number. And as I mentioned, the first milestone is making progress towards 2019 margin levels.\nJamie Baker: Got it, got it. Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just on fuel, the hedging program is obviously still in its infancy, but by the looks of things, you might already be underwater, I can\u2019t say for certain, but just looking at the 350 all in during the first quarter and how New York Harbor has settled down. I mean at the forward curve, do you assume you lose money on your hedges this year?\nUrsula Hurley: We do at the moment, but there it\u2019s immaterial.\nJamie Baker: Okay. All right. Helpful. Okay. Thank you everybody.\nRobin Hayes: And Jamie, a very happy birthday. I don\u2019t want you thinking that we have forgotten you.\nJamie Baker: Well, you never do. Thank you, Robin. I appreciate that. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Mike Linenberg at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. Hey good morning, everyone. Hey Joanna, I want to go back to the point that you made about, no short-term fix with the airspace issues specifically in New York. And the FAA is, I guess, what you said, 54% staffed of the levels that they need to be. What\u2019s the risk that we get to September and I realize mid-September on things slow a bit. But given 54% and no short-term fix, are you going to have to go back to the FAA? Or are they going to come back to you and say, can you guys continue to run an abbreviated schedule?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, just to be clear, it\u2019s 54% of 2014 staffing levels. So, I don\u2019t know who manages the 2014 and the year 2023, but it\u2019s a 2014 staffing level. So that\u2019s an important point. The second piece is we don\u2019t expect a problem this fall. Obviously, it\u2019s a trough. This has been an ongoing issue for years. It\u2019s gotten worse. So we manage through the challenges. We have built an operation around trying to mitigate a regular operation. So it\u2019s something given our footprint that we\u2019ve gotten quite good at. But we don\u2019t expect the fall itself to be a problem. But this is a multiyear kind of path of FAAs down to try to remedy its staffing shortages and it\u2019s not going to get fixed in the near time. Where it significantly presents itself is in convective weather activity and when there are peak periods and there\u2019s just a lot of travel.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Great. And then just my second question, I guess, maybe this is to Dave. Just within the context of demand trends remaining robust, I mean, we\u2019re hearing that from other carriers. I think one other carrier did call out some softness to Heathrow. I think it\u2019s more just a function of everybody being forced to utilize slots right now under the use or lose it rule. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re seeing that. I mean, you\u2019re a relatively small player. Maybe you\u2019re not seeing it tuned from Heathrow to Boston and New York. And then I think there\u2019s been some comment about maybe transcons and pricing. Any markets in particular where maybe you are seeing some softness, again, within the context that overall demand is actually quite good in the majority of your markets? Thank you.\nDave Clark: Sure. Good morning, Mike, and thanks for the question. And no, I\u2019d say there\u2019s no parts of our network where I would say we\u2019re seeing any softness. At the highest levels, those markets that did have a very high business mix before COVID have seen the biggest traffic reduction, but we\u2019ve appropriately scaled capacity in those to account for that. So we feel pretty good. Our European markets continue to ramp well. We\u2019re pleased to be at five flights to London a day from New York and Boston, combined and to have that second Heathrow from New York flight in there on a daily basis. So no concerns for us as we look ahead to the summer, for Europe, seeing very strong early demand trends. So feeling quite good about the continued progress and ramp of our European franchise.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Duane Pfennigwerth at Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. I wanted to ask you about your hotel inventory on JetBlue Travel Products. Where are you getting your hotel inventory from? And are you working to create direct relationships with hotels in this business? And I guess, just broadly, do you have anecdotes as to why the value proposition is more compelling to a customer than booking separately or maybe through an OTA?\nAndres Barry: Hi Duane, and thank you for the question. A couple of pieces. We do have direct relationships with hotels. And we do see that, that helps a lot on the servicing side and to create a compelling value proposition for customers. We do also supplement that with other third parties that we source. But the vast majority of our bookings are the hotels we have direct relationships with. And then in terms of the value proposition, I mean it\u2019s taking what made JetBlue the airline special, which is not having to pick between good price and good service and taking that to broader travel. And I think that\u2019s what customers are appreciating.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I appreciate that. And then maybe just a little modeling one, just for my follow-up. On hedges, can you comment on the \u2013 if the values in your hedge disclosure represent floors? And it seems like they\u2019d be sort of modestly out of the money today. Thanks for taking the questions.\nUrsula Hurley: Yes. Thanks for the question, Duane. So just as a reminder, we view hedging as a way to mitigate risk and volatility in the market. So we\u2019re always monitoring the market. We found a period after the banking crisis where pricing made sense for us to reenter the hedging market in a meaningful way. So that\u2019s when we layered on most of these hedges. So, we feel okay, but then we get to participate in downside \u2013 in the downside, obviously, the way that these are structured in terms of when prices fall. And I can confirm that they\u2019re slightly out of the money at the moment.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Dan McKenzie at Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nDan McKenzie: Hey good morning. Thanks guys. Going back to the script on planning the operation conservatively and buffering operations in New York City. You touched on the cost hit in the script. I\u2019m wondering what the revenue hit is from that lost flying. And I guess where I\u2019m going, there\u2019s a pretty big profit impact in what I believe is 50% of the flying that should go away at some point. And it\u2019d be great if you could just kind of give a sense for what that might look like and whether it\u2019s going to take a fully staffed ATC to get back to that historical $3 EPS target?\nDave Clark: Good morning, Dan. Thanks for the question. This is Dave. As we pulled down our New York City flying, we did it pretty surgically to ensure that we\u2019re hitting shorter-haul routes, smaller gauge flights and routes that generally we felt would have the least impact of the loss to frequency. So based on that, both the capacity impact of the pull as well as any revenue impact is quite a bit less than the departure pull. So we pulled about 10% of departures out but capacity is much, much smaller than that. And the revenue is really to be determined. We have initial estimates, but we\u2019ll see as we go through the quarter, how things come in. So it\u2019s tough to size it at the moment.\nJoanna Geraghty: Dan, if I could just add, I mean, we\u2019re very prepared for this summer. Most airlines are unfortunately, the FAA is not. And so these are obviously steps that we\u2019ve had to take. But last summer, we made a number of investments to try to insulate the operation from air traffic control challenges, some of which were transient in nature, some of which have stayed with us, things like investing in more people and crew services and planning the network in a way that allows us to more easily manage days where there are -- where there is convective activity, so higher percent of out and back flights that enable you to kind of cleanly cut those flights and contain it to a specific route. We\u2019ve also made a number of investments in technology, a new solver that enables us to more quickly repair flights. So, as we think about JetBlue\u2019s footprint in the Northeast, we are making operational decisions, planning decisions, and investments to enable us to operate in this airspace. Because this is something that\u2019s not going to change in the very near term. We obviously have more reserves as most carriers do. The capacity pool the summer in New York has enabled us to kind of redistribute those reserves a couple of points into our operational plans. So that we\u2019re more resilient for the summer. But we\u2019re fully prepared for the summer timeframe. We\u2019re fully prepared for the next few years of challenges that we expect will present themselves because of this ATC staffing shortage, we need the FAA to continue to focus on a longer-term fix because this is coming at a cost to JetBlue and frankly, a cost to customers. Customers deserve and should get more out of out of the FAA in terms of the services that they provide.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Very good. Second question here. As we think about the 2023 revenue outlook, I\u2019m just wondering, we can flesh that out a little bit more. And I\u2019m wondering if you can speak to the revenue recovery in the capacity constrained airports in 2022 and to what extent JetBlue\u2019s RASM hit at those airports leg the industry? And how last year\u2019s trends are inflecting and contributing to the outlook this year? So, the RASM hit, what the RASM hit was from over capacity last year in the constrained airports? And how the trends this summer are aiding those airports this year?\nDave Clark: Thanks, Dan. This is Dave. I\u2019ll take that one. Clearly in 2022, we had a headwind in our slotted airports as use or lose came back into effect in us and the rest of the industry needed to fly those slots which ramped up capacity, but faster than demand was ramping up. We also, in addition to that, our strong growth in New York City enabled by the Northeast Alliance led to a lot of capacity that was relatively new, and that capacity always goes through ramp. We\u2019re now seeing that the flip side, those headwinds last year have turned into a tailwind this year, which is great. And I think maybe the easiest way to size it is if you look at the first quarter, which just completed, our New York City year-over-year RASM was 10 points better than the rest of our system. So we\u2019re seeing the catch up happening. It\u2019s still behind. It\u2019s not caught up to where it was relative to the system before COVID. But a 10-point improvement last quarter on a year-over-year basis obviously shows the rate at which it\u2019s starting to catch up.\nDave Clark: Yes. Thanks so much you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Catherine O\u2019Brien at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for your time. So maybe just on the maintenance cost, you called out that maintenance expense will be a headwind in the second half and gave us some good information on the 4Q impact specifically. Can you just help us think about is like the magnitude of the timing impact this year? I know maintenance is always going to be lumpy around events. But is 2023 a good comp for a normal maintenance year or a maintenance event still elevated from a pandemic recovery perspective? Thanks.\nJoanna Geraghty: Catie, thanks for the question. Good morning. I mean maintenance, it is always going to be somewhat volatile. It\u2019s really just driven by the number of events within the quarter. And it just happens to be that in the fourth quarter this year it\u2019s somewhat heavier than what we saw last year. So there\u2019s going to be volatility, we\u2019ll try to be as transparent as possible as we navigate. I think the important thing here is that our full year CASM ex-fuel guide were reiterating, and this was expected. We knew that we were going to have a meaningful step up in the fourth quarter of this year.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Got it. And then maybe just on your European service, you\u2019ve always hinted that it would be London and a couple of other cities where you had gaps for your New York City and Boston flyers. Does Amsterdam round out that list or could there be more, should we still think about Europe as a couple percentage points of total capacity fully ramped or has anything changed based on the initial performance of these routes? Thanks.\nDave Clark: Sure. Thanks, Catie. This is Dave. I think the easiest way to look at it is with our fleet plan which has about 26 transatlantic capable aircraft in it, both the Airbus 321LR and XLR. Looking at what we\u2019ve now announced between London, Paris, and Amsterdam, as those ramp up it will be about 10 flights per day and take about the first 11 of those 26 airplane. So there\u2019s certainly more trans-Atlantic capable aircraft coming. It\u2019ll take sort of a year or two to get to them through the order book. But we expect based on our initial results to continue growing, we now have the big three markets which really adds relevance for us in the North Atlantic. After that, I think you can see us be a bit more sort of creative and spread over where we want to go and use some of the features of our aircraft that are unique and fit some markets really well. So more to come, but for most of next year you\u2019ll see us ramping up these markets we\u2019ve already announced.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Helane Becker at TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, team. Thanks for the time. So on the Fort Lauderdale issues that you had with the weather, I\u2019m wondering if there are any read-throughs that you can take for how the team handled it into handling other disruptions elsewhere in the network when they occur?\nJoanna Geraghty: Hey, Helane, thanks. I\u2019ll start with a sort of every time there\u2019s an event, we do a post action review. And in this case, the team, whether it\u2019s Broward County Aviation Department, and Mark and his team or the JetBlue team, there\u2019s always learnings, but overall, the team did an exceptionally good job. Not only do we have to restart the operation, one the operation down and restart the operation. But we also have to support the crew members who are impacting the local communities because they\u2019ve been personally hit losing cars and things of that nature. And so, given that we have a footprint in the Northeast and we see a lot of these types of events, we\u2019ve gotten pretty good at managing regular operations. Obviously, there\u2019s nuances to each one of them, but this one, I think the team did an exceptionally good job in taking care of the safety of our customers and our crew members and then restarting the operation when it was safe to do so. But yes, we do an after action report on all of these. So that we can take learnings and incorporate them into the next event.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is just on kind of going from first half breakeven, which is, it looks like on an adjusted earnings basis is where you\u2019ll be, to profit of $0.70 to $1 in, I guess in the second half, right? So how are you about the third and fourth quarter? The third should normally be a very strong quarter and fourth maybe not so good. Then I\u2019m wondering how we should think about bridging that breakeven to somewhere between $0.70 and $1. Thank you.\nUrsula Hurley: Good morning, Helane. Obviously, in the first quarter of this year, it\u2019s typically always the seasonally weakest. So then the year tends to ramp from there. What you have to believe for us to achieve the $0.70 to $1 is that we continue to see a strong demand and revenue environment. I mentioned earlier, our full year guidance allows for unit revenue to be slightly down year-over-year. And we are cycling through, obviously strong comps year-over-year, but that seems reasonable given the JetBlue initiatives that we have in place, right? The continued recovery in New York, JetBlue loyalty program launching, and then as well as JetBlue Travel Products. So on a top line perspective that\u2019s what you need to believe. On the cost execution side, I\u2019m very pleased that for five quarters in a row, we\u2019ve either met or beat our controllable cost guidance. And so the continued execution of the structural cost program in the second half of the year, I feel really confident in, and so those are the things that we feel good about and very strong that we can deliver the $0.70 to $1.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Conor Cunningham at Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Everyone thank you. You had a couple of questions on RASM. So maybe ask it a different way. When, I mean you\u2019re outperforming pretty nicely in the second quarter relative to what we\u2019ve heard from some other carriers. So is the way of thinking basically whatever the domestic market does, JetBlue is ultimately going to outperform this year just given the tailwinds from the NEA and some of the other revenue initiatives that you\u2019ve put in place?\nDave Clark: Good morning, Conor. This is Dave. Thanks for the question. And yes, I think that\u2019s a good way to think about it. I think given our exposure to the slotted markets and the recovery that they\u2019ve had and as mentioned that headwind last year turning to a tailwind this year, I think we\u2019re well positioned in the domestic market compared to the industry as a whole. And then just also, we\u2019re about 30% to 33% international, too. So we\u2019re certainly getting some benefit from the improvements there as well.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then maybe a longer-term question; 1Q is obviously your seasonally weakest quarter, but you typically add capacity from fourth quarter to first quarter. There\u2019s been obviously a lot of changes in how people are booking and what that may look like going forward. But just long-term, why wouldn\u2019t JetBlue somewhat reshape their capacity to drive long-term profits? Some of your competitors are talking about looking at first quarter and how they make it a little better. I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s a thought process for you guys as well? Thank you.\nDave Clark: Yes. And I\u2019d say absolutely. Every time we complete a season, we immediately scrub it and learn from it as we plan the capacity for the next year. And we certainly saw some different trends this winter that will factor in. So of course, we don\u2019t want to react to any one season and look for larger trends over time. But we\u2019ll continue to update our capacity plan as we see customer behavior in terms of all.\nConor Cunningham: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Chris Stathoulopoulos at Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So Rob and Joan, I\u2019m curious the capacity guide for this year, 5.5% to 8.5% to 3 points, you have your \u2013 you have the ATC issues you spoke to. There\u2019s always weather. There\u2019s always additional slippage with deliveries. And certainly there\u2019s increasingly macro and consumer risk in the second half. So obvious, why shouldn\u2019t we look at the closer to the lower end of that guide as a kind of a more realistic starting point for the full year?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. I mean, I\u2019ll add and then Robin, feel free to jump in. We\u2019re confident where we sit today that that\u2019s the right \u2013 that\u2019s the right capacity guide for the year. But you are correct. I mean this summer, if ATC presents itself as far worse than anybody has anticipated, even in the face of the capacity pulls we\u2019ve made, that could obviously impact completion factor going forward. And obviously, if there\u2019s a significant change in the macroeconomic environment that could also impact our capacity guide because we want to stay nimble with capacity and adjust as conditions warrant. So based upon what we know now, we think that is the right capacity guide for the year. But we are mindful of the order environment that we operate in, and we will plan the business accordingly.\nRobin Hayes: Yes. The only thing I\u2019d say to add to that is that the idea of putting the flights out is to make the summer more operable. That should mean that we are able to complete more flights. I mean I think our team do a really, really good job trying to complete flights even in very challenging circumstances. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 we talked about Fort Lauderdale earlier, that was the beginning of a very tough five days because we have the \u2013 as we had the Fort Lauderdale closure, that bled into weather into the New York area and ATC delays on Saturday night. And then it led into weather and thunderstorms in Florida on Sunday. So it was a very challenging event. And yet, I think our team did a really good job trying to get as many people home that they could. So those are things obviously [ph] completion back will help us operate the capacity that we are sort of publishing. But again, there\u2019s always been puts and takes in it. Right now, we feel good about the guide that we are laying out.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you. And Ursula, I just want to \u2013 I think you might have said for the second half, the potential for unit revenue down, but just on the math here on the full year revenue guide, the capacity guide implies around \u2013 I think it\u2019s around two points of acceleration in the RASM from the second quarter to the second half. So, I just want to make sure I understood your prepared comments and if the math is correct here, how are you anticipating growing RASM in the second half, while most peers are guiding for deceleration? I know you have the NEA, you have Travel Products and some other initiatives going on here, but I want to understand sort of the thought process here. Thank you.\nDave Clark: Hi, Chris, this is Dave. I\u2019ll take that one, and we can loop offline afterwards if you\u2019d like with the team, but we do not need to see positive RASM in the second half of the year. Given our Q1 performance, given our guidance for Q2, we can then be slightly negative RASM for Q3 and Q4 and still achieve the revenue and EPS numbers.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Yes. By the way, I would also add, I think, again, with the capacity changes that you\u2019re seeing in the New York region this summer, which are quite significant, not just from JetBlue but from other airlines, it is possible some of that demand spills into the fall. We don\u2019t know that yet. We did see some of that last year. And so I think whilst that\u2019s not in our \u2013 we\u2019re not assuming that today, I think that right everyone focused on the economic uncertainty that\u2019s out there, we\u2019re all very watchful about that. We\u2019re thinking about that. But there\u2019s some, I think, some revenue tailwinds here linked to just continued New York recovery spilling demand at the peak into the fall and some of the JetBlue and the initiatives that we\u2019ve already outlined.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Stephen Trent at Citi. Please go ahead.\nStephen Trent: Good morning and thanks very much for taking my questions. Just two quick ones for you here. First, I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s possible that you guys can expand your sustainable aviation fuel purchases beyond Los Angeles? And two, any high-level view as to where you guys expect to get your pilots over the next five years? If you\u2019re partnering with a flight school or something like that. Would just love to hear that. Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks for the question. On sustainable aviation fuel then, that\u2019s something our team is extremely focused on. It\u2019s become the gold rush of the airline industry. So, I\u2019m not going to be too specific about what we\u2019re thinking about. But it\u2019s clearly something that we\u2019re committed to. And the 10% target by 2030 is something that we are working towards every day. On the pilot issue, I mean, it\u2019s something that I\u2019m incredibly proud of is several years ago, JetBlue created some internal \u2013 some gateway programs to take pilots and train \u2013 take people who want to become pilots and train them. Called that gateway programs. We have, I think, now close to 1,000 pilots who have either been through one of those programs or in one of those programs or due to come in to one of those programs this year. The retention from these pilots is extremely high. And more recently, we\u2019ve opened up programs internally to our crewmembers. So if you want to come to work at JetBlue \u2013 if you work at JetBlue, then after two years, you want to become a pilot, we\u2019ll train you. And then also that applies to family members as well. So really, removing a lot of the economic and practical challenges that come with learning to fly. So, I think we couldn\u2019t be more pleased about that, and we\u2019re going to continue to work that in partnership with others in the industry. So again, we are not having any issue right now hiring, attracting pilots. We are seeing heightened levels of attrition. And again, that is another thing that drives the cost headwind that we\u2019re having to navigate, but we feel good about our ability to attract and train pilots. And our gateway programs have just been so transforming for so many people over the years. Transformative, I should say.\nStephen Trent: Appreciate that Robin. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we have no other questions registered. I will turn it back to our speakers for closing remarks.\nJoe Caiado: Great. Well, thank you very much. That will conclude our first quarter 2023 conference call. Thank you all for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. And again, this will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation, and we do ask that you please disconnect your lines."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2023-01-26 11:30:04", "content": "Operator: Good morning.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Greetings here from New York City, and we appreciate you joining us today. I'll start, as always, with a huge thanks and shout-out to our 24,000 crew members. We overcame many challenges together throughout this past year, and we made tremendous progress in restoring the business coming out of the pandemic. And we're set up to further build on that success here in 2023, with a disciplined plan to continue strengthening our foundations, both operationally and financially. While we face economic uncertainty, we remain focused on what we can control, and we are leveraging our unique value proposition of offering both great service and low fares enabled by our low-cost structure. This will result in margin expansion and robust earnings growth. Turning now to slide 4 of our new deck template. We closed the year with significant cost and revenue momentum, resulting in an adjusted pre-tax income of $69 million for the quarter and earnings per share of $0.22. Reflecting back on the full year 2022, we made important progress in positioning JetBlue for longer term success. We hit a new record annual revenue result, a phenomenal achievement by our team, given we were only two years removed from the depths of the worst crisis in aviation history. We continue to see incredible demand for JetBlue's differentiated product of low fares and great service, which was recently recognized by The Points Guy with an Editor's Choice Award for Best Economy Class in the world. We launched a new structural cost program targeting $150 million to $200 million of cost savings by the end of 2024. This program is designed to ensure that we are offsetting some of the inflationary increases in our cost structure and help us maintain a low-cost platform, allowing us to continue to offer even more lower fares. We strengthened our network and built even more relevance for our customers, by adding more service to more destinations, including significant growth out of New York, enabled by our Northeast Alliance with American Airlines, as well as building out our transatlantic service between the Northeast and London with additional frequency. We also moved into state-of-the-art wonderful new terminals at LaGuardia and Orlando and recently secured our third slot pair at London Heathrow. Our ESG efforts continue to lead the industry. Last quarter, we announced our most aggressive emissions reduction target yet, with a plan that would effectively reduce our per seat emissions in half by 2035 compared with 2019 levels as part of our recently announced science-based target. JetBlue is the only US carrier today to be flying regular domestic flights with fuel supply by both currently available SAF producers, while supporting a portfolio of emerging suppliers with significant forward commitments. We also made great progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion goals. Our external customer research shows that JetBlue ranks number one for diversity and inclusion in accommodating travelers in our focus cities. And our Gateway Direct program open to our crew members aspiring to become pilots, people of color represent 82% of our classes. As we look ahead to 2023, we are capitalizing on the strength of our trusted travel brand to drive record customer engagement and continued revenue momentum. We are making steady underlying progress on our long-term initiatives to structurally improve our profitability and enhance our long-term earnings power, with a low fare offering that appeals to a wide range of customers, supported by our growing traction on our cost program. This gives me great confidence that we can restore margins towards 2019 levels, as we move throughout this year. Beyond 2023, we look forward to transformational long-term value creation for all of our stakeholders with the acquisition of Spirit, which will allow us to create a truly national customer-centric, low-fare challenger to the Big Four airlines. This will enable us to bring more of our unique value proposition to more customers across more destinations. As we said before, we continue to expect this transaction to close no later than the first half of 2024. Moving now to slide five. For the first quarter, which is a seasonally tough travel period, we projected an adjusted loss of between $0.35 and $0.45 per share. We expect continued revenue strength and execution on cost reduction efforts throughout the year, with a margin trajectory approaching pre-pandemic levels as we exit 2023, despite significantly higher labor cost and fuel prices. As a result, for the full year 2023, we expect to generate between $0.70 to $1 in adjusted earnings per share, which is inclusive of a new pilot deal that we hope will be ratified very soon. This full year EPS guidance reflects the improvement that we expect throughout the year and highlight the run rate earnings profile of the stand-alone business into 2024, as we execute on new and existing initiatives across the business. The contribution from our Northeast Alliance will continue to ramp in 2023. We are so encouraged by the improvement in economic growth in New York as measured by GDP after lagging the rest of the country last year. At the same time, both JetBlue and industry capacity in the region recovered more quickly than the rest of the US in 2022, which provides a sequential tailwind in 2023 as that growth matures. We continue to see incredible momentum in our loyalty program, which continues to not only exceed our expectation but also hit new records. We recently announced the evolution of our TrueBlue loyalty program, which Joanna will elaborate on shortly. With respect to our network, we are planning to take delivery of four A321LR aircraft this year to support our continued transatlantic network expansion. We are very excited to launch service to Paris this summer, marking our second transatlantic destination and our first in Continental Europe as we build customer relevance from our key focus cities. Our JetBlue Travel Products subsidiary took another fantastic step forward last year with 59% revenue growth versus 2021 and 136% revenue growth versus 2019. This progress is a result of continued product innovation across JetBlue Vacations, travel insurance and our new Paisly platform, coupled with increased customer awareness. When we started JetBlue Travel Products, we set a target of $100 million run rate EBIT by 2022 compared to $15 million of EBIT in 2019. I am so pleased to share that we are near the $100 million, with consistent $20 million to $25 million of quarterly earnings with growing momentum into 2023. We continue to be optimistic about the growth potential of this business and aim now to roughly double our current run rate EBIT in the next three years. Finally, we continue to make strides to transform our cost footprint. We remain on track to deliver $250 million of total cost savings through 2024 with execution on our structural cost program and our fleet modernization efforts, which Ursula will touch on here very shortly with more detail. In closing, I would again like to thank our crew members for your dedication and all of your incredible hard work in 2022. I am so optimistic about how we are positioning the business for long-term success and so proud of the role that all of you have played in that. We have a strong foundation in place to execute on our plan to structurally enhance our long-term earnings power and create value for our shareholders. With that, Joanna, over to you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. I would also like to thank our team for the hard work day-in and day-out and for the incredible job in closing out the year strong. You've persevered and navigated through many challenges this past year from severe weather events to ATC outages, all against a backdrop of historic demand for air travel. We also made great strides this year to improve our operational reliability. Following our operational reset last spring, we made investments and embraced a more cautious operating planning philosophy, which has served us well as evidenced by our execution in the back half of the year. And I'm very pleased to report that our completion factor for the month of December was north of 98%, which puts us at the top of the industry, an incredible achievement. Turning to slide 7. For the fourth quarter of 2022, capacity grew 2.4% year over three, in line with our initial expectations and despite severe weather across our system. Looking ahead, we continue to see results from our operational investments with strong completion factor trends as we continue to operate in a challenging ATC environment. We expect capacity to be up 5.5% to 8.5% year-over-year, both for the first quarter and for the full year 2023. Our capacity growth this year will largely come from increased utilization, which should also drive improved productivity. As always, we will remain nimble with capacity as the year progresses and take decisive action through the lens of margins. Given the continued fragility of the aviation ecosystem, we continue to plan our operation with a level of conservatism for the foreseeable future, including scheduled buffers as well as increased crew reserve levels. Last year, our network focus was primarily centered on ramping our Northeast Alliance and delivering on its promise, bringing low fares and great service to more communities and boosting competition in the region. Growth from the NEA far outpaced overall domestic industry capacity growth, bringing enormous consumer benefits in the process as we have successfully created a true third alternative for customers in the region. And during the fourth quarter, we announced exciting news with plans to add more destinations and choice out of the Northeast as we strengthen our footprint. Looking ahead to 2023, we also plan to add service across other non-slotted focus cities where we see meaningful margin opportunities. We expect to continue restoring our Boston network and increase capacity in Florida and in San Juan. We are also building on the success of our Mint franchise with further expansion at Los Angeles, as well as the launch of service this summer to our latest transatlantic destination and Europe's most visited city, Paris. In the fourth quarter, revenue per available seat mile was up 16.1% year over three, slightly better than our mid-December investor update, fueled by strong close-in demand to close out the year. The robust underlying demand trends, combined with the solid execution of our commercial initiatives, drove the highest full year revenue results in our history despite operational challenges in the first half of the year. As we kick off 2023, we are pleased to see the demand environment remains strong into a seasonally trough period. For the first quarter, we are forecasting revenue to increase between 28% to 32% year-over-year. Looking further ahead, we are excited to continue building on last year's record performance as we expect another strong year of revenue growth ahead of us, underpinned by robust leisure demand and multiple network and commercial initiatives. I am pleased with the early performance of our transatlantic service, which remains ahead of our expectations. Meanwhile, our Mint cabin remains a bright spot with Mint RASM continuing to outperform core, as you would expect, and all of our A321neo deliveries this year are in the Mint configuration. We are also pleased with the early performance of the NEA. Last year, we more than tripled our number of daily flights at LaGuardia compared with pre-pandemic levels, a tremendous amount of growth in a very short period of time. And these new markets will continue to ramp throughout 2023. We expect the earnings contribution from the NEA to increase over the coming years as this service matures. Turning to loyalty. This part of the business is performing exceptionally well and is on a very encouraging long-term trajectory. We saw yet another record in co-brand spend last month and we continue to meet our strong growth targets. Active customer engagement with our TrueBlue program is also at historic highs, reflected in the number of active cardholders and program activity. We achieved our best year ever in program enrollment, which was up 50% year-over-year while co-brand sign-ups were up 40% year-over-year. In December, we also announced the exciting new iteration of TrueBlue, which is launching later this year. Our new program is designed to appeal to a wide variety of customers, whether you are a Mosaic member or travel just once a year. It is a truly differentiated approach to loyalty, as we give more opportunities to all customers to earn rewards faster, drive utility through more options and choice and increase their engagement with the program in TrueBlue. The evolution of our TrueBlue program, including the launch of other airline redemptions and a new credit card portfolio, also supports our evolution to a travel brand, as our customers can earn points and qualify for Mosaic when booking travel beyond just flights. This is an important driver of our multi-year journey to grow this revenue stream as a percentage of our total revenue base and close the gap to best-in-class loyalty performance.  I'll close with another huge thanks to our crew members for going above and beyond every day no matter the circumstances. The investments we have made position us well to reliably deliver the JetBlue experience, and this year is all about execution from planning our operation, to delivering our day of performance and to executing numerous revenue initiatives. And in doing so, we will build a better and stronger JetBlue for all stakeholders. Ursula, I'll now turn the call over to you.\nUrsula Hurley: Thank you, Joanna, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd also like to add my thanks to our dedicated crew members for all of their hard work in closing out the year on a strong note. We achieved another quarter of profitability as our teams delivered for our customers. At the same time, we've been focused on building a 2023 plan to create a stronger JetBlue for all of our stakeholders. Turning to Slide 9. Our return to profitability in the second half of 2022 was an important milestone in our recovery. We effectively navigated a very challenging year, having set ourselves up for success back in the spring with an operational reset. And we've seen vastly improved operational performance and reliability since then. While we are expecting a net loss in the seasonally weaker first quarter, we're very confident that we're on a path to materially improve our financial performance through the remainder of 2023 and deliver a full year adjusted profit. We remain laser-focused on executing the commercial and operational initiatives Joanna outlined plus our ongoing cost discipline. We're pleased to have reached a tentative agreement with ALPA to extend our collective bargaining agreement for two years, which our pilots are currently voting to ratify. This gives us planning certainty, and we believe this deal will ensure JetBlue remains competitive, while facilitating a smooth transition to eventual joint CBA negotiations following our acquisition of Spirit. Our 2023 outlook for CASM ex-fuel and earnings per share assumes the estimated impact of this pilot deal, which is worth approximately one point to CASM ex-fuel in the first quarter and approximately three points for the full year. For the first quarter of 2023, we are forecasting CASM ex-fuel to increase 2% to 4% year-over-year. Our non-fuel unit costs would be up 1% to 3% year-over-year when excluding the impact from the CBA. Importantly, we are still on track to deliver on our prior goal to flat CASM ex-fuel this year when adjusting for the three-point impact of the ALPA deal. Last year, we launched a new structural cost program to help mitigate other cost headwinds and set an optimal cost foundation to support long-term margin expansion. These cost pressures are primarily related to maintenance and rents and landing fees, which are collectively worth a two-point headwind to CASM ex-fuel in 2023 on a year-over-year basis. The structural cost program is well on track to deliver roughly $70 million in cost savings this year and $150 million to $200 million of cost savings through 2024. Our work has already delivered roughly $30 million since launch, and we expect savings to accelerate throughout 2023. Some of the most meaningful drivers of this year's cost savings include improved productivity, optimized maintenance work scopes and enhanced productivity across work groups through our enterprise planning function. We also expect over $40 million of savings through 2023 and $75 million through 2024 from our accelerated transition from E190s to A220s. Combined, this brings total cost savings to $250 million through 2024. In addition to the higher labor costs, we're working hard to offset cost pressures from higher rents and landing fees tied to operating and growing in high-cost terminals across our high-value geography as well as elevated maintenance activity, given the age of our fleet. Turning to liquidity and the balance sheet on slide 10. Recall that we ended the third quarter of 2022 with $2.3 billion in liquidity. And in the fourth quarter, we paid down $114 million of debt, funded $324 million in capital expenditures and made a $272 million prepayment to Spirit's shareholders. We also signed an agreement to become a minority investor in the new JFK Terminal 6, which closed in November. As a result, we ended the year with liquidity of $1.6 billion or 17% of trailing 12-month revenue, excluding our undrawn $600 million revolver. For 2023, we expect cash outflows related to the monthly Spirit shareholder prepayment to total approximately $130 million for the full year. We're forecasting full year 2023 CapEx to be approximately $1.3 billion, consisting mainly of aircraft CapEx as we continue to modernize our fleet. This forecast assumes 19 aircraft deliveries this year. It's worth noting that much of our capacity growth this year will actually come in the form of restoring utilization. So if we do experience further aircraft delivery delays, we don't expect such delays to drive meaningful changes to our full year capacity guidance. We remain very focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity balance. Given continued economic uncertainty and fuel price volatility, we intend to finance a portion of our aircraft deliveries this year rather than using cash. That said, our long-term balance sheet priorities remain unchanged. We plan to generate solid earnings and operating cash flow this year. And following the close of the Spirit transaction, we expect the strong pro forma cash flow profile to support a quick deleveraging of the balance sheet from what we still expect to be a very manageable level at closing. Turning to slide 11 for a recap of our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023. We have discussed most of these guidance ranges already, but I want to touch briefly on fuel, where we continue to see significant volatility in both oil and crack spreads. Last quarter, we executed some fuel hedges to protect against a spike in oil prices. As of today, we have hedged roughly 9% of our planned consumption for the first quarter of 2023 and will continue to be opportunistic going forward to help mitigate our financial risk. Given the volatility in the futures and regional markets, such as New York Harbor Jet fuel, we have decided to provide a range for our fuel price guidance moving forward. To conclude, I'd like to thank our team once again for all of your efforts to position us for long-term success. We're driving continued momentum from the back half of 2022, as we move into a stable and more normalized backdrop this year. I could not be more excited about the path we've laid out. We expect to generate our first full year of profit since the pandemic with an EPS in the range of $0.70 to $1. This guidance implies significant momentum in earnings, as our initiatives ramp and we deliver margins close to 2019 levels later this year. And we believe, our quarterly EPS run rate this year beyond Q1 is a better indication of our normalized earnings power into next year. The strong underlying revenue environment, combined with our continued execution on optimizing costs, gives me great confidence that we are on a path to generating strong margins and enhancing our earnings power. And we will work diligently to prepare for the acquisition of Spirit, which will only build on the strong foundations that we are laying today. I truly believe we are extremely well positioned for significant long-term value creation for our owners and all of our stakeholders. With that, we will now take your questions.\nJoe Caiado: Thanks, everyone. Joanna, we're now ready for the question-and-answer session. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Michael Linenberg at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey good morning everyone. I guess two questions here, Joanna, just first to you. You talked about the NEA and you said you're expecting another year of ramp. I think, Robin, you sort of echoed that as well. Any sort of financial details or anything that you can provide around that to give us a sense of baseline or maybe where it's going? And if you're loath to give us financials, anything maybe like number of passengers who connect per day between the two carriers or maybe one or two or three load factor points on your planes are tied to their American customers, et cetera. Just anything that we can sort of assess how it's ramping? Thanks.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thanks, Michael. Yeah, we're not going to go into the financials. It's obviously still in ramp-up, and we're very in a very good place, given where we are in the trajectory. Maybe a couple of things worth calling out, JFK will be at combined NEA flights 290. In April, we'll be operating 190 of those. LaGuardia will be at a combined 190. We will 52 of those, which triples our daily departures compared to 2019. And then growth, obviously, in Boston as well, will be at 220 in April from a flight departures perspective with JetBlue approaching 150. So we're seeing the NEA very much on the correct trajectory, a strong number of connecting passengers. We can go offline with you on specifics regarding that, but we're very pleased with the performance of the NEA and the acceleration that's given, frankly, to our New York markets and their recovery.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And then just second question to Robin. Just on sustainable aviation fuel, it does seem like that you guys have done -- you've been actually pretty aggressive in going out and sourcing future needs. And I suspect that as we move forward, some of these benchmarks that the administration is pointing various industries toward will become mandates. And it does feel like that we can get to a point where there is very much a real shortage of SAF availability. Where are you on what you need to get to? I think it's 10%, I think a lot of -- is what the industry is aiming toward in 2030. How much of sort of where you are? And what are your thoughts on that about potentially leading to a shortage where carriers will have to rethink about their growth plans and this may be only a few years away?\nRobin Hayes: Hi, Mike, good morning. Great question, and thanks for asking it. Yeah, so to set the baseline, you're right. The industry target in the US is 10% of SAF by 2030. It is going to require a lot of ramp up from where we are today to get there. I think that -- I don't believe that a mandate is on the horizon all required because airlines are very willing to buy this fuel. They're very willing to make commitments. And also in the last year or two, we've seen a lot of willingness from corporate customers as well to participate in some of the additional cost of buying SAF, which is again, making it easier for the airlines to commit and corporate to also continue traveling. So that, together with some of the federal incentives that we saw roll out last year. So I think everything moving in the right direction but there's a lot more that needs to be done. As you would expect, we are in conversations with all the major producers frequently and we're very active in acquiring SAF when we're able to do that.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Savi Syth at Raymond James. Please go ahead. Savi, your line is open. You can proceed with your question.\nSavi Syth: Hey good morning everyone. Thank you. Sorry, I had mute on. Just on the comments around increasing utilization to grow capacity and that should help productivity. Could you provide a little bit more color on how this still compares to 2019, given that it sounds like you still have a lot of conservatism here and what we could expect throughout the year? Does that get better as we head into 2024, or is this kind of a new normal?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. Thanks, Savi. Thanks for the question. So, you will see utilization improving relative to 2022 levels, but we will still be operating at a lower utilization level than 2019. We're very cognizant of the overarching operational environment and the need to ensure that we are protecting the operation. And that includes both aircraft time but also investments we're making around pilots that we made in 2022 that will continue into 2023. I will say, though, those are improving from a productivity standpoint. So we are peeling away some of those investments, but we will not return to 2019 levels from a utilization perspective or from a, for example, pilot resources or some of the buffering in the padding that we're putting in.\nSavi Syth: Joanna, like do you think as you get to the end of 2023, is that what you expect to be kind of the new normal, or are you hoping that just things will ease as the next few years as well with ATC hiring and things like that?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. We're not expecting things are going to ease. I think frankly, two weeks ago was proof positive of some of the challenges that we are experiencing overall in the airspace that we fly into. JetBlue has significantly higher amount of exposure in that -- in the Northeast corridor, where nearly two-thirds of the ATC delays are present. Absent a step change from the FAA in terms of technology or the ability to handle the ATC throughput, we're planning for a more conservative approach. We are very connected with the FAA. They've been great from a transparency perspective and a communication perspective. But at the end of the day, we need to ensure that our operation is protected. So you will see us continue things such as incrementally more reserves, a higher percentage of out back flights that enables a cleaner cancel if we need to when we are in a disruptive situation, trying to base more flying out of crew bases. And then JetBlue is investing in some system improvements as well and have been for quite some time and then obviously, Spirit and diversifying our network. So bottom line for the foreseeable future, you should expect that some of these costs that we laid in, in 2022 will carry through into 2023 and beyond, although they are easing a bit as we return to a new normal, but it will not return to 2019 levels.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And if I might -- just you talked about the TrueBlue revamp as well and it was kind of somewhat unique. I was kind of curious, what's the goal around some of the changes that you made. And how do you expect that to kind of flow through kind of either purchasing behavior or travel behavior?\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. One of the things that we've been focused on is how do we really reward and incentivize all different types of customers, not just the customers who fly us frequently and who are Mosaic but also the customers who are infrequent and try to engage them. So, customers will have the ability to pick the perks that they like, and that includes customers who fly infrequently. We also are providing additional layers of Mosaic levels, which we think will incentivize some of our most loyal customers. But at the end of the day, this is a holistic approach to our loyalty program by bringing benefits to customers who fly JetBlue. And then customers also use the co-brand card, which is such an incremental -- an important part of our loyalty program. If you think of loyalty overall in co-brand, it represented 10% of our total revenue. We continue to see that increase quarter-over-quarter. We're very excited with the positive momentum that we have from co-brand and TrueBlue. The new TrueBlue program will only amplify that momentum that we are seeing.\nSavi Syth: Okay, Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Jamie Baker at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning everybody. So I was impressed that on United's call. Scott gave your operations a shout-out. Just wondering what's really driving the improvement in operational integrity. I know in American's case, paying pilots double time for Thanksgiving and Christmas obviously helped them. I don't recall JetBlue doing that. So was it really just the more cautious scheduling that Joanna mentioned in her prepared remarks, or is there a labor component to the improvement in operations?\nJoanna Geraghty : Yes. Maybe to give you some visibility, Jamie, thanks for the question. There's a few things going on. I think, first, from a planning perspective, we are trying to plan more conservatively, recognizing that we are disproportionately impacted with delays, given the geography that we fly into. So that's kind of the first thing. And that includes everything from increased level of reserves. So when things start to run late, our crew doesn't time out and we can replace crew to protect the operation or, in some cases, double crew if you need to, to some of our one-a-day markets in the Caribbean. A higher percentage of out back flights. That's a really important part of how we plan the schedule, particularly with the airspace we fly into so that if we do get into trouble, we can cleanly cancel a flight. And then as I mentioned to Savi, increasing the number of flying out of places where we have crew bases, which makes it easier to recover and get additional resources when we need to. The other piece that we've been on a multi-year journey around is modernizing the systems that we had in our operations center. I'll use an example. Last year, we introduced a new crew solver, which enables us to repair canceled flights and broken pattering crew pairings more quickly, which ultimately means that we can recover faster and take advantage of the resources that we do have without having those resources time out or lose track of them. So our focus has been on the Blue Sky days. We need to be great. And on the IROP days, the regular operation days where we have, frankly, more than most, we need to better manage how we plan for those days, how we execute day-of and then how we recover. Over the holidays, you saw a very clear focus on driving for completion factor, but also recognizing that when you start seeing lengthy delays, you've got to take quick action and address those lengthy delays so that they don't bleed into the following day and the day after. So it's multi-pronged planning, day of operational execution and then ensuring that our crew members understand and know the plan and are prepared to execute to it.\nJamie Baker: Thanks for all that cadence. And second quick question. American and United both clear that their 2023 forecasts do assume that revenue and GDP recouple to pre-pandemic levels. As a younger growth year airline, I've never really framed JetBlue against this particular measure, but I do wonder if it's something you look at internally when coming up with your forecast for the year?\nDave Clark: Good morning, Jamie, this is Dave. I'll take that one. GDP is an important component in our revenue forecasting so we certainly use it. And for 2023, we have a pretty cautious forecast along with the consensus estimates back there, where we actually have a recession, a mild one for the consensus in the first half of the year and relatively slow growth throughout. But we have not -- we're still looking at a year-over-year basis. We have not pegged our revenue forecast to relinking what we saw pre-COVID. And if we did, there'd be quite a -- or if we see that, there would be quite a bit of upside on revenue. So what you're seeing from JetBlue is just year-over-year GDP combined with the JetBlue-specific revenue initiatives, continued contribution from the NEA, ramp-up of loyalty around JetBlue Travel Products. Those alone get us to our -- the forecast and guidance.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That's very helpful. I'm glad I asked. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Catherine O'Brien at Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks very much for the time. So slightly altering what I wanted to ask, based off your latest response to Jamie, Dave. So you just mentioned that part of what's driving that revenue outlook is improvement in NEA, JetBlue Travel, loyalty, et cetera. Can you just give us how many points of tailwind you think that might be into 2023?\nDave Clark: Good morning, Katie, and thanks for the question. I don't have the exact, in front of me, points of tailwind. We're certainly talking low single digits, so just to give you a general idea of it. The NEA has become measurably margin positive over the past half year, which is terrific. It was more of an investment in the first early days, but it was measurably positive back half of last year and we expect that to continue to accelerate. Probably less than 1 point, but certainly measurable on that front. And then the other piece I just talked about as well is the other big input into the GDP -- excuse me, into the revenue forecast is competitive capacity. And as we think about how competitive capacity ramps up throughout the country as we recover, keep in mind that over half of JetBlue's flying is in slotted airports. And that capacity all came back last year, when they used a rule -- use or lose rules came back into effect. So in those slotted airports, which are half of our flying, there's capacity limitation that might have a disproportionate impact on the competitive capacity we see this year versus the industry at large.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great. And maybe just a related follow-up on the Northeast Alliance. So I might be oversimplifying this, but American just called out on their call, they don't expect any further recovery from contractual corporate travel over this year. And to my understanding, Northeast Alliance is mainly aimed at better serving corporate clients out of Boston and New York. Can you just walk us through where the upside from the Alliance comes to JetBlue if contractual corporate revenue is expected to stay at current levels? Thanks so much for the time.\nDave Clark: Sure. Thanks, Katie. And overall, we have a relatively small part of our total revenue coming out of contracted corporate shares, so this is a smaller pool for us than the industry at large. We are seeing measurably in our internal data, as well as in the public data that's out there that JetBlue is taking share from, in the Northeast as a benefit of this. So we're seeing it in our new accounts. We're seeing a higher share from our existing accounts, and it's a bit visible in the public data, which is, of course, delayed versus what we have proprietarily. So as we continue to see the Northeast ramp back up, we expect to see a bigger pie in general and then with JetBlue's added share, that will certainly help us grow in these geographies a bit more than the industry overall.\nJoanna Geraghty: I'll also add from JetBlue's perspective, this isn't just about growing business. It's also about growing leisure for JetBlue. If you look at the route announcement we've made, we are collectively growing business, but also leisure and VFR routes. So in all scenarios, we would be better off with the NEA than without the NEA. And there's flexibility within that. So you've seen a number of new route announcements out of LaGuardia that are beginning later this spring. That's reflecting a pivot to some more leisure destinations. So at the end of the day, this is for JetBlue and think about our network footprint in JFK specifically and, to a lesser degree, in LaGuardia, this is about both business, but also very importantly, leisure.\nCatherine O'Brien: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Dan McKenzie at Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nDan McKenzie: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. So a couple of questions here. The last comment in the script regarding earnings momentum later this year, leading to, I think you said, normalized earnings power next year or something to that extent. Are you using 2019 as a proxy for what normalized margins could look like? And, I guess, the reason I ask is, they range from basically 10% to 20% in the last cycle. So I'm just wondering if 2019 is a fair proxy or perhaps something a little better than that.\nUrsula Hurley: Hi, Dan. Thanks for the question. So I was referencing, as we continue to build momentum throughout 2023 and the back half of this year, our intent is to build our margins close, very close to 2019 levels. So that's the first benchmark, right, coming out of COVID is achieving a margin level equivalent to pre-COVID, with the intent beyond 2023 continuing to grow margins over the long-term. So we have a lot of conviction in our top-line forecast and the JetBlue-specific revenue initiatives as well as delivering on the structural cost to get back up to those 2019 margin levels in the back half of this year.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. And then, I guess, following up on Jamie's question, the embedded in the outlook this year is continued contributions from the NEA. I know you expect to win the case and based on how it played out in court, my sense is JetBlue will probably win as well. But if there is an adverse decision, what's built into the full year capacity and revenue guide? And should we expect it to change based on a potential adverse decision?\nRobin Hayes: Hi, Dan, it's Robin. I'll take that. Look, we felt good about the case that we put forward. I don't really want to speculate on the downside because one, we felt we put a very case forward -- a good case forward. I think everyone in Boston and New York is enjoying more JetBlue flying as a result of the NEA. They've seen more routes. And back to the question earlier, it's largely leisure because they were all -- there were some leisure markets out of New York that we never had the ability to serve before without taking away from something else, and we can do that now. So, so many people have enjoyed the lower fares and the more choice. So it's hard to foresee a negative outcome. It is possible, clearly. It's going to be down to the judge and he's going to make a decision. And I think that if that comes to pass, we'll look at it. There's a number of options and we'll deal with it. But we're focused right now on hoping for a positive outcome and continuing the momentum behind the NEA because it will so much more competition and so much more benefits to everyone in the New York and Boston catchment areas.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Understood. Thanks for the time, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth at Evercore. Please go ahead. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hi. Thanks. I appreciate the questions. Just on fuel, which I guess was marked on the 13th of January, how do you calculate the jet crack spread? And if you calculated that today or yesterday or something before you were in the crush of earnings, where would you estimate that to be in a more recent time frame? And is there any hedge benefit embedded in the fuel guidance?\nUrsula Hurley: Good morning, Duane. So you're correct. We marked fuel on January 13 and this is consistent the same day that we historically marked fuel for our Q4 earnings call. If we were to mark as of this past Friday on the 20th, we would have about a $0.15 higher impact in the first quarter. So that's just about over one point of margin in the first quarter. On a full year basis, we're obviously still within the upper end of our range, even marking to last Friday, the 20th. How we mark fuel, so the prompt 12 weeks are off of the forward curve. And then beyond those 12 weeks, we actually use Bloomberg consensus. And the latter part of your question, there is a small hedge benefit vetted into the first quarter due to the 9% hedges that we have in place.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Great. And then maybe one for Robin. As you work down the path of the Spirit merger and learn more along the way, both about the process and about Spirit, any change in thinking about how complex this is going to be? I guess a different way to ask it, anything you learned that you wish you knew at the beginning of the process?\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Duane. No, I mean, I think as you know, these are incredibly complicated affairs. I think the good news is that there are a lot who have gone before us. And we're always able to -- when you're following somebody else, you're always able to learn from what worked and what didn't work. We already have our integrated management team in place. There's a number of work streams going on. We have a team appointed. And I couldn't be more delighted with some of the work that's already underway to prepare for this. We are working on an assumption of regulatory close in 2024. We also have to go through a single operating certificate process. In recent mergers, that's been a 12 to 18-month time line after close, but you can start preparing for it now, which we have started to do. And we've got a pretty good understanding of the sequencing of decisions and what decisions we need to take, when to make this process as efficient as we can. So, overall, it's early. There's a lot of wood to chop, but I couldn't be more pleased with the start that we've made. And the partnership between the JetBlue and Spirit teams has just been excellent.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Conor Cunningham at Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hi everyone. Thank you for the time. Just on Duane's question on fuel. I'm just curious, 40% of your fuel, I think, has historically been sourced in New York and that market's been particularly volatile recently. And I think there may be some more volatility coming up. There's a refinery going offline. I'm just curious, if you've thought about how you may source fuel differently in the future. Or is that -- is it just a function of where you're flying out of mostly in [indiscernible]?\nUrsula Hurley: Yes. Thanks for the question, Conor. You're extremely correct in terms of the volatility has been pretty significant. Historically, New York Harbor has ranged anywhere from $0.07 to $0.08. And just here, last year, the average was about $0.48, and in January, we're sitting at about $0.53. So we actually go through an annual tender process, whereby which we determine which markets and which lines and indexes to purchase fuel on. So there is a potential opportunity for us to shift, if it's cost effective, some of our purchasing off of New York Harbor, just given that it continues to be extremely volatile. So we do go through an annual process and we'll evaluate that mid-year.\nConor Cunningham : Okay. Hopefully, it didn't add too much work for Joe. Just on the cost cadence throughout the year. When we think about -- I'm just trying to figure out if there's any lumpiness in maybe your maintenance schedules or anything like that. Like does it -- is it pretty smooth throughout the year? And then is there an offset from the structural cost program that kind of matches up with a lot of that, so it's, again, like a smooth CASM ex profile? And then just thinking about the exit rate there. Like why -- I mean, assuming that not taking account of your pilot deal, but just like assuming how that would trend throughout the year as you think about it into the fourth quarter. I realize there's a lot there, but if you could just provide some context on it. Thank you.\nUrsula Hurley : I think that was about five different questions, Conor.\nConor Cunningham : Right.\nUrsula Hurley : In regards to CASM ex in 2023, 1H versus 2H, there's about a one point step-up in the second half of the year. And that's driven by two factors. Number one, we do have a pilot CBA pay rate step-up in the fourth quarter. And we also have some lumpiness in regards to the timing of our maintenance spend, which is typical, right? So those are two items that are the main drivers in the one point increase between 1H and 2H. The structural cost program builds pretty consistently throughout the year. So by the end of the year, our intent is to achieve the $70 million in run rate savings. And there's really not much lumpiness to that. Like I said, it's pretty consistent between 1H and 2H.\nRobin Hayes : Hey, I guess just to give -- because I think all the questions on cost are very -- have been very well put. And I know Joanna touched on this earlier and it's come up with other airlines. But just to kind of help people understand the sort of the investment going into some of the benefits around reducing operational risk. So Joanna talked about the ability to have more pilot reserves and starting up pilot. So approximately every 5% of additional pilots that you're hiring to fly the same schedule you had before, that's going to be just over one point of CASM in the year. Every time you take utilization down two points what you had before, that's about one point of CASM in terms of the impact. So these investments are quite meaningful, and that's why you're seeing them in the underlying CASM. And we do have optionality over time to dial some of those back, and Joanna alluded to some of that being dialed back this year. But I'm not sure that we can run certainly this airline like we did in 2019. And so we're going to have to be very measured and very thoughtful, and frankly find other opportunities in the cost structure to allow us continuing to make these investments. We have seen the benefit. Now you do see other benefits with these investments. So if you have higher completion factor, you have more on-time performance, that's going to help your operating cost. You'll protect more revenue because you'll be able -- have less in vouchers or refunds or travel credit. So the benefits are there, but it's going to, I think, mean a different revenue and cost profile in terms of where you spend, how you spend and where you see the revenue benefit to perhaps what we used to pre-2019. So there are opportunities over time to bring those costs back down, but we're going to have to tread into it very carefully to make sure that we're not, sort of, going back to some of the challenges that we saw and others saw earlier in 2022.\nConor Cunningham: Appreciate the context.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Helane Becker at Cowen. Please, go ahead. Helane, your line is open. You may proceed with your question.\nHelane Becker: Right. Thanks very much operator. Robin, on the Spirit, I get a lot of questions from arbs who don't understand why you are planning for a first quarter or first half 2024 close, when it seems perfectly obvious to me that it would be in the second half -- first half of next year versus second half of this year. So maybe you could go through some of the hurdles that you have to go through before you can get the approval.\nRobin Hayes: Well, yes, so I mean, there's really two outcomes. We're able to reach an agreement with the Department of Justice. And if we do that, it's possible that could happen sooner, but the time line is down to the Department of Justice, and we certainly want to be respectful of that. The second scenario is that we don't get an agreement with the Department of Justice and they decide to sue us, and we go to court as we did in the NEA. And that process can take several months to go through. And so, I think, for both of those reasons, an assumption on closing this transaction in the first part of 2024 is the right one to make.\nHelane Becker: Yes. That makes sense. Thank you. And then, as we think about the balance sheet, this one's probably for Ursula, is there an opportunity to accelerate debt paydown, or is that not something you would consider?\nUrsula Hurley: Good morning, Helane. We have a significant CapEx commitment this year. We have $1.3 billion. We also have approximately $130 million associated with the Spirit prepayment. And then in addition to that, we have regular scheduled debt payments. So it's actually a pretty meaningful cash outflow this year. And given that, we're pivoting our strategy to go from purchasing aircraft with cash to financing. So the intent is to fund the business, but also build a healthy cushion to help support the purchase and the integration of Spirit as well. So at this point in time, we're not looking at potential debt paydowns. I would also note, our weighted average cost of debt is extremely competitive. And given where rates are today, we're actually probably in a more beneficial place than paying down low-cost debt. So the answer to your question is no, we're going to fund the business this year and prepare for the integration.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Ursula.\nOperator: Thank you. And the last question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos at Susquehanna International Group. Please, go ahead.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning, everyone. So, Joanna or Ursula, on the capacity guide for 2023, could you break out the moving pieces there, so departure, stage engage? I know you spoke about utilization driving a big piece of that. And then it also sounds like, again, I think you said this on the -- or you suggested this on your last call, but clearly calling it out this time is that, it sounds like the ASM guide for this year is essentially derisked as it relates to delays in aircraft. So am I interpreting that correctly?\nUrsula Hurley:  Sure, so maybe I'll start. So the full year guide is 5.5% to 8.5% so midpoint of 7%. The majority of this, as I noted in my script, is driven by utilization. So utilization is going to be up compared to 2022 as well as 2019. As Joanna highlighted, utilization will not yet get back to 2019 levels, given we are planning conservatively. In relation to the aircraft deliveries that we're taking this year, the planning assumption is 19. I'll note, they're very back weighted, so we take five in the first half of this year and then the remainder in the second half of this year. So my commentary in the script is even if some of those deliveries in the back half of this year end up slipping, we don't view our full year capacity guidance at any risk. So that's generally how to think about the full year guide. In terms of gauge and stage, stage is coming down slightly on a full year basis year-over-year, and gauge is going up slightly on a year-over-year basis. So all-in-all, we feel extremely confident in the full year guide.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you. And then on my follow-up, again, Ursula or Joanna. So the planning more conservatively with respect to the scheduling, and you talked about flying out of points there, emphasizing where their crew base is and to drive operational stability integrity. So is this part of what the transition plan, if you will, for this year, or is this the new go-forward operating plan? And if so, and I think Robin was implying to this in the comment from two questions ago, contemplated with how you're thinking about your long-term RASM and CASM ex-assumptions? Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, so I'll take it and then I'll flip it to Dave on the RASM assumption. So this is contemplated in our longer-term planning view. Unless there is a step change in capabilities that we see within the airspace that we fly. Two-thirds of the delays in the US, in the national aerospace in the US are largely in JetBlue's network. And so these planning assumptions contemplate that it stays relatively the same with like modest improvements, but nothing substantial because we just don't see a step change in capabilities coming in the next few years. Dave, on the RASM?\nDave Clark: Sure. And just to go a bit deeper, Chris, I mean, some of the things we're doing around scheduling more out of crew bases has just been swapping of aircraft type. For example, we've largely moved our E190 flying out of Florida as we soon will no longer have E190 crew bases there, whereas we used to fly a lot from non-base locations in Florida before then. So that's one example. Also working very closely across departments to plan further ahead, years ahead. So when we think about big infrastructure that we'll need, we're planning it earlier with both the revenue in mind as well as the operating team. So I think it's just good additional robustness we're doing. I don't expect material RASM impact from any of this, but I do expect better, sort of, cost and just general efficiency as we have more robust cross-functional planning even further ahead than today.\nJoanna Geraghty: And I think if you look at the holiday period, that very much played out in terms of the strong completion factor performance we had and our ability to deliver on the revenue plan that we had. And so to Robin's point, this is the new normal for the foreseeable future, and we're going to plan this way. And there are benefits that we will see play out in completing the schedule and not incurring many of the costs that you would otherwise incur if you're running late and/or having to cancel flights and the revenue cost.\nRobin Hayes: I mean, I'll give you a real life example. Let's talk about last night. So we had weather come into the Northeast. We were in ground delay programs and ground stops at all the New York airports. The ground delay program at JFK reached over 3.5 hours, which means every domestic flight coming into JFK last night had an average of 3.5 hours of delay. There were 749 cancellations in and out of the US yesterday. JetBlue was three of those. So our ability to kind of complete that schedule because we have planned more resiliently, executed whether on night, clearly drives the benefit of having not to refund those tickets, not at the expense of rebooking those customers. And I think the operational -- a more conservative operational philosophy change is just not how we have to think about operational costs, but over time, will drive some benefit on the commercial side as well.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Great. Thank you.\nJoe Caiado: Great. Well, thanks, everyone. That concludes our fourth quarter 2022 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our thoughts are with all of those affected by the recent hurricanes in the Southeast and the Caribbean, including many of our crew members, customers and their loved ones. As always, supporting our crew members and the communities is a top priority after devastating events like these, and we know it's going to be a long road to recovery for several impacted regions. JetBlue is working with nonprofit partners such as World Central Kitchen, to ship supplies and assist with relief efforts. And alongside our JetBlue Crewmember Crisis Fund, we're working to provide support for our crew members who were hardest hit, and we're going to stay with them every step of the way. I'd like to thank our more than 24,000 crew members for their dedication, patience and service. I am always amazed at how our crew members step up in these challenging times to care for each other and the communities we serve, prioritizing safety above all else. Our crew members also helped deliver another record quarter of revenue, resulting in our first quarterly profit since the start of the pandemic. Despite the macroeconomic uncertainty, we are building momentum in the second half of the year, and I'm confident that we're on a path to continue increasing our margins as we bring our low fare, award-winning JetBlue experience to more customers. Let's now turn to our quarterly results on Slide 4 of the deck. For the third quarter, we reported an adjusted pretax income of $118 million, adjusted pretax margin of 4.6% and an adjusted earnings per share of $0.21. The changes we made earlier this year to enhance operational resourcing and the resilience of our schedule resulted in strong operational performance over the summer peak despite significant weather and air traffic control challenges and record customer demand. We've made excellent strides on hiring, and we're now at a point where we believe we are appropriately resourced from a staffing perspective, which in turn should translate to improved productivity. Looking ahead, we expect our momentum to continue through to another solid quarter of mid-single-digit pretax margins in the fourth quarter. We'll look to build margins further in 2023 as we continue to restore our pre-pandemic earnings power. We continue to see a very healthy revenue environment with no signs of slowing demand for air travel.  Moving now to Slide 5. Our teams are diligently working on the strategic initiatives driving our earnings recovery and enhancing our business for the long term. We're fortifying our unique business model to more effectively compete within trenched Big Four carriers and deliver significant consumer benefits as we continue to disrupt the market. It starts with our network. Our Northeast Alliance, which has been up and running for more than 1.5 years is fundamentally about growing capacity in consumer choice, and it has promoted competition in both New York and Boston. By all measures, JetBlue and American are delivering substantial consumer benefits with the launch of dozens of new routes, increased frequencies on over 100 additional routes and improved schedule offering and reciprocal frequent flyer benefits for our customers. Again, this growth would not be possible without the NEA, and consumers are further benefiting from the clear, competitive response that we have stimulated. The NEA is doing what it set out to do, giving consumers more choice and better value. And we look forward to continuing to expand these benefits. Outside of the NEA, I'm extremely pleased with the recent Spirit shareholder approval for our combination, which will create value for all of our stakeholders. Together, we'll build a low fare challenger to the dominant Big Four airlines on a national scale and expand our compelling combination of award-winning service and low fares to more customers across more destinations. On the transatlantic front, by the end of this week, we'll offer 5 daily flights between the Northeast and London. And we look forward to taking delivery of a handful of Airbus 321LR aircraft next year to support our expansion to Europe, notwithstanding some modest delivery delays. Stay tuned for an announcement in the near future. Customer engagement with JetBlue remains at record levels, and we continue to see healthy spend on our co-branded credit cards. Our loyalty program is producing record cash flows, which is a testament to our customer value proposition. Separately, our JetBlue Travel Product subsidiary continues to innovate with the launch of True, a free group planning app to help groups decide when to travel, where to go and what to do, building on efforts to make the travel experience more seamless. JetBlue Travel Products is on track to generate close to $100 million of EBIT this year compared to $15 million in 2019. We also continue to make great progress on the structural cost program we announced last quarter, which Ursula will discuss shortly in more detail. We made further progress on the ESG front, with an agreement to purchase 25 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel starting in 2027 from Air Company, one of the JetBlue Ventures investments. We're committed to growing and diversifying our SaaS supply as we progress towards our goal of converting 10% of our jet fuel usage to SAP by 2030. We also appalled the International Civil Aviation Organization, or ICAO, for endorsing a net 0 by 2050 goal for international aviation emissions, an important milestone that U.S. airlines had already voluntarily committed to. We expect this will continue to drive the investments in technological innovation needed to enable our industry to continue to grow sustainably. I'll close with another huge thank you to our crew members. Thank you for all of your hard work, your patience. We're building strong momentum, and I'm excited about the journey that lies ahead.  With that, over to you, Joanna.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. I'd like to also add my thanks to our fantastic team for their dedication in delivering for our customers through a very challenging summer and the most recent hurricanes. I'm extremely proud of how they've stepped up to support each other and/or impacted communities as we recover from the recent storms.  Turning to capacity on Slide 7. In the third quarter of 2022, our capacity was down 0.5% year over 3% compared with our most recent guidance for flat capacity. Hurricanes Fiona and Ian impacted our flown capacity by roughly 0.7 point. Throughout the quarter, our teams executed well, particularly in the context of significant ATC constraints, resulting in a strong completion factor. For the fourth quarter, we expect capacity to be up 1% to 4% year over three, a modest sequential step up versus the third quarter. Full year 2022 capacity growth is now expected to be up 0% to 2% year three.  Looking ahead, we expect the aviation ecosystem to continue to remain fragile, given supply chain challenges and ATC staffing headwinds. Therefore, we are maintaining a continued bias towards more conservative planning assumptions in the medium term, such as carrying higher levels of reserves versus 2019 to ensure that we are set up for operational success. During the third quarter, we expanded our transatlantic service with new daily service between Boston and London. And we plan to add a third frequency between JFK and London later this week. As we think about our growth plans for 2023, we expect to return to our historical growth rate of mid- to high single-digit growth year-over-year. As Robin mentioned, we will soon be announcing our next European destination as we build even more relevance in our largest Northeast-focused cities. And we also expect to grow our other focus cities as we take delivery of next-generation Airbus 220s and 321neo aircraft and replace our older E190s.  Turning to Slide 8. In the third quarter, we delivered the highest quarterly revenue result in JetBlue's history. Our revenue per available seat mile increased 23.4% year over three, at the high end of our original expectations. Hurricane Ian was a net neutral impact to our unit revenues in the third quarter as revenue was offset by reduced capacity. Throughout the quarter, we saw strong leisure and VFR demand trends. We were particularly pleased to see load factor in the off-peak month of September increased approximately 3 points above 2019 levels. We see these positive trends continuing here in the fourth quarter, and we are confident strong demand will continue through the upcoming holiday peaks. As a further proof point, ancillary revenue per customer grew over 50% year over three in the third quarter as our varied product offerings and low prices continue to resonate extremely well with our customers. For the fourth quarter, we expect unit revenue to increase between 15% and 19% year over three. This includes a 5-point impact from Hurricanes Fiona and Ian, the placement of the holidays this year and tough loyalty comps. Our strong revenue performance continues to be bolstered by our commercial initiatives. We've unlocked immense consumer benefits through our Northeast Alliance, which is rooted in providing customers with more choice as a true third competitor in the Northeast. Crucially, we're growing supply in the Northeast with NEA growth well outpacing overall domestic industry capacity, launching new destinations, adding flights to others, enhancing our schedules and allowing our loyalty customers the ability to benefit from 2 different programs. In addition, we've seen the entrenched carriers respond by matching our new destinations as well as expanding their own service, boosting competition in the region and benefiting consumers. The Northeast Alliance also enables JetBlue to provide another compelling option for business travelers, with the best network and schedules in the region. We were pleased to see business travel step up again post Labor Day following the typical summer low in July and August and continue to recover towards pre-pandemic levels. Our contracted corporate revenue bookings are now roughly 90% recovered compared with roughly 80% at the end of the second quarter, aided by our Northeast Alliance, which is helping us capture a greater share of corporate customers in the Northeast, which has yet to be fully recovered. On the loyalty front, I'm pleased to see program engagement at record highs, as evidenced by spend growth persistently w ell above pre-pandemic levels. Last month, we hit a new record in co-brand acquisitions, and our portfolio of accounts is set to expand by over 25% year-over-year. As a testament to the outstanding traction we've made in closing the revenue gap to peers, loyalty revenue now represents roughly 10% of our total revenue compared to approximately 7% in 2019.  As I've said before, we are in the early innings of the multiyear evolution of our loyalty program, and we could not be more excited for its growth. Before closing, I would like to highlight that although we are seeing no indications of any type of drop-off in air travel demand, we are keeping a very close eye on the macroeconomic environment. As we look to 2023, we take comfort in the fact that the U.S. economy is much larger than it was prior to the pandemic, while industry capacity is still below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that our industry's experience with a potential 2023 economic downturn could look quite different than historical downturns. For JetBlue specifically, our business model has evolved significantly since the last downturn as we have built a more segmented strategy that appeals to a wide spectrum of customers. Our ancillary revenue base has also grown and proved stable even through the pandemic. And of course, capacity is the biggest lever we have.  Thank you again to our crew members for all of the hard work during an exceptionally busy summer and for taking care of our customers and each other. Now I'll turn the call over to you, Ursula.\nUrsula Hurley: Thank you, Joanna. I'd also like to thank our incredible crew members for always stepping up to tackle the numerous challenges that arise in our industry and safely delivering the JetBlue experience for all our customers through it all. Despite all of the challenges from extreme weather events to external staffing pressures to record fuel prices, we've remained focused on what we can control, and we are taking action to forge a strong cost trajectory that supports our margin expansion and value creation over the long term.  I'll start on Slide 11 with a brief overview of our financial results for the quarter. Revenue per available seat mile was up 23.4% year over three. Cost per available seat mile was up 32.4% year over three. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, was up 16.3% year over three, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.18 and adjusted earnings per share was $0.21. I'm very proud of the team's execution in delivering a profitable third quarter, a very important milestone for us. We exceeded our original revenue guidance, maintained CASM ex-fuel in line with our initial outlook despite the impact from hurricanes and continued pressure tied to ATC staffing challenges, and we delivered a solid pretax margin result in our first quarter of profitability since the pandemic. We've overcome many hurdles in our past, improved our operational performance, generated record revenue and laid plans to improve our cost trajectory. Looking ahead, we expect to build on our momentum and deliver another profitable quarter in Q4.  Turning to Slide 12. During the third quarter, CASM ex-fuel increased 16.3% versus 2019. The impact from the hurricanes was roughly 1 point to CASMx in the third quarter. In addition, we continue to build more resiliency into the operation, which pressured CASM. Separately, ongoing Spirit-related transaction expenses, combined with E190 fleet transition costs, were approximately $13 million in the third quarter, which we exclude from CASM ex-fuel.  For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting CASM ex-fuel to increase 8.5% to 10.5%. The year over three growth rate in CASM ex-fuel is improving by 7 points sequentially from Q3 to Q4 or 5 points after adjusting for capacity as we peel back some of the operational investments from the summer while maintaining a conservative approach to planning as we enter 2023. We're also benefiting from early progress on our structural cost program and savings from early E190 retirements. We're tightening our full year 2022 CASM ex-fuel forecast to an increase of 13% to 14% year over three versus our prior guidance of an 11% to 14% increase.  Turning to Slide 13. Last quarter, we announced 2 initiatives designed to help us deliver a flattish unit cost trajectory. First, our structural cost program, which we expect to drive $150 million to $200 million of cost reductions through 2024; and secondly, the acceleration of our E190 retirements. Today, we're deep into our annual planning cycle. And as we look ahead to 2023, we remain committed to keeping our nonfuel unit cost flat or better year-over-year in support of our continued margin recovery. You'll recall that next year, we're facing several cost headwinds as we manage through the timing of a number of expensive heavy maintenance visits as well as airport cost pressures related to upgrading to new terminals across our network. These major headwinds are in part what the new structural cost program was envisioned to help offset in addition to the 3 years of inflationary pressures currently in the cost base. We're driving a strong sequential improvement in ex-fuel unit costs in the fourth quarter with some benefit from maintenance timing, but most importantly, due to the early returns we're seeing from our new structural cost program. Specifically, we're gaining traction with our enterprise planning effort, producing crew efficiencies and improvements in soft time without sacrificing operability and with our maintenance optimization initiative, as we work to minimize the investment in some of our older engines in our fleet. In addition, we're seeing savings from the accelerated retirement of our E190 fleet having already parked 5 of these aircraft to date. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 14. In the third quarter, we paid down $66 million of debt, funded $260 million in capital expenditures and paid a $25 million break fee related to the Spirit transaction. At the end of September, our adjusted debt to cap was 53%, and we closed the quarter with liquidity of $2.3 billion or 28% of 2019 revenue. This excludes our revolving credit facility, which we recently increased to $600 million, ensuring JetBlue has the flexibility to navigate in an uncertain environment. Separately, we've also layered on fuel hedges for roughly 27% of our consumption for Q4 to protect against oil exceeding $100 a barrel. We view these hedges as a form of insurance to help mitigate financial risk and we'll continue to monitor the market regularly to help derisk our earnings profile.  Our full year 2022 CapEx forecast remains unchanged at approximately $1 billion. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect our CapEx to increase consistent with our order book as we work through renewing our fleet over the next several years. While we recognize that aircraft deliveries are a moving target given OEM production challenges and delays, we believe our mid- to high single-digit growth target next year is achievable based on what we know today. As Robin mentioned, we're thrilled that Spirit shareholders overwhelmingly voted for our proposed transaction with Spirit last week, which triggered the prepayment of $272 million to Spirit shareholders here in the fourth quarter. We're making good progress on the regulatory front, and we expect to receive regulatory approval and close the transaction by the first half of 2024.  Finally, our balance sheet today remains one of the strongest in the industry, enabling us to pursue the acquisition of Spirit to create a national low-fare challenger to the Big Four. Post-closing, we expect a very manageable leverage position, and we expect the enhanced pro forma earnings and cash flow generation to help us quickly delever again.  To close, I'd like to thank our teams once again for taking care of all of our stakeholders and for helping steer JetBlue towards sustained and growing profitability. With the game-changing moves we've made, including the Northeast Alliance, our evolving loyalty program, our new structural cost program and a planned combination with Spirit, I could not be more excited about our future. We are on the right path to transform our long-term earnings power and create value for all of our stakeholders.  With that, we will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Can I ask if you could provide an update on kind of the staffing levels here in 2022? And what you're seeing in terms of attrition? And maybe what your plans are for 2023, given it seems like you're taking maybe 2 to 3x more aircraft in 2023 than you did this year?\nJoanna Geraghty: Savi, thanks for the question. It's Joanna. So in terms of overall staffing, we're pleased with the progress we've made. We're actually seeing, I think, some good normalization of staffing levels overall across most of our work groups. We are also seeing attrition across most of our other work groups slow in the last several months, which is also fantastic. Maybe I'll do a double click on pilots because I think that's probably where folks want to hear us offer a view or 2.  So with regard to pilots, we have a very strong pipeline, but we continue to plan for elevated levels of pilot attrition and for -- on excess reserves so that we can ensure we're protecting the operation during what we believe will continue to be a constrained ATC environment. For 2022, we're tracking to hire close to 1,000 pilots. That number remains largely unchanged for 2023. That is inclusive of attrition. And then obviously, we're in the midst of moving the 190 fleet out, so that also drives some incremental pilots as we transition fleets.  So we think from an opportunity perspective on the cost side, this is where as ATC, hopefully, over the next year or so begins to normalize. And hopefully, as attritioning is normalize, there'll be some opportunity here in terms of slowing that hiring pace. But again, we're on track to hire pilot front at least 1,000 for this year and into next.\nSavi Syth: That's super helpful color, Joanna. And Ursula, maybe just on that, if I may follow up on your CapEx comment, are you able to provide a little more color on CapEx given I don't think ever as many deliveries this year as next year. So do you expect like a big step up? Or how should we think about the CapEx?\nUrsula Hurley : Sure, Savi. As we're all well aware, the OEMs are struggling with challenges in terms of ramp-ups and manpower and supply chain. So we've been working hand-in-hand with Airbus on staying close to any delivery delays. As you've seen in our update today in regards to next year, contractually, we're supposed to take 29 deliveries. From a planning assumption perspective we're expecting 22. So in terms of CapEx, this year, we're expecting $1 billion. Next year, I think a logical assumption is we'll be anywhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. However, I think this is going to continue to remain fluid as we work with Airbus over the next 18 months or so in managing the delays. I also want to reiterate, even with the planning assumption with the 22 aircraft, we still believe that we can achieve our mid- to high single growth rate in 2023.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So the TRASM guidance implies a pretty big drop on an absolute basis. Just any color there? Is that just seasonality? Are you seeing anything in terms of -- I know you said demand, you're not seeing any changes there, but anything with fares or cancellations? Just any color on the sequential drop in TRASM?\nJoanna Geraghty: Thanks for the question. So maybe a little color. First and foremost, we're not seeing any cracks in underlying demand, extremely strong as we step into Q4 across all geographies, led by our VFR markets followed by Mint and transcon, all of which are performing very well. We're seeing both positive load factors, positive RASM as well in all of those and then obviously positive fare. So we're really pleased with the underlying demand environment. What you're seeing from Q3 to Q4 are a few things. I'll flip it to Dave to walk through the specifics. But you're seeing the December holiday shift, specifically with a shorter peak period for that Christmas holiday. You're also seeing a modest impact from Hurricanes Fiona, Ian; on Puerto Rico, the DR and Florida. And then you're seeing a comp issue with regard to loyalty. We had a very, very strong loyalty number in Q4 of 2019. So you're seeing a slight decrease there, but loyalty, as we noted in the script, remains extremely strong in absolute terms. So there's a 5-point difference Q3 to Q4. But other than that, the demand trends underlying all of that remain extremely strong, just these 3 items that are bit of a put and take.  Dave, maybe you want to give a little color to the 3?\nDave Clark : Sure. And I think you covered it well. Demand very strong, just 3 transitory items here that are pushing a headwind of about 5 points for Q4, and they're all roughly the same size in terms of the magnitude. As mentioned, loyalty, some choppiness from 2019. There were some one-timers there in Q4 2019 and then just some ongoing choppiness in the sort of ongoing strength as we continue to build our loyalty, but extremely happy with how loyalty is performing. We continue to have very high growth both on a quarter-over-quarter basis and a year over three. So no concerns at all just a hard comp in 2019. On the holiday placement, I think some other airlines have called this out as well with regards to the weekday placement with Christmas on a Sunday leads to an outbound about 3 days later than you've had in 2019 given school calendars in the Northeast, which is where the largest chunk of our customers originate from. And then lastly, on the hurricanes, it was actually both Ian and Fiona. Obviously, Fort Myers was the most impacted from a revenue perspective, but we had the opportunity to redeploy some of that capacity for the Q4 peaks. And we did set some capacity for the trough in Q4. And then Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic did have some lingering effects from Fiona, which passed in late September. The volumes are completely back, but we have seen, especially in Puerto Rico, a lower fare trajectory than we're seeing before the hurricane. It's improving week on week, and Puerto Rico is fully open for business and a great experience for a tourist. So no concerns here. But we have seen that fair sort of creep back a little bit each week, but it's still about 10 and 20 points below where it was. So all transitory items and no concern at all with the underlying demand.\nScott Group: Okay. And just secondly, the fuel hedging, just the rationale on why you're starting it, is it just Q4 or is some of this -- are you hedging anything for '23 at this point?\nUrsula Hurley : Thanks for the question, Scott. So we're constantly monitoring the market over the last 18 months or so, it's been pretty costly to enter the hedging market. We saw a window of opportunity a few months back to layer in some hedges to protect against fuel volatility here in the fourth quarter. It's something that we'll continue to monitor going forward. As a reminder, we view fuel hedging as insurance, and we utilize hedging to protect against extreme volatility in oil prices. So as we enter 2023, you can expect us to continue to monitor the market and potentially layer in future hedges.\nScott Group: But at this point, is there anything for '23 hedged?\nUrsula Hurley : We do not have any hedges for 2023 at this point.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker : Sorry, if I missed this, I fell off the line. But when does your locked-in deal financing expire? I'm just trying to understand if there's a delay with the deal at what point would you be exposed to current rates?\nUrsula Hurley : So the bridge financing that we currently have in place has the current expiration of mid-2024. As a reminder, we're not currently drawn on the bridge. We are paying a small commitment fee for that bridge. And as you recall, when we receive regulatory approval, at that point in time, we will look at the potential takeout financing markets. And so I remind everyone, the financing markets at that point in time could look very different compared to where we sit today.\nJamie Baker : Okay. That's helpful. And then for 2023, ex-fuel CASM flat or better, I assume there's no specific allowance in there for any movement on the pilot contract. If I just look at Alaska's fall 2023 rates, looks like it's about 12% higher than your current rates, recognizing that other deals may be struck between now and then?\nUrsula Hurley : So our flat-to-better CASM ex-fuel guidance for next year for planning purposes, does not assume any change to our current CBA. Unlike a lot of the contracts that are currently open, ours is actually just opened. We are at the negotiation table, working through the complexity of a potential update to the CBA. And so from a planning perspective, as of right now, we're assuming the CBA -- no changes to the current CBA for next year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Just a follow-up to that last question. Does your 2024 CASM assumption assume any change in the CBA?\nUrsula Hurley : So we haven't provided any CASM ex-fuel guidance yet for 2024.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. I thought the flattish -- I thought in the presentation you said flattish CASM ex-fuel through 2024. So I was just wondering if there's anything in pilots for 2 years out.\nUrsula Hurley : Got it. So our structural cost program, we've committed -- as a result of the structural cost program, our intent is to deliver flattish CASM ex-fuel over the next multi-year period. So as I mentioned, 2023 does not include a change to the CBA. And so -- and in addition to that, we have not yet provided 2024 guidance. But our goal is to get back to that flattish on a multiyear -- over a multiyear period.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Robin, just strategically, how do you think the competitive dynamics change on the transatlantic over the next several years? I ask because I think the CEO of the U.S. ULCC said that he's considering transatlantic flights as the XLR is delivered, I would think other ULCCs may do the same. Just curious to get your thoughts on how you think the transatlantic evolves here.\nRobin Hayes: No. I think certainly, I think the first thing to say that we are a relatively small player on the transatlantic. I mean we are pleased to be starting our fifth flight. But as you know, that represents a very tiny percent of the market and probably around 2% to 3% of our ASMs in total. We see an opportunity out of New York and Boston to fly to a number of European markets, and we are confidently progressing with those plans. When I think about the transatlantic historically, it's always had a mix of legacy and low-cost carriers. And so I think that's going to continue. I mean we saw with Norwegian, a large number of low-cost carrier seats come out of the market. We've seen a new entrant called Norse there. And I think you're going to continue to see that. But what we believe with the LR and the XLR is we have the right airplane to serve these markets and carrying our mix of both low-cost premium travel because what we're doing with our transatlantic Mint product is appealing to a segment that has been grossly overcharged and gauged by legacy carriers for many years, whilst also making a competitive offering for our core or coach customers, which includes a combination of low fare and a great product. We think that's a great niche. We think that's a niche that most customers want to be in. And so we feel very confident that we have the right plan to continue to serve this market.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham : When you think about 2023, what do you think is the best opportunity for outsized revenue production? Like so historically, I think pre-pandemic, you would think that there's -- JetBlue had a bunch of levers that would generate above-average unit revenue outperformance. Just curious if there's anything else that's out there that could juice those numbers higher. And I know you spoke to loyalty, but is there anything else that you're thinking about into next year?\nDave Clark : Thanks, Conor. This is Dave. I'll take that one. As we look ahead to revenue levers for next year, a lot of it is the continued strong performance of the initiatives that we've already outlined, things like the very strong growth we're seeing in loyalty as well as in JetBlue Travel Products. I do want to go deeper on a couple of them, though, that we haven't talked about yet. So one is our customer segmentation strategy, which has really seen excellent buy-up with customers choosing premium leisure products, things like Mint is having a RASM improvement about 10 points better than the core system. And you'll see next year, all of our Airbus 320 family deliveries will come with a Mint configuration given the strength we've been seeing there. But also within the core cabin, seeing very strong buy-up numbers to our Blue and our Blue Extra fair. It's now well above 50%, which is really strong and has made a lot of progress in the last year or 2. So very pleased there.  And then secondly, the Northeast Alliance, we're thrilled to be in this area to be offering more choices to customers and more low fares, and we're seeing our customer response there really pick up. So for example, in the third quarter, our revenues and profit margins in the NEA accelerated more quickly than the rest of our network. We're seeing really good code share growth sort of quarter-over-quarter and remain above our targets there. And then the corporate response is really improving. As our seamlessness continues to improve and our loyalty benefits roll out, we're seeing more corporations booking the code share. We're seeing some additional accounts signed because of the NEA.  And then lastly, and this really points to the future stickiness, our co-brand card account growth in NEA geographies has been faster and greater than the non-NEA geographies. So we think really continuing to execute and ramp up these revenue initiatives that we've been speaking of should help give us a good tailwind as we go through 2023.\nConor Cunningham : Okay. That's helpful. And then on the buckets of your structural cost program, I'm just curious on what's taken hold a lot quicker than you would have expected? And then maybe what's your biggest focus into next year as we start to work through that?\nUrsula Hurley : Thanks for the question. So we've started to see meaningful progress in our enterprise planning. And as a reminder, what we're doing here is optimizing how we're building schedules around our existing work rules, and we're planning smarter, and we're building more resilient pairings. We're collectively identifying any hidden inefficiencies, and we're reducing structural operability risks. So in the sequential improvement between Q3 and Q4, we've actually seen a point of improvement associated with our enterprise planning work. So that is going to continue to ramp up as we enter next year. In addition to that, we're also going to make meaningful progress on our maintenance opportunities entering next year. So we moved to a phase in which we're retiring airplanes. And so we've strategically been making decisions on what level of investments we do or do not make in certain airframes and engines. So next year, you will continue to see enterprise planning benefits as well as maintenance benefits. In addition to that, as I mentioned in my remarks, we have actually started the retirement of our E190 airplanes. So we actually have a point of savings -- sequential savings between Q3 and Q4 associated with that, and that will continue to ramp up. So as a reminder, in 2023, we've assumed the structural cost program will deliver between $60 million and $80 million, and the E190 retirements will drive $45 million of savings next year. I want to reiterate, in terms of structural costs, those are structural savings that will carry through. In regards to the E190 retirement, think of these as onetime cost avoidance items. So the $75 million isn't necessarily run rate, but it's onetime savings that will be achieved over the next 2 years.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So I think a piece of the CASM guidance improvement sequentially is peeling back on reliability investments that you made over the summer. I wondered if you could just expand on that a little bit. What specifically are you kind of loosening? And what are you seeing that kind of gives you confidence to do that? Or is it really just a function of it's kind of a less peaky time and there's more kind of slack in the system, which enables you to do it?\nUrsula Hurley : Thanks, Duane. So between Q3 and Q4, we are peeling back 2.5 points of summer investments, and the majority of that is related to internal and external labor. As you recall, we are operating in somewhat of a challenging environment throughout the network, given ATC delays. And so we naturally built a level of resiliency into our planning around labor to ensure that we can deliver and operate. So Joanna, I don't know if you have anything else to add?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, a couple of things maybe. I think the biggest investment we made this summer was pulling back the schedule. And so I think as you see Q3 to Q4, we're adding more capacity back into the schedule. So I think that's showing some of these investments have paid off. In terms of things that we're peeling back, obviously, slowing the pace of hiring across our in-flight and airport teams. We're actually, in some cases, offering some rest and relaxation program this fall, which is more of a trough, which is a great -- that's a great place to be, given where we were a year ago on sort of a higher, higher, higher framework. And then the other piece is pilots, which I mentioned before. We're actually seeing even Q3 to Q4, a slight ease up on some of our reserve levels. We will continue to plan to have greater reserves in 2019, but I would not expect 2023 to have as high a reserve level as 2022. And so you'll see, I think, some meaningful improvements there over time.  We are being careful though, because the ATC environment remains fragile. The FAA has been a great partner, bringing a ton of transparency around what they're seeing in terms of staffing challenges. We know N90 is particularly challenged, and we don't think this is going to course correct in the next few months. So we are working closely with them to ensure that we are aligned in our planning assumptions and what we expect to see how they handle some of these programs and some of the irregular operations days. So continuing some investments there, but there remains opportunity in pilot reserve levels.\nDave Clark : And this is Dave. Duane, one thing I'll note as well is our aircraft utilization on a year-over-three basis improved several points as we move from Q3 to Q4, so that helps as well. And we'll continue to see that in 2023 as we continue to ramp back towards our pre-COVID utilization.\nRobin Hayes: And Duane, this is Robin, you're going to win the award because you're the only person so far to get 4 leaders to answer your question.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: It's a very comprehensive answer, which is appreciated.\nRobin Hayes: But I do think that we're confident in the -- so first of all, you're going to see more buffer of the peaks more -- in future years as well. We're not going to go back to where we were in 2019. If we think about the sort of the if we think about pilots, Joanna talked about that. We've been -- for the -- if we look at sort of November, for example, we're going to be -- we're going to have about 14% more pilots flying about the same capacity than we did in 2019. So it's still a significant step up. What we don't know fully is -- we know we will unpeel those investments over time. We don't -- what we don't quite know is how quickly we can do that because it's going to be very driven by, as Joanna said, the external environment and some of the issues that we've seen this year. But clearly, there's a significant opportunity there to reduce cost as we unpeel it. And so if I look at -- if I was to kind of take a sort of a crystal ball into next year, as Joanna said, we will have lower reserve coverage than we had this year, but we won't be back to 2019 levels. I just don't know yet, until we get into planning cycle, how big a step down that would be.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I do have a quick follow-up, hopefully quicker. Just with respect to routes that -- as you build out LaGuardia, right? So as you have markets that maybe historically served from JFK and now you've built that out from LaGuardia, has anything surprised you in terms of very different demand set, very different pricing? Are there markets that look in essence, completely different from LaGuardia?\nDave Clark : Thanks, Duane. I'll take that. This is Dave. I'd say there's nothing that has completely surprised us or looks a lot different than we thought, but we've certainly been learning a lot over the past several months here, especially since LaGuardia went up to 52 flights a day in July. And the team is sort of constantly reworking the capacity plan into schedules so that not only does this this capacity naturally improve as it ramps over time, but that we accelerate that improvement and raise the ceiling by improving the schedule to more closely align with customer demand. So no big surprises, but lots of tweaks and refinements that we'll be rolling out over the next months and year to continue to improve our New York performance.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: So as you -- has the change in IATA designation for Newark change the way you have to respond to the government on the NEA alliance?\nRobin Hayes: Helane, I'll take that. No, absolutely not. The change that IATA has proposed or made really relates to fare construction only. It doesn't relate to what we call sort of multi-airport city codes. And so if you go into a GDS, if you go into Expedia and type NYC, you're going to get all airports come up, including Newark. Everyone who lives or works in New York clearly knows Newark is part of the New York airport system managed by the same authority as LaGuardia and JFK. And we see customers move between those airports pretty regularly as well. So no, it has not -- I mean, no impact on the NEA, but also no impact on JetBlue's business or any other airline business.\nHelane Becker: That's very helpful. And then just a point of clarification. In terms of aircraft in and aircraft out, can you just say, of the 22 aircrafts you're planning for next year what percent are replacement and what percent are growth?\nUrsula Hurley : Helane, so next year, we take -- we're expected to take delivery of -- well, contractually, we're supposed to take 18 A220s. Our planning assumption is that we take 14, so you can consider those replacement. We're contractually retiring 6 E190s. And then of the 30 that we own, we will also be retiring some of those as well. So in summary, the 14 airplanes, A220 that we take next year, the margin-accretive aircraft that we take next year will be replacement.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Ursula, just a question on CapEx. The $1 billion this year, just to remind us, that's predominantly airplanes, and that's being out of -- paid out of cash. Your $1.5 billion to $2 billion of CapEx that you sort of guided to earlier on the call, is that -- presumably, that's going to be a mix of cash and debt given the size? And I guess, as an add-on, have do you gotten actually any commitments for aircraft finance for aircraft that are coming in 2023?\nUrsula Hurley : So you're correct, Mike. The $1 billion this year will be completely be funded by cash. The estimated CapEx range next year of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, none of that is currently financed. We're going through the 2023 planning process at the moment. And so we'll share color with you in January around the baseline assumptions between cash and financing.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then this is a question, I don't know if it's Robin or Joanna, just the news at a week or 2 ago, Delta making an investment in Joby. I read somewhere something about an exclusivity. And I know that you guys also have an investment in Joby. Does that preclude you from doing anything with them down the road? I'm not sure if it was like geography specific or airport specific, the exclusivity. Just any comments, I know I'm sort of jumping ahead a few years.\nRobin Hayes: Yes. No. Mike, I'll take that. No, I mean, we were an early investor in Joby. We had a great partnership with them, really appreciated seeing that business grow and develop. And yes, their partnership they announced with Delta does provide exclusivity period of 5 years. But I think we are very focused right now on executing the initiatives that we have. We're very focused on getting the Spirit transaction done because this is a very important strategic priority for our airline. And our JTV subsidiary has dozens of investments and ventures, and we have many opportunities across the spectrum there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna International Group.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So Robin or Ursula, could you give a little bit more color on the modest aircraft delays that you mentioned in your prepared remarks for next year? Is that 5% or 7%? And do you think that you can still grow capacity in mid- to single digits with the modest delays? And I guess, said another way, if it's easier to just answer it this way, could you fly the schedule that you're planning for 2023 with the aircraft that you have in the fleet now with the CASMx down that you're looking for?\nUrsula Hurley : So, as I mentioned, so contractually, Airbus is supposed to deliver 29 airplanes to us next year. I think we're all well aware that they're struggling from ramp-up challenges driven by manpower and supply chain. So we are seeing delivery delays. We're working hand-in-hand with them to manage through those. From a planning assumption perspective, contractually, we're supposed to get 29. We're assuming we get a minimum of 22 next year. And with those 22 airplanes, we believe that we can deliver the mid- to high single-digit growth rate that we're planning for next year. And in turn, we also believe that we can deliver the flat or better CASM ex-fuel. Our utilization continues to be down here in the fourth quarter by a handful of points as we enter next year. Our fleet-wide utilization, we expect to increase a couple of points as well. So again, we feel confident based on what we know today and the assumptions that we've been working with Airbus on we can deliver that mid- to high single-digit growth rate.\nRobin Hayes: Yes. And if I can -- and just add to that, we also have the option of delaying retirements if we need to. And I think we're trying to give as much color on 2023 as we can based on what we know today. We accept there is a macroeconomic question mark out there that people have. We're not seeing any signs of concerns around that today, but we also recognize it could be in the future. And so we will ultimately take decisions next year driven around by margin. And so we also have flexibility to adjust capacity down, if that's what we need to do because of the economic environment. So we have a lot of flexibility to delay retirements, increase utilization. We've taken our spare count up significantly this year to derisk the operation, we\u2019ll bring that down next year. Ursula talked about some of the flavour around the delivery day. But I think at the end of the day, our capacity is going to be governed by what we see in terms of the economic environment as we go into next year. And clearly, CASM forecast built off the capacity assumption that we're making today.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And a follow-up, Joanna, so in your comments, you spoke about potential cyclical slowing and some cautious planning around that. What are the key data points you're watching every day with respect to that? An obvious one being I'm guessing, daily bookings, cash intake, but what are some of the more nuanced data points that you believe might signal a slowing?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. Just to be clear, we didn't signal any cyclical slowing, quite the opposite, actually. It's very strong. We're not seeing any slowdown. Specifically, we did speak to if there is one down the road, we think we're well positioned with the number of levers we have to pull, capacity being the largest. But we are not seeing any slowdown in terms of underlying demand. In terms of things we look for bookings, fare, load, things of that nature. But beyond that, we're not seeing anything in terms of any kind of slowing or signs of it.\nRobin Hayes: Yes. I think in addition, there's a number of other metrics that we can look at in terms of credit card data is also a good sort of indicator. Again, no concerns at this point. And I think what we're all struggling with here is the economy has grown significantly since 2019. Capacity has not kept up with that growth. If we think about -- for those who have been in the industry a long time, GDP and capacity growth was probably -- one of the linker between capacity and GDP was probably the best correlation you could have. And so we have a lot of GDP growth that has occurred since 2019. And so the question is if we have a recession and how much of that that eats into that sort of higher base that we've already got. And again, we continue to see a lot of pent-up demand, people who haven't flown for a period of time. We continue to see very high load factors on days where we haven't historically seen high load factors, which suggests to me there's still a lot of pent-up demand that we're still eating into.\nOperator: Our next question will come from James Hollins with BNP.\nJames Hollins: Just I want to come back on corporate travel. I mean the 90% recovered from pre-COVID, it looks pretty good to me, it maybe just immediate. But I mean perhaps I think conspicuous by its absence is really talking up the corporate travel either in your release or your presentation. Maybe you could run through the thoughts on sort of how you're seeing corporate travel, how it's trending into the current season?\nDave Clark : Sure. Thanks, James. This is Dave. I'll take that. We're certainly pleased with the corporate travel trends we've seen in the last 4 to 6 weeks here. There is still some choppiness. So I don't think we want to completely declare success and it's still being about 90% bookings. It's clearly below the 2019 levels, whereas the rest of our revenue is up more than 20%. So relative to that, it's still got a long ways to go. But we're seeing a number of things, we're seeing not only the bookings, but the travel, obviously, which follows on a few weeks lag. We actually did have 1 week earlier this month where we had a higher loan revenue, so higher travel revenue this year than we did the same week in 2019. So that was a new record, which is very helpful. And the big thing for us too is, as mentioned before, the NEA is really accelerating for us in the past quarter. And we see -- the lion's share of our corporate happens in New York and Boston. So as the NEA ramps up with seamlessness, as we continue to layer in the loyalty benefits, it is very heartening to see how the corporates have responded with additional code-share bookings, additional accounts, things like that. So we feel very good about just the general corporate recovery as well as the NEA benefits that it's driving.\nJames Hollins: And then just, I mean, from afar, I'm getting a lot of headlines on your court case, obviously, on the Northeast Alliance. I was wondering if you're having any traction in court of the idea that it's not a merger with American brands?\nRobin Hayes: Yes. I'll take that, and thanks for the question, James. The court case -- yes, the trial is wrapping up soon. I believe that we\u2019ve put on a really compelling case. We have a lot of conviction about the NEA. The consumer benefits are there for everybody to see. Everyone in New York loves having more JetBlue flying, everyone in Boston loves having more JetBlue flying. They don't want to go back to how it was. And so we have a -- we're confident that at the end of the day, it's a process. The judge will make the decision. And we are -- we'll wait to hear on that. But I'm very pleased with the case that our team have put forward.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global.\nDan McKenzie: Robin, to put a bow on the revenue cost and utilization comments, for 2023, I'm guessing you could drive a mack truck through how you're thinking about the business and what the Street is modelling in. And you've shared in the past, the pieces are in place to drive $3 a share more in earnings at some point and the Street seems to be dismissing that. So I guess the question is, do you continue to have confidence in that outlook? And given that would you say consensus embedding a recession next year based on what you know today? And the point, of course, is not early to tell us what's the model. It's just, again, going back to the conviction in your ability to drive sustainably higher margins from here.\nRobin Hayes: Yes. No, Dan, I mean, thanks for the question. I mean we have a lot of conviction, a lot of confidence as we -- we had a deeper hole than some to climb out of because of COVID. We were in geography that I think everyone accepts was some of the most impacted. We didn't have the diversification in some revenue streams like cargo during COVID that others had. We had a bump this April as we had to pull down capacity to reflect, I think, a different planning assumption around some of the external constraints that we made in the system and some of the hiring challenges that we have. Of course, others have also had to course correct. And I think we have good momentum now. We continue to see strong revenue performance, notwithstanding some of the one-off headwinds that Dave and Joanna walked through some Q3 to Q4. We're executing on CASM. We have a new structural cost program underway. We have the fleet modernization going on as well. Our revenue initiatives around Travel Products and loyalty are doing exactly what we've said we've been doing for the last couple of years now, and we're pleased with those. And let's not forget that geography like New York is still not fully recovered to the same degree as other geographies in the U.S., and we're seeing that recovery now. And then on top of that, we're seeing all the benefits from the NEA. So we have a lot of conviction. We recognize that, that past confidence has to be earned quarter-by-quarter on delivering on the results and that's exactly what we are intending to do.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. Second question here, regulatory approval for the Spirit merger by early 2024, I think is -- kind of the messaging that seems pretty specific. And I guess is that -- are there some outside data points that give you certainty around that? Or is that simply a legal guess by your counsel? And I'm just wondering from where you sit, is there anything that -- what might cause that time frame to slip?\nRobin Hayes: No. Thanks, Dan. No, I mean, I think we laid out a pretty conservative time line there. I mean, if you look at historically, and previous precedent transactions in the space, they've been decided more quickly than that. I think we recognize, as we've been through this, that this transaction will face a lot of regulatory oversight and overview. And we wanted to lay out a pretty cautious time line and hopefully beat it. So right now, we're not changing anything. We're very excited about the prospect of creating this true national low-fare challenger to bring the JetBlue effect to more geographies and more markets and speeding up our organic plan by several years. And I've been spending quite a bit of time recently down in Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. And there's a lot of excitement down there around this merger. And so we are very excited to get on with it, but we're going to fully respect the regulatory process that's under way comply with the requests that are being made by the Department of Justice and hopefully get to a regulatory approval as quickly as time permits.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joe Caiado for any closing remarks.\nJoe Caiado: Thanks, Anthony. That concludes our third quarter 2022 conference call. Thanks for joining us.

My name is Cody and I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, Joe Caiado. Please go ahead, Joe.\nJoe Caiado: Thanks, Cody. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release and a presentation that we will reference during this call. All of those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and have been filed with the SEC. In New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Ursula Hurley, our Chief Financial Officer. And also joining us for Q&A are Dave Clark, Head of Revenue and Planning; and Andres Barry, President of JetBlue Travel Products.

And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue\u2019s CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. I\u2019d like to start with my thanks to our more than 24,000 crew members for their tremendous work and dedication to delivering the award-winning JetBlue Experience to our customers as we marked some significant milestones in our recovery this summer. This morning, we reported a record breaking absolute revenue results for the second quarter and we are on pace to top it again here in the third quarter and drive our first quarterly profit since the start of the pandemic. Turning to Slide 5. Before we dig into our financial results and outlook, I\u2019d like to take a moment to discuss our recently announced agreement to acquire Spirit. I am very pleased we found the path forward with Spirit and we can\u2019t wait to welcome the incredible 10,000 team members to JetBlue as we create a true national, low-fare high-quality challenger to the dominant Big Four airlines. Together, we will expand our uniquely disruptive combination of award-winning service and competitive low fares to more customers across the country as we combine the best of both airlines. You have heard me say it before this transaction turbocharges our strategic growth plan. It will diversify and expand our network for customers, create new jobs and opportunities for crew members and expand our foundation for profitable growth, unlocking sustained long-term value for all of our stakeholders. We remain highly confident in our ability to obtain regulatory approval no later than the first half of 2024. We expect the transaction to be accretive to EPS in the first full year following closing and to deliver $600 million to $700 million in annual net synergies once integration is complete. You can find more information about this transaction and the many stakeholder benefits on our website. We are thrilled about this unique long-term opportunity, but we also recognize that we are still some time away from closing. And even as we begin early work on integration planning, we remain focused on running the standalone business in the interim and we also continue to execute on our organic initiatives. Returning to sustained profitability, Slide 5. With that, we are here today to discuss earnings and I\u2019d like to start with our quarterly reports on Slide 6. For the second quarter, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.47. As you will recall, we had some operational challenges earlier in the spring, which drove a sizable reset to our full year growth plan and a number of investments to ensure we could operate reliably during this exceptionally busy summer season. I am proud to say that our operational performance improved significantly throughout the quarter and we capitalize on the strong demand environment to deliver record revenue growth at the top-end of our original guidance range and a record quarterly revenue result for JetBlue. We were profitable in the month of June on an adjusted basis, entering the third quarter with solid momentum as we expect the carry-forward through to sustained profitability. I am pleased to see record demand to travel with JetBlue and the solid underlying momentum in our recovery as we work to build an even better JetBlue for our stakeholders. Moving now to Slide 7. With high fuel prices and our short-term operational investments are weighing on our margins this summer, we are making steady underlying progress on our long-term initiatives to structurally improve our profitability and enhance our long-term earnings power. Our network is foundational to our success and we continue to strengthen relevance this year, primarily through our Northeast Alliance with American Airlines, or the NEA. The NEA will be a significant margin builder for JetBlue by allowing us to grow in New York and Boston, our two largest focus cities and offering more value to all customers in the region. Together with American Airlines, we have created a robust competition with industry-leading network depth and breadth and more combined daily departures than Delta and United. The NEA continues to scale nicely on its multiyear path to steady state as we build our connectivity, enhanced loyalty benefits and a seamless customer experience. Across the pond, I am delighted to say that we have secured permanent slots at London Heathrow starting at the end of October, the culmination of some great work together with our airport and government partners. In addition, we are excited to expand our award-winning transatlantic service to our second largest focus city with the launch of service from Boston this week, further strengthening our relevance in the Northeast. And with the addition of a third frequency between JFK in London in October, we\u2019ll be operating 5 daily flights between the Northeast and London this fall. More customers were engaging with JetBlue than ever before as we continue to see double-digit growth in our loyalty business, fueled by the NEA and the strength of our brand preference as we generate record cash flows from the program. And back in 2018, we shared with you a vision for our new JetBlue Travel Products subsidiary, with an audacious goal of contributing $100 million in EBIT by 2022. And despite all of the challenges of the last 24 months, we are on track to deliver close to that target this year. Last month, just in time for the busy travel \u2013 summer travel period, the JTP team rolled out a revamped website and additional inventory to Paisly by JetBlue, a travel website that we launched just over a year ago and offers customers a one-stop shopping platform to conveniently purchase ancillary travel products relevant to their trip, all backed by JetBlue\u2019s great customer service. Earlier this year, when we reset our medium-term capacity plan to reflect the industry\u2019s constraints, we highlighted some potential mitigating actions to right-size our footprint for this new reality. Today, we announced a further acceleration of our 190 transition with our fleet modernization efforts poised to accelerate not only our margin expansion, but our path to reducing emissions. And Ursula will walk you through our new structural cost program, which will set a new foundation for our long-term, low cost structure. Finally, our responsibility to mitigate climate risk is a core part of our mission and we remain steadfast in leading the industry in our efforts. We have recently announced our commitment to work with the Science-Based Targets initiative to set a near-term emissions reduction target for our airline operations. In addition to our sustainability efforts, we remain committed by fostering diversity and we are proud to say that underrepresented groups represent over 60% and 90% of students enrolled in our Gateway Select and Gateway Direct programs respectively, which are industry leading career development programs that allow crew members and external applicants to pursue a path to become a pilot or maintenance technician at JetBlue. Once again, I\u2019d like to thank our passionate crew members for caring for our customers each other and JetBlue. With the foundation we put in place and the many exciting initiatives we have underway, I have never been more excited about our long-term cost outlook \u2013 our long-term outlook, which will only be enhanced by our acquisition of Spirit. With that, over to you, Joanna.\nJoanna Geraghty: Great. Thank you, Robin. I\u2019d also like to add my thanks to our great team. Earlier this year, we made a number of operational decisions to better set us up for the summer. And while the summer has not been without its challenges, these investments are providing relief and we are pleased that our completion factor is now back above 98%. We would like to thank our team as we know it has been a particularly challenging operating environment. I\u2019d also like to thank our industry partners at the FAA for their continued support and importantly, their transparency as we all work to bring flying back to the level and quality of the pre-pandemic environment. Turning to capacity on Slide 9. As Robin mentioned, we actually began moderating our capacity plans back in March. And following a challenging few weeks in April, we moved quickly to reset our full year growth plan. The reality is that almost no airline has been immune to operational challenges this year as the industry quickly ramped back up and it\u2019s clear that what we experienced has now been felt by all of our peers. Frankly, it just hit us earlier given our network footprint. And therefore, we were able to reset earlier. On our last call, we announced we were taking decisive action to reduce our full year capacity plan by 10 points to build greater resiliency into the operation. And today, we are tightening that capacity range. In fact, the incremental investments for the summer partially delayed in anticipated productivity benefit into the fourth quarter. As an example, in June, we had 16% more active pilots, but 8% fewer block hours compared with 2019. We are also carrying elevated reserve levels. As we move beyond the peak summer, we expect some of these investments will gradually normalize as the broader aviation ecosystem stabilizes and we ramp utilization back up. That said we firmly believe that this level of investment and a more conservative operational planning philosophy was necessary to ensure that we can reliably deliver for our customers and crew members, especially as external factors continue to make for a challenging operating environment during this busy summer season. As noted, we closed May and June with a completion factor above 98% compared to approximately 90% during the first 3 weeks of April. As a result, when we provided our Q2 investor update in late May, we were the only airline to guide up capacity on a better May completion factor, while others were enacting further schedule reductions. And in our congested geography, where more than two-thirds of our flights touched the Northeast, we had a higher completion factor than our peers in May and in June. With this said, we do continue to see challenges beyond what we can control with continued difficult weather events on the East Coast and meaningful ATC constraints as they too face some of the same staffing challenges as most other businesses. To address this and build in a degree of resilience, we will continue to plan appropriate levels of reserve crews in the context of a more fragile national aviation system and one that is likely to remain so for the near to medium-term. We continue to work collaboratively with the FAA to better understand their constraints, improve transparency and ensure we are set up to deliver for the flying public. For the second quarter of 2022, our capacity increased 2.3% year over 3 with strong completion factor trends. For the third quarter, we expect capacity to be negative 3% to flat year over 3. We believe the sequential step down in capacity in Q3, consistent with the revised capacity plan we announced back in April, is the right move to set us up for success this quarter. And for the full year 2022, we are tightening our forecast for capacity to grow between 0% and 3% versus 2019. During the second quarter, we continued our international expansion, the startup service to our first Canadian Blue City, Vancouver, marking another milestone in JetBlue\u2019s history in making us the only airline to offer non-stop flights from JFK. And as Robin mentioned, we are boosting transatlantic service even more this quarter with new daily service between Boston and both Gatwick and Heathrow as well as a third frequency between JFK in London in October. We are obviously very pleased to see the CDC follow the science and remove inbound testing requirements for international arrivals into the U.S., finally eliminating a cumbersome hurdle to the industry\u2019s continued recovery and driving further improvement in international demand, particularly in our Caribbean network, where trends were already strong. On the other hand, we were disappointed to see the Canadian government reinstate the random testing regime, which we believe is a step in the wrong direction, but also serves as a reminder of the ever evolving landscape of pandemic recovery. Domestically, we have fully consolidated our LaGuardia operations to Terminal B earlier this month. In the fall, we are relocating to the brand-new South Terminal C in Orlando as the anchor tenant. And in the fourth quarter, we also plan to move into Newark\u2019s new Terminal A. We are excited to welcome our customers in these world class terminals and provide them with an enhanced airport experience and a more seamless travel journey with JetBlue. And of course, operationally, we are looking forward to the improved efficiencies that come with the limiting split terminal operations at La Guardia. As we have smoothed out and de-risked our return to growth this year, we are setting a strong foundation for the network to deliver sustained profitability as we build out our relevance. As always, we will remain nimble and adept as needed to the broader macro environment, making decisions through the lens of margin. Turning to Slide 10. During the second quarter, our revenue increased 16.1% year over 3, better than the high-end of our initial outlook as a result of robust demand across the network with a record number of customers and we expect load factors to remain in the high 80s through the summer. Our ancillary revenue per customer grew 65% in the second quarter to well over $50 per customer and we are pleased with the success of our segmentation strategy, with a broad product portfolio that offers great value and choice for all customers. For the third quarter, we expect unit revenue to increase between 19% and 23% to the highest level in our history, as strong demand combined with a tight supply backdrop helped offset the high price of fuel. Revenue is tracking well to help deliver a profitable quarter and early bookings keep us cautiously optimistic about the fall. As Robin mentioned, we are solidly executing across a number of commercial initiatives. On the network front, we are making good progress in ramping up our margin accretive Northeast Alliance with American Airlines. And while the industry has yet to return capacity to 2019 levels, the NEA is growing well in excess of the U.S. market. We have added over 50 new routes not previously served by either carrier and increased frequencies on another 130. Collectively, with American Airlines, we are now offering more departures out of New York than Delta and United. This growth is delivering tremendous consumer benefits as we offer more customers our award-winning combination of low fares and great service, while eliciting a strong competitive response from other carriers, such as Delta\u2019s substantial growth at Boston and United additions at Newark as well as new service between Boston and London. Through the NEA, JetBlue is able to serve a broader set of customers, including business travelers, flight to more markets and create thousands of jobs in the process. Business travel also continues to recover nicely, with Q2 contracted corporate bookings improving 10 points sequentially as we move closer to pre-pandemic levels. The Northeast Alliance positions us well to capitalize on the continued business travel recovery as we expand our share of the corporate travel wallet in the region with a compelling network, schedule and service offering as well as reciprocity across our loyalty programs. Turning to loyalty and co-brand, the value proposition of our TrueBlue loyalty program continues to resonate extremely well with our customers with program engagement at all-time highs and I am pleased to see yet another record quarter of program growth with spend growth that continues to consistently and meaningfully exceed pre-pandemic levels, up over 40% year over 3. This is an area with ample runway for growth and our team continues to find new ways to add further value as we evolve the programs and enhance this resilient cash flow stream. The short-term investments we made in the operation have positioned us well to reliably deliver the JetBlue Experience as we capitalize on the strong demand environment, while our strategic initiatives fuel our profitable growth over the long-term. I will close with another thanks to our crew members. We know it\u2019s been a long summer and we are very appreciative of how you have taken care of our customers and importantly, one another. I will turn the call over to you, Ursula.\nUrsula Hurley: Thank you, Joanna. I\u2019d also like to thank our incredible crew members for their commitment and hard work to ensure that we deliver for our customers, our fellow crew members and our owners as we lay the foundation to build back our margins beyond pre-pandemic levels and create sustainable long-term value for all of our stakeholders. I will start on Slide 12 with a brief overview of our financial results for the quarter. Revenue was a record $2.4 billion, up 16.1% year over 3. Cost per available seat mile was up 34.7% year over 3. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, was up 14.5% year over 3. And our GAAP loss per share was $0.58 and adjusted loss per share was $0.47. I am very pleased with the team\u2019s execution this quarter to position us to return to sustained profitability in the back half of the year. Despite the operational headwinds in April, the subsequent operational investments we made and the sharp rise in fuel prices throughout the quarter, we exited Q2 with an adjusted pre-tax profit for the month of June and we look forward to carrying this momentum into Q3 and beyond. Turning to Slide 13, during the second quarter, CASM ex-fuel increased 14.5% versus 2019, below our original guidance, driven by efficiencies tied to a better operation. As you have heard, the reliability investments we made for this summer are yielding much improved operational results and have helped to derisk this summer, but they are weighing on our margin recovery. For the third quarter, we are forecasting CASM ex-fuel to increase 15% to 17%. We do expect this heightened investment to ease once we get beyond the summer peak. As a result, we expect to see some productivity improvement in the fourth quarter and into 2023. We are also tightening our forecast for full year 2022 CASM ex-fuel to increase in the range of 11% to 14% versus 2019 from prior guidance of 10% to 15%. As a reminder, this includes 6 points from the capacity reductions announced back in April, a total of 3 points from the spring operational challenges and the investments we are making for the summer and 1 point from inflationary pressures from pilots and our business partners. Turning to Slide 14. On our last call, we mentioned that we had engaged some outside experts to conduct a thorough review of our costs to help us identify the optimal long-term cost structure for JetBlue as we emerge from the pandemic. The result of that work is the new structural cost program that I am pleased to share with you today. Just prior to the pandemic, we concluded our first structural cost program, which successfully removed over $300 million of cost and was centered largely around sourcing contracts, distribution and implementing self-service technology and rationalizing other fixed costs. That program drove an industry-leading CASM ex performance in 2019, and we were on track to execute a zero to 1% CASM ex CAGR from 2018 to 2020. Fast forward to today, and while we are still benefiting from our first structural cost program, we\u2019re embarking on a new plan to keep our costs low as part of our continuous focus on this area of our business. This new program focuses on cross-functional costs and is more about gaining operational and planning efficiencies. This past quarter, we announced the creation of a new enterprise planning team, which will play a critical role in unlocking these structural efficiencies across the airline longer term, some of which we have already begun implementing successfully. For example, Joanna mentioned that we are currently staffed at much higher levels of flying activity and we have strategically invested in reserves as part of our more conservative summer planning. But at the same time, we\u2019re actually seeing big improvements in planning productivity and reductions in pilot soft time. And these are exactly the types of underlying efficiencies that will carry forward and ramp beyond the summer while utilization also improves. We\u2019re also investing in automation across the business, especially in support of end-of-life maintenance planning given that we are now in a position where we are retiring aircraft for the first time. Specifically, we are investing in software that optimizes when to swap or remove engines to maximize utilization before retirement, thereby reducing total system-wide cost of engine ownership. The expected new structural cost program to deliver run-rate cost savings of approximately $175 million by the end of 2024, with half of these savings expected by the end of 2023. This will help to mitigate any medium-term CASM headwinds and support our objective of a flat or better CASM ex trajectory over a multiyear period fueling our margin expansion beyond pre-pandemic levels. You\u2019ll also recall that earlier this year, we exercised and accelerated 30 A220 options in order to exit our E190 fleet by 2026. Today, we announced a further acceleration of our E190 retirement, pulling it forward by over a year to mid-2025 and as we further optimize our fleet planning and maintenance spend. As part of this acceleration, we\u2019ve already parked three E190 aircraft and plan to fit an additional nine for a total of 12 E190 exits this year. We expect to save at least $75 million in maintenance expense through 2024 and will benefit from reallocating flying to much more CASM-efficient A220s, which have 30% lower direct operating costs and 35% better fuel efficiency. Our fleet modernization plans will not only improve our margins, but also accelerate our decarbonization journey. In total, the structural cost program and the accelerated E190 retirements will drive approximately $250 million of cost savings through 2024, with $150 million to $200 million of that, representing a permanent run rate cost reduction. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 15. In the second quarter, we paid down approximately $106 million of debt, and we funded approximately $205 million in capital expenditures. For the full year 2022, our CapEx forecast remains at approximately $1 billion. At the end of June, our adjusted debt to cap was 54%, and we closed the quarter with liquidity of $2.6 billion or 32% of 2019 revenue, excluding our revolving credit facility. As we think about our proposed acquisition of Spirit, it\u2019s important to remember that JetBlue\u2019s relative balance sheet strength is the key enabler of this transaction. Post closing, we continue to expect that JetBlue would maintain a strong balance sheet with pro forma net leverage of approximately 3x to 3.5x, which we believe to be a very manageable level that still compares favorably to the peer group. A strong balance sheet is foundational to JetBlue\u2019s strategy and the strong earnings accretion and cash flow profile of the combined business will allow us to quickly de-lever the balance sheet as we integrate. To close, we recognize there is a lot of work ahead, but through the strong underlying momentum in the business and the continued execution of our various strategic initiatives from the Northeast Alliance to the evolution of our loyalty program to scaling JetBlue Travel Products, and now, our new structural cost program as well we are setting a foundation to structurally improve our long-term earnings potential beyond pre-pandemic levels. I\u2019m also very excited to welcome Spirit team members to JetBlue as we create the number five carrier in the U.S. and unleash a national low-fare challenger to the Big Four. I\u2019d like to once again express my sincere thanks to our crew members for their tiers efforts in helping to build a better JetBlue for all of our stakeholders. With that, we will now take your questions.\nJoe Caiado: Thanks, everyone. Cody, we\u2019re now ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question. Caller, please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: This is Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Just on the timing of the debt raise to support the Spirit acquisition. How do you think about the timing of that? Are there sort of regulatory hurdles you want to clear before that happens and if you could comment at all on estimated cost of capital on that debt raise?\nUrsula Hurley: Good morning, Duane, so we currently have a 364-day bridge facility in place for $3.5 billion. We envision that staying in place until we receive regulatory approval. And then once we receive regulatory approval, we will then take out that bridge. We will assess the various markets at that point in time and focus on all-in cost of funding, and we will determine appropriately which assets and which markets to utilize in order to take out that bridge. The cost of debt in regards to the bridge at the moment is around 6%. Given the time frame in which the bridge stays in place, there are some step-up fees along the way. So that could slightly increase depending on the length of the regulatory approval. Obviously, the cost of debt when we take out the bridge facility, that could be the end of next year or early 2024. So the financing markets at that point in time could look very different than what they look like today. But you should envision us playing a keen focus on all-in cost of funding when we take it out.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And then just for my second, there was a competitor where an extension of basically credit balances impacted revenue trends or their outlook for the third quarter. And then going through that post that call it looks like JetBlue does have some policies of sort of COVID credits that expire at the end of September. Can you comment on how many points of revenue growth or how many points of revenue are from credit balance breakage?\nDave Clark: Duane, this is Dave Clark. I can take that one. Regarding the credits since the pandemic began, we\u2019ve seen a higher cancellation rate and thus more credits being issued. This is especially too early in the pandemic when customers were canceling the flights in pretty high numbers. And we\u2019ve been forecasting usage rates of the credits and recognizing increased breakage revenue since Q3 of 2020, so this is 2 years into the process for us. It\u2019s a relatively smooth ramp for us with no large lump sort of as we go up or down. The highest breakage revenue recognition was actually the past three quarters from Q4 of \u201821 and to Q2 of \u201822, and we\u2019re starting to normalize right now. And this is all sort of fairly low numbers, low single digits on the way up. And it will normalize at a higher rate than it was because customer cancellation behavior has changed with the removal of most change cancel fees. So on the way down, it\u2019s roughly a 1 point headwind, but all pretty smooth and low numbers for us.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And just to put a finer point, that 1 point headwind would be like a 4Q relative to 3Q? Is that the right way to think about it or next year versus this year?\nDave Clark: Correct. Think starting 4Q and throughout the first few quarters of 2023.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now move on to our next question. Caller, please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: It\u2019s Savi Syth from Raymond James. I\u2019m just kind of curious, keeping CASM ex flattish versus kind of 2020, which, let\u2019s say, it\u2019s around 12.5% above 2019 on kind of mid to high single digits, that seems a little bit disappointing given that in 2020 you were supposed to have a step-down because of the first structural cost program. And you have had some kind of one-time items this year. So could you talk about what\u2019s the incremental costs you\u2019re seeing in 2023 that requires a new program to kind of maintain this flattish level?\nUrsula Hurley: Sure. Thanks for the question, Savi. So maybe just to walk forward, so the midpoint of our guide this year is 12.5%. If you take out the spring disruption costs as well as the summer investments, you get down to an underlying CASM ex of 8.5% for 2022. So next year, if you think about us growing capacity mid- to high single digits next year, that\u2019s historically what we said is the sweet spot. You would expect us to drive, to your point, a flattish CASM ex-fuel. However, we have also highlighted that we do have some headwinds next year, one of those being we will have a small incremental impact due to the NEA. And this is really because we moved into new terminal space in La Guardia this year as well as Newark. So you\u2019ll have the full year effect of that increase in 2023. We also have an aging fleet. So we\u2019ve highlighted that we have a level of maintenance investment that will need to take place. And then we also have some in-flight rate increases from our new contracts that are effective in January as well. So essentially, [Technical Difficulty] our structural cost program that we rolled out today is going to help offset those headwinds. And essentially, we intend to deliver a flattish, if not better, CASM ex fuel next year.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you. And can I just ask on the capacity to kind of start going back to that mid to high single-digit growth level, especially step up from third quarter to fourth quarter, what you can expecting on the resource side or expect on the operations side that\u2019s going you confidence \u2013 you can kind of meet that level? I know you mentioned that \u2013 it sounds like the pilot soft times are coming down. But I\u2019m just kind of curious, given the issues that the industry has been having on kind of restoring capacity, where the confidence comes from for the fourth quarter and beyond?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. Thanks, Savi. I\u2019ll take that. It\u2019s Joanna. So we\u2019re confident with the investments that we\u2019ve made into the summer that we\u2019re now in a position where we are ramped up to handle that level of capacity. We teased out some of the investments we made with pilots and additional reserves. We expect to continue some of those investments as we move forward just to ensure a level of operational reliability. Yes, there are some shorter-term summer investments that will peel off, but there is some, given the more fragile aviation ecosystem, that will stay. And we will continue to invest there. And we feel that we\u2019re adequately staffed to handle that capacity adjustment. Obviously, the talent landscape is challenging, but the underlying infrastructure to support all of that, whether it\u2019s training, hiring is fully ramped, and we feel good about that.\nSavi Syth: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question. Caller, please go ahead.\nScott Group: It\u2019s Scott Group from Wolfe Research. So I just want to clarify just one thing on that CASM point about flattish. Are you talking \u2013 are you guys guiding flattish versus the up 12.5% this year or versus what you tried to talk about the more normalized underlying plus 8% for this year?\nUrsula Hurley: Yes, Scott. So it\u2019s against the 12.5% midpoint of our 2022 guide.\nScott Group: Okay. Okay. Perfect. Okay. I just want to clarify. Can you guys share some color on the monthly sort of TRASM trajectory throughout second quarter and as you look out throughout third quarter? And Robin, I know you had some, I don\u2019t know, cautious or maybe uncertain comments around fall and what business travel could look like. Any updated thoughts or color there?\nJoanna Geraghty: Hey, maybe I will take that and flip it to Dave to give you some color, additional color. So as we think about Q2 into Q3, we are seeing many of the same trends that were present in Q2 carry into Q3, ultimately broad strength across most of our geographies. Transcon actually outperformed most of the geographies. And then as we look at VFR and international, the removal of the inbound testing requirements provided some nice lift there. Domestic Mint is also significantly performing. If you look at load factors, we\u2019re back to 2019 levels, and then fares and yields for Q2 both above 2019 levels. So we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re seeing. Obviously, cautiously optimistic about the fall and seeing these trends carry into the fall. Dave, you want to add any color?\nDave Clark: Sure. Thanks, Joanna. And this is Dave. As you mentioned, the trends continue. We\u2019ve actually been remarkably steady throughout the quarter, ramped up really well during Q2 and then just more or less plateaued and stayed relatively flat as we move through the third quarter with the leisure bookings that we\u2019ve taken so far into September and October remaining very strong and indicating that leisure travel should be resilient through the fall. And then in terms of corporate, corporate continues to progress. We progressed about 10 points in the recovery during the second quarter. We\u2019ve seen that continue here for the first month of the third. We expect to see another step up in the fall driven by continued return to work after Labor Day, and there is certainly high traveler willingness to be on the road. We see that in the surveys and with all of our discussions with corporate customers. So we think the recovery will continue as we head through the fall.\nScott Group: Okay, thanks you, guys for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question.\nJamie Baker: Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Jamie Baker at JPMorgan. Robin, we didn\u2019t speak last week, so I did want to offer my congratulations on getting the deal announced. A question on the regulatory process. A second data request has already been made. You disclosed that. What happens from here? I mean, in the case of Alaska Virgin, they pushed back their closing date to give them more time to work with Justice, which essentially disclosed the fact that they were talking. Do you envision providing color in this regard? Are you even permitted to do so? Would a third data request be disclosed, for example? I\u2019m just trying to think through how to monitor from the outside?\nRobin Hayes: No. Thanks, Jamie, and I appreciate the comments and the thoughts about getting the Spirit transaction closed. We\u2019re extremely pleased with that. I think we have laid out a \u2013 on the regulatory front, right through this process. I think we\u2019ve laid out a sense that we expected this to take a fair amount of time. Obviously, we\u2019re not in control of the time line although we are active participants in the process. And we\u2019re going to continue to engage with both DOJ and DOT as well as we work through the process. Jamie, I don\u2019t know at this point what will exactly say and when. I do obviously understand people want to know where we are in the process. But equally, I think it\u2019s a process that is going to take some time, and we want to be respectful of the regulators\u2019 view and rights to review this transaction.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That\u2019s fair. Thanks, Robin. And second, how do you think a U.S. recession plays out for JetBlue? As a public company, you\u2019ve only experienced a single downturn, so not a huge history to call on. But that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m interested in asking the question. Thanks.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, I\u2019m going to ask Joanna to pick that.\nJoanna Geraghty: Hi, Jamie. How are you? So you mentioned our history. So if you take a look at how we performed during the 2008, 2009 cycle, we actually performed better in \u201809 versus \u201808. Obviously, a lot has changed. Hopefully, we don\u2019t see a recession. But if we do, we have taken a hard look at our business model and its resilience during what we believe could happen. And we have changed quite a bit since then, I think for the good in terms of building additional resilience in. we have continued to evolve our customer segmentation strategy. As you know, premium leisure tends to be more resilient during economic downturns. We now have our Mint product, which we did not have back in the \u201808, \u201809 crisis. We also carry a higher mix of VFR traffic, which also tends to be resilient. And we saw this as \u2013 even in the face of the pandemic when there were barriers to travel, this customer segment continued to fly to see their friends and family. And then as you think about segments potentially choosing to go down sort of the segmentation ladder, the introduction of our price-sensitive product, Blue Basic, is also, I think bodes well for us. And then finally, ancillary revenue, this has only grown over the last decade. And this tends to be much stickier during the recession. So, we do think there are inherent advantages in our business model. But we also recognize that recessions bring about a lot of change and not just on the demand side, but also it could include lower input costs as well. That said, as you think about the levers that we have to pull, capacity, we have demonstrated, I think all airlines have demonstrated their ability to book full capacity in a challenging environment. And so we could slow our growth rate and obviously right-size to the demand environment. Labor, that continues to be an opportunity as we think about what JetBlue was able to accomplish during COVID with voluntary programs and crew members taking advantage of those. And then, obviously, our fleet. We do have an aging fleet, so there could be opportunities to retire aircraft early. So, again, inherent advantages in our business model we think will serve us well during a recession. But not looking at that through rose-colored glasses and recognizing that we do have these additional levers in our toolkit that we could pull if we needed to do.\nJamie Baker: You have obviously put a lot of time and thought into it. Thank you, Joanna. Appreciate it. Take care.\nOperator: We will now move on to our next question.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Good morning everyone. Mike Linenberg, Deutsche Bank. Robin, just a follow-up on Jamie\u2019s question. Obviously, it is going to be \u2013 it seems like it\u2019s going to be a long regulatory process. But what can you do before you have gotten the full approval? Can you initiate code-sharing, frequent flyer reciprocity? Can your fleet people talk to their fleet people? I know that there are things that you can do, some of them may need DOT approval. Can you just talk about maybe some of the things that you could do or planning to do in the near-term?\nRobin Hayes: Yes. Hi. Michael, yes, no, thanks for the question. Obviously, many airlines have been through this many times. So, we have a lot to learn from what others have done. And yes, it is true. There are a small number of things that you are able to sort of talk about in that period. But we are going to take a very cautious approach to that. We are going to follow our legal advice and make sure that we are doing nothing to jeopardize to close the transaction or to give concern to our regulators who are reviewing it. And so I think work is all underway in terms of some of the internal planning that we do. Right now, our focus in addition to obviously the regulatory process, which is underway, is to make sure we get the shareholder approval \u2013 Spirit shareholder approval for the transaction.\nMike Linenberg: What is the data that, Robin? Have you come out with a date on the Spirit shareholder?\nRobin Hayes: No. My best estimate, Michael, is sort of 60 days to 90 days, and we have to get the proxy completed with Spirit, then we have to see if there is any SEC comments on that. And then it\u2019s got to \u2013 we have got to publish a meeting date. So, don\u2019t have the exact date yet, but we will know more on that soon.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. And then just my second question, Joanna, getting from a 90% completion factor to 98%, obviously a step in the right direction. But I suspect 98% is not still where you want to be, probably 99.2%, 99.3%. You did call out operational challenges for not just you, but the industry in the near and medium-term. What \u2013 how do we get to 99% plus? Do we get there by year-end? Is that a 2023 phenomenon? Every point of completion factor is probably the old saw was worth a point of margin, and I am not sure if that\u2019s still applicable to you or not. But it does seem like there is some upside there, but it may take some time, if you can comment on that? Thank you. Thanks for...\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, sure. Obviously, weather and then continued ATC disruptions are what will stand in the way of improving completion factor. I will say we are nearing historical levels. And so I think we are really pleased with where we are now. The teams have done a really nice job. But at the end of the day, weather and ATC challenges continue to be sort of the impediment to getting it up above 98%.\nRobin Hayes: Yes. Michael, let me just add to that. If we take July, Joanna mentioned this, but if we were to take our completion factor in July 2022 and compare it with 2019, it is extremely close. I mean I think it\u2019s like 0.2% away. So, I think the biggest driver of completion factor during the summer period is just the amount of ATC programs that are getting put in place, primarily those are weather-connected. So, on a good day here, we will have a completion factor, I hope of as close to 100% as we can. But because of the jobs here in the Northeast and just number of ATC programs that we see on a day when you sort of a three-hour to four-hour ground delay program is pushed into New York, you are going to see the industry with a completion factor somewhere probably between 90% to 95%. And so when you average those, you kind of get to that sort of 98%, 99% summer completion factor, which I think means that we are basically completing every \u2013 almost every flight other than those that are directly impacted by an ATC program or weather.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Great for the details. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. We will then move on to our next question.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. Good morning. Dan McKenzie from Seaport here. A couple of things. It\u2019s great to see the messaging that reiterates the prior objective of achieving the same or better margins versus pre-pandemic levels. The growth in cost commentary is helpful. On the balance sheet side, it looks like the plan is for lower leverage on the standalone and/or merger scenario. And on this point, are there free cash flow targets that you can share once back to normalized levels of profitability?\nUrsula Hurley: Good morning Dan. Good to hear from you. So, we did highlight that post transaction, we expect to end up at 3x to 3.5x of leverage, which is below the median within the industry. Obviously, the joint combined company, we intend to generate meaningful cash flow right out of the gate. And so the focus will be on de-levering the balance sheet to get it back to an even more acceptable level to JetBlue based on our historical performance and the way in which we manage the balance sheet. So, we do believe that, that could be a fairly quick de-levering exercise once the two combined companies come together. What I will say is the synergies obviously ramp up over a multi-period timeframe. So, it will take us a few years. But the goal, obviously, will be, as I mentioned, to get even lower than the 3x to 3.5x.\nDan McKenzie: Understood. On the corporate trends, I am wondering if you can just put a finer point on some of the prior Q&A questions. I guess with respect to the operational challenges, to what extent did they impact the corporate trends in the second quarter? Is there an impact on corporate demand heading into third quarter? So, I am just trying to get a better read on what\u2019s behind the revenue outlook. And is there some pent-up corporate demand here? And when can the volumes and revenue really surpass 2019 levels?\nDave Clark: Thanks Dan for the question. This is Dave. We saw just a little pressure, I would say at the beginning of the second quarter, more of a blip as we had the difficult first half of April slightly on the corporate side, some on the leisure side as well. But as we move through the second quarter and improved and got back towards our targets and at or above where our peers were, any of that has dissipated away. We have seen corporate sentiment continued to rebound as the operation has improved. And it\u2019s clear that corporates are the travelers themselves, the individuals already get on the road, all the surveys show that. As return to office continues, that will help enable more trips. Certainly, corporate customers are excited to get back in front of their customers and to do face-to-face revenue-generating meetings as well as some internal work and conference work that\u2019s been suspended for the last couple of years. So, a lot of different pieces there. The NEA is really helping to add more options for these customers in the Northeast. As our seamlessness continues to ramp up, we have seen increasingly positive sentiment from our corporate customers. And about two-thirds of them now have the NEA code-share benefits in their corporate contracts. So, things continue to improve. We don\u2019t have a final date yet on when we will reach fully recovered. This trend, we are probably looking late this year or over the winter, but we will see how that progresses and it could happen sooner.\nDan McKenzie: Thanks for the time guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now move on to our next question.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. This is Chris Stathoulopoulos, Susquehanna Financial Group. So, Ursula, or Robin, I just want to dig into this \u2013 the buckets here, you have outlined on Slide 14. The range of these numbers here, are these independent of the high-single digit ASM guide you put out, meaning if we are in a recessionary scenario and that high-single digit is perhaps 4 to 5, can you still hit these targets? And then b, how much of this, because the maintenance piece was in tech ops, if I remember, was a big focus in the last plan. So, how much of this is sort of identified during the pandemic versus a natural evolution of the plan that you envisioned as you were coming \u2013 exiting 2019?\nUrsula Hurley: Thanks for the question, Chris. So, first and foremost, half of the program that we have laid out is tied to enterprise planning. So, when I think of network and crew planning, we are essentially redesigning our processes to improve operability, which should result in improved cost performance. And the way in which our network has evolved given COVID, it\u2019s the pertinent time to actually ensure that we are iterating past performance and identifying, quite frankly, the optimal intersection between network operability and quality of life for our crew. So, the ranges take into consideration the capacity growth. In regards to end-of-life maintenance optimization, the structural cost program 1.0 that we delivered on, that was really focused in tech ops on airframe and engine contracts. This program is putting technology in place to optimize, quite frankly, end-of-life retirements for aircraft and engines. This program also is focused for maintenance on operational improvements, so given how the network has evolved, having the right tools, parts and processes in place to deliver from an operability perspective. And so from a maintenance perspective, these initiatives are very different than the first structural cost program. So, all-in-all to summarize that, we feel confident in delivering the $150 million to $200 million in structural cost savings by the end of 2024 and the ranges do take into account a small capacity range.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And the flattish \u2013 my follow-up CASM ex guide through 2024, that is on a guessing on a sustained high-single digit ASM base, does that \u2013 just remind us if that includes any labor deals? And on that high-single digit ASM base, if you could any color you could break out in terms of how you are thinking about gauge, stage lengths or new markets or building out depth of schedules? Just want to understand the buildup into that ASM guide? Thank you.\nUrsula Hurley: So, we are technically not providing 2023 and 2024 capacity guidance. However, historically, we have provided those guardrails around mid to high-single digits being the sweet spot for JetBlue in delivering superior margins. So, that\u2019s how I would think about the next few years. Actually, forget the second part of\u2026\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Labor.\nUrsula Hurley: Oh, labor. Yes. I am not going to comment on labor at this point in time. We are in discussions with our pilots, but I am not going to comment on that today. Over to you, David, any color on stage and gauge over the coming years?\nDave Clark: Sure. I think we will see roughly what we are seeing today. Obviously, with the retirement of the E190s and bringing in the A320s, there is a bit of a gauge increase that\u2019s well known as part of that. But in general, we will see the same sort of trends that we have had for the last couple of years.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question.\nHelane Becker: Hi team. It\u2019s Helane Becker from Cowen. Thank you for the time. So, just on the question of moving later, I guess did you say later this winter-fall into a new Terminal A at Newark and then new operations or new terminal at Orlando. As you think about the cost of doing that versus the benefits, can you just talk about, I don\u2019t know, whether it\u2019s a cost savings that you would experience with those two or maybe include La Guardia in there airports, of those three airports?\nUrsula Hurley: Yes. So, thanks for the question, Helane. Obviously, moving into new terminals will have an impact on the cost structure. However, we are growing in high-value geographies. So, we expect the margin production to heavily offset the infrastructure investments that are taking place. Dave \u2013 it is an enhanced customer experience for our customers, and so there are benefits there. Dave, anything else to add?\nDave Clark: Sure. Thanks, Ursula. And hi Helane, this is Dave. In addition to the superior customer experience, there are some efficiencies as well. I think in La Guardia Terminal B, we are reducing from two terminals that we are operating before down to one. That creates efficiencies. We are also co-locating with American, which provides the efficiencies in terms of customer connections within the Northeast Alliance. So, we feel really good about that one. New York has also been a real challenge in the old terminal. There wasn\u2019t enough space, security room, hold room space. We are pushing departures across multiple terminals as well. So, there is a lot of efficiency in just getting the customer experience to an acceptable level and then to a very good level that we are excited about there. So, certainly some benefits that come with simplifying operations into one terminal across various cities.\nHelane Becker: Thanks for that. And then just for a follow-up question on \u2013 as you think about \u2013 Ursula, since you mentioned geographies and operating in high-value geographies. Is there a way for you over maybe the next year or 3 years to move some of that capacity to other geographies that maybe are less impacted by air traffic control?\nJoanna Geraghty: Hey Helane, this is Joanna. I will take it and then Robin, I am sure, wants to chime in. So, as you look about the Spirit transaction, that\u2019s in part what it is about, is the ability to grow more quickly and diversify our network outside of the Northeast. If you look at the divestitures that we put out there, it\u2019s really keeping the Northeast growth kind of in line with where it is today and growing outside of that geography. I think the piece I will point out is New York has historically been a great sort of margin-building engine for JetBlue, and it\u2019s not fully recovered yet. And so as you think about potential upside even in the Northeast geographies, New York is one of those places where whether it\u2019s moving to the new terminal in Newark or LaGuardia, these are long-term investments. By the way, Newark, they are tearing it down. So, there is not an option there. But these are investments we think are more than appropriate given where New York has historically been and where we think it\u2019s going to return to over the medium-term.\nHelane Becker: Thank you very much. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our final question. Please go ahead.\nJames Hollins: Hi. It\u2019s James Hollins from BNP Paribas. Just my first question, just on staffing levels. It looks like they have probably take just above 20,000. I am just wondering if that\u2019s kind of the right number through the rest of \u201822? And maybe what the \u2013 where you would expect to be in 2023 as you look to grow what sounds like mid to high-single digit. Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. I think the staffing number is around 24,000. Though I will say, roughly in line, I mean at this point, we are really hiring for just that sort of mid-single digit growth. And so part of what you saw from kind of 2020, \u201821 through today was really ramping up. We also obviously have had some elevated levels of attrition, so we will continue to hire there. But it\u2019s largely backfilling and then just small incremental growth associated with our capacity growth.\nJames Hollins: Thanks again. And I expect I know the answer to this, but does your Atlantic strategy changed at all with the Spirit deal being landed and also in mind of the ramp-up in Heathrow costs? Thanks.\nRobin Hayes: No, it\u2019s unchanged. I mean our \u2013 as we think about Europe, it\u2019s really flying to the markets in Europe that are most important to New York and Boston, so for example, London and others to follow. We are really looking at the Spirit transaction to help grow our footprint outside of the Northeast. To Helane\u2019s point, we like our Northeast geography. It\u2019s very important that JetBlue stays relevant in these markets in order to drive long-term margin success. As Joanna mentioned, despite the very strong revenue guide into New York is still ramping up. We added a lot of capacity over the summer. And as we all know, as you add that, it takes some time to ramp up. So, I think good legs on that still. And whilst Heathrow cost increases have gone up, it is a very small part of our network. And as we add Boston, it will be two departures and arrivals a day, and so sort of de minimis really in terms of the overall impact.\nJames Hollins: Appreciate it. Great. Thanks Robin.\nJoe Caiado: James, go ahead, did you have a follow-up?\nJames Hollins: No, that was it.\nJoe Caiado: Great. Well, that\u2019s going to conclude our conference call for today. So, thank you so much for joining us, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-04-26 16:05:27", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Lee, your operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways' First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the call over to JetBlue's Director of Investor Relations, Joe Caiado. Please go ahead, sir.\nJose Caiado: Thanks, Lee. Good morning, everyone.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation. I'll start by thanking our more than 23,000 crew members for their continued dedication to caring for our customers and their unwavering focus on running a safe operation even as we work through recent challenges. We realize these difficulties have an impact on our customers and crew members, and we know that we haven't lived up to their expectations in recent weeks. But we are taking swift and significant actions to get the operation back on track in the near term and deliver the JetBlue experience that our customers love and expect whilst not losing sight of our longer-term strategic initiatives.  As you will see in our updated guidance, these actions will have a short-term impact on margin, but it's the right thing to do to build the confidence of our customers and crew members and set ourselves up for success as we look to maintain our revenue and cost momentum beyond the summer.  Our first quarter results were characterized by very strong demand acceleration with revenue coming in more than 6 points ahead of our initial view in January. We delivered positive year over three revenue growth in the month of March as we exited the quarter with tremendous revenue momentum, driven by very strong underlying travel demand across all of our core segments.  Unfortunately, a complement of events resulted in a temporary operational setback here in April that has significantly impacted our second quarter outlook. As you will recall, last month at an investor conference, we discussed our plans to moderate our capacity plan for the year in light of rising fuel prices and building more operational resilience.  We continue to experience elevated levels of pilot attrition and training pressures. This was further compounded by unprecedented levels of weather and ATC disruption in April, resulting in a 90% completion factor, 9 points lower than our historical average.  To help restore our operational reliability, we are reducing our capacity growth even further as we plan more conservatively for the summer and make investments to derisk the operation. These actions will create more resiliency in the operation and set us up for better May and an even better June and strong summer peak. While our return to profitability has likely been pushed out by a quarter, we're confident that this reset puts us on the right path.  Before we get into the results for the quarter, I'd like to make a brief comment regarding our proposal to acquire Spirit. We are very pleased by the determination of the Spirit Board that our offer could reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal in recognition of the compelling value for all stakeholders that JetBlue has offered. We will respect the confidential nature of the process as we engage with Spirit under the terms of their current merger agreement with Frontier and have nothing further to add on this topic beyond what we outlined in our conference call a few weeks ago.  Please keep in mind that the outlook and forecast that we discussed on this call have been prepared without taking into account or consideration a possible transaction with Spirit.  We remain focused on the operation as we look to capitalize on the very robust demand environment ahead of us, while continuing to execute on our strategic initiatives so that we are well positioned to return to profitability in the back half of the year and deliver value for our owners, customers, crew members and communities over the long term.  Now let's turn to our quarterly results, starting on Slide 6. For the first quarter, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.80. We experienced a remarkable V-shaped recovery following the Omicron wave, hitting a new daily sales record along the way. This demand momentum positions us incredibly well to recapture the recent run-up in fuel prices and we're excited for the strong summer travel period ahead of us.  As we strive to provide the high quality of service that our customers have come to expect from us, we're taking proactive measures to invest in and improve our operational performance, as Joanna will discuss.  We're also maintaining our summer hiring pace despite the reduced capacity outlook. And in partnership with New York Mayor Eric Adams, we hosted over 1,200 candidates at our hugely successful JFK hiring event last month as we work together to revitalize our hometown economies and vibrant tourism industry. All of this is reflected in our second quarter and revised full year outlook.  Moving to Slide 7. Despite the current operating and fuel environment, we are seeing underlying momentum of our path to transforming JetBlue's structural profitability. We are making great progress on many of our longer-term initiatives in 2022 and these will be meaningful drivers of our earnings growth in coming years. Our ability to grow in high-value geographies, bringing more value to customers and promote competition would not be possible without the Northeast alliance with American Airlines.  We are now operating more flights out of the New York metro area today than ever before with plans to increase service up to 300 flights per day. This compares to an average of roughly 200 flights per day pre-pandemic. And in the process, we are creating 5,000 high-quality jobs in our hometown of New York to support this growth.  I will note that given what we have experienced during April, our intention is to treat the ramp-up to 300 flights per day in New York very conservatively and to ensure we have more capacity to recover quickly from weather events.  I'm also pleased with the strong execution of our ancillary revenue strategy, which continues to provide customers with additional value and choice while driving strong unit revenue performance. On the loyalty front, the team continues to enhance the value proposition through our award winning TrueBlue program by adding earning and redemption opportunities for our customers.  And last but certainly not least, I'm always impressed by our JetBlue Travel Products team, as they doubled their revenue growth in Q1 compared with the first quarter of 2019. The business is scaling very nicely and remains on track to hit $100 million in run rate EBIT contribution this year.  Notwithstanding some of the short-term investments we have outlined here, our business model slides when we keep costs low, which is the other key lever to restoring our profitability. The volatile fuel environment and the investments we are making in our operations only serve to highlight the urgency, which we need to manage our controllable costs and drive productivity.  Having said that, it is important to note that the operational disruption in April really masks the underlying progress we are seeing in our CASM ex-fuel performance in Q2, which is actually trending in the right direction after adjusting for the short-term headwinds as Ursula will discuss further shortly.  In the first quarter, we exercised and accelerated 30 A220 options support the exit of our 190 fleet by 2026, and our fleet modernization program is key to driving a more efficient cost structure, while also supporting JetBlue's path towards net zero.  And given our reduced capacity outlook, we are also exploring the potential to further accelerate the retirement of some of our older aircraft. We're looking forward to sharing more detail with you at our Investor Day next month on all of the work our team is doing to position JetBlue for success as we look to strengthen our earnings power in the coming years and deliver value for our owners.  Turning to Slide 8. The work is never done on ensuring our long-term sustainability. And we recently announced another deal for SAF supply with Aemetis.  As part of our objective to be at the forefront of innovation and help decarbonize aviation, our JetBlue travel -- our JetBlue Tech Ventures subsidiary has made further investments in 2 additional start-ups. Electric Power Systems is a leading provider of aerospace battery systems and Air Company is working on carbon capture and conversion technologies.  We've also invested in the TPG Rise Climate fund as a limited partner focusing on decarbonizing transportation. All of this great work would not be possible without our crew members, and we continue to invest in protecting the sustainability of our talent pipeline as well.  Our JetBlue Foundation, which supports aviation-related STEM programs recently awarded grants to 10 charitable organizations to help increase advocacy for inclusion, gender and racial parity within STEM and aviation.  In conclusion, we absolutely recognize the short-term margin impact of the April disruption and the operational investments we are making for spring and summer, but they are essential to restore all of our customers' confidence and drive the higher revenue mix enabled by the NEA through the better schedules and benefits that will appeal to corporate and high-value leisure customers. I'll close with another thank you to our crew members. I'm always amazed and inspired by your resilience and hard work taking care of our customers and, of course, each other.  With that, over to you, Joanna.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. I'd also like to thank our crew members for always supporting each other and caring for our customers, especially when the operation experiences significant stress as we have seen this month. Severe weather compounded by ATC challenges, particularly across Florida and the Northeast have had an outsized impact on our operation, where 95% of our daily flights operate. Despite being well on track with our summer operational preparation, we have reevaluated our capacity planning assumptions for the summer in light of these challenges.  Turning to capacity on Slide 10. We began adjusting May capacity last month and we are continuing these adjustments into the summer and second half of the year as we focus on building a more operable and resilient schedule that takes into consideration the reality of the operating environment, including elevated pilot attrition, pilot training delays stemming from disruptions to planned training schedules due to Omicron, business partner staffing shortages and ATC staffing shortages.  In addition to our capacity adjustments, we are redoubling our efforts to bring the JetBlue experience back to our customers and our crew members. This includes maintaining our hiring pace for the summer despite the lower capacity outlook, getting ahead of supply chain pressures by prepurchasing key supplies and additional ground equipment for our airport and technical operations teams. Making infrastructure investments throughout our network, such as redeveloping the south lobby at JFK to support additional customers and COVID documentation checks, as well as additional gate hold seating and improvements to the roadway to better manage congestion during peak times.  We are also investing in additional checking kiosks as well as investing in additional resources for our crew members to better support them with hotels and transportation when there is bad weather, and flights are disrupted.  Finally, as our capacity has come down, we are investing in more spare aircraft and dedicated maintenance lines to provide our maintenance teams with additional touch time with aircraft. We believe our operational investments and capacity reductions will improve our operational performance in the coming months, while we continue to fly a record number of customers.  For the first quarter of 2022, our capacity declined 0.3% year over three as we proactively trimmed our schedules throughout the quarter in response to rising fuel prices and operational challenges and we have now made additional cuts to make our operation more resilient.  For the second quarter, we expect capacity to increase in a range between 0% to 3% year over three, the first quarter since 2020 that we expect to operate at levels above 2019, a significant milestone in our recovery.  We recently launched 3 new BlueCities in the first quarter, including Puerto Vallarta, Kansas City and Milwaukee. Later this quarter, we plan to launch service to Asheville as well as our inaugural Canadian BlueCity, Vancouver.  Our transatlantic service continues to perform very well, and we are excited to begin service to London from Boston this summer, with Gatwick service beginning in July, followed by Heathrow in August. For the full year 2022, we are now planning to grow capacity between 0% and 5% versus 2019 to reflect our more conservative planning assumptions.  Turning to corporate travel. This continues to be a positive momentum story as business bookings have recovered to approximately 75% of 2019 levels as we exited the first quarter compared to roughly half at the end of last year.  We expect a continued acceleration in Q2 and beyond, especially as we drive improvements in our operation. We are leveraging the NEA to grow our airline for both leisure and corporate travelers with a much enhanced network and schedule driving a competitive value proposition for customers.  As we execute our near-term plan, we will monitor the demand and fuel environment closely, and we will remain nimble with our capacity with the ultimate goal of returning to profitability in the second half of the year.  Turning to Slide 11. During the first quarter, our revenue declined 7.2% year over three, which came in more than 6 points higher versus our original forecast in late January. We initially anticipated a step function increase in demand following President's Day weekend as case counts dropped, and we are very pleased to see pent-up demand materialize beyond our expectations.  Load factors improved meaningfully from an average of 62% in the month of January to 80% in March. And in April, our loads are now tracking in the mid-80s. As we bring new crew members into the operation, we are building towards right-sized staffing levels and restoring efficiency and productivity levels over the long term.  For the second quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to increase between 11% and 6% year over three. This includes up to a 4-point revenue impact from the operational disruption. And despite the meaningful impact to the quarter and the year, we are set to generate our best quarterly revenue results in the second quarter and are positioned to accelerate this momentum through the summer. In fact, looking beyond the near-term headwinds, we anticipate June RASM to be approximately 20% year over three, and we expect June to be a nicely profitable month as we head into the peak summer.  I am pleased to see the record demand for travel on JetBlue all across our network, further fueled by the continued execution of our commercial initiatives. Based on our revised capacity plan, roughly 80% of our flights touch the Northeast as we continue to build out our Northeast alliance.  Through the growth enabled by the NEA, we can continue to do what we do best, bring down airfares in underserved and overpriced markets and deliver better service to more communities. By growing our Northeast footprint, we are bringing even more competition to customers in the Northeast, creating jobs and generating broader economic benefits while also positioning to capture a greater share of the corporate travel wallet in the region.  Loyalty continues to perform exceptionally well, and we achieved another month of record acquisitions and spend on our co-brand credit cards. We've also expanded Elite Loyalty Perks to TrueBlue Mosaic and AAdvantage members starting on March 23. In addition to space available extra-legroom seats, we are rewarding our most loyal customers with 2 complementary checked bags and same-day confirmed changes. This is on top of reciprocal Elite benefits launched earlier in the quarter.  Our suite of ancillary products is resonating well with our customers who are finding great value and choices with our different options. I'm pleased with the ongoing execution as we generated an ancillary revenue per customer increase of 70% in the first quarter year over three. Our segmented offering is also helping to shift the mix of our customers, driving a benefit for JetBlue. We are seeing acceleration across all customer segments and outstanding performance in the premium leisure category, in particular.  In close, thanks again to our crew members for your patience and perseverance in helping JetBlue manage through challenging circumstances. I remain excited about our long-term trajectory and look forward to sharing more at Investor Day next month.  Now I'll turn the call over to you, Ursula.\nUrsula Hurley: Thank you, Joanna. I would also like to add my thanks to our crew members for their dedication to taking care of our customers and each other. They have laid the groundwork and are executing every day to position JetBlue to deliver for all of our stakeholders.  I'll start on Slide 13 with a brief overview of our financial results for the quarter. Revenue was $1.7 billion, down 7.2% year over three. Cost per available seat mile was up 17.5% year over three. CASM ex-fuel was up 13.9% year over three, and GAAP loss per share was $0.79 and adjusted loss per share was $0.80. We are extremely pleased with the demand and revenue momentum, which accelerated throughout the quarter and resulted in first quarter revenue that was roughly 6 points ahead of our original January guidance. I am also pleased that we executed within the range of our original cost guide despite abnormally elevated winter weather events.  Looking ahead, as Joanna noted, we are reducing our full year capacity growth outlook to a range of 0% to 5% as we work to restore operational reliability and as we remain mindful of elevated fuel prices in the back half of the year. That said, the strength in bookings is driving revenue in the second quarter that is expected to be up 10% to 15% year over three, which will set a new high watermark for quarterly revenue in JetBlue's history. Despite the dramatic spike in fuel prices, we have been able to recapture nearly all of the cost increase.  Turning to Slide 14. During the first quarter, CASM ex-fuel increased 13.9% versus 2019, in line with our original guidance. As a reminder, incentives and premium pay tied to the Omicron and weather disruptions were worth roughly 3 points of CASM ex-fuel in the first quarter.  For the second quarter, we are forecasting CASM ex-fuel to increase 15% to 17%. The sequential increase versus Q1 reflects some inefficient closing capacity reductions in Q2, frontline premium and incentive pay to support the operation, ramp-up costs as we maintain our hiring pace for the summer and our recently signed deal with ALPA. If we adjust for the cost impact of the operational disruptions in April, our Q2 CASM ex-fuel would have been approximately 10%, demonstrating solid underlying improvement as we started to see progress in areas such as maintenance.  All in, the April disruption impacted our pretax margin in the second quarter by approximately 6 percentage points and keeps us at a loss for the quarter. That said, we expect to be solidly profitable for the month of June as we exit the quarter with strong momentum.  Looking ahead, as we build a more resilient operation and reach a more optimal staffing level, we expect to gain further efficiencies and productivity after the summer, meaning we won't need to rely as much on things like premium and incentive pay, driving continued CASM ex-fuel improvement as we move through the remainder of the year.  While the operational disruption in April has delayed our return to solid pretax profitability, we are investing meaningfully this summer to restore operational performance and we believe we are on a path to building back our margins and creating value for our owners through strong revenue growth, disciplined cost control and a methodical approach to capacity decisions. As always, we'll continue to be nimble and adjust course as needed.  We are very excited about the deliveries of next-generation fuel-efficient aircraft as we embark on a multiyear fleet modernization program. As a reminder, the A220s are 35% to 40% more fuel-efficient per seat compared to the E190s they are replacing. While the A321neos are 15% to 20% more fuel efficient versus our A321cos.  Moving to Slide 15. We now expect our full year capacity to increase in the range of 0% to 5%, approximately 10 points lower at the midpoint versus our prior forecast. We are reducing capacity as we work to overcome operational challenges, which are driving incremental costs through premiums and incentives on top of people-related ramp-up costs.  Following this sizable reduction, we now expect CASM ex-fuel for the full year 2022 to increase in the range of 10% to 15% versus 2019, compared with our initial expectations for an increase of 1% to 5%. The difference between our previous full year CASM ex-fuel midpoint to the new guidance midpoint, a 10-point difference breaks down as follows: 6 points driven by the capacity reduction. A total of 3 points from the spring operational challenges and the investments we're making for the summer, as previously outlined by Joanna and 1 point from inflationary pressures from pilots and our business partners. A slower growth rate creates a number of opportunities and additional cost levers that we can pull, including optimizing maintenance spend, accelerating aircraft retirements and cutting discretionary spend across the entire organization.  We believe we're taking the right actions to get back on track and fortify our long-term value creation framework, which we are excited to share more about at our Investor Day next month, along with the details on the next phase of our structural cost initiatives.  Turning to capital allocation on Slide 16. In the first quarter, we continued to make progress on our balance sheet while investing in our fleet and maintaining a strong liquidity position. During the first quarter, we paid down approximately $83 million of debt, and we funded approximately $160 million in capital expenditures. At the end of March, our adjusted debt to cap was 54%, and we closed the quarter with liquidity of $2.9 billion or 36% of 2019 revenue.  Turning to the fleet. I'd like to highlight our recent revision to our aircraft order book. I'm pleased to have a revised agreement with Airbus in place, as we exercised and accelerated 30 A220 options for delivery starting in 2022 through 2026. These 30 A220s will ultimately replace our 30 owned E190s and allow us to fully exit the E190 fleet by the end of 2026, driving a meaningful CASM tailwind and providing a solid platform for margin expansion and earnings growth.  For the full year 2022, our CapEx forecast remains at approximately $1 billion, mainly for aircraft, which we intend to fund with cash.  In closing, we've recognized that we've had to pivot this year as we need to get our operations back on track and regain our customers and crew members' trust. While this means lower utilization and productivity levels versus our original plan, we can now take advantage of the reduced growth outlook to pursue further structural opportunities such as further optimizing our maintenance spend and reevaluating accelerated aircraft retirements.  As we think beyond 2022, we're looking forward to our Investor Day next month where we'll provide you with a framework for JetBlue's long-term earnings power and deep dive some of our key strategic initiatives that will drive out our out-year financial targets and create value for our owners as we look to expand our margins beyond pre-pandemic levels in the coming years.  I'll close with another thank you to our crew members for their resilience and hard work in managing through all the challenges that come our way.  With that, we will now take your questions.\nJose Caiado: Thanks, everyone. Lee, we're now ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: So just thinking about some of the staffing issues, it sounds like there's some short-term headwinds given the industry are facing tied to Omicron training delays and just being a max training throughput, but then there's also elevated attrition in addition to staffing issues at airports, air traffic control, which aren't directly under JetBlue's control. Can you just walk us through when you see each of those buckets, the shorter and long-term issues within JetBlue's labor force and then throughout the more general travel infrastructure.  When do you see those easing? And I guess, what can you do today to influence the pace of those getting back on track? I know you laid out some operational boosters that you're going through for the summer, but just like specifically on hiring and getting staffing back up.\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. Thanks, Catherine, for the question. So the teams have done a fantastic job across all of our work groups really ramping up hiring for the last year. If you recall, we ramped capacity faster than any other airline last summer. We've had a couple of challenges across the industry, whether it's the Delta variant, Omicron that have created a level of volatility across the industry. What we're striving for is to find a place where the operation is more reliable and where there's a certain degree of certainty that we can plan around. Getting ahead of many of these staffing issues is critical because there is a long lead time for some of the roles. . So I fully expect our airports team, our in-flight team and our technical operations teams to be fully staffed as we step in through the summer time frame and into a more, I think, normal course of business, where we see, I think, meaningful pressures, and it's something I think everybody is seeing across the industry is on the pilot front. We are seeing elevated attrition levels with pilots. And so we've ramped up to max capacity there.  We will catch up on some of the training delays, but we have to plan for a world where we just have elevated pilot attrition and adjust our training plans and adjust our simulator capacity, et cetera, et cetera, to just speak to this kind of new world where pilots are just going to be a bit more challenging from a hiring and in retention perspective. We continue to have a very strong pipeline. We built out a number of pilot gateways years ago, recognizing that this potentially could be a problem down the road. We have great retention among the pilots that come through our gateway programs. But at the end of the day, given the legacy carriers have accelerated retirements through COVID of pilots, there's just, I think, a challenge the whole industry is facing right now in terms of pilot hiring and it will be facing, I think, for the foreseeable future.  With regard to the external factors, I cannot speak to when we think the FAA is going to be fully staffed. We've obviously seen acute pressures down in the Jacksonville center in Florida. But I think everybody around the United States is looking at these talent challenges.  I think on the good news front, we've got a great pipeline, people like working here, and we're going to continue to double down on our culture. And I'm making sure that JetBlue continues to be a preferred airline employer.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Great. And then maybe just one on the June. You gave us June RASM up 20%, showing some nice acceleration over the course of the quarter there. I guess just given the cuts you've had to make, do you feel more confident than in a normal year about that June number, just given some of the close-in cuts. Like can you just maybe give us an update? I know book and curve got really short and varying COVID, sounds like we're moving back to normalization. So just maybe like your confidence level and anything that might make you more confident on June than in a normal year?\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. Yes. I mean, we are extremely confident about the revenue landscape right now. We are seeing extremely robust demand across our leisure segment. Premium domestic is extremely strong, Mint. Q1 Mint was 6 points better than core. Our VFR markets are performing exceptionally well. So we're very, very bullish on the revenue front, both from a total revenue but also from a unit revenue perspective. We're yielding up in a meaningful way, fares and yields are now above 2019 levels, and we do expect June and the summer to be very strong.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Duane here. Robin, I appreciate the brief intro comments, but when do you expect to hear a response from Spirit? What have you learned so far since unveiling this to the world? And what do you think is taking so long?\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Duane. In terms of any questions you may have about the time line, I would suggest that you address those to Spirit. And I'm not really going to comment any more at this stage other than that our team is working very diligently and very hard to move things along as quickly as possible.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Fair enough. And then sorry to go here, but just on the growth takedown, this feels surprisingly unsurprising. Many investors believe that the implied growth acceleration you were guiding to felt ambitious aggressive last quarter. Multiple large carriers saw this coming last year and took their growth rates down kind of proactively, yet JetBlue expressed a lot of confidence just last quarter, just on this call 3 months ago that you could hire, and you could sort of pull off the summer. So what specifically broke down here in just 3 months' time? Or was this just a forecasting problem?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. I think at the end of the day, we've had, I think, exceptional revenue performance for the last year. If we could continue to proceed at this growth pace, I think we would continue to have exceptional revenue performance. There's clearly not a demand issue. We've been, I think, planning well for the summer, but there were a series of things early this year that transpired. I think pilot training delays stemming from Omicron in Q1, so that's January. And then in March, we communicated that we will be moderating capacity into May and beyond. Obviously, we would have liked to, of course, correct it quickly. But in this volatile world where there's new variants that happened upon you and attrition challenges across the industry. I think we've done a pretty strong job pivoting and adjusting our capacity to reflect our resources and the environment.  Nobody could have anticipated that Florida in April would have 115 minutes of ATC delay -- 115 hours of ATC delays for that month compared to 22 in 2019. So these are challenging times, and I think we're doing the responsible thing by taking capacity down and rightsizing it to reflect the resources we have and the external environment.\nRobin Hayes: I think, Duane, let me just build on that because it's a good question. I think that we are -- we address the -- as Joanna said, we actually made a change in May that we announced in early March. We also, at that point, suggested it would continue into the summer. I think what you're seeing today is just a couple of things. First of all, we wanted to be as clear and transparent with investors about how we're thinking about the rest of the year, because you're still seeing airlines cut schedules every weekend. And so it is still a very nonlinear volatile process. And so I think what we're trying to do is kind of set the stage for the rest of the year. I'd also -- we could be accused here clearly of almost overinvesting and being too cautious as we go into the summer. That is an extremely deliberate approach that we're taking because we know how important it is for us to drive margins, for us to deliver the benefits on the NEA, for us to continue to be the preferred airline in the Northeast for customers' premium leisure and also leisure travel. We know we have to deliver a stable operation. And we have become increasingly concerned about some of the external environment constraints that we may see this summer based on what we've seen in April. And so we want to respond quickly and decisively to that.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Listen, I appreciate the thoughts. And maybe just one last follow-up. I hear you on attrition, right? It's something we've been hearing about for a long time, over a year, right? It's not a new issue. It's something we've been hearing about for over a year. To what extent is staff productivity surprising you? If you could just comment on that.\nJoanna Geraghty: Maybe I'll offer a broad comment and Ursula can chime in. We need to get to a more stable environment to start seeing productivity settle in. When you're hiring to just backfill the person who left a month before, that's not a great place to be in. And so our focus is on driving stability across the operation. And at that point, we're confident that we will start seeing some of the productivity that we need to see going forward. So I think back half of the year, as we stabilize, I think we're cautiously optimistic that we'll be in a better place.\nUrsula Hurley: Yes. I would just add, Duane, like coming into this year, we were very focused on a growth track and driving productivity and utilization ramp up throughout the year. Given the pivot and the reduction in capacity on a full year basis means that we're going to have significantly lower aircraft utilization and essentially a delay in the productivity benefit. We do expect, once we get to that optimal staffing level to see productivity improvement in the fourth quarter. However, in addition with the capacity reduction, it also means that we can take advantage of other structural initiatives such as replanning maintenance and also looking at potentially accelerating incremental aircraft retirements. And so those are some structural cost areas that we're now very acutely focused on to ensure that we can deliver on a cost discipline not only this year, but as we enter 2023.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Robin, when you -- I guess, you were speaking on CNBC or something this morning, you had mentioned something about $270 million to fix the ops. And then I saw a headline that said $180 million. Is that what was one, a '22 number and one is a longer-term number. Can you just clarify what that several hundred million dollars of cost to fix ops, what that is? And what's the time frame?\nRobin Hayes: I didn't do a CNBC interview this morning, Mike, that's this afternoon. I did a couple of other interviews. That really relates to the 3 points of CASM headwind that Urs talked about. So if we think about, first of all, the cost of the April disruption itself, so we ended up canceling a large number of flights. Those flights are being crude and they were fully operational. So that is a very significant CASM headwind on top of that in order to recover from some of the weather events, we saw a big outflow in terms of premium pay.  So that's really about half of that 3 points of CASM that you were referring to. And then the rest of it is us taking a much more cautious approach about -- for the rest of the spring and summer.  So for example, even though capacity is significantly down, we're maintaining current hiring plans. We are putting additional resilience and redundancy into the JFK operation. And that makes up the -- those are a couple of examples. And that makes up the other 1.5 points of the 3 points of CASM that represents the other half, about 1.5 points.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. That's helpful. And then just I want to go back on the attrition thing. When I sort of think about JetBlue historically, I mean that's -- it's a destination carrier for airline professionals historically. And yet now, it does seem like maybe for some, it's a stepping stone. And I'm not sure -- like what can you do? Is this a secular shift or beyond throwing a lot more money at the pilots? Obviously, you are a growth carrier, and that's something that's attracted to pilots. For now, you can't grow. Like, is this something that's with you for the next 6 months? Or is this something more structural and it goes on for several years where you're constantly playing catch-up to attract the people that you would attract in the past.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thanks, Mike. Really appreciate the question. So it's not an issue of attraction. We have a strong pipeline, particularly on pilots, they like coming here. And the issue becomes obviously time to upgrade. It becomes pay. If you want to fly widebodies, there might be different pads that you want to take but we remain a very attractive carrier. We need to plan for elevated levels of attrition, recognizing that there may be some pilots that choose to leave near 0 to 4 because of a different life choice but then we also do a great job retaining pilots as well. And so it's a bit of a mixed bag.  We've got a number that's stable and we have a number that leave. We need to plan our training and our simulator capacity for an elevated level of attrition, but we also need to ensure that those who come and want to stay at a carrier like JetBlue stay, which many of them are.  We have these gateway programs, which are fantastic. They bring crew members in from JetBlue's family members, friends, et cetera. We've been doing this for several years now. We're now generating a decent size number of pilots coming through those pipelines that have a real stickiness to JetBlue, our culture and the type of organization that we are. Attrition is very low among those cohorts. And so we are looking at continuing to increase the number of folks that come through there. But I think the industry as a whole, I think, is looking at what do we do about the pilot shortage of legacy carrier retirements accelerated this pilot shortage issue by a few years. It could very well lead to lower aggregate capacity growth over the next couple of years. But we are pivoting our philosophy around how do we build a model where we have elevated attrition where we have the gateways that crew members and their family members and other aspiring pilots come through, and they want to stay at JetBlue and then continuing to build out partnerships with other carriers, speeder carriers around the United States.\nRobin Hayes: The other thing I'd like to add to that, Mike, is I think the other structural change you're going to see is that the pay rates for pilots across all of the large airlines will start to converge. And I think we're already seeing that. I think you're going to continue to see that. I think that is something that could be around for a number of years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Just if I might follow up on Mike and Catie's question. Just based on kind of the capacity growth that you have in mind for the next few years, just how many pilots do you need to hire? And how many of them might come from your kind of internal programs? And to follow up also, Robin, on your pay rate question. If that is the case, then does that mean kind of legacy versus like your cost -- unit cost will then also start to narrow versus kind of legacy carriers because there's a bigger gap there between where your kind of LCC band is versus like a carrier pay band?\nRobin Hayes: Yes. Savi, on the second one, I don't think it's going to be a huge issue for JetBlue. Our pay rates were already pretty close. And in fact, with this adjustment that we just did, I think you'll find -- if you'll compare our fleet 20 pay rates versus some of the legacies, you'll find them very similar. So it's more a comment aimed at maybe some of the other carriers that have lower pay rates and how those will probably need to come up, just my opinion. In terms of go-forward rate, we'll provide more color at Investor Day about how we're thinking about multiyear. But I think that we are going to continue to clearly prudently plan and plan more conservatively around pilot attrition until we have a better sense of how long this is going to be. I mean the good news for JetBlue is, and Joanna mentioned this, we started our gateway program a number of years ago, and it's producing a meaningful number of pilots.  And so it's not like we're sort of starting from scratch last year and trying to get this thing going. And we have every confidence that as we recruit more and more through these programs, those are pilots that have more traditionally seen it as remaining as a destinational carrier.  So I think that's how we're thinking about the next few years. But I certainly think that in my opinion, and some of you heard this before, that the access to pilots really becomes the governing factor for growth in the industry over the next few years.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And if I might, just Joanna, just to follow up on some of the kind of the ATC-type issues. I'm just trying to understand is kind of Florida saw a lot of capacity being added to over the last several years and that accelerated the last couple of years, I think. Is this -- is this more of a near-term staffing issue that FA needs to address? Or is it becoming kind of a congested airspace like you have in the Northeast? I'm just kind of curious if there's something fundamentally structurally changing in Florida or kind of an issue that just need to be addressed?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. I mean I know you're down in Florida. I think everybody is in Florida right now. So I think it's probably a temporary issue with just the amount of capacities in there. We do think once international opens up a bit more, once the COVID document checks go away, the inbound international you'll start seeing, I think, a rebalancing of capacity into other leisure destinations beyond Florida. But -- and then I think you've also got a winter summer thing playing out as well there. But I do think there are structural issues regarding SAA ATC staffing, we've talked about it before. I think April was a particularly acute month. If you look at JetBlue's network footprint, 45% of our flights touch Florida. And so it makes perfect sense that when you have a significant ATC center understaffed by, call it, 50% and with that volume of flights you have going in, there's no way that you aren't going to see significant amount of delays from those carriers to have a very big footprint in Florida.  So I think the capacity will be largely hopefully, short term, as carriers rightsize their networks over time and COVID doc checks come away. But I do think this FAA staffing shortage could be potentially a more protracted item. And so we continue to be very focused on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham from MKM Partners.\nConor Cunningham: I think that investors are -- I mean a lot of -- there's been a lot of conversation about structure versus temporary here. So I'm just trying to unpack it -- unpack like what's actually going to be your long-term utilization rate of the airline going forward. Like why shouldn't we just assume, given the host of issues that you have that it will be a challenge for you ever to get back to this 12 hour of flying per day. I mean can you just speak to the utilization in the context of hiring problems and you leaning more into tougher airports like New York and so on. So if you can just speak to that, that would be great.\nUrsula Hurley: Conor, thanks for the question. As I mentioned, at the beginning of the year, we were acutely focused and on a growth track with high utilization. And given the meaningful step back, due to the challenges that we've seen in April, utilization is going to be down double digits throughout the remainder of this year. And I also think as we think about 2023 capacity most likely will be below our original anticipated capacity growth. And one of the structural levers I highlighted was taking another look at aircraft retirements in light of the lower utilization levels. And can we have the ability to drive some structural cost savings that, quite frankly, some of our peers were able to take advantage of in retiring fleets throughout COVID. So that's an opportunity that we're looking at given this reset and the lower utilization levels that we'll expect this year as well as into next year, given the constraints.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then yes, your head count is actually up fairly nicely in the first quarter. I think your capacity is done and I realized you talked about the productivity conversation earlier. But I'm trying to pinpoint like when we should expect -- it seems like that's going to expand further that gap between capacity and headcount in the near term, but then should gradually improve. Is that like a 3Q event when we peak out? Or should we just expect that to kind of be elevated through the pandemic part of even next year?\nUrsula Hurley: Yes. I would expect us to see a level of staffing stability and operational stability and that will drive productivity in the fourth quarter. So we're making investments in the short term in order to continue hiring and staffing through the summer, and we believe that we'll bring a level of resiliency to the operation, and we'll be at optimal staffing levels in order to get that productivity in the fourth quarter.\nRobin Hayes: One thing I'd just add on the head number is that whilst capacity is flat, stage engage is up. So for example, more 321s, the restyled 320s, both of which are 4 in-flight crew members. And so -- and then in terms of customer support or reservations, we've seen a big increase there related just to -- and you've seen this across the industry, the vast number of additional calls that are coming in for disruption. So those 2 areas are sort of driving a disproportionate increase in actual headcount.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Robin, you actually just partly answered my question about bigger aircraft. How can you accelerate delivery of bigger aircraft to alleviate some of your staffing issues, especially with pilots? And then my other question is related to scaling up to 300 flights in the New York area. Can this air traffic control system handle that level of airport utilization? And I know you said you would be more conservative, but how should we think about getting there from here?\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Helane. In terms of your first question, I think, no, we don't have any plans to accelerate any more airplanes. We talked recently about the 220s. I think what this adjustment allows us to do is to, as Ursula mentioned earlier, look at some of the retirement opportunities that exist for some of our older airplanes and accelerate out of that, because back to [indiscernible] comment, whilst I recognize that aircraft utilization probably needs to be a bit lower than it has been historically reflecting the air space. Now obviously, that lower aircraft utilization also creates the opportunity to drive some retirements in a world where we look at sort of structurally lower growth because of pilot supply.  In terms of the growth in New York, one of the areas that we have been adjusting is Newark. And we have some of the capacity changes that we make have reduced our flying in and out of Newark. Obviously, from a JFK and LaGuardia perspective, with just slotted airports, that is something that's much harder to do. So we do have slightly less dependency in the New York air space following this capacity adjustment than we did before because of the changes that we're making in Newark.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Without commenting on the deal specifically, just given the first half challenges, do you stand by the leverage recovery guidance that you gave us when you announced the bid? The stand-alone outlook is obviously worse. So just trying to quantify the need to potentially issue equity.\nUrsula Hurley: Jamie, the original plan still stands for the offer for Spirit to be a full cash offer. Obviously, we've taken one step back in terms of our projections for full year profitability this year, but we still have a strong balance sheet, and our offer stands as is. Our 2022 leverage will now be slightly above 1x, which is obviously a slight change compared to the presentation that we laid out last -- a couple of weeks ago, and that's really driven by, obviously, the April step back here.\nJamie Baker: And second, and specifically to Robin, look, 2007 was a different era for the industry for JetBlue. The constitution of JetBlue's Board is different today, but it's worth noting there's precedent for senior leaders being let go when operations have suffered. How would you characterize your recent conversations with the Board? Could you say how much that time has been split between discussing the merger and discussing the operational challenges?\nRobin Hayes: Well, first of all, Jamie, let me, as I often do on this call. I wish you a very happy birthday week not forgotten. No, look, I think the operational concerns are of concern to all of us, the leadership team, the Board and more importantly, our crew members. And clearly, as you know, we operate in the most congested complex geography in the country. And what we have to do is just get better at managing that.  And as these -- I mean, as you know, weather comes in, flights will get canceled, there'll be ATC delays. And really, we continue to make a lot of investments to allow us to get better at that. And so I think that the pivot that we're announcing here in terms of reducing capacity, distressing the summer, investing in staffing, all of these things are the things that will help us deliver a better, more stable operation.  We can't control the weather, but we can try and control everything in out, and that's what we're laying out to do. But the #1 priority from that for me or the leadership team for the Board right now is restoring our operational performance because that is the path to margin recovery. And whilst I fully accept, we take a step back in the second quarter, there is -- there will be no catalyst for driving better cost performance and improved revenue than a stable operation, and that's what we're focused on.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Robin, I appreciate that. Also worth noting that I share my birthday with the Piedmont hub in Charlotte, proving that there's always an aviation angle.\nRobin Hayes: Always, Jamie, with you always.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie from Seaport Global.\nDaniel McKenzie: A couple of questions here. Profitability in the back half of the year. I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on how we get there. Is it being driven by premium revenue, corporate demand? So is there some revenue acceleration from here? Or how much of the profitability is just tied to better utilization?\nUrsula Hurley: As mentioned in our remarks, the revenue and demand environment continues to be really, really strong. And so we're expecting profitability as early as June, and that's really driven by a top line RASM number of like 20% as of right now. And as we navigate through the year, we expect especially in the third quarter, demand in the revenue environment to be extremely strong. In 2H of this year, we'll also see a 4-point improved -- sequential improvement from a CASM ex-fuel perspective. So we will start to gain some efficiencies as we discussed earlier around maintenance as well as productivity in the fourth quarter. So that's the road map, but maybe to give more detail on top line, I'll pass it over to Dave.\nDavid Clark: Sure. Dan, thanks for the question. Just a little bit more color on the revenue. In addition to the really strong demand environment we're seeing, we have a couple of other factors that will improve as we go through the year. First, just a reminder that we had a 4-point revenue headwind this quarter from the operational disruptions that should not continue past Q2. And then the NEA is off to a great start in ramping up well. We expect that to continue throughout the year. So we expect to have additional revenue acceleration as the NEA performs better and better.\nDaniel McKenzie: Okay. And then, I guess, just bigger picture for those investors that take a longer view of the story, you have lots of patients. Going back to the PowerPoint, the goal of expanding margins beyond 2019, so the $2.50 to $3 a share target at this point, what's the path and time frame for getting there today? Is that -- how much corporate travel has to come back? What size or scale from a growth perspective is required? And are new revenue initiatives or cost initiatives needed to offset some of the challenges we're seeing today?\nRobin Hayes: Yes. Maybe I'll sort of take a high level. And I think, Dan, first of all, it's a great key up to Investor Day because our plan at Investor Day is going to really lay out that multiyear path. And I think that -- I think '23 will be the first year we're actually comping against the year before as opposed to 2019. So it feels like it's a new beginning. But look, on the revenue side, I think we've talked about a lot of the catalyst. And I think we have a lot of very strong revenue initiative for the ramping up nicely. I mean if we didn't have that 4 points of headwind for the very significant operational disruption that we talked about earlier, we -- our top of the range for the quarter would be 20 points.  And so -- and by the way, we do factor in a certain amount of weather events, right? We don't want to just always talk about the weather. But Joanna described how meaningful it was that in Florida, for example, the first 20 days of April, we were in ground stop or ground delay programs for over 115 hours. And I think if you compare that to 2019, it was 22 hours. So significantly bigger impact.  And so I believe that we will work through those challenges. Already, we've seen a better traffic control environment in the last 10 days of April. So that's encouraging. And hopefully, that will continue. So Dave talked about the ramp-up, the NEA revenue, the growth of JetBlue travel products.  And then on the cost side, I think that we are making good progress on some of the underlying cost initiatives that we've talked about before. We'll share more of that at Investor Day. We've also concluded the work on a new multiyear structural cost program that we've been working on for the last several months. We have been working with some external partners on that, and we'll be laying that out at Investor Day as well. So continued and accelerated revenue momentum.  And when we get past some of this noise of what we're seeing this year and I fully recognize the difficulty for people to model it when you sort of have these big pop-up numbers that appear into the quarter. But when you take the revenue acceleration and you take the structural cost initiatives, we'll share more about. We're very [indiscernible] some of the benefits and some of that, and we'll be sharing more of that at Investor Day as well [Technical Difficulty].\nDaniel McKenzie: Asked and answered, but one for Robin I guess, when I look at this kind of short-term cuts to capacity just seemed like these operational problems. When I think about kind of longer term, how much does M&A actually attempt to solve this labor issue as opposed to just accelerating the growth of the airline? Interested to get your thoughts there.\nRobin Hayes: No. Thanks, Andrew [ph]. I do think -- you're right. I mean some of what you're seeing now is us just trying to significantly derisk the summer. And we can talk about how much we should derisk it. But I think we recognize that we need to plan conservatively. I mean, to give you a sense, I mean, this is the first time in JetBlue's history that June block outs or ASMs will be significantly below April's. Those April and June tend to be the strongest month we have in quarter 2. So it's a very sizable change. I think when we think about the longer term, I do think the pilot supply issue will be a governor of you in capacity in the U.S. for a period of time. And I think when I think about M&A, the reason that we believe the opportunity is for the JetBlue and Spirit merger is it would allow us to supercharge and accelerate that organic plan, bring in a large group of pilots into the airline, creating more growth opportunities, kind of creating a bigger destinational carrier, potentially reducing attrition. So I think that for airlines who want to pursue an organic plan, and we've been there, obviously, for many years, I do think that is more challenging over the next few years given the pilot supply environment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna International.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So I realize that there's a lot going on here, the NEA, the potential Spirit deal. But CASM ex has been a key area of focus and for some pushback on JetBlue since the structural cost program was first communicated in, I believe, 2014. And I guess the moving parts of the 10% to 15% CASM ex-guide. But on your Spirit call, you indicated that you would not expect that to go lower, I think, on what was a 60% to 70% larger base due to certain dissynergies. And I realize you can't comment on Spirit here, but directionally, how should we think about your core exit rate for CASM this year? And again, this is probably more suitable for Investor Day, but at a high level, what should we put in the structural versus temporary cost buckets at this point?\nUrsula Hurley: Chris. So when you look at the 2022 CASM ex forecast, if you take the midpoint of 12.5%, we essentially have 4 points of nonrecurring investment. And one of those was driven by the Omicron hit to Q1 of this year. And then the remaining 3 that we've highlighted here today in regards to the investments in the spring and summer operations. So those are nonrecurring, and you should expect those to fall away as we enter 2023. So then that brings you down and you -- essentially, as a reminder, you have 3 years of inflationary pressures across the business when you look at labor and business partner spend. But even outside of that, we have incremental costs that we need to offset. And as Robin mentioned, we are looking at structural levers given the reduction in capacity. So think of reflowing through your maintenance plan and investment levels. Think of how can we accelerate incremental aircraft to drive cost savings over the next few years given the lower utilization. And as Robin mentioned, in addition to that, we also have hired external help to put -- to get -- help us put together the next set of structural cost initiatives.  The JetBlue business model works if we have a lean cost structure compared to the peer set. And we acknowledge we have to execute that, and we look forward to providing you guys more color at Investor Day next month.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. If I could get one more in on the corporate side, based on any survey work or other data that you're looking at, what does your mix of users look like now versus pre-pandemic? Are you seeing a shift in, say, your mix of finance, consulting in pharma or health care now versus 2019? And what should we think about in terms of that mix for your 2022 guide?\nDavid Clark: Thanks, Chris, for the question. This is Dave. I'll take that one. One of the great stories over Q1 has seen the corporate customer come back, and we've seen that mix really start to return back to what we've seen before the pandemic. So lots of growth in the consulting sectors, finance sectors, education. So we're really back now pretty close to where we were pre-pandemic, which is terrific and has really helped fuel that growth from corporate recovery was about 50% for us as we exited 2021, and it was at 75% as we exited Q1. So really good growth in return back to our historical mix.\nJose Caiado: We will take one final question from the analysts.\nOperator: Wonderful. Your last question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Can you talk about your exposure to New York [Jet] and any potential to reduce that? Or do you think this is just temporary and it will sort of fix itself over time?\nUrsula Hurley: Yes. I appreciate the question. Our exposure to the New York over index, this -- in the second quarter was to the tune of about $0.06 to $0.07 on our fuel price. And obviously, since we marked fuel and over the last few weeks, the New York Harbor Index has drastically come down compared to where it was a month ago. But as I said, minimal -- generally speaking, minimal impact, $0.06 to $0.07 in the quarter.\nScott Group: Okay. And then as I look out to next year, if you've sort of taken 10 points of capacity out of this year, would you -- if you can, would you hope to sort of get 10 points of capacity growth next year? And then assuming you can grow next year, you think CASM is down in '23?\nRobin Hayes: I mean, first of all, I don't think it's realistic to take the 10% of capacity this year and add it into next year because, again, it's not aircraft or fleet or demand that is driving that change that we would normally say, well, when the demand comes back, you ramp it up. We know demand is exceptionally strong. It's really sort of pilot supply. And until we see a different trajectory in terms of attrition and sort of the number of pilots being produced in the U.S., we need to take a more prudent approach. And so I think you'll see that from us at Investor Day.  And in terms of multiyear CASM outlook, the way I think about it is strip out the onetime CASM numbers that we've seen here due to sort of exceptional circumstances. If you really go and look at that then that cumulative number is sort of 3 years of inflationary pressure and everything else that you see us, and other airlines talk about.  And then as we exit into '23, then we have the benefit of the structural cost initiatives that are unfortunately masked by some of the issues we've seen in Q2. You have some new initiatives that we'll be talking to you about. And then we have the ability on the maintenance and retirement side to retire some of our sort of more costly older airplanes. I think all of that comes together to drive a CASM outlook.  When I look back at 2018 and 2020 and getting back to sort of the cost discipline. Now I think the difference between then and now is inflationary pressure in the industry. I think we have to wait and see a little bit how that continues to play out. But we need to make sure that we're doing everything on the productivity front, everything on the maintenance front and everything else that we're doing to drive a low CASM growth outlook in the face of moderated capacity that which will go to drive margin expansion.\nJose Caiado: Thanks, everyone. That concludes our first quarter 2022 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: And again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 4, "year": 2021, "date": "2022-01-27 13:59:04", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Sarah, and I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  I would like to turn the call over to JetBlue's Director of Investor Relations, Joe Caiado. Please go ahead.\nJose Caiado: Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release and a presentation that we'll reference during this call. All of those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and have been filed with the SEC. In New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ursula Hurley, our Chief Financial Officer.

For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Thank you, Joe, and congratulations to Lisa and David, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking our 22,000 crewmembers who have been extraordinary through 2021. I'm so proud of their efforts to continue to deliver the JetBlue experience our customers expect regardless of the challenges. The spike in Omicron cases, particularly during the holiday peak, drove an unprecedented increase in sick calls across the industry. The Northeast, where the vast majority of our crew are based, was especially impacted, and we recognize this created very difficult travel conditions for our customers. Despite these challenges, our crewmembers remain focused on running a safe airline. As we look ahead, we believe JetBlue is positioned extremely well for future success as many of our investments come to fruition in 2022, and we remain well on track to restoring our earnings power. We have a great team of crewmembers, and I'm confident they will continue to deliver the best service and products in the industry, while inspiring humanity. Let's turn now to Slide 4 in the deck. For the fourth quarter, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.36. While Omicron has temporarily weighed on demand in the very near-term, we expect sequential month-on-month improvement through the quarter, ultimately returning to sustained profitability in the spring and beyond. In fact, if it was not for Omicron, we believe we would have generated higher revenue this quarter than in the first quarter of 2019. I'd like to highlight several key achievements in 2021, enabled by the outstanding work of our crewmembers. We generated revenue close to 2019 levels this summer, outperforming the nine largest U.S. airlines aided by the solid execution of our commercial initiatives. And we turned a profit in the months of July and August as a result. We put a solid plan in place to deliver low single-digit CASM ex growth in 2022 versus 2019, methodically identifying savings to help offset significant industry cost headwinds and our investments in the NEA. You'll recall that we were quick to identify and call out these cost pressures in the middle of last year, and we will continue to be extremely transparent with all of you on the trajectory of our recovery. We brought much needed competition and customer choice to the Northeast with our Northeast Alliance. We also disrupted the transatlantic market with the launch of our service to London, and our award-winning products and service. We now have a greatly enhanced network with stronger relevance to all customers, both business and leisure as we come out of the pandemic. Turning to 2022, we look forward to continuing to execute on our plan to create value for all of our stakeholders, our customers, our crewmembers, our owners and our communities, with our primary focus remaining on margin. Moving to Slide 5. The recent surge in COVID case counts nationwide, particularly here in the Northeast, underscores the need to remain nimble and adjust capacity quickly. However, with respect to Omicron, we are confident the worst is behind us and evidenced by recent case count trends in New York City plummeting. We believe demand is poised to reaccelerate through the quarter into a robust spring and peak summer travel season, similar to the setup around this time last year. And we are already seeing demand rebound strongly, with net revenue builds up roughly 30% compared to the first week of January. Consequently, while we do not expect to be pretax profitable in Q1, we expect the month of March to be much stronger than January and February. I firmly believe that 2022 will prove to be a transformational year for JetBlue's structural profitability as we look to restore our earnings power and create value for our shareholders. And we plan to achieve this by pulling meaningful commercial levers, keeping our relentless focus on costs and maintaining our measured approach to capital allocation. Despite all the near-term volatility, we plan to leverage our enhanced network enabled by our Northeast Alliance to unlock further value in our key geographies, while promoting robust competition. And we plan to bolster relevance and competition in the region even more with the expansion of London service from New York and the exciting addition of Boston transatlantic service later this year as well. I'm also pleased with the ongoing execution of our other commercial initiatives, including fare options and our TrueBlue loyalty program, both of which continue to be important drivers of revenue growth. On the cost front, we saw meaningful pressure across the industry in 2021 as the recovery took hold. The nonlinear recovery emphasizes our need to double down on cost control, as Ursula will discuss. I believe our focus on driving tangible productivity benefits will help ensure we become an even more efficient enterprise. We have also demonstrated our commitment to repairing our balance sheet, having paid down approximately $1.9 billion of debt this year. We'll continue to be measured and balanced in our capital allocation to drive further shareholder value over the coming years. Let's move now to Slide 6. Today, I'd like to spend a minute highlighting the tremendous momentum from our JetBlue Travel Product subsidiary. Back in 2018, we announced a plan to deliver $100 million in run rate EBIT, and we're marching towards our goal. 2021 was a banner year, with record JTP revenue, including 50% commissions revenue growth versus 2019 and $45 million in EBIT contribution. Importantly, we saw growth in all of our main offerings across the JTP portfolio, which is an exceptional result, just considering how challenging this period has been for aviation. We have also been able to leverage JetBlue's core DNA of creating better customer experiences backed by our exceptional service. A few accomplishments to highlight include: enhanced flight and hotel vacation packages with accelerated take rates to key Caribbean destination; the launch of Paisly as our post travel \u2013 as our post-purchase platform to add more ancillary components, such as car rentals; and additional updates to our travel insurance offering. I'm extremely proud of the ongoing work from the JTP team, and I'm optimistic as to how this business will scale up as demand stabilizes, and we build customer awareness, putting us firmly on a path to reaching $100 million EBIT run rate this year. Turning to Slide 7. Mitigating risks to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business is so imperative for JetBlue. And this is why we're at the forefront of ESG, posting our efforts where we can have the most positive measurable impact. Late last year, JetBlue, along with our venture capital subsidiary, JetBlue Technology Ventures from the aviation climate task force with nine other airlines and the Boston Consulting Group. Together, we plan to invest in and facilitate the development of emerging technologies to decarbonize aviation. And earlier this month, we launched our sustainable travel partners program, enabling our corporate customers to play a direct role in the sustainability of their business travel by purchasing SaaS credits. We're also delivering on our commitment to our crewmembers, our greatest asset by creating new development opportunities. Growing our talent pipeline is critical to the sustainability of our long-term success. In our Gateway Direct program, which provides a path to pilot and technical operations careers for current crewmembers, women represent roughly 40% of our first group of selected candidates, far exceeding the industry average. And in our Gateway Select program open to all aspiring to become pilots, people of color represent more than 44% of our classes compared to roughly 10% of the industry pilots in the U.S. And now we are expanding these programs to the families of all of our crewmembers. Thanks again to our crewmembers. We have so much to look forward to and so much to do in 2022 and beyond as we work to make JetBlue an even better travel company for our customers, crewmembers and owners. And with that, over to you, Joanna.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. I'd also like to thank our crewmembers for living our values and their commitment to our customers and each other. Despite all of the challenges of the past year, including the most recent COVID wave across the country, disrupting operations during the holidays, you've continued to step up, and I cannot be more excited for the future that's being shaped by the best people in the industry. Turning to Slide 9. During the fourth quarter, our revenue declined 9.7% year over two. Driven by strong holiday peaks, this was within range of our initial assumptions despite a late quarter impact from the Omicron wave. The surgeon case counts disproportionately impacted the Northeast, hitting New York particularly hard, driving increased customer cancellations and bookings softness during the most significant revenue weeks of the quarter and also led to some crew-related cancellations. The abrupt tightening of international travel restrictions starting in early December also temporarily dampened the momentum in leisure bookings. Despite all these challenges, our underlying revenue performance was very strong. And this keeps us optimistic about the future as we continue to ramp up hiring efforts towards a fully staffed operation. This is an essential prerequisite to our long-term performance. And despite the Omicron surge, we were extremely pleased with the strength of our Mint cabin, which outperformed during the holidays even when compared to pre-pandemic levels. We expect premium leisure to continue to be a source of strength going forward and one that our business model is ideally positioned for. For the first quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to decrease between 11% and 16% year over three. This sequential slowdown reflects the large negative impact from Omicron on Q1 demand. However, trends have largely stabilized and are improving across all geographies. As quickly as the Omicron wave swept through the Northeast, we are seeing cases rapidly decline, and we expect sequential month-on-month improvement leading to a profitable Q2 and a very strong summer peak. Even with the Delta and Omicron variants, our underlying performance during the holiday and peak travel periods demonstrates our ability to generate revenue. We are also very encouraged by our JTP vacations bookings, having rebounded last week to over 3x the revenue we saw four weeks ago, which we view as a leading indicator as we look ahead. Our revenue performance continues to be underpinned by our various unique commercial initiatives. We have hit an outstanding milestone with our Northeast Alliance with American Airlines. With a greatly enhanced network, reciprocal elite loyalty benefits and accelerated growth that have all yet to be fully rolled out, we reached $100 million in code share revenue generated by the alliance in its early stages. We are bringing sorely needed competition and growth with low fares in the region and creating economic benefits with thousands of new jobs. As a proof point, since the launch of the NEA, we announced the largest expansion of our network in the past 15 years with nine new JetBlue cities and 32 new routes. This would not be possible without this alliance. Together, we\u2019ve added over 50 new routes, including 19 international flights. While business travel may have been pushed out further with this latest wave, we see a strong business travel recovery on the horizon for this region, and we expect to capture an increasing share of this tremendously valuable market as we stand up a true third competitor in the region and offer business travelers additional choice with a fabulous travel experience and low fares on JetBlue. Our team has also expanded our portfolio of partners, allowing JetBlue to broaden its reach and serve more customers with more options. In addition, we bolstered our code share with Icelandair to Keflav\u00edk in Europe. We also grew our code share with Aer Lingus, giving customers the ability to book flights to Dublin and Shannon from JFK and Boston through JetBlue. Our Evolved Fare Options offering has driven a step function improvement in our revenue base in excess of 2 points. In the fourth quarter, the buy-up rate to the Blue Fare was roughly 10 points higher than in the third quarter. Our customers continue to find value in our product across all categories as we continue to offer competitive fares. And on the loyalty front, we took steps to further evolve our program, building on a busy year for our team. In addition to introducing reciprocal elite benefits for JetBlue and American customers, we recently announced new Mosaic benefits for 2022. To reward our most loyal customers, we introduced a new tier with an all-new Mosaic Plus program that includes Mint upgrades, the most widely requested perk from our loyal Mosaic customers. And our Mosaic customers will now enjoy even more space seat perks, Heathrow Express upgrades and more. As I\u2019ve said on prior calls, we are still in the early innings of our loyalty evolution and look forward to continuing to grow this meaningful contributor to our business. Turning to capacity on Slide 10. During the fourth quarter, our capacity declined 5% year over two. For the first quarter of 2022, we expect capacity to range between a decrease of 1% to an increase of 2% year over three as the demand recovery regains steam following the temporary setback tied to the Omicron variant. We will continue to be nimble and react to the environment and this capacity guide is 5 points lower than our plan before Omicron. That being said, we expect demand to accelerate throughout the year and we are positioning JetBlue to serve more customers than ever this year. For the full year 2022, we are planning to grow capacity between 11% and 15% versus 2019 as we bring aircraft utilization back towards pre-pandemic levels and take delivery of new aircraft, while retaining flexibility. Over 3/4 of our 2022 growth is planned to be deployed in the Northeast as we ramp up the NEA and deliver better service to a wider range of destinations. We believe corporate travel will recover in a nonlinear path, similar to the shape of leisure demand. This past quarter, we were encouraged to see corporate bookings recover to roughly half of 2019 levels prior to the onset of the latest wave compared to approximately one-third at the start of the quarter. And through the NEA, we intend to gain a larger share of business travel as we are able to offer an expansive network, robust schedule as well as a superior product and service. Based on surveys and conversations with our corporate customers, we expect business travel to accelerate in Q2 and beyond. Throughout the year, we\u2019ll remain nimble and tactical with capacity as we serve the growing travel needs of our customers and deliver the JetBlue experience. Again, a huge thank you to our crewmembers. I know it\u2019s not been easy, but we are positioned for a strong year as we restore earnings in 2022 and beyond. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to you, Ursula.\nUrsula Hurley: Thanks, Joanna. I\u2019d also like to thank our amazing crewmembers for continuing to deliver the experience that gets our customers coming back and keeps our brands strong. We have an incredibly passionate team who are out there delivering every day despite the many challenges we face in this industry. The dedication to our company and our customers is a key reason why we\u2019re so confident in our long-term future. I\u2019ll start on Slide 12 with a brief overview of our financial results for the quarter. Revenue was $1.8 billion, down 9.7% year over two. Cost per available seat mile was up 14.4% year over two. CASM ex-fuel was up 16.3% year over two. Adjusted EBITDA was $31 million. GAAP loss per share was $0.40, and adjusted loss per share was $0.36. It is important to note that if not for Omicron, we would have hit the better end or exceeded our original revenue, unit costs and EBITDA assumptions for the quarter. For the first quarter of 2022, we are forecasting a pretax loss. However, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re on a path to sequential pretax margin improvement with sustained profitability in the second quarter and beyond. We\u2019re encouraged by economic forecast that point to a strong macro backdrop for 2022, and we expect to achieve greater operating leverage as we grow revenue while continuing to improve our unit cost performance. Turning to Slide 13. We believe we are well on track to building back our margins through a solid plan to produce strong revenue growth and maintain a competitive cost structure, ultimately creating value for our owners. Given the nonlinear recovery, we\u2019ll continue to be nimble in managing the business through the lens of margin. During the fourth quarter, CASM ex-fuel increased 16.3% versus 2019. Consistent with the industry, our cost performance was impacted by incremental incentives and premium pay tied to the surge in case counts and the resulting operational impact worth approximately 2 points of CASM ex-fuel in the quarter. Our fourth quarter costs also exclude a bonus related to the ratification of our first 5-year contract for our in-flight crewmembers with TWU. We are pleased that we have finally reached an agreement. For the first quarter of 2022, we expect CASM ex-fuel to increase between 13% to 15% year over three. Excluding the impact of short-term headwinds, such as incentive and premium pay, worth roughly 3 points as well as rents and landing fees that we covered on prior calls, we estimate our first quarter CASM ex-fuel would be up 8% to 10% year over three. Moving to Slide 14. For the full year 2022, we expect CASM ex-fuel to increase in the range of 1% to 5% versus 2019. We expect elevated unit costs in the first half followed by a meaningful improvement in the second half of the year as we plan for our network, operation and aircraft utilization to settle into a new normal with optimal staffing levels along with the ramp of our planned cost initiatives. As a reminder, our full year CASM ex-fuel outlook includes a maintenance headwind of roughly 2 points and Northeast Alliance investments worth 2 to 4 points. We have established a comprehensive plan to help us achieve our cost goals. This includes productivity initiatives for both our frontline and support center crewmembers, collectively worth $60 million in annualized savings in 2022 to help offset wage increases. In addition, we now expect to benefit from technology investments, which we made throughout the pandemic by improving efficiencies and streamlining processes through better data leverage. We continue to maintain our discipline in managing business partner needs through sourcing initiatives and tight controls on discretionary spending. Our teams have also identified solutions to cost effectively maintain our aging fleet. And as we continue to onboard new crewmembers to support future growth, we expect to gain meaningful efficiencies as we optimize staffing in our operation in addition to benefiting from juniority. Nearly 20% of our crewmembers have been with us for less than two years. Our teams continue to work tirelessly in executing our plan to make our cost structure more competitive and positioning JetBlue for long-term value creation. Keeping our costs low is foundational to our success, and we are confident about our plan that will drive unit costs. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 15. We closed 2021 with a healthy liquidity balance with unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $2.8 billion or 35% of 2019 revenue. During the fourth quarter, we paid down approximately $120 million of debt, which included approximately $20 million in prepayments. For the full year, we have paid a total of approximately $1.9 billion of debt. I\u2019m proud of the team for this tremendous achievement. Our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio ended the year at 53%, and our balance sheet continues to be among the strongest in the industry. For the full year 2022, our CapEx forecast remains at approximately $1 billion, consisting mostly of aircraft spend, which we intend to fund with cash. We\u2019re thrilled to be adding next-generation fuel-efficient aircraft into our fleet, which is fundamental to our path to generating long-term earnings growth. We\u2019ll continue our balanced approach to capital allocation to drive shareholder value, and we remain absolutely committed to returning our balance sheet to investment-grade credit metrics. I\u2019ll close with another thank you to all of our crewmembers. While we are approaching the third year of the pandemic, we are firmly on track to execute our cost plan, grow our earnings power and create value for all of our stakeholders. With that, we will now take your questions.\nJose Caiado: Thanks, everyone. Sarah, we\u2019re now ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Good morning, everyone. I guess, Joanna, the $100 million of code share revenue that you identified from the NEA, is that cumulative? Or was that for the quarter? And how should we think about the run rate of that? Like annually, what\u2019s the magnitude? Where does that go? Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. Thanks, Mike. So you should think of that as cumulative. And I could say that we haven\u2019t gone into a great detail in terms of what we think the future path is here. We\u2019ll give you, I think, some more insight as we move through COVID, but it will ramp up significantly in the coming years. We are in the very early stages of the NEA.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just, Robin, on just kind of the ESG initiatives. I think what was it in 2020, what you were the first major carrier to become carbon-neutral domestically. And then I think in 2021, you added the London flights. For 2022, are you planning carbon neutrality 100% of your system? Have you come out with sort of what your goal is for this year? Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Good morning. Yes. Right now, our position is net carbon zero by 2040, which is about \u2013 well, not about, is 10 years ahead of the industry commitment. And right now, when we think about the challenges around climate, which are very real and airlines really need to lead in this area for both the short and the long-term. So right now, in terms of some of the shorter-term initiatives that we\u2019re focused on, we\u2019re very focused on continuing to build the book of our sustainable aviation fuel deals. That\u2019s very important. We\u2019ve talked about before about the electrification of some of our ground equipment. We\u2019re going through a big fleet replacement, as you know, in terms of new airplanes coming in that are a lot more fuel efficient. And whilst we\u2019ve delayed the retirement of our 190 airplanes, that\u2019s something, obviously, we still have pending in the future. And then, finally, as we come out of COVID and traffic ramps up, really working with the FAA ATC to use a lot of these more fuel-efficient approaches that we\u2019ve been working on because there will be significant savings there. We estimate in the U.S. potentially up to 6% to 8% fuel \u2013 carbon emission reductions with a more efficient air traffic control system. And as traffic comes back, that\u2019s going to get more important.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Your line is open.\nDan McKenzie: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. You guys alluded to strong demand trends in the script here. And Dave, I\u2019m just wondering if you can comment a little bit \u2013 if you can elaborate a little bit further on what the dashboard is saying about pent-up demand from here. And I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us understand how does it compare to what you\u2019ve seen historically? Are there any demographic or wealth factors that might cause it to be different this time? And just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more.\nDave Clark: Good morning, Dan. Thanks for the question. And as noted, we were seeing very positive revenue momentum throughout Q4, seeing that both in the peaks with the holiday travel as well as with our business customers, which were recovering pretty steadily throughout the quarter. And we\u2019re absolutely seeing signs of pent-up demand as we recover from the pandemic. Probably the biggest example is the New York City to the London route, where we saw our revenue and demand jumped 5x in the quarter opened last fall. It went from a market that was sort of behind initial forecast because of travel restrictions to right back on track. We\u2019ve also seen, as mentioned earlier, about a 30 point improvement just in the last three weeks here for revenue. So a very quick snapback after Omicron, well faster than what we saw last year with previous waves where it took maybe six months or so to improve 50 points. So we\u2019re seeing the cycle accelerate more quickly. And then there\u2019s just other indicators that consumer spending is healthier sort of on a historical basis, if you go out after the last couple of big crisises. The GDP growth we\u2019re seeing now, the excess customer savings, customer spend in other categories and even things like New York City rents snapping back pretty quickly, all seem to indicate real strength for the customer and pent-up demand that wasn\u2019t there in the past. So we\u2019ve seen good revenue momentum, and we expect to continue to see that throughout 2022.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Very good. And then a second question here, going back to the PowerPoint presentation, restoring earnings and margins beyond 2019 levels. Should that be interpreted as a restoration of the $2.50 to $3 EPS target that JetBlue previously had for 2020? And as we kind of think about that \u2013 the restoration of earnings, should we be thinking about 2023 as a transition year as well? Or is this \u2013 or is the glide path more smooth as you kind of think about restoring the company?\nRobin Hayes: Hi, Dan, I\u2019ll take that, and good morning. Hope you\u2019re doing well. No. I mean, I think that\u2019s very important. I mean we \u2013 I think one of the challenges that this industry has continued to face as witnessed by what we just went through with the latest wave is, there are so much about this we have not been able to control. What we do know, and Dave, I think, gave some very good data points is that every time we go through this, the recovery snaps back quicker. So on the basis that as we look ahead for the rest of the year into next year, that is not something that is going to get troubled by future waves. We have incredible revenue momentum. I mean we\u2019ve got the proof points of what we were able to deliver last year in the peak. We\u2019ve got the really good momentum that we saw before the latest wave at the end of the year. We\u2019ve got the fact that revenue in the first quarter this year would have been greater than 2019 if it wasn\u2019t the wave. So tremendous flowing revenue momentum. I then overlay all the revenue initiatives, which continue to perform extremely well, whether that\u2019s TrueBlue, Fare Options, JetBlue Travel Products, some of the code share revenue around the NEA. And then with our laser like focused on cost, and we were making great progress as we came into 2020. A lot of the \u2013 what a lot we\u2019ve all seen in the last two years really relate to the fact that our business was fundamentally disrupted. A lot of the flying was stopped and it really sort of \u2013 we\u2019ve been in recovery mode. But as we look ahead, we are laser-focused on that cost control. We know that\u2019s extremely important for our sort of ability to drive superior margins. And so yes, with the revenue momentum and our focus on costs, we should absolutely and we will be in a position not to just restore those earnings to $2.50 to $3, but to grow beyond that.\nDan McKenzie: That\u2019s terrific. Thanks for the timing guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you. On the full year capacity of 11% to 15% starting from flat in 1Q, can you talk about the components of that growth? How much is Europe? How much is stage and gauge? And any help you can give us with the cadence. So for example, as we think about 2Q, which is in your planning cycle, how big of a step up is it into 2Q?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. Thanks, Duane, I\u2019ll take that, and then I\u2019ll flip it to Dave for any additional color. So I think you should think of it as sort of a slow and steady ramp-up through the year with summer obviously being what we\u2019re focused on given our performance from last summer specifically. We need to be in a position to take advantage of what we see will be a tremendous pent-up demand through that peak period. Just \u2013 if you recall, we actually had the strongest revenue performance last summer of any U.S. carrier. And so we feel that we can absolutely duplicate that performance this summer, particularly given leisure and leisure has led the way. As you know, we performed extremely strong in that area. We\u2019ve also got the NEA ramping up, contributing to about 3/4 of the capacity growth that you are seeing. We were \u2013 we\u2019ll be on track for a record spending year in New York with 300 departures out of JFK and LaGuardia combined. So very excited about what we\u2019re seeing. Maybe just quickly on the utilization front as well. The capacity ramp-up, we think will be quite efficient in that. Our utilization is still down 10%, and we will get much closer to 2019 levels as we step into the rest of the year. And Dave, maybe a bit on stage and gauge?\nDave Clark: Sure. Thanks. And the only color I\u2019d provide is, as mentioned, our gauge is out for seats for departure is up versus two years ago as we brought in 321 new deliveries and as we have restyled our 8020 fleet and added 12 more seats. So feeling good about that efficient flying. Last piece, too, just on the ramp-up of the capacity through the year, Joanna noted it\u2019s fairly smooth. It is, but keep in mind that with the 5-point capacity pull out of Q1, we did not pull 5 points out of Q2 also. So there will be a bit faster acceleration as we go to Q2 just due to that adjustment we made in Q1.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. And I\u2019ll just add, the 300 in New York includes Newark as well.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And sorry, Europe in that?\nJoanna Geraghty: Europe is de minimis if you think about the contributor to that. I wouldn\u2019t view Europe as a meaningful contributor to capacity growth.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then just for my follow-up on staffing. With the staff you have in place now, and maybe you alluded to it with that utilization comment, how much larger of an airline could you be today? And given this fairly ambitious ramp into the second half, how would you compare your hiring needs this year versus last year or an average year pre-pandemic? Thanks for taking the questions.\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re hiring more this year than pre-pandemic, but it\u2019s important to note that we had a large number of crewmembers actually lead the organization over the last two years. So a lot of the hiring is actually to replace crewmembers to fly the capacity that we would have otherwise flown. I think in terms of hiring, we\u2019re hiring well over 5,000, and we\u2019re very much on track for doing that in the first half of the year, specifically for the summer ramp up. And so we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. We still have \u2013 we still have a little ways to go. But everybody is laser-focused on making sure that we\u2019re prepared to fly the capacity we have in place for this summer.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Good morning, everyone. First off, just to follow up on Duane\u2019s question there. Could you quantify just how much of the 11% to 15% growth in 2022? Like how much of that is stage, how much of that is gauge and then just kind of the rest of it being growth?\nDave Clark: Sure, Savi. This is Dave. I\u2019ll take that. The stage for the year is up about sort of 6% to 7% or so, and gauge is roughly in the same ballpark. So that\u2019s giving two of those contributors to growth.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you. And also just on the staffing question. I was kind of curious if you have any confidence that as we get into the next peak, so it\u2019d be like spring break or kind of Easter time period or even in the summer, is there kind of confidence that we won\u2019t have to rely on kind of the elevated incentive pace that we saw last summer over the holidays here. Is there something about kind of the level of hiring that\u2019s happening versus kind of the level of capacity that you\u2019re planning that gives you that confidence?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. Let me \u2013 kind of I\u2019ll give a sort of broad view on incentive pace. If you look at the incentive pay, we had to pay over the holidays. That was largely associated with a massive number of sick calls tied to the Omicron variant. And so I view that as a very unique circumstance. The incentive pay we paid last summer, which actually wasn\u2019t as meaningful as what we paid over the holidays, that was tied to a very fast ramp-up. JetBlue ramped up faster than any other airline from the March into summer time frame. In the U.S., if you recall, the Northeast, obviously disproportionately impacted. We saw an opportunity in March to really ramp up for the summer. So we ramped up very quickly. So staffing and other areas were pressured last summer. So to the extent we paid any level of premium, it was to help with that faster-than-expected ramp up. Our goal is to not pay incentive pay outside of very unique circumstances such as massive sick calls tied to a new variant or weather, where you\u2019ve got a unique sort of a regular operation. So we do think it\u2019s very important to get back to a more stable environment where carriers are not paying meaningful amounts of incentive pay. And the way you do that is by being properly staffed so that you can support the level that you\u2019re flying, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now. As I mentioned, we\u2019re hiring well over 5,000 people. Our training center is at MAX throughput and it\u2019s all about trying to get in position for the summer time frame. We should be relatively well situated as well for the spring break.\nSavi Syth: Just a quick question. Does the new CDC rules, would that have helped with the kind of the sick calls that you saw back in kind of the December holiday?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. So the CDC rules actually came out in the middle of the December peak, and it absolutely helped a bit. There needs to be a reconciliation, however, with the New York State and State Sick Pay laws and that five-day CDC rule. There\u2019s still incongruent in that you get paid, for example, in New York, 14 days COVID sick pay, notwithstanding the fact that the CDC says that you \u2013 if you\u2019re asymptomatic, you can come back up for five days. So it\u2019s a little bit of a conflict that I think we are hopeful that the various states will remedy and kind of close that gap as we learn more about these various variants.\nSavi Syth: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Maybe just a quick one on forward bookings. You called out that pretty material improvement over the last couple of weeks as we start to recover from the Omicron impact, very impressive. Can you speak to how spring break and summer 2022 bookings are running on a versus 2019 basis at this point?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll take and then have Dave add any color. So I think you should still think about in terms of peaks and troughs. The peaks are performing very well, particularly as you look at the February President\u2019s Day and into March, ramping up as the quarter moves on. It\u2019s a bit far out for the summer at this point. But Dave, I don\u2019t know if you want to add any color?\nDave Clark: Sure. Just in terms of color, the selling fares for sort of the summer and even April and beyond are up versus 2019. So we feel the demand will be there and are sort of planning likewise, as demand improves throughout the first half of the year, and we see strength in those peaks.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Got it. And then maybe just coming back to cost. Like, I know a large percentage of the growth this year is driven by NEA, and then you\u2019ve got more structural changes to your cost structure of 2 to 4 points, also driven by the NEA. And I\u2019m not sure if the E190\u2019s are in that bucket or the 2 points maintenance in that bucket. But either way, I think some of the NEA costs should be transitory like the IT investment and then whichever bucket it\u2019s in the E190 having maintenance will be lumpy, but then we\u2019ll move past it. So as we think about 2023, I know it\u2019s far way off, but should rolling past these transitory pieces of the NEA and E190s drive a cost tailing next year? Or maybe we could see better than flat CASM ex-fuel year-over-year on your standard kind of mid- to high digit growth profile. Just trying to understand like what is \u2013 what hits this year that should, in theory, drive some tailwinds into next year? Thanks so much.\nUrsula Hurley: Good morning, Cathy. Thank you for the question. So as a reminder, we have 2 to 4 points, as you noted, in NEA investments. And what falls into those 2 to 4 points is, number one, just \u2013 the cost of operating at higher cost airports, so think rents and landing fees here in the Northeast. The second category is, to your point, the investment in the E190s, the 30 owned that we have decided to hold into the fleet longer to provide support for the ramp-up of the NEA. And then the third component of the 2 to 4 points is investments in the seamless customer experience. So as we think about 2022, excluding the NEA, we would have had flat CASM ex-fuel. As I think beyond 2022, our sweet spot pre-COVID was growing high single digits while maintaining a flattish CASM ex-fuel. And so I would expect, as we navigate into 2023 that would become the objective. That\u2019s where we believe we can grow margins over an extended period of time.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Understood. I guess maybe a quick follow-up, if I may. But if some of these costs from the NEA are onetime-ish in nature, is there a reason we shouldn\u2019t expect those headwinds to turn to tailwinds kind of versus your normal operating procedure of flat CASM on growth?\nUrsula Hurley: I think how you should think about it is it\u2019s margin accretive growth. So as you look forward to 2023, the top line should be able to more than overcome the level of investment. In regards specific to the E190, eventually, we do intend to retire those E190s and replace them with A220s, which will provide a tailwind from a CASM ex-fuel perspective.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners. Your line is open.\nConor Cunningham: Everyone, thank you. Of the 4 points you cite as tailwinds in 2022, how much is that already captured in your cost structure right now and it\u2019s just not visible given a lot of the near-term noise that you\u2019re seeing?\nUrsula Hurley: Conor, just to clarify specific to the NEA?\nConor Cunningham: No. Like in the bridge that you have on the cost, you have 2 points from productivity and business partner initiatives and \u2013 yes.\nUrsula Hurley: Got it. So as we progress through the year, we expect a robust demand environment where we\u2019re normalizing aircraft utilization. So capacity is going to continue to ramp. We need greater stability in our schedules, which is going to allow us to deliver on the 2 points of productivity initiatives. And that\u2019s really driven by our frontline crewmembers scaling and gaining efficiencies as capacity ramps back up. The other cost initiatives are really ensuring that we continue our fixed cost reductions and hold those through as capacity ramps up through the remainder of this year.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then as my follow-up, just on the second half, historically, you guys are going to be 25% larger or so versus 2019. Do you still expect CASM ex to be flat or below 2019 levels during that growth rates? It just seems like the capacity plans really haven\u2019t changed all that much, but obviously, the environment is a little bit different so on and so forth.\nUrsula Hurley: Yes. We\u2019ve always said that this is definitely a year of two halves. So as capacity ramps, the expectation is that we will have negative CASM ex-fuel in the second half of this year.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a clarification on kind of what your transatlantic strategy is going to be for this year? Is it a wait and watching and see as it comes? Or are you guys going to go kind of all in trying to fill those planes and kind of boost the capacity there? And also just on that note, kind of are you happy with your current corporate exposure, distribution plans, your visibility in terms of being able to really capitalize on that corporate customer flying London?\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Ravi. I\u2019ll take that. And my colleagues will tell you I\u2019m never happy. Now look, I think, certainly, as I think Dave alluded to, London, we kind of started it at a good time because it did coincide when some of the travel restrictions were eased. And as Dave said, once that happened, we started seeing London ramp-up to sort of our system average. It then did take a step back with some of the measures were put in again before the holidays, but we\u2019re encouraged by some of the recent announcements out of the UK, and we\u2019re already starting to see that in terms of additional interest and bookings in traveling. In terms of your question about size, then we have three long-range airplanes coming this year. So it\u2019s going to be another fairly modest step up. So we expect to see \u2013 we\u2019re going to add Boston, London, which we\u2019ve already talked about. And certainly, for this year, I don\u2019t see us moving beyond London. We do have 26 LR and XLR airplanes coming over the next several years. And so obviously, at some point, we will look at other markets to Europe that we believe we could succeed in. But the focus on this year will be, again, more incremental growth in London.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. Thanks for the color. And just a follow-up, the strength in the premium leisure part of the cabin; a, do you think that\u2019s sustainable? And, b, where is the opportunity there in the medium to long term? Is it more of a pricing opportunity as people want those seats? Or is there room to actually boost the number of seats in the plane and so it\u2019s more of a mix opportunity?\nRobin Hayes: Yes. Actually, I\u2019m going to hand that to Dave, Ravi. But I just remember I didn\u2019t answer part of your question on London, and I want to make sure I don\u2019t lost. So in terms of distribution, again, a very strong leisure offering. And I think a segment in business travel, we do very well in the small, medium-sized corporate. And I think the \u2013 just the sheer size of fare reductions that they\u2019re able to enjoy when they fly JetBlue to London versus some of our competitors meant that we don\u2019t have any concerns about the ability to attract both a good mix of business and leisure travelers. So Dave and Joanna then take the question more broadly.\nDave Clark: Sure. And thanks for the question on premium leisure. As noted, throughout 2021, we\u2019ve been seeing strong relative performance in our premium leisure, especially our transcon Mint flights. And that actually sort of peaked at a great sort of illustrative point over the holidays here over the December holidays. We had stronger RASM in revenue on our transcon Mint than we had in 2019 compared to a sort of system revenue that was about 10 points below. So certainly, our performance there, on a more leisure-focused space. Obviously, a period like this where we normally have more business customers and Mint is still trailing a bit versus 2019. But as we recover this year and have the ramp-up in business, we see a great opportunity where we should have combined business plus leisure demand exceeding what it was in 2021. And that creates a bunch of opportunities, both sort of in terms of load factor and in terms of pricing in \u2013 obviously, in terms of capacity to where we see a lot of areas to grow and add new seats into these markets.\nRavi Shanker: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody and thank you for the time. Just as we think about \u2013 so two questions. The first is, as we think about your network, how significantly different is it in 2022, let's say, second half versus 2019 where you were flying a significant amount of capacity to places like Puerto Rico and the Caribbean? And then my second \u2013 it's probably for Dave. And my second question is for probably Robin.\nJoanna Geraghty: Helane, thanks for the question. I think the most important thing I would highlight is the continued growth in the Northeast. At the end of the day, the NEA is driving meaningful \u2013 a meaningful focus there and also growth in our focus cities overall. So I think that's probably the biggest difference, as I mentioned. We'll be over 300 departures this summer across Newark, LaGuardia and JFK. Boston will get back to pre-pandemic levels as well this summer. So I think that's probably the biggest difference. I don't know, Dave, if there's anything you want to add beyond that?\nDave Clark: No. Beyond that, it's pretty consistent. We're still very focused and our focus cities with 97%, 98% of our flying touching focus cities is just more growth in New York and Boston than the rest of the network overall.\nHelane Becker: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just for my follow-up question, last week, 5G was a big thing. And Robin and you were very visible talking about it. And I just have a question about the E190s because, as I understand it, about 90% of aircraft have been clear to fly into the biggest airports, but the regional airlines and the RAA are concerned about smaller airports. And I'm just wondering if that informs where your E190s can fly, or if there's some thought of accelerating retirement of those because of limitations or maybe I have that all wrong?\nRobin Hayes: So you see, Helane, my team were very wide that I was going to get this question because it brings all of my avionic engineering background out. And so I'm going to try and keep this very tight and not burn the rest of the time. But look, this is going to be a dynamic process. I mean, the way it work is the FAA issued NOTAMs and then what was called AMOCs alternative means of compliance were issued that then gave effectively exemptions to those NOTAMs. Those AMOCs were really issued on a fleet type and altimeter combination. And so it kind of looks different depending on what airplanes you have and what altimeters you have. We certainly do on our E190s, have a \u2013 let me say, a less forgiving footprint. And so we would have issues operating our 190 equipment right now in certain airports, including some of our larger airports, in conditions where we could not fly CAT1. Fortunately, that's a very low percentage of flights, but it's out there. Now the point I want to make, this is a dynamic process. So right now, the FAA is telling us that these AMOCs will be updated every month based on more data, as more 5G cell towers get lit up. And so it's going to be an ongoing iterative process. So whilst I'm pleased. The big crisis was averted. Whilst I'm pleased that the industry and the government is now collaborating effectively to work through this problem together, we can't assume that we are completely out of the 5G woods yet.\nHelane Becker: Okay, thank you very much for that. That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe just one follow-up here on the growth plan. So Joanna, when I look at kind of what your back half of 2022 capacity implies, I'm getting kind of high teens, pushing 20%. And then when I look at the fleet plan and the presentation from this morning, I know you're taking 29 more aircraft in 2023. So kind of what \u2013 with this exit trajectory in 2022 plus your fleet plan, what could 2023 capacity look like at this point?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. I think we're probably a little bit of aways from guiding that given how the environment remains still quite volatile. I think the message that we're very confident about is we have extremely strong revenue performance. Our business model is well positioned to take advantage of the recovery. The NEA is extremely well positioned to enabled JetBlue to grow in an otherwise constrained market. And so as we think about kind of 2022 and beyond, that Northeast footprint, as Dave talked about, demand recovery in the Northeast, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing. And so we're confident that we have the right fleet plan for the next years. Although my network team obviously always wants more airplanes, but we're very confident with the fleet plan that we have, and we'll continue to focus on margin. And if we can drive superior margins as we move through the next few years, then we'll take that into consideration as we plan our capacity out.\nUrsula Hurley: Andrew, one thing that I would add \u2013 this is Ursula, is that even though we have 29 deliveries next year, we're actually moving into a phase where we're starting to retire airplanes. So we're actually planned to retire at least 10 shells in 2023. So as a reminder, 30 of our E190s are leased, and so they start to return next year as well as our A320 fleet is aging, and so we're retiring a few of those next year as well. So this is going to be a common theme as we navigate 2023 and beyond.\nAndrew Didora: Understood. And then, Ursula, I wanted to ask you, when you built out your 2022 cost plan, just curious what type of labor inflation are you baking into sort of each of your big labor groups for this year? Thanks.\nUrsula Hurley: Yes, good question. So obviously, we're seeing the pressures that everyone else is seeing. We're ensuring that our front-line crewmembers are paid appropriately in order to attract relevant talent. So the objective is that once we get to a normalized schedule and the capacity starts to uptick through the latter part of this year, we really got to drive these productivity initiatives to offset that level of inflation that we're all seeing. So that's the objective is to drive efficiencies and productivity to offset that inflationary pressure.\nAndrew Didora: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. Back to some of the topics from Ravi's question and a bit of a rehash of what I've asked before. But can you give some color on how the transatlantic year two profit plan has evolved since you first announced the expansion? I mean that was obviously pre-COVID, it was pre-NEA. You got some Heathrow operating experience under your belt at this point. The competitive landscape has changed. I mean it feels like a mix of pros and cons. I've got to imagine your margin assumptions today are different than what they initially were?\nRobin Hayes: Yes, Jamie. And obviously, I failed to answer your question well enough last time. So I'm going to let Dave have a go at doing at this time.\nDave Clark: Sure. Thanks, Jamie, for the question. And yes, it's been a dynamic for sort of half year in London. But in general, we're really pleased. I think we've had terrific customer response, terrific media response for building a name for ourselves in the UK point of sale, book with leisure and with the corporate side, where we have a team there working to deepen those relationships. We feel great about our first six months of operating in London have had really strong performance there. So all the foundational pieces are coming together really well. In terms of sort of revenue and demand, it's obviously been volatile with Omicron cases as well as just trial restrictions sort of coming in and out. But we remain, I think, extremely bullish on what will transpire this spring and summer and the second half of the year. We expect cases to go down. We expect travel restrictions to continue to peel away. I think the last 1 comes off February 11 for the UK market. So we feel very good that we will continue to ramp up well, not only our JFK flying into London, but our new Boston flying as well. So feeling really good despite the choppiness of the first year as we go through the second year.\nRobin Hayes: I'm going to go a bit further on that, Dave, because I kind of know what Jamie is asking from last time. So what I'd say is this, Jamie. When I look at our Mint flying, both from a TransCon point of view and now London, it ramps up quicker and it performs above system margin. And so when I look at London, I'm very confident that our unique offering of a great product at a lower fare, targeting the vast majority of customers who fly in premium that don't have access to a corporate deal or any kind of form of discounted ticket, I think we're looking forward to we're seeing that. I think Dave gave \u2013 made a very good point. Obviously, been a bit of a stop start first six months, but we truly believe London will take its place in our hall of fame together with many of our Mint markets that we see that. And I will remind you because you've been following us a long time. What a disaster JFK to L.A. Basin used to be for us and how Mint transformed our profitability and make that, at one point, the most profitable route that we flew. And so I'm looking at seeing the progress we can make in London.\nJoanna Geraghty: Just a reminder, it's 2% of our ASM.\nJamie Baker: Yes.\nRobin Hayes: But it will be more Jamie, it\u2019s very successful.\nJamie Baker: Yes. But that's actually \u2013 and thank you for everybody's comments there. It's a good segue into my follow-up. On premium leisure, you've cited Mint outperforming several times, you just opined in the transcon. But other than Mint, where are you really capturing premium leisure demand? Again, aside from Mint, I mean, do you really have the right hard product to compete in this market in non-transcon or non-long-haul markets, let's call it?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, Jamie, maybe I'll take it and Dave, feel free to add color. So I mean at the end of the day, our product offering is far superior to what other carriers are currently out there offering with regard to sort of that premium core coach customer, even more space, the free WiFi, most legroom in coach. I mean, we like to think that our core offering really taps into sort of this leisure customer that's willing to spend a bit more for more in exchange. If you look at our performance into Florida over the holiday period and to some of the other markets, we've really done well with even more space product and really capturing our fair share of customers. So I think you hear a lot of other carriers talking about the premium segment. We are well positioned already given the product offering to tap into those leisure markets given what our business model is built around. Dave, anything beyond that?\nDave Clark: No, that\u2019s it.\nRobin Hayes: And then, Jamie, please don't forget our JetBlue travel product offering with the ability to give the customers a single booking with multiple parts of experience. And I think the insider experience they offer, the concierge service, the seamless commitment when things go wrong, I think all of that is very, very focused on our premium leisure and our leisure segment.\nJamie Baker: Excellent. I really appreciate it. I suspect our next call is from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research.\nRobin Hayes: No, you're wrong about that, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: All right.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yes. I guess, Jamie, don't try to box out Barclays so soon there. Guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess, Joanna, following that discussion on premium economy, how does that square up with the NEA where obviously, the products are not going to be necessarily fully aligned if you're booking a JetBlue code-share you expect free WiFi, most legroom in coach, you might not get that on the other partner. And I guess the second part to that question, how does the revenue sharing here help incentivize that competitive growth? Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thanks. It's a great question. At the end of the day, we're very focused on making the experience between American and JetBlue as seamless as possible. There are, as you point out, some differences in the product offerings. We have certain things that we offer. They have certain things they offer. From our perspective, it's all about ensuring adequate disclosure on the website so that customers know what they are getting. But if you think about loyalty, I think we've done some really great work there in terms of bridging those loyalty programs, reciprocal unburn. We now have Elite recognition, which is very exciting for our most loyal mosaics and American has access to that for their most loyal. So that's how we're approaching it. But at the end of the day, there are unique product differences, and we need to make sure customers know when they book that JetBlue is operating the flight or American's operating the flight as the case may be.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yes. And I guess, there's a unique aspect here with the revenue sharing between the code-share partners. Can you talk to how that helps incentivize what you guys want to accomplish?\nDave Clark: Sure, Brandon. This is Dave. I'll take that. In general, what it does is that it ensures that we're both thinking about the NEA as a whole and the partnership as a whole, and we're not worrying about is the customer choosing the JetBlue flight that day or the American fight that day. So it's a nice sort of alignment mechanism to ensure that we're aligned and focused on the NEA providing sort of the most consumer good and also driving the best sort of revenue outcome.\nBrandon Oglenski: All right, thank you all for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Hollins with BNP. Your line is open.\nJames Hollins: Thanks for taking the question. Very clich\u00e9 for it to be asking about transatlantic, even though it's 2% of your ASMs but just as I look at it, I was wondering if you could just give me a bit of feedback on your customer reaction to Heathrow, Gatwick? I mean clearly, you've got Heathrow slot I think, until October 2022. I was wondering if it was absolutely sacrosanct that in terms of making this route network really work for you or where the Gatwick is performing just as well? Thanks.\nRobin Hayes: I'll take that. No, I mean \u2013 look, I mean, I think that we've been pleased with both \u2013 if we strip out the noise that has come with some of the travel restrictions, when we were sort of in a more close-to-steady state, we were pleased with what we are seeing both at Heathrow and Gatwick. And the reality is there isn't that much option to Gatwick. And there's a big population center, both in South London, Southeast and North of Gatwick that really would prefer to fly out of Gatwick. So \u2013 but, yes, we've been very pleased. And so certainly, whilst we're likely to get into Heathrow, I think that was very important because Heathrow is the airport that has suffered a lot from very high fares to the U.S. over the years. I think our ability to fly into Heathrow has helped the whole fare structure across the market fares come down. But Gatwick, obviously offers a greater growth potential as well. And so we continue to see a path to serving more than one airport. And I think the fact we're flying it with a narrow-bodied airplane also gives us optionality that some of the wide-bodied operators don't necessarily have as they think about London Airport.\nJames Hollins: I appreciate the thoughts. And just a broader question on your ESG commitments, I was wondering if you're sort of seeing strong signs of incremental customer loyalty from your our clear leadership in that space or even price inelasticity? And regarding ESG, are you kind of sort of done with major announcements after I think ESG first and last time as you sort of fed that into the medium term? Thanks.\nRobin Hayes: No. On the customer loyalty, yes, look, there is a very small group of customers currently who, I think, put a high value on that. I think \u2013 well, I'm confident it's going to grow, and it's going to grow quickly. I think the only reason we haven't seen more of that is really linked to COVID, which has become sort of such a distraction for many people. And in terms of your second question, then, no, I mean, whilst we've been very pleased with the SaaS deals that we have in place, we want to continue to lead here. We are \u2013 we have a 2030 10% target for SaaS. It is our goal to try to exceed that. And so our team is currently continuing to work on a number of follow-up staff deals and more in due course.\nJames Hollins: Okay, many thanks for the time.\nRobin Hayes: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Hi, good morning. Sorry, that was my fault in the queue \u2013 I wasn\u2019t queued in, thank you for taking. Anyway, thank you, Jamie. So couple of questions for you. When you say you're going to take market share in New York to the NEA. Who are you taking share from? Is that American's share shifting over to you? Or is it somebody else?\nJoanna Geraghty: No. I mean I think what we're looking at is being a sort of a third viable competitor in the region compared to United and to Delta. And so given the combined network between American and JetBlue, we're confident, and we're seeing this response from the business customers and the business companies that we're meeting with that they're very encouraged by the network offering that we have and in terms of the ability to drive more competition into the region. And so that's our focus, specifically in the Northeast.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thanks Joanna. And then I think the capacity plan, just a minute on that and jet fuel. Obviously, historically, there's a relationship between a little bit of marginal supply getting dialed back when jet fuel goes up. But is that relationship sort of on hold right now where you might be a little bit more hesitant to dial back some of the marginal supply just because we're in such an anomalistic demand environment? Are you going to wait until we get into the summer before you would make a customary decision on dialing back capacity in response exclusively at the higher jet fuel?\nUrsula Hurley: Hi, Hunter, this is Ursula. Thanks for the question. Yes. Listen, we make capacity decisions through the lens of margin. Historically, we've performed very well in high fuel environment. To your point, there has been that historical dynamic where we've been able to pass on 70% of jet fuel increases with a month or two of lag in high fuel environment. Given the environment that we're in today, we'll have to see if that relationship settles back in as we continue to dial up capacity and work our way through this recovery. But just as a reminder, we'll continue to make all capacity decisions through the lens of margins as we navigate through the summer.\nRobin Hayes: And I would say \u2013 I might just add to that, Hunter. I think in terms of timing, I think one of the \u2013 and I know this isn't a fuel answer, but we've been in a situation with some of these waves of COVID, where we're making capacity changes within one to two month period. That's expensive because you really got the crews scheduled and so you have to effectively pay for the crew. And so with a fuel environment, to Ursula's point, if we start to see months out that we start to get concerned about this, then we can make adjustments. And I think we \u2013 if there's one thing we and really all airlines have learned to during the last couple of years to be extremely nimble and react quickly to changes in capacity when we need to make them. Margin will help us drive that. We just are very bullish coming into summer because of the demand that we anticipate. And then we \u2013 fall and later in the year, we have time to review that.\nHunter Keay: Okay, thanks Robin.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thanks for taking my question. So I'm guessing \u2013 you've been doing some survey work around business travel. And if so, curious if there's been any meaningful change in the appetite for corporate \u2013 large corporate or SMB travel versus where it was six or seven months ago or pre-delta? And also, are you seeing any change in user demand, meaning a shift between tech consulting finance or health care? Thanks.\nDave Clark: Thanks, Chris, for the question. This is Dave. I'll take that. No, we have not seen any fundamental shifts in the last six months. We have seen some, I'd say, choppiness based on variance coming through. But we are seeing really good recovery pace in the fourth quarter. And from about a third recovered in terms of bookings to half recovered and the pace of about one month before Thanksgiving. So things are moving really nicely. It's obviously peeled back a little bit here. What we're seeing right now is mostly sort of individual travel. It's going to see clients going to build new relationships going to close the deal the sort of large meetings, whether external or internal are a bit on hold for Q1. You guys probably saw a couple of high-profile ones go entirely virtual or largely virtual versus the original plan. So we continue to see right now those industries that have more of that client relationship probably traveling a bit more as well as other continued things we've had throughout such as media production and whatnot. But I think once we get through Omicron here and through the spring, we'll see a return to that strong recovery that we're seeing in the fall and have sort of not only all these different industries growing, but different use types, growth \u2013 growing, especially some of that are getting pretty largely pent up now in terms of gatherings, whether external or internal large gatherings, I think, are set to really grow in the warmer months this year.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And just my follow-up. So you've historically looked at margin as your North Star. And given what increasingly looks like transition to an endemic state for COVID-19 this year as well as significant pent-up demand in business and long-haul international travel. How should we think about the cadence of recovery in your pretax margins through this next stage of the recovery? And I guess, the punch line, do you still think that you can exceed 2019's 9.5% next year? Thanks.\nRobin Hayes: I'll take that, and I'll just give it a helpful in my answer. It all depends on future COVID waves because I do think we have to be realistic. And whilst we are hopefully, and we all want to enter an endemic phase, we don't know for sure if another wave isn't going to come along. I think what we're confident is as these waves come, providing people feel protected against it, the impact will be shorter. But having said that, as I look ahead of the rest of the year, with Q1 behind us, I would expect us to be profitable for the rest of the year, and based on the revenue momentum and based on the cost initiatives that we have in place, to grow back to that $2.50 to $3 as quickly as we can and then grow beyond that. And I think that when I think about the revenue momentum, when I think about the older revenue initiative and our long-term cost trajectory, we're very focused here in the short-term, I do appreciate it's fairly bumpy and hard to sort of see the wood from the trees sometimes. But when we look at the A220 fleet renewal, when we look at the 192s retiring, when we look at \u2013 as we kind of peak through some of the V2500 shop visits on the engines, which should drive a lot of maintenance cost, we have a very strong cost trajectory over multiyears. And so we should be sitting here with an expectation that we can grow this business mid to high single-digits capacity, maintain our cost flat or close to flat and drive top line revenue. And so all of that, I think, gives me a great deal of confidence that we continue to grow margins and our earnings beyond even what we had expected to earn in 2020 had COVID not come.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Great. Thank you for the time.\nJose Caiado: Thank you. And with that, we'll conclude our fourth quarter 2021 conference call. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: And again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

But now I would like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As we have done throughout the pandemic, I'd like to take a moment to remember 4 crew members We have lost to COVID-19 in recent month. Richard Oh was a beloved member of our systems engineering team here at Long Island City and has worked for us for almost 12 years. He was also a close friend to his fellow crew-members. Joseph Anderson supported training and development programs for our customers support team for the last 5 years and was known for his generosity and adventurous spirit. Manny Gomez was a cherished member of our in-flight team for almost as many years as JetBlue has been operating. And Alex [inaudible 00:02:46] joined the JetBlue family in October 2002. He was a treasured member of the ground ops team at Orlando's, where he was always known for being first to chip in and help. Our hearts go out to their family, friends, and fellow crew members, and to all of those who have been impacted by COVID-19. I'd now like to thank our truly amazing 21,000 crew members. They continued to deliver for our customers and they give me great confidence that JetBlue is well-positioned for future success. Moving to Slide 4 of our 3Q-21 earnings presentation. For the third quarter, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.12. I'm encouraged by the steady progress we are making while capitalizing on opportunities to enhance our future earning power. And while the demand environment has been affected by CapEx count, we believe that demand is once again poised to accelerate into the peak holiday periods and beyond as people adjust to a new normal. As we look ahead and plan for 2022, we retain the agility that has characterized our planning process for the last 18 months and as we prepare for continued demand recovery. We're marching towards a full recovery and the return to sustained profitability with margin truly as our moved Star. I'm a firm believer that our unique business model, low cost, low fares, and the superior product positions JetBlue to thrive in the years ahead. Now turning to slide 5 of our presentation. Throughout the pandemic, we have not lost sight of our commitment to serve our communities, add more diversity to the aviation industry's pipeline, and increase sustainability across our operation. JetBlue continues to lead the industry in ESG as the first airline -- U.S. airline to file SASB and TCFD aligned ESG report. The executive compensation to ESG met tie executive compensation ESG metrics, execute a sustainability linked loan, and operate an ESG subcommittee of our Board of Directors. We're also pleased to see our initial 2017 investment in Joby Aviation validated as they went public this past quarter. With our efforts, we are honoring our responsibility to our customers, our crew members, development and strengthening shareholders' value as we recover grow. I'm pleased to say we are now well ahead of pace to achieve our target of transitioning 10% of our fuel usage to sustainable aviation fuel by 2013, enabled by our recent deals with SG Preston, Neste, World Energy and World Fuel Services. We're taking a diversified approach on SaaS by engaging with multiple partners. Our industry has a responsibility to decarbonize how we cannot do it alone. Earlier this month, the International Air Transport Association Member Airlines, committed to achieve a net 0 carbon emissions by 2050. Following the IOTA resolution, we are pleased to see the Air Transport Action Group or ATAG adopt a net 0 carbon goal for 2050. ATAG is a global organization comprised of airlines, airports, aircraft and engine OEMS, and air traffic controllers. These commitments underscore and unparalleled and collaborative approach across our entire industry to address key challenges and advanced collectively for the net 0 targets. We are happy to play a role in continuing to lead the industry with the most holistic plan to address sustainability, and we're delighted to see some of our competitor [inaudible 00:06:43] up to this issue. We've also recently released our annual ESG and social impact reports, which includes the results of our first ever climate risk scenario analysis as well as an overview of our corporate responsibility programs focused on youth education, the environment, and increasing diversity within the stem fields that fuel our airline. Both comprehensive reports can be found on our Investor Relations webpage. Moving now to Slide 6. As we walk -- as we work through the annual planning process, our teams are setting solid goals were our network, commercial, and cost initiatives, and capital allocation priorities. I could not be more proud of our team's efforts. And I'm confident we are setting JetBlue on a trajectory to restore our earnings power to beyond 2019 levels over the coming years, generating long-term value for all of our shareholders -- stakeholders. Over the course of the pandemic, we launched game-changing network moves, and continued to pursue strategic initiatives to build a strong foundation for our long-term success. We're thrilled to have finally landed in London in the third quarter, a milestone achievement that was years in the making, and we look forward to bringing JetBlue's low fares and award-winning service to even more customers across the Atlantic, just as the U.S. prepares to ease entry requirements for U.K. travelers next month. Our team is doing a fantastic job in rolling out and expanding our commercial initiative, including the latest evolution of our fare options, which helped drive the industry's best revenue acceleration this summer. Our JetBlue Travel Products subsidiary remains a bright spot in recovery. Delivering over 40% revenue growth versus pre -pandemic levels. And our efforts in loyalty starting to materially enhance earnings performance. Our talent -- our relentless work to shape our cost structure is a key pillar of our goal of achieving superior margins. We are deep in our planning process and working diligently to mitigate the external cost pressures tied to the recovery. I'm confident that we'll maintain a competitive cost structure and return to our roots as a low-cost airline. Lastly, we made incremental progress in deleveraging our balance sheet by paying off our Cares Act loan and other bank loans. Our unwavering commitment to repair our balance sheet is part of our balanced approach to capital allocation. And moving to Slide 7. I'd like to spend a minute discussing in greater detail on Northeast Alliance with American Airlines and the many benefits this Alliance brings to all of our stakeholders. New York, a capacity constrained region, has historically been dominated by just 2 carriers. And in Boston, our lines is enabling JetBlue to expand our low fares and superior products to new markets and create a broad and virtual network. This Alliance in no uncertain terms to supercharge competition in the region. It's important to note that our commitment to competition and low fares is steadfast, as is our commitment to our home here in the Northeast at New York hometown airline. We will continue to implement this important alliance and deliver meaningful value to all of our stakeholders, including our customer's crew members, owners, and the broader economy here in the Northeast. We are fully committed to this alliance and to delivering the tremendous benefits of added competition to our customers. Together with American Airlines, we plan to operate close to 500 daily flights in November, 300 of which will be flown by JetBlue. Given the vastly expanded network and flying, the NEA is estimated to generate more than $800 million in annual consumer benefits. We're also in the process of hiring 1800 new crew members as a direct result of the growth the NEA is enabling for us, jobs that otherwise wouldn't be created without this alliance. I will close with another huge thank you to our crew members with exciting revenue initiatives, a firm grip on costs and superior margins as our guiding light. I am very confident we are charting a course to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever. Joanna, over to you.\nJoanna Geraghty : Thanks Robin. I will also start by recognizing our extraordinary crew-members who helped us achieve among the industry's quickest ramp up during the most challenging summer in our history. We were not immune to the operational challenges felt across the industry, exacerbated by weather, runway closures, and a patchwork of varying COVID travel restrictions. At the same time, you our crew members, have laid the foundation for a stronger JetBlue, and I thank you for everything that you continue to do to support our customers and one another. Turning to slide 9, I'm very pleased with our exceptionally strong revenue performance in the third quarter, which declined 5.5% year over [inaudible 00:11:37].. This result was better than our most recent revenue guidance from early September, largely stemming from our fair options initiative, which continues to out perform our expectations. We also benefited from a renewed uptick in demand beginning in mid-September. July and August performance was solid with load factors in the mid-80s and overall yield largely back to pre -pandemic level, which is simply outstanding considering the vast majority of our customers this summer where leisure and VFR. September to the brunt of the bookings softness associated with rising case counts tied to the Delta variant. And the expected post-Labor Day corporate demand recovery that was pushed out to the right. That said, trends did stabilize during the month and are improving. We expect robust revenue acceleration throughout the quarter as the holidays approach and demand continues to meaningfully improve. For the fourth quarter, we're planning for revenue to decline between 8% and 13% year over 2. We expect trough to be challenging, exacerbated by a slower business travel recovery. But the holidays are performing meaningfully better and we took tactical capacity actions to better align with the demand environment. Our strong revenue performance is driven by our continued execution on a number of unique initiatives. Our Northeast Alliance with American Airlines is unleashing tremendous benefits for our customers. This alliance above all is about growth. JetBlue's growth that would not otherwise be possible. We're bringing more low fares, a greatly enhanced network and schedule, and more seats to the Northeast. Together with American, we have already launched 58 new routes out of the Northeast and added frequencies on more than 130 routes. And we will expand through next year, including to 18 new international destinations. Starting next week, we'll begin our long awaited expansion at LaGuardia with new flights to Jacksonville, Savannah, and Sarasota with plans to serve new destinations in 2022, including Nashville, New orleans, and Portland Maine. Our growth in the Northeast has already provoked a competitive response from the entrenched legacy carriers that have long dominated in the region and who stand to benefit the most from the absence of a viable third competitor in the region. Our refreshed fare options offering continues to outperform our expectations. We're pleased to see customer behavior and buy back activity driving a revenue benefit in excess of the 2 points that we called out last quarter. Validating our view that we offer the best product in every category we serve all at low fares. Our JetBlue travel products subsidiary had its highest revenue quarter on record in Q3. And for the full year is on pace not only to deliver the highest revenue relative to overall flight revenue, but in absolute terms as well. This is being driven by very strong performance of vacation packages, travel insurance, and car rentals powered by our Paisly Platform. And the team continues to innovate and expand its offering, including the recent launch of Flights Plus Cruise Bundles for JetBlue vacations. And we're gaining additional attraction in lodging options for Paisley with the launch of vacation rentals. These recent trends and new product launches keep me confident that we are firmly on a path to achieve 100 million and run rate EBITDA next year. Lastly, our teams continue to grow and enhance our loyalty program From a revenue perspective, we are nearly fully recovered, pre -pandemic level and continue to accelerate growth rates that are having a material impact on program performance. For customers, we are on the front end of a multiyear effort to expand benefits and add value to our TrueBlue point currency. Thus far, we've introduced loyalty benefits that give both JetBlue and American customers the opportunity to earn on both airlines, as well as, our 1st phase of reciprocal elite benefits. This creates a new option for Americans, 20 million-plus Advantage members, many of which might not have otherwise considered JetBlue. Over the coming month, we plan to roll out personalized offering and experiences for TrueBlue members, as well as enhancements for our Mosaic customers. Ultimately, we are in the process of transforming our TrueBlue platform. I could not be more excited about the future in this space. Turning to capacity on Slide 10. In the third quarter, our flown capacity declined 1% year-over-two. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our planning assumption is for capacity to decline between 4% and 7% year-over-two, given the seasonal pullback in leisure demand and a corporate travel recovery that has been pushed back. Corporate travel, which historically accounted for approximately 20% of our revenue is currently trending closer to 5% to 10%. While the recovery has been delayed, it is improving significantly each week. And we remain optimistic for this segment to recover even more robustly this winter. We're hitting new highs in the corporate travel recovery, which is recovered approximately a third of 2019 levels. Over the coming years, we expect the NDA will allow us to capture a greater share of corporate travel in the Northeast. As always, we will remain nimble and adjusting to future demand volatility tied to the course of the pandemic. VFR and leisure demand continues to underpin our strong performance. Our network is designed to carry leisure customers to and from high-value geography. To that end, we are pleased that authorities have sensibly relaxed travel restrictions between the U.S. and the U.K. In the week following the administration's announcement regarding the reopening of the travel corridor, we saw a step change increase by more than five-fold for bookings from the U.K. point-of-sale for November travel and beyond. As we move through the recovery, we will continue to be nimble and deploying capacity to areas of demand strength. Our network is one of our greatest assets. And we will continue to build relevance across our focus cities to serve our customers and achieve long-term success. We are thrilled to have meaningfully upside from the NEA ahead of us. I'll close by expressing my utmost gratitude to our crew members, their professionalism and dedication enabled us to navigate all of the new challenges we have faced as a team. We are as excited as ever for our future, as we rebuild our margins and restore earnings in 2022 and beyond. With that over to you, Ursula.\nUrsula Hurley: Thank you, Joanna. I'd also like to thank our incredible crew members for their commitment and hard work in building a solid foundation to ensure JetBlue emerges from the crisis. As a stronger airline. Our teams continue to lay the groundwork through our 2022 planning process to ultimately return to long-term financial success and create value for our owners. I'll start on slide 12 with a brief overview of our financial results for the quarter. Revenue was $2 billion down 5.5 percent year over to cost per available seat mile was down 2.1 percent year over to CASM x fuel was up 12.7 percent year over to Adjusted EBITDA was $140 million, and GAAP earnings per share was $0.40, and adjusted loss per share was $0.12. We also recorded a $54 million gain from our investments through JetBlue Tech Ventures. Going forward, we expect to record mark-to-market gains and losses from our equity investments and other income, but will exclude these adjustments in our non-GAAP results. We were very pleased to achieve pre -tax profitability in both July and August as expected. And both our third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA came in above the high end of the ranges we expected in early September. This was largely driven by stronger than expected performance of fare options and a mid September pickup in bookings, which drove the best revenue results in the third quarter of those that have reported. For the fourth quarter, we estimate our EBITDA will range between negative 50 million to positive $50 million. This sequential decrease is due to the seasonal leisure demand pattern and pressure from the recent material spike in fuel prices. Turning to Slide 13, our teams worked exceptionally well to manage the complexities due to this swift operational ramp -up for the peak summer travel period. As we look ahead, we believe we are charting a course for sustained profitability and superior margins through a laser focus on cost control. We'll maintain a nimble and flexible approach in managing capacity, as we have done throughout the pandemic. During the third quarter, CASM ex-fuel increased approximately 12.7% year-over-two within the range of our prior assumptions to ensure appropriate staffing levels for our summer operation. This excludes a payroll benefit of a $186 million from PSP2 and 3, which we exhausted in August and reflects approximately 6 points of temporary headwinds we previously identified in last quarter's call that we expect to persist through year-end. For the fourth quarter, our planning assumption is for CASM ex-fuel to increase between 14% to 16% year over to which again, includes short-term pressure from temporary headwinds tied to the recovery. The sequential increase is largely a function of lower capacity for the leisure demand trough period, partially offset by underlying improvement in our unit costs trajectory. We expect to achieve meaningful productivity efficiencies in 2022 as we continue to ramp and welcome new crew members into the operation. Moving to Slide 14, our teams continue to work diligently to improve our cost -structure and mitigate the near-term pressures we are facing as we restore the business and invest in our long-term earnings power. We continue to expect CASM ex-fuel to improve from a double-digit growth rate in the second half of 2021 to low single-digit growth in 2022 versus 2019 levels. We are in the thick of our annual planning cycle and today, I'd like to share an early view of our cost trajectory next year. We expect 2022 to be a story of two halves, assuming a stronger performance in the second half as the recovery ramps. We expect CASM ex to remain elevated through the first half of next year due to lower capacity assumptions before inflecting in the latter half of the year. As the recovery accelerates, we expect elevated rents and landing fees to normalize into start seeing benefits from our enter wide prize parse for productivity to mitigate inflationary pressures. In addition, we plan to continue investing in our margin accretive NEA as business travel recovers and catching up on the significant amount of maintenance work we deferred throughout the pandemic. Following the completion of our planning process, we will share more about our initiatives that will help us achieve our cost goals.We are fully committed to keeping our cost low and generating superior margins for the long term. Moving to Slide 15. In the third quarter, we took delivery of 3 A220 and 1 A321LR. The fleet stood at 280 aircraft at the end of September. And we expect to take delivery of 2 additional aircraft's during the fourth quarter. Our full-year 2021 CapEx forecast remains unchanged at approximately $1 billion. The majority of which is aircraft CapEx, which we intend to pay for with cash. Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 16. At the end of September, we maintained a strong liquidity position with unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $3.3 billion or 41% of 2019 revenue. We expect to maintain a minimum liquidity balance of around $2.5 billion in the medium-term, inclusive of our revolver. And we believe we have the ability to raise cash at attractive rates if necessary. Our commitment to delever our balance sheet, lower our debt service obligations, and grow our unencumbered asset base remains a key pillar in our recovery. During the third quarter, we continue to take action to repair our balance sheet by paying down the $115 million CARES Act loan and an incremental a $105 million of bank debt. Year-to-date, we have repaid a total of approximately $1.5 billion of debt. And as a result, we have reduced our annual interest expense by approximately $33 million in 2021. Our net and weighted average cost of debt remain below pre -pandemic levels. While our debt-to-cap ratios stood at 53% at the end of September. A slight decrease from the prior quarter. In addition, our unencumbered asset base grew by approximately $500 million during the third quarter. We continue to make extremely good progress in returning our balance sheet to investment-grade credit metrics. Looking ahead, we plan to maintain a balanced approach to capital allocation to help achieve our financial targets, enabled by our relatively strong balance sheet which we believe ranks among the best in the industry. I'll close with another thank you to our inspiring crew-members for helping to navigate the most challenging period in our history. They are playing a critical role in positioning JetBlue to exit the crisis on a path towards creating value for all of our stakeholders. With that, we will now take your questions. Over to you Frenzy.\nOperator: Thank you. And participants as a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star 1 on your telephone [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSavi Syth : Hey, good morning everyone. If I may Ursula I think, if you look at the second half 2022 unit costs, kind of view that it should be below second half '19. I believe pre - Covid, with the structural cost program, you were looking to be about maybe 1 to 2 points lower than 2019. So on top of that, now you have several headwinds including 2 to 4 points from the NEA. You have elevated maintenance and inflation, which nets you out to a low single-digit pressure in the best-case scenario. To get to that below 2019 level in second half 2022, how much of it is coming from maybe capacity growth versus 2019, and how much of it is maybe more structural cost initiatives that you hadn't identified or perhaps hadn't executed when you came out with that 2020 guide back in January of 2020?\nUrsula Hurley: Good morning, Savi. Thank you so much for the question. I want to reiterate or laser-focused on cost. And we acknowledge that costs are the key to our success in delivering superior margins. Our singular focus on mitigating the sustained headwinds, which we highlighted, which we're cycling through the volume of maintenance events, as well as to your point, the investments in the ADA, the way in which we're going to mitigate those is through operating leverage, productivity gains, optimizing our business partners spend, ensuring that our fixed costs achieved in 2020 carry through to 2022. And as we bring capacity back, we will continue to see the structural cost benefits that we achieved prior to COVID. As I look at next year, I'm extremely confident that we have a path to achieve the low single-digit CASM ex-fuel guidance that we provided.\nSavi Syth : Got it. That's helpful. And if I might a quick follow-up to Joanna, you had mentioned buy up in excess of 2 points to the year - over -to-year revenue in 3Q. Just wondering if you could provide some color on the magnitude of -- from the contributions from the other revenue initiatives and maybe the progress you expect over the next year or 2.\nJoanna Geraghty : Yeah, sure. Thanks, Savi for the question. I'll start walk through each one of them in, Dave Clark, feel free to add additional color if I miss anything. So the way we're looking about this, these are unique JetBlue revenue initiatives. There's 4 of them that sit on top of I think what we view as 2022 being a being a pretty strong recovery year, both leisure and then taking advantage of the return of the business customer. Fare Options 2.1, recall, we launched sort of the latest iteration of this less than a year ago. Fare Options has absolutely delivered on what we expected. It's our goal is to deliver the best products at a low fare in every category, how we compete in the segment and marketplace with clearly defined products and price points. So we're just incredibly pleased with the overall performance we had originally anticipated about a 1 point RASM benefit. We adjusted that in the last earnings call to closer to 2, and now we're exceeding 2. So I think just great performance by the team. And I think the other piece was mentioned is, we have continued ability to optimize as we learn more and follow customer behavior throughout the year and how they engage with their options, both in the peaks and in the off-peak time frame. The 2 things that are driving the improved performance, greater up-sell, and frankly more customers are checking more bags. So that's what you're seeing on the fare options side of the house in terms of loyalty. The second of the four initiatives, no change from last quarter. That's a point of RASM. It is purely economics associated with the co-brand deal. So as you think about loyalty, you could think of incremental benefit on top of that coming from growth of the program. organic growth from the NEA and the partnership we have with American Airlines. And then we have, I think, a unique opportunity to really focus on serving some of these underserved segments that don't have access to credit in some of the same ways that others may now as we focus on our DE&I strategy. And then as we mentioned, evolving the overall program from 2022 into '23. JTP, the 3rd of the 4, we see that delivering about a hundred million of EBIT next year. We're making great progress, Andres Barry and his team, the crews plus flights, as we mentioned, and Paisly. We should think about Paisly as offering additional travel benefits to customers who book trips on JetBlue, whether that's cars, hotels, excursions, and we see a tremendous opportunity there. And then finally last but certainly not least is the NEA. We are very confident that this will be margin accretive as we move into 2022, particularly with the recovery of business travel. That said, there is a large leisure play here as well, which we're excited about, and we've continued to count the benefits of this, I mean, I think you see it across the industry with some of the announcements or other carriers around the competitive landscape we're going to bring a viable third competitor to this region, more seats, more routes, lower fares, better service. This unlocks tremendous growth opportunities for JetBlue in our geography that we would not have otherwise had, with that will come greater relevance. Whether it's through Codeshare, loyalty, merge-joint corporate sales. So those are the 4 initiatives. We're really excited about the momentum we have behind those. You factor that in with the improving demand environment and 2022 should shape up to be a good year on the revenue side for us.\nSavi Syth : And where is the JBT today? Sorry.\nJoanna Geraghty : We haven't indicated where it is today. It's on a journey, but we're very confident it will hit a 100 million of EBITDA. Through the end of '22.\nSavi Syth : Got it. Alright, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nCatherine O'brien : Hey, good morning, everyone. So one of the Transatlantic, I know you called out the recent strength that seems in line with that -- what your competitors have also been seeing. But we've also had one of your competitors call out that they expect the domestic network to be more challenged due to industry capacity growth in international over the next couple of years. I guess first, do you agree and if you do, would you consider speeding up your Transatlantic expansion? Are you able to with your current portfolio? Thanks.\nJoanna Geraghty : Sure. Maybe I will start with Transatlantic first and sort of what we're seeing there, give you a little bit more insight. Frankly, we timed the launch, I'd like to take credit for it, but we timed it incredibly well with the change in the 2-12 travel restriction, so that could not have happened at a better time. That's ramping up very nicely. Both factors around 60%, but that jumps after November 8th. If you've read any of the reviews and absolutely fantastic product, fantastic service, we're doing what we do best, bringing better product at a low fare in a historically overpriced market. And really excited about what we are doing there. In terms of future growth opportunities there, we're focused on London and New York and Boston next summer. And that's where our priorities are in terms of Transatlantic. As you think about the domestic landscape, we're quite bullish on the domestic landscape. We have a set of unique revenue initiatives. We are -- others are talking about pivoting the leisure, we are a leisure carrier. That is what we do. We do it well, that is what we are born to do. Leisure continues to fuel this recovery. It remains strong both on the VFR side and the strictly leisure side. That said, we're also well-positioned for business recovery as you look at -- not just what we organically do largely out of Boston, but what the NEA is going to be delivering for us as well. The peaks are strong, holidays are looking good, so we're excited about what next year brings, and we think the Transatlantic is frankly gravy on top of what we're already doing.\nCatherine O'brien : Okay. Great. And maybe just sticking with revenue. I know in the past investment or share of that corporate revenue represents about 20% to 30% of total. I guess, 2 parts. 1, any early thoughts on where that could go with the NEA as you break into some new accounts in the Northeast and then I'm guessing that varies seasonally. Any thoughts on perhaps the greater drag that might represent in 4Q and 1Q versus 2Q and 3Q, I'm guessing it's a lower percentage of total revenue. Thanks for the time.\nJoanna Geraghty : Our corporate travel typically represents over the course of the year about 20% of our overall revenue. In the fall, it moves up to 25%. If you look at other airlines and think about the NEA opportunity, they're around 30%. Anywhere between that 20% to 30% range of how we're thinking about the revenue opportunity from corporates for the NEA. We're very excited about the partnerships, not only does this give us access to Americans ' accounts, but we'll be able to do joint corporate sales. We're very pleased about the opportunity on the business travel on the corporate side. But again, I also want to emphasize there's tremendous leisure opportunity as well. We've announced a whole set of routes into the Mid Atlantic South, we got Denver so the NEA is definitely corporate piece of it, but there's also a tremendous leisure piece and it's frankly making JetBlue of 5% player a far more relevant competitor in this region with a much bigger network, much better opportunities for customers, joint loyalty, so all good things there.\nCatherine O'brien : Great, thanks so much for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Okay, thanks. Just on the E190s. Can you let us know like how restored they are now? What percent of the ultimate recovery in the E190s we're seeing maybe in the fourth quarter and first quarter? And I don't know if you have any high level thoughts on margin profile by fleet type.\nJoanna Geraghty : Scott, you want to take that?\nScott Laurence: Yes, I can take that. Thanks for the question.\nScott Laurence: is that, a couple of things, but first is the E190s are flying and we'll be flying. The fleet comes out entirely out of the -- out of storage as of November 19. In terms of the E190 and its profile versus the rest of pre -COVID. I mean, obviously we had some maintenance headwinds on that airplane, and it's -- again, I think serving a very good purpose as we focus on the shorter haul flying particularly in Boston, and as we ramp up the NEA. So again, I think while that -- we have that fleet queue a bit longer because of the NEA opportunity. Again, we -- I think we're in a position to see that airplane producing given the profile of the missions that we can flight it on.\nRobin Hayes: The only thing I build on that Duane, it's well-being. Good morning is to sculpt spot. I think we've really learned with that plan over the years the type of mission where it can perform well, I think as we pivot back to any schedule, as we pick pivot back to higher frequency, shorter stages to certainly what we've been flying it during COVID, where we were really flying it for cash generation purposes. I think we feel really good about the ability for the one mine to also drive and contribute to margin.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. And then maybe just to stay on that fleet-type. Everything you've said about the NEA and being certainly more relevant here in New York, that makes a lot of sense. If it doesn't go the way you anticipate and you've been very transparent about the cost headwinds related to this fleet-type into next year, if this does not go the way you anticipate, do those costs just go away and do these 190s go back into storage and that's just a client question. I appreciate your thoughts. Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Duane, I appreciate the question. Obviously, you don't even expect me to start the answer by saying that we are very confident that the NEA will be extremely successful. When I look at JetBlue's P& L over the years, one of the things that limit -- limited us just the lack of the ability to grow New York. New York has always been a market where we might up -- we've made really good margins and others have struggled. There's no reason not to believe that the NEA won't be successful. And I think most any -- most industry observers see that too. And I'm -- I think everything that we said around allowing JetBlue to build more relevant, some of the things that Joanna talked about, giving people a reason to get the credit card to engage a more heavily in the TrueBlue program. All those things flow from having a bigger, more relevant network. However, I don't want to dodge your question. So, what if we're wrong about whether that? While the cost simply come out, I mean, if you look at the CASM guide that we say it really relates to keeping the 19 beyond the original plan to set them down, which was really a 1 for 1 of the 2 in 2 came in and it reflects the fact that we have more flying in higher-cost airports. And of course, if the NEA doesn't happen, I assume the slots that will be flying, additional slots that will be flying we would no longer be flying and you would see the IPO cost reduce as we would have less exposure to some of those high-cost airport. So the purpose of the what-if planning, please I'll say again, we're very confident that the NEA will be incredibly successful and do everything we believe it will. But if we were wrong about that or if for some reason the DOJ was successful, which I don't believe they will be. But if they were then, it'll be relatively straightforward to back those costs out.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie from Seaport Global. Your line is now open.\nDan McKenzie : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions here. I guess going back to the script, a few things that you guys shared restoring earnings power beyond 2019 and superior margins for the long term. So if I go back to 2019, JetBlue was pretty clear that that year was a transition year on the way to a better 2020. So I guess, what I'm wondering is, you guys saying that, you think you really have a business plan here for better margins versus 2019 steady-state.\nRobin Hayes: Ursula, you want to take that?\nUrsula Hurley: Sure. Good morning, Dan. So Dan, as you referenced, I would remind us all that we were on a path to deliver flat CASM ex-fuel pre - COVID. We exceeded cost expectations in 2019. We significantly closed the GAAP versus our peers and we were on track to deliver record cost performance in 2020. And costs are a vital pillar of our business model. And when you couple our commitment to deliver flattish unit cost trajectory to drive superior margins over the long-term with unique revenue opportunities that are currently outperforming and that flat CASM ex-fuel commitment, it's a meaningful and powerful formula to restore earnings power and expand our margins over the long-term.\nDan McKenzie : Okay, got it. And then going back to an earlier question, 20% to 30% of the revenue coming from corporate travel versus 20% historically, if I heard that correctly, Is that an outlook for 2022? And I guess is it -- I'm just wondering about the resistance to reinstating the margins that you've reported historically. I'm just wondering if it's tied to the lack of visibility around the timing of when corporate travel returns?\nJoanna Geraghty : No. No. Let me be clear. So 2019 on average, our corporate contribution was about 20. The percent of revenue on the fall of 25% because obviously more corporate plan in the fall. As we look at the industry and the potential opportunity with the NEA, because that will obviously drive more corporate signage JetBlue on the industry is on average about 30% corporate travels. So we're at 20 the industries that 30 somewhere between their lives, the opportunity for JetBlue with the NEA.\nDan Mc Kenzie : Okay. Thanks for the time you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham from MKM Partners. Your line is now open.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. You're calling out 6 points of transitory cost pressures. Just what gives you the confidence that this inflationary environment we want to stickier labor costs or maybe about our way to ask it is, how many people are you planning on hiring in 2022? Or from now until the end of 2022? And just like well, how has the wage rates changed as of late?\nUrsula Hurley: Yeah. Good morning, Connor. Thank you for the question. To your point, we have highlighted both short-term and longer-term headwinds in regards to labor On the short-term labor challenges, we believe that those are going to get mitigated as we ramp up hiring. And essentially the networks sets into a new norm. We'll be able to longer term drive productivity efficiencies, which we believe will offset the longer-term inflationary pressures that we're seeing. So we entered -- obviously the recovery occurred much quicker than we had originally anticipated throughout the summer, so there was a need to ensure that we paid appropriately to cover the operation. We're hiring in preparation for next year, and as I mentioned, once the network normalizes, we'll be able to drive those productivity efficiencies over the long term.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then maybe to just piggyback on Duane's question around the E190s. So, I'm just curious on how much of your 2022 capacity plan is tied to the NEA? And if that obviously about SPAC, does that basically just go away with the E190? I'm just trying to get a sense for the moving parts both on the cost side and the capacity side of the equation and thanks again.\nUrsula Hurley: Scott, you want to take that?\nScott Laurence: Yeah, so this is Scott, I'll try to grab that. I mean, if you look at the NEA it represented about 2/3 of our capacity, just going into those rights 4 airports that are involved. What I would highlight is the E190s are not big ASM contributors, right They don't generate a lot of capacity because they tend to fly shorter\nScott Laurence: stages, and, obviously, they've all got a 100 seats. The stage on that airplane as we move forward into 2022, is going to continue to be somewhat limited just based upon the high frequency flying as we restore some of the frequencies, Boston to LaGuardia, things like that that we haven't been able to traditionally access. You got to -- if you look at that and I guess the concept of what we touched on earlier, that the ASM generation associated there is -- it's probably is not going to be significant.\nRobin Hayes: If I can add to that though I do think from a capacity, probably that's very true. If you think about what we were flying in New York per day pre NEA, and what we'd be flying in New York post NEA. And then you take into account some additional growth in Boston pre NEA. You're talking probably an excess of a 100 departures a day. Additionally, because of the NEA. And so well, they all short stages. It has a very disruptive effect on low fares because these are some of the markets that traditionally suffered from the high spreads. And so whilst from a capacity point of view, it's not that significant, those you may remember pre -COVID in 2019, I think the one line 2 was about 4 to 5% of our total capacity in terms of ASM. You'll see the impact it has is significant just because of the number of additional flights a day allow us to offer out of New York.\nConor Cunningham: Great. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker : Thanks very much, Operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. To -- one of the areas that you are really strong in is the Caribbean. We had some issues in Haiti. I don't know what's going on in Puerto Rico. Wondering if you can just give us an update on how you're thinking about that market into fourth quarter and first quarter given how they were strong from a VFR perspective earlier this year.\nJoanna Geraghty : Hey, Helane. Thanks for the question. I will get a top-line, I'll let Dave to dig a little deeper on Haiti, specifically, obviously tough situation, I know they've had a rough year with a variety of things happening. VFR has performed very well throughout the quarter. We've got good loads and higher fares despite there being some pressure on industry capacity. We're very pleased with its performance into the holiday period. So overall, VFR holding up well. David, do you want to give a little color specifically on Haiti?\nDavid Clark : Sure. And just overall the region, Caribbean, Latin America was our strongest performing revenue region in Q3, had the highest year over to revenue growth. If you look at it as a portfolio performing quite well, and as Joanna mentioned the VFR demand is quite strong, but we also saw a lot of leisure traffic too. As customers look for outdoor activities and outdoor vacations, the Caribbean hits the spot very nicely. And to overall doing well yes, some challenging spots, Haiti being one of them. We continue to work through it, but the region as a whole has been a strong point for our network.\nHelane Becker : That was very helpful, thanks. And then my other question and I don't mean to -- I'm going to apologize. I'm not going to be a jerk about it that, as you think about adding capacity on LaGuardia and New York, specifically, JFK as well, you've got, I mean, this area as you guys know is just fraught with ATC delays, weather like today. So how do you think about getting around the delays that all this excess for extra, maybe not excess, capacity will cause in the area to keep the operation from lagging on your part, getting them to wait. And like I said, I don't mean to be a jerk about it that --\nJoanna Geraghty : No, worry Celine. Rest assured we talked about it a lot here as well. Listen the New York area is a very high-value geography. There's a lot of people that live here who. wan to fly out of here and there's a lot of people that want to visit here. And in the absence of meaningful reform with NextGen in aerospace that we I think have done an exceptionally good job navigating through. We've got a great team that's focused on how do you operate in the Northeast, frankly, other carriers have tried and haven't done it particularly well. And we have a unique operating model specific to how we set up New York to, I think protect the operation as best we can, we've a greater number of out-and-backs flights between from the northeast other locations to try to ensure that there's a level of stability across the system when we do have disruptive days. I think I will point out that the incremental growth that we have is actually net neutral to the region because it's lot constrained in LaGuardia and JFK. so you're not seeing incremental flights necessarily as much as you're seeing JetBlue does, I mean incremental flights, but the industry as a whole, it'll be the same number out of the region, but our team does a really great job in really trying circumstances. You see customers still flying JetBlue because they recognize that this is a complex market. And we do it well, we focus on completing flights and getting customers to where they want to go, having leisure, that's what we know they want to do in JetBlue and that's what we prioritize.\nHelane Becker : That's usually helpful. Thank you very much. Thanks, everybody. Have a nice day.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nJamie Baker : Good morning, everybody. Robin, a question on London and then I guess Europe more broadly, how do you intend to build a brand there? I know what worked well here in the U.S. but different times, different market.\nRobin Hayes: Well, Jamie, I'll do that because I know you have be pegged as London guy, I guess that's very fair. I -- look -- I\nJamie Baker : What gave it away.\nRobin Hayes: Yeah, exactly. Look, we have a whole plan to do that. We have -- we wanted to wait until we got -- the UK was open. We -- I think we got some very creative ways of doing it that can -- I think stay close to our low-cost routes. And whilst [inaudible 00:54:33] share the point-of-sale split between the U.K. And yes, I will tell you, I'm already extremely pleased as to how much of our business is coming out of the U.K. point-of-sale where we really haven't done too much to promote it, and it's significantly ahead of what we had even expected to be the case, sort of steady-state. So I think clearly what is understood over there through significant amount of media that we've had is that we're doing it differently and we're offering a much more accessible premium service, which is a very good premium service, and continue to of [inaudible 00:55:10] coat well, coach, we call it core -- our core fares that are restoring some of the glory days of transatlantic flying with decent food and, of course, free Wi - Fi and free TV, including the BBC.\nJamie Baker : That's helpful. Thanks, Robin. And then second in the next 3 or 4 or 5 years, what do you think is the biggest structural risk either to JetBlue or the industry? And I'm looking for a big picture theme, this isn't a modeling question. ESG, the next industry labor cycle over capacity, pandemic risk, those themes, well, to the extent it all goes wrong, what do you think would ultimately drive that?\nRobin Hayes: Now, when I think at the big picture and I think this is why we've been doing so much in the area of sustainability. I truly believe going into COVID, we're having a lot of discussions with both A4A, which is, as you know, the UK Trade Association and IR. And you started to talk to some of the European airlines around how it was done to think of talk thing influenced how that thinking about planning and positioning and I think I've been really pleasantly, I've really been happy how well the U.S. airline industry has responded to this challenge in relatively short space of time.  You know, we do not want--we want people who fly on us to know that we care about the environment and that we are doing everything we can to reduce our carbon footprint. Because if we don't, as other, other sectors do the percentage of carbon emissions that come from aviation will climb about 2% or 3% if today. And we're going to have an even bigger target on our back. So I think that's the macro risk -- that's the biggest macro risk that I would point to.\nJamie Baker : Okay. Very helpful. Thank you, Robin and team. Take care.\nRobin Hayes: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, Good morning, everyone. Personal maybe, can we go back to cost for a minute? Because in my model I'm having a hard time finding and kind of the cost line that had a lot of leverage to drive CASM down in the back half of next year. So maybe, in first question, can you give us any rough estimates on what kind of capacity you're assuming in the back half of '22 to get to that level. And 2, in the pandemic, I've been looking at cost more on absolute basis as opposed to an ASM basis. And when I look at your cost structure next year, do you think there will be any line items that will be lower in 2022 than they were in 2019.\nUrsula Hurley: Good morning, Andrew. Thanks for that question. So in regards to the capacity level that we're expecting next year, so we do envision full-year 2022 to be up versus 2019, and we expect that capacity to ramp up progressively as we navigate through the year, depending on the shape of the recovery. So as we acknowledge, we live in a fluid environment, and so we'll put a stake in the ground in terms of our capacity level to basically drive margins and profitability. I think in overarching comment is that we're still not in the new norm, so the operation is still very fluid and it hasn't yet settled down. What I can point you to is we're starting to see some efficiencies come through because we are getting to a more level setted normalization. So meaning, we had, if you look at Q3 to Q4 of this year, it's a 2 point sequential CASM increase and capacity is decreasing 5. Capacity as it's coming back, we are getting to a more normal level with less volatility, and so we're starting to see cost efficiencies comes to fruition that had previously been mapped throughout COVID. As I look into next year, the levers to be pulled our first and foremost as the network normalizes and is hiring it is optimized, we have to drive productivity. That is essential for us to gain meaningful cost efficiencies as we navigate through the year. I think Stackin, I'll reiterate, we need to ensure the fixed costs that we took out of 2020 or sustained as we navigate through 2022. If we're going through the 2022 planning process right now and I can tell you, no stone is going unturned. So, I feel extremely confident that we've got levers to pull in order to achieve the low single-digit CASM ex-fuel commitment next year.\nAndrew Didora: And then one short follow-up from me. In terms of the London flying, can you quantify what the CASM tailwind is going to be from that in next year?\nJoanna Geraghty : Yeah, this is Joanna. I'll take that. It's de minimis. I mean, just to give you a sense of the ASM's, London's currently contributing, it's less than half a percent. So de minimis.\nAndrew Didora: Yeah. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.Your line is now open.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Morning everyone. Just a couple of follow-ups. I think you said on the call that holiday travel is looking really strong, but I'm not sure if you quantified it.?Apologies to be dead?. If you could just give us sense of what holiday travel is tracking like versus 2019. Second, not to beat the horse on the whole Margin versus cost story here, but I wanted to clarify -- Robin, you said at the top of the call that you are laser-focused on margin. Ursula, you said that you are highly focused on costs and there's been a lot of talk on the revenue opportunity with any international as well. So the risk of being and all of the above. What is the priority here? Are you focused on EBITDA growth? Are you focused on margin improvement are you focused on cost control? What's the -- if you're going to rank all that that would.\nRobin Hayes: Sure. I'll take that and then maybe -- I'll maybe answer the second part of your question and maybe one of the team can take comment about the holiday. Margin is our North Star. I think the reason we spent so much time talking about cost is that we knew ahead of COVID, we had to do a lot of work to drive more efficiency in our cost structure. We had the structural cost program that in the end ended up delivering more than the $250 to $300 million goal we set. As we went through COVID, we also took some further opportunities to reduce our fixed cost structure as well. And so, as we come out of COVID, we need to be laser-focused on maintaining that focus on costs. And there were a lot of challenges that go with operating the Northeast. And so we have to be very laser-focused on that so that we can maintain our commitment to our cost structure because ultimately that's what allows us to offer low fares. Now, the reason I think margin is -- I think the proof point that margin is a North Star is the decision that we took to enter into the NEA with American. It does drive some additional costs which we outlined in the last earnings call because we are keeping the E190s longer and our mix is changing to have more flying into higher-cost airports that we did that because [inaudible 01:03:19] margin. So I don't want -- I want everyone to be under no illusions. Margin is our North Star, but we aren't going to take our eye off the cost structure either.\nDavid Clark : And Ravi, this is Dave, just following up on the question about the holidays. The holidays continue to book well, as we've seen in the third quarter, July and August's peak travel period performed very well. Right now, the holidays are about even with where we were at this point in 2019, they were behind for quite a while because the Delta variant, so we were falling behind in August and early September. We've not been catching up for over a month and about even. And December, I'd say especially, is performing well. The last several weeks we've actually taken more revenue bookings this year than we did at the same time in 2019 over this booking weeks.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Frenzy, we'll take a couple of more questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Christopher. Your line is now open.\nChristopher: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Going back to this focus here on productivity, could you help us frame how you're thinking about and what are some of the metrics that we should look at here? Is it ASM's per FT E and I guess there's a part B to that? Do you believe that you can, what -- when fully recovered, meaning on a 2019 ASM base, can you run the airline at fewer FTEs relative to 2019? is this a total passengers per FTE. And then also on fuel as we look out to 2022 and 2023 assuming we are fully recovered there. Should we expect that line to improve as well versus 2019? Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty : Hi, this is Joanna. I'll take the first part just to give you a sense of how we look at it. So it's a combination of departures and customers per FTE. Obviously, each work group has a specific set of metrics though tech ops is a little bit different. That's about departures and customers. But rest assured, we are looking looking at it at every level and are very laser-focused on it. I'll point out a couple of things. Number 1, we will see juniority benefits with hiring that we wouldn't have had post pre - COVID as we bring more crew members on. That's a tremendous benefit. Number 2 and Ursula mentioned it, but I cannot emphasize it enough. The volatility of the schedule has created a level of inefficiency into the operation that will go away into next year as things stabilize. So when you think about pulling capacity close in, you pay for a certain amount of crew costs when you do that. When you think about pivoting the network to introduce new flying, it means that the markets where you have staffing that maybe excess staffing that you otherwise would have used in a normal time. And so as the network stabilizes, as we continue to hire more crew members to make up for where crew members have left at a lower junior -- at a lower seniority number, that will drive meaningful benefit across the operation. So I think that's the most important thing to remember, and that will get much better as we cycle through and step into 2022, right now, we're in ramp-up mode. We're hiring a lot, but there's also a training throughput issues, so we can't bring everybody on overnight. We have to meter them in so you'll see a level of inefficiency into Q4 and into Q1 as we continue to ramp up and get to the right staffing complement moving forward, maybe Ursula, you want to take the second part of the question.\nUrsula Hurley: Yeah, I would just reiterate what Joanna said. So as we navigate through the 20-22 planning process, we envisioned the network normalizing. We'd go work group by work group in terms of the metrics that we track. I would also highlight that we'll also focus on working with better leverage technology and where can we fundamentally improved processes. And this is not only in Joanna 's frontline work groups, but also corporate support centers as well. That's why we feel very confident that there is a path to deliver meaningful value here as we look at achieving that low single-digit CASM ex-fuel number next year.\nChristopher: Okay. And if I could just the second question here on the 20% to 30% opportunity on the business side, we're just curious what type of mix is that contemplating in terms of industries,. Is that similar to 2019 or perhaps should we consider a different mix and by extension a different level of body? Thank you.\nDavid Clark : Sure. Thanks, Christopher, for the question, This is Dave. The mix would be largely the same. We already have about 3 quarters of our business and corporate exposure in New York and Boston so growing this area won't change the mix significantly for us.\nChristopher: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking my question here. I just want to circle back to the NDA, Robin or Joanna. Can you guys talk to the anticipated benefits of this partnership and how important is that revenue sharing portion of it, because I think that might be where some of the criticism is coming out at this and then Ursula, you did talk. About a couple of points from the NDA, but that's being accretive to the Alex. I'm assuming that's more of the short-haul smaller gauge. Fine. But would love a little clarification there, too. Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Sure, no. Brandon, I'll keep it still high level just because of time and then we can think a way for follow-up, but think of the NEA I mean, again, this is effectively enabling JetBlue to increase our presence in New York by nearly 50%. That is extremely significant from a network relevance point-of-view that is very important in terms of being more attractive to corporate flying. I can't tell you -- when we look at our data how much of a high-share of wallet if we have of people's leisure income, and a larger share of wallet in the business -- on the business side. And so the ability to fly more places, the ability for Americans high-value customers to fly on JetBlue, the ability to offer -- for us to offer more [Inaudible 01:09:39] for our own TrueBlue members, especially our Mozart members. And then overlay all the benefits of co-chair [inaudible 01:09:47] it is a multi-pronged approach, and all I will say is that, I look back historically and JetBlue in New York always been up-stand out-performer from a margin perspective. And this is another enabling us to grow that beyond what we could have possibly done without the NEA.\nBrandon Oglenski: Great. Frenzy, we'll take 1 final question from the analysts.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nHunter Keay: Thank you for getting me on. I appreciate it squeezing in. L isten, I know we know that the NEA is going to drive some costs on the East Coast, but how are you feeling about the ability to keep costs down on the West Coast where you just reoriented the West Coast strategy around LAX. I asked the question because Frontier just pulled out of LAX because of what [inaudible 01:10:39] is doing with airport costs there. I think about this margin as a North Star concept. Are you sure that you are going to be able to have the West Coast strategy be accretive to that in the context of all the moving parts?\nScott Laurence: Scott, I appreciate the question. I think, first and foremost, the West Coast strategy is anchored around the Transcon. And if you look at our performance in -- particular in LAX, Mint has been the standout for us and continues to be the case. That was the case before COVID, and through COVID and today. Again, I think the West Coast strategy is based upon ensuring that we leverage the -- having the best product at the best price. The NEA also comes into that as well. So again, I think the West Coast strategy is one where we can drive margin and a significant portion of the -- that success will come from mid flying and expanded mid flying and expanded Transcon.\nHunter Keay: All right. And then Robin, what are some of the things that JetBlue has historically done well on costs. And what are some things where you see the most room for improvement?\nRobin Hayes: On costs with that, I take it?\nHunter Keay: Exclusively on costs. Not unit costs but just overhead and just anything that you think you guys could probably do a better job going forward relative where you've been in prior years.\nRobin Hayes: I think I'd point back to the 3-year structural cost program where we delivered exactly what we said we would do. We have some of the best multi-bag unit cost performance during some of that period, and so I think the -- that the -- and we did have over $300 million of benefits. I think that we've demonstrated [inaudible 01:12:30] for a number of years as we came to COVID, we also took the opportunity.It will ah, about Baker. I'm sorry.Onto Mik start again. I wasn't trying to avoid your question on costs. But to recap, I would say that between the period of 2017 and 2020, as we went through the structural cost program, a significant number of our maintenance cost issues, our distribution cost issues, you will recall that those buckets. I mean, historically, if you compare our cost performance to other airlines, one of the areas where we have performed less well, with our maintenance costs and that's why so much of the structural costs program was focused on that and putting the lot agreements in place as we took delivery of new airplanes to smooth out over time. So I'm very pleased that with the efforts that the teams have made in all of those areas. As we went into COVID, we talked a really hard look at our fixed cost structure. And sort of committed to delivering over a $150 million of fixed cost savings. And we are well on the way in accomplishing that. And as we come out of COVID, I think this long-term commitment, I mean, when I think about the next 5 years, I don't see any reason why JetBlue can't continue to deliver flattish CASM on sort of mid-single-digit increases in capacity. And that's what we'll, I think, provide some clarity. So this is a new JetBlue from a cost perspective. I know a lot of it gets marked at the moment because of what we've done with the network and how we're managing through COVID. But I truly believe coming -- maintaining our discipline and focus on costs plus the additional revenue initiatives. It is a unique store industry in terms of one that can drive margin and drive margin next year. This is not a plan to drive margin in 3 or 4 years. This is planned to drive margin into '22 and that's where we focused on.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Caiado: Great, thanks, Robin. And that will conclude our Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. Have a great day.\nOperator: And again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 2, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-07-27 15:37:03", "content": "Operator: Good morning, my name is Sinedra. I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue's Director of Investor Relations, Joe Caiado.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Joe, and welcome to your first earnings call with JetBlue. It's great to have you on the team and I'm also very excited to have Ursula joining me here as well. So Ursula welcome to your first earnings call. You've been in the room for years, but welcome to the seat. So, good morning everyone. I'd like to start by thanking our inspiring 20,000 crew members for their determination through the most challenging period in our history and now in taking on the difficult task of restoring operations back to normal levels. The recovery in air travel has come more quickly than we expected. In addition, our recovery has been accelerated by our Northeast Alliance with American Airlines, helping us expand and capture more corporate customers in both New York and Boston. Vaccines have clearly consumer confidence and we are pleased to see our customers traveling with us in greater numbers. Thanks to the outstanding efforts of our crew members in taking care of our customers and each other, JetBlue is well positioned for success, and I couldn't be more excited about the future. Turning to Slide 4 of the earnings deck. In the second quarter, we saw strong signs that consumer confidence and travel demand is returning with second quarter revenue doubling compared to the first quarter driven by pent-up demand. JetBlue reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.65 as we capitalize on the strength of our brand at distinctive positioning in the accelerating leisure market and the draw of our focus cities. To give you more context the recovery in leisure and VFR travel has been more robust than we had anticipated. The quick operational ramp up and unusually severe weather in the Northeast has come with challenges, but we are pleased with a continued improvement in demand trends through the summer. We operated a peak 929 flights per day in early July, a far cry from the roughly 140 average daily departures in the second quarter a year ago. We also expect capacity to be largely restored to 2019 levels in the third quarter as a result of the increased demand and growth opportunities from our Northeast Alliance, an important milestone in our recovery. As we march towards a full recovery, we will be laser focused on executing our plan to put us back on the path towards superior margins. We are confident that our competitive advantages, our service, outstanding onboard product and cost structure and the disciplined approach of the three years preceding the pandemic will drive our long-term recovery and sustainable success. Margin is firmly back as our North Star. And as we start to realize benefits from \u2013 and we are starting to realize benefits from our new commercial and revenue initiatives and we'll be sharing more on that shortly. Moving to Slide 5, as we turn to recovery, we continue to generate positive cash from operations in the second quarter and we expect continued improvement in our operating performance as we progress towards the full recovery. We are creating a path to restore our earnings power to beyond 2019 levels and generate long-term value for our owners in the years ahead enabled by an accelerated recovery and the earnings of margin tailwinds from our Northeast Alliance. Our attention now is on squarely rebuilding our margins and repairing our balance sheet. To rebuild our margins we are executing various revenue initiatives across the network and business while continuing to focus on cost control and sound capital allocation. Regarding our network, we have added new destinations, a more service to our focus cities to help our customers travel again, including eight new routes set to launch in the coming months. In August, we expect to launch our first Transatlantic flight to London, and we remain committed to our long-term strategy to bring our unique combination of low fares and great service to these routes. We are disappointed with the continued restrictions on travel between the U.S. and the UK and urge regulators to safely reopen borders for travel. We are planning schedule adjustments for this fall to match the current demand environment and once a path to the border reopening is clear, we expect demand to bounce back quickly just as it has in the rest of our network. In New York and Boston, we are already seeing the initial benefit of our Northeast Alliance with American Airlines. We believe this partnership will be a key driver in accelerating JetBlue's recovery and an important contributor to our long-term growth, including revenue and margin generation. The Northeast Alliance supports our expansion in both New York and Boston, and we're excited to see almost 20 new flights and multiple new markets in LaGuardia launching this fall with many more to come in 2022. The alliance benefits consumers by bringing healthy competition a much needed choices for travelers in the Northeast. As both JetBlue and American expand flying, we remain focused on developing a seamless travel experience for our customers, and we are making the many necessary investments. Given the new growth opportunities provided by our Northeast Alliance, we reexamined our fleet to ensure we are well equipped to capitalize fully on both current and near-term conditions. We have a plan to delay our retirement schedule for our owned E190s, which offers an efficient way to profitably grow in the Northeast while protecting our balance sheet. We will, of course, remain flexible with our fleet to continue to align with the demand environment. Our commercial efforts continue to drive incremental revenue and position JetBlue for margin expansion. In the Northeast Alliance, I'd like to highlight three specific initiatives. In addition to the Northeast airlines, I should say, I'd like to highlight three specific initiatives. We are pleased with the early results of our fare options update, which is providing a significant revenue tailwind. Our JetBlue Travel Products subsidiary generated our highest ever single quarter commissions revenue across all products, including JetBlue Vacations. Finally, we are thrilled to announce the extension of our co-brand agreement with Barclays and MasterCard, which will greatly enhance the value of our program. We expect all of these initiatives to significantly drive margin expansion as we look ahead. With margin as our North Star, we will make these investments in the Northeast Alliance \u2013 we will make investments in the Northeast Alliance, but while adding cost pressures, unlock new growth opportunities. These growth opportunities are emerging faster than we expected, and we are pulling forward some CASM pressure in 2022, as we delayed 190 retirements and ramp up capacity and high cost airports, including LaGuardia in Europe. We remain laser focused on our cost structure and believe we have a good trajectory over the longer-term to support our efforts to expand earnings and margins. In the near-term, we are working through various cost headwinds as we recover notably with maintenance, rents, landing fees, and ramp up pressures. We believe some of these pressures will prove temporary and are a natural path of a recovery. Our teams are working hard to mitigate these headwinds and ensure we execute on our fixed cost saving. We expect to share more color on this important work as we add to our list of cost initiatives, following the annual planning process. Lastly, we took another step forward in repairing our balance sheet by paying down our term-loan part of our balanced approach to capital allocation. We expect to continue paying down the high cost debt while investing in margin and earnings accretive backlog. Moving now to Slide 6, how optimism in JetBlue's future grows day by day. As we look cover from the greatest crisis in our history, we will continue executing our plan to emerge as a stronger airline equipped for long-term sustainable profitable growth. The sustainability of our future growth is in fact stitched in to our strategy as we work to mitigate risks, reduce our carbon footprint and create value for our owners. Importantly, part of our executive incentive plan is tied to ESG. We continue on our path to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040 and we're pleased to report that we recently signed an agreement to purchase sustainable aviation fuel or SAF at LAX and took our first delivery earlier this month. This followed JetBlue's move last year to fuel flights from San Francisco with SAF. SAF is one of the most promising ways to reduce air travel emissions. All stakeholders, airlines, manufacturers, fuel supplies, governments, and investors will need to play a part and a role to help grow and scale SAF and usher in a new lower carbon future to aviation. So in conclusion for me, I'd close by again thanking our incredible crew members for everything they've done through this pandemic and particularly over the last couple of months as our airline has come roaring back. Summer has always had its share of challenges, but your energy and commitment are bringing customers back and setting JetBlue on a solid path of recovery. We're as excited as ever as we chart a course towards generating superior margin. With that I'll hand off to Joanna.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. I'll start by adding my thanks to our amazing crew members, who are rising to the challenge of rapidly restoring our operations to meet pent-up demand while managing an unusual amount of severe weather days. It has truly been a team effort. We've brought all crew members back from leave. We are hiring new crew members, many are picking up extra hours to support the large number of customers flying and our support center crew members have been turning out in strong numbers to help support our operational ramp up. We also appreciate our customers, who are flying in record numbers again, and are excited to connect them to their destinations. This swift rebound in travel demand has come with operational challenges across the industry, which we believe will ease as we move through the summer. We are pleased to be in a position today where we are growing once again and welcoming more JetBlue crew members to our family. Turning to Slide 8. We're very excited about a number of revenue initiatives currently underway to drive profitable growth. As Robin mentioned, we're encouraged by the early results of our Northeast Alliance with American Airlines. This is driving compelling benefits for our customers through increased options and low fares. It is resulting in incremental capacity and revenue growth. Thus far Codeshare revenue is exceeding our expectations and we are particularly excited by the positive initial response from many of our corporate customers. Through this alliance, we can provide our business and leisure customers a more compelling network and schedule offerings such as our plans to operate up to 12 daily round trips in the fall between LaGuardia and Boston. Last quarter, we continue to roll out Codeshare markets and launched the ability to earn points or miles on either JetBlue or American for both TrueBlue and Advantage members. Starting this fall, elite members of both programs will be able to enjoy benefits on both carriers. So far the NEA has announced a total of 58 new markets, 32 flown by JetBlue with many more to come. The success of the NEA will come not just from a greatly expanded network with more JetBlue flying, but also the ability for customers to seamlessly fly in either JetBlue or American operated flights. We're also very pleased with the contributions from our recent update to our fare options platform, which is trending above the expected one point of revenue benefit and currently contributing closer to two points of revenue for the third quarter and beyond. We have seen a double-digit increase in customer demand to buy up from our Blue Basic offering. We believe we offer the best product at a low price in every category that we serve. Our JetBlue Travel Products subsidiary remains a bright spot with record revenues across all key products, doubling in relative size to the airline versus pre-pandemic levels. JetBlue Vacations sales were up over 60% year over two. Travel insurance attach rates continued growing as we better tailor products to evolving customer needs and we recently issued an RFP, which generated a positive initial response. We are also seeing continued growth from car rentals and increasingly hotels by better targeting our offers via our recently launched Paisly platform. Our continued investment in product development, merchandising and marketing of broader travel products provides us a path to reach $100 million in run rate EBIT next year. Moving to Slide 9. We're very bullish in loyalty and we are supercharging our performance in this space by building on our award-winning TrueBlue program and high-growth co-brand portfolio. We have laid the groundwork to evolve the benefits and value proposition of TrueBlue at additional value and versatility to our currency of points and further enhance our co-brand portfolio. As part of our plans foundation, we are very pleased to announce the renewal of our partnerships with Barclays and MasterCard for our co-brand credit card program. They have both been tremendous partners over the past several years, and we are very excited to continue growing the portfolio and enhancing value for all stakeholders. We expect our new agreement will deliver approximately an incremental 1 point to our annualized revenue and margin and many exciting enhancements are in-store. In the immediate term, we are seeing material growth in the co-brand portfolio, including record breaking acquisition on the JetBlue Plus Card. This is an important funnel to grow our loyal customer base. Spend from existing card members is also up significantly. Both of these will contribute to our growing revenue performance. Moving to Slide 10. In the second quarter, our revenue declined 29% year-over-two, a 32% sequential improvement from the prior quarter and better than our latest planning assumption. Throughout the quarter, demand trends exceeded our initial revenue expectations. Our recent co-brand agreement, which was not included in our planning assumption, added approximately 1.5 points of revenue in the second quarter. We are pleased to see further month-on-month improvement into the peak summer months with demand momentum across all of our geographies. Our leisure fares continued to improve and returned to 2019 levels this month, supported by the strong recovery in demand and load factors. We ended the quarter with load factors in the mid-80s with June capacity largely back to pre-pandemic levels compared to an average load factor in the mid-60s in the first quarter on 41% lift capacity year-over-two. By the end of the second quarter, we were generating average daily cash sales in excess of $20 million, which marks a considerable expansion from the $15 million per day at the end of March. For the third quarter of 2021, our planning assumption for revenue is a decline between 4% and 9% year-over-two; another quarter of strong sequential improvement of approximately 20 points. We expect unit revenue to continue to improve on top of increasing capacity with load factors into the mid-80s this summer and yields approaching 2019 levels despite our heavier leisure mix. We've seen days with average paid load factors in the 90s. We've been pleased to see a stronger than expected leisure recovery through summer and, looking further ahead, we are optimistic for business travel to show a more robust recovery post Labor Day. Our customers are guiding us to expect an acceleration in business demand recovery this fall as people return to the office and travel policies become less restrictive. That said we will remain flexible, given the potential for future demand volatility due to variants and the course of the pandemic. Turning to capacity on Slide 11. In the second quarter, our flown capacity declined 15% year-over-two. For the third quarter of 2021, our planning assumption is for capacity to be down between flat-to-down 3% year-over-two, given the strong sequential improvement in demand. Throughout the pandemic, we have been nimble in adjusting our capacity deployment to the prevailing demand environment. While we are not seeing an impact on bookings from variants, we\u2019ll maintain this approach, given the uncertainty. Our VFR and leisure revenue is performing nicely and leading the travel rebound. We are also very pleased with the performance from our investments at LAX and New York. The pandemic opened up unique opportunities to meaningfully expand our presence at these historically capacity-constrained airports. In addition, we are continuously optimizing our network, focused on reallocating capacity to our highest margin opportunities. As our Northeast Alliance with American Airlines continue to accelerate our recovery, we are collaborating closely to reinforce benefits to our customers by growing and harmonizing our schedules, flying to new destinations to serve more customers, adding frequencies and all at low-fares. We are very excited for our partnership to provide a path for JetBlue to grow and provide more options to customers out of New York and Boston. I will close with my deepest thanks to all of our crewmembers for their hard work and resilience and ramping the operation to serve our customers and handling the operational challenges with professionalism. Our crewmembers form the core and the foundation of JetBlue's success. As we look ahead, I could not be more excited about the future of JetBlue as we execute our initiatives to grow revenue and margins and expand our loyal customer base. With that, over to you, Ursula.\nUrsula Hurley: Thank you, Joanna. I'd like to add my thanks to our crewmembers for their hard work to restore JetBlue and set us up for future success. The robust margin-accretive revenue initiatives you've heard about from Robin and Joanna, combined with our ongoing cost discipline and margin focus, gives me enormous confidence in our future. I'll start on Slide 13 with a brief overview of our financial results for the quarter. Revenue was $1.5 billion, down 29% year-over-two. Operating expenses were down 27% year-over-two. Excluding the benefit from Payroll Support Programs 2 and 3, operating expenses were down 7% year-over-two. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $86 million and GAAP earnings per share was $0.20 and adjusted loss per share was $0.65. Starting with our operational performance; our second quarter adjusted EBITDA came in better than the range we anticipated in early June. This was mainly the result of improving underlying revenue trends, the contribution from our co-brand agreement and our focus on mitigating cost pressures as we ramp up. For the third quarter, we estimate our EBITDA will range between $75 million and $175 million, reflecting continued sequential improvement in demand, partially offset by continued cost pressures from fuel prices and airports rents and landing fees. We expect to remain in positive EBITDA territory through the end of the year and expect to generate pre-tax profits in both July and August. Turning to Slide 14. We are pleased to see the progression in the revenue recovery and are deploying capacity to near pre-pandemic levels to meet demand. We'll maintain a laser focus on cost control as an important contributor in putting JetBlue back on a path towards superior margins. We'll continue to maintain a nimble approach in managing our business as we are mindful of the potential choppiness tied to variants and possible travel restrictions. During the second quarter, our adjusted operating expenses declined 7% year-over-two, in line with our prior assumptions. This excludes a payroll benefit of $366 million from PSP2 and 3. Our CASM ex-fuel declined meaningfully from a 41% increase year-over-two in the first quarter to a 19% increase in the second quarter. For the third quarter, our planning assumption is for a CASM ex-fuel increase between 11% to 13%, resulting in a sequential improvement over the second quarter. This 11% to 13% increase includes approximately 6 points of temporary headwinds as follows: approximately 3 to 4 points from rents and landing fees; and roughly 2 points from ramp-up labor costs. Given the faster than expected ramp-up and to help manage operational challenges worsened by weather events, we are offering financial incentives to ensure we are appropriately staffed for the summer peak travel period. We expect to gain efficiencies over the coming months as our newly hired crewmembers are trained to support the operation. Lastly, entering the third quarter and into next year, we expect to incur higher maintenance costs as we begin to cycle through a year\u2019s worth of maintenance that we deferred from the pandemic to protect liquidity. This is worth approximately 4 points of CASM ex-fuel-pressure in the third quarter. Moving to Slide 15. Looking ahead to 2022, we are laser-focused on aggressively managing our costs and expanding our margins as we continue to grow capacity and earnings. We expect CASM ex-fuel to improve from a double-digit growth rate in the third quarter of 2021 to low single-digit growth in 2022 compared to 2019. This cost trajectory is due to the timing shift on maintenance events tied to COVID, rents and landing fees, inflationary pressures and margin-accretive investments in our Northeast Alliance. We expect elevated maintenance expenses through the medium term to support our aging fleet and as we work through a significant volume of events, which we deferred through the pandemic. While the timing is fluid, we currently expect rents and landing fees to continue to be a headwind into 2022. But this should normalize over time as industry-wide traffic returns and rates stabilize in our key airports. As Robin and Joanna mentioned, we are also investing in our transformative Northeast Alliance, which is already outpacing expectations and will create long-term value for our shareholders. We expect this will drive CASM pressure as we emerge from the crisis. This will allow us to capitalize on the meaningful growth opportunities from the NEA in a capital-light and flexible way, resulting in margin expansion and earnings growth. The investments include delaying our E190 retirement schedule, earnings-accretive growth at higher-cost airports and creating a seamless customer experience. Mitigating these headwinds is critical as our operation continues to recover and we're doubling down on our efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure. In addition to the progress we are making in reducing fixed costs, we are targeting productivity gains as operations normalize to optimize our cost base as we work towards our goal of generating superior margins. We are also actively identifying further areas of cost opportunities and expect to share more details on our next set of structural cost initiatives following the 2022 planning cycle. We are committed to generating better than pre-pandemic earnings in the next few years by growing revenue and controlling costs. And we are extremely confident that we are on the right path to expand margins in a sustainable way. Moving to Slide 16; in the second quarter, we took delivery of two A220s, two A321neos and two A321LRs. The fleet stood at 276 aircraft at the end of June and we expect to take delivery of five additional aircrafts during the third quarter. Our 2021 CapEx forecast remains at approximately $1 billion, the majority of which is aircraft CapEx, which we expect to fund using cash. Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 17. At the end of June, our unrestricted cash and short-term investments were $3.7 billion or 46% of 2019 revenue. We remain comfortable with our strong liquidity position and we believe we have the ability to raise additional liquidity at attractive and competitive rates, if necessary. We're now squarely focused on repairing our balance sheet, lowering our total cost of debt and growing our unencumbered asset base. At the end of June, our debt-to-cap ratio was 55%; a slight decrease from the prior quarter. During the second quarter, we made further progress towards delevering by paying down a $722 million term loan. We also received over $1.1 billion from a combination of proceeds, including the second and third rounds of PSP. As a result of these actions, we reduced our net debt by over 50% to under $1 billion at the end of June, bringing our net debt below pre-pandemic levels. Turning to Slide 18; in 2021, we have repaid a total of $1.3 billion of debt between our revolving credit and term loan facilities. As a result of these payments, we have reduced our interest expense by approximately $30 million in 2021. In addition to our net debt, these actions have lowered our weighted average cost of debt to pre-pandemic levels and increased the amount of unencumbered high-value collateral. As we manage through the recovery, we plan to continue paying down high-cost debt. We\u2019ll maintain our balanced approach to capital allocation as we return to investment-grade metrics over the coming years. I'll close with a huge thank you to our crewmembers for all of their efforts to ensure JetBlue emerges from the crisis as a stronger airline. We\u2019re extremely pleased to see our customers returning in great numbers and JetBlue is well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and a path towards generating earnings growth and creating value for our owners. With that, we will now take your questions.\nJoe Caiado: Thank you. Sinedra, we're ready for the analyst Q&A portion. Could you please go over the instructions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hi, good morning everyone. Just kind of curious on your capacity outlook for 2022 and too that underscores the ex-fuel cost guide that you gave. And kind of what your revised plans are along those lines for the E190 fleet?\nUrsula Hurley: Good morning, Savi. Thank you for the question. This is Ursula. In regards to 2022 capacity, what we're trying to do this morning is provide you a level of transparency around the cost and how you should think about them over the next quarter as well as into 2022. We at this time are not specifically guiding to 2022 capacity as we're still working through our planning process. Given the volatility and uncertainty in the environment around COVID and the ramp-up of business travel, there are a wide range of capacity outcomes, but you should be assured that we'll set our 2022 capacity level around generating margins and we'll adjust as we navigate through the recovery. In regards to the E190, at this point in time, we have delayed the retirement of the 30 owned aircraft, and we will evaluate over time the optimal time from a cost perspective, as well as capitalizing on the NEA opportunity to determine the most optimal time to retire those aircraft.\nSavi Syth: So, Ursula, if I could on that \u2013 is there \u2013 do the other E190s then go away and is there kind of a lower and upper bound of what flexibility you have on the capacity front?\nUrsula Hurley: So as a reminder, we have 60 E190s in the fleet, so 30 of them are leased. So those we intend to return at the appropriate time, so those aircrafts will return between 2023 and 2026, the 30 owned aircraft, as I mentioned, we will determine the optimal time to retire those. However, I want to remind you we're keeping them in the fleet to capture the Northeast Alliance opportunity that is in front of us. So we are making investments in that fleet type to ensure that we can grow margins and capitalize on the Northeast Alliance opportunity.\nSavi Syth: And if I might clarify on the Northeast Alliance opportunity, the investments you're making, does that get built into the base or do those investments pressures then go away as you kind of leave 2022?\nUrsula Hurley: Sure. So there are two to four points of CASM ex-fuel investment to capitalize on the Northeast opportunity. We \u2013 those are put in three categories. So first and foremost, we're investing to ensure that there is a seamless customer experience from an IT perspective, as well as an airport experience perspective. The second area we're investing in is delaying the E190 aircraft, so ensuring that the customer experience on that aircraft and the maintenance is associated and embedded into the guidance in keeping that fleet type. And then the third area of investment is accelerating our growth in high cost, high value airports, such as LaGuardia and Newark here in the Northeast.\nSavi Syth: Got it. All right, I appreciate the color.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Dan McKenzie [Seaport Global].\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time here. And just kind of following up on that last question, the accelerated growth and high cost, high value airports, specifically Newark, LaGuardia, are there other airports that you're looking to grow as a function of the relationship with American Airlines?\nUrsula Hurley: Hi, Scott. Do you want to take that?\nScott Laurence: Yes. Hi, Dan. It's Scott Laurence. Thanks for the question. If you look at the NEA covers four airports, so JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, and Boston, we anticipate significant growth at those four airports because of the NEA and the opportunity that's there. We've got something that's transformational in terms of the opportunity and the ability to ramp the benefit from that quickly. So, if you think about where we're going or where we've been and where we're going in 2019 JFK sort of sat at about 175 peak flights. We expect steady state to be over 200, Newark going from about 35 to 70 flights, LaGuardia going from 16 to \u2013 50 to 60 and Boston going from 175 to over 230. So a lot of growth there, we believe it's hugely beneficial for us. There are a number of things here in terms of channel shift and also customer benefit as we see JetBlue growing, adding competition, really challenging the dominant carriers in the Northeast and really a win-win here.\nDan McKenzie: Then the next sort of logical question to that at some point here is, you know, are you exploring an entry into one world? And what are the pros and cons at this point as you think about developing that relationship with American?\nScott Laurence: So, Dan, it's a natural question to ask us. And I think that as we've looked at global alliances, our story has not changed there that we see a pretty large investment for a carrier like JetBlue and things like training and we think that we've got a better mouse trap. Our open architecture partnerships strategy has worked really well for us and that allows us to do so in a really responsible way in terms of costs. So, over the long-term, we'd never rule out opportunities, but right now it seems to make sense to pursue a strategy that's working for us.\nDan McKenzie: Thanks for the time you guys.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth [Evercore Partners].\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hi, thanks. I'm just curious when would you envision guiding to pre-tax margins or net income margins as some of your peers have started to do?\nUrsula Hurley: Good morning, Duane. Thank you for the question. So as we provide the guidance this morning, we are going to be EBITDA positive in the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter. I also noted in my remarks that we will be pre-tax positive in both July and August. As you think about September, September has historically been a trough month for JetBlue. And what I would also highlight is that we're being cautious around the return of business traffic. However, what I would know is that we're extremely pleased with how the Northeast Alliance has been accelerating in terms of ramp-up. So we do believe that that will provide us some momentum year over two as we look at the September timeframe.\nRobin Hayes: And Duane, if I can just build on that, because I think it's a great question. If I think through the various stages of the pandemic, we started very much talking in terms of daily cash burn. We then sort of moved to EBITDA because we felt that was sort of a measure of, sort of, operating performance, our ability to drive revenue and manage costs. And as everyone remembers, JetBlue was probably the most impacted airline in the early days from a revenue perspective given our geography in the Northeast. And so we were extremely aggressive at deferring many costs, including some of the maintenance costs that Ursula referred to. And I think we're very close here to being able to transition into pre-tax margin, reflecting ultimately that's what we're aiming for and everything we're putting in place here is to drive a significant margin expansion into next year and beyond.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then just for a follow-up with respect to these deferred retirements, can you just remind us kind of where you stand on 2022 and 2023 CapEx? And is there any element of this that's about delays, delivery delays or have you shifted CapEx out? Or is the message the capital plan is the same where we're just going to fly more on this higher CASM sub-fleet that we expected to retire?\nUrsula Hurley: Thanks for the follow-up question, Duane. So in regards to the capital plan for 2021, we've guided $1 billion worth of CapEx, which is mainly associated with the aircraft growth. In terms of 2022, we intend to take 12 aircraft next year, and that will drive approximately the same CapEx profile to 2021. In regards to 2023, we have a step up in the quantity of A220 deliveries. So you will have a slightly elevated CapEx profile in 2023 compared to 2021 and 2022. In regards to the investments in fleet, has it changed? The simple answer is no. The decision we've made is to simply delay the E190 retirement, which is a capital light and balance sheet friendly decision in order to support the ramp-up of the NEA.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. My first question is really maybe a follow-up to Duane's first question. So, you're expecting to be pre-tax profitable for July and August, sounds like not so for September. And based on your answer to Duane, it sounds like that's really just more of you on leisure revenue dropping off and maybe a little bit of a slower rebound in corporate or just a continued slower, I don't mean like relative to your prior expectations, just that that's wrapping up slower than leisure generally. So it sounds a little bit more revenue based, I guess, like first is that right? And then second moving forward getting to that pre-tax profitability is it really just about corporate ramping up from here? Are there any other cost items we should be keeping an eye on the second half that might impact that? Thanks.\nRobin Hayes: Yes, thanks, Catherine. I'll take that. It's Robin. I think that the comment on September is right. I mean, if you look at sort of historically for JetBlue that's always been our most challenging month. And so that combined with sort of some uncertainty around the pace of corporate travel. We are reading a lot about some companies moving office openings back from September to October. So, we're just sort of want to be cautious about that. When we think about what we're focused on, we're very \u2013 we're focused on margin. And again, EBITDA is really something that we entered into the year with and I think we said at the time \u2013 at some point this will transition back to margin. When I look at all the revenue initiatives, we talked today about how fare options is closer to two points. We talked about the TrueBlue program. We've talked about how quickly JetBlue Travel Products is driving margin. And you've seen the cost that is the additional CASM that is driven by the NEA, and we believe the NEA to be very accretive. And so when you look up all of those revenue initiatives together, we're very confident about their ability to drive margin as we head into next year. I think our caution is just around that we've been here before. We still are concerned that a spike in varying cases or other concerns could impact future demand. And we said, for over a year now, this could remain a very non-linear path. So we certainly don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves in setting expectations, but we have been extremely aggressive about lining up a set of revenue initiatives and are focused on costs to drive margin expansion very rapidly into 2022.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, understood and then maybe just a quick follow-up. In the slides, your debt payments for the rest of the year shown \u2013 not showing any more prepayments I think that's just a little bit of a placeholder for now. But based on your current cash flow outlook, might there be some additional issuances you would look to prepay and then just more generally, how are you thinking about pacing incremental debt prepayments? Are there any gating factors for you to do more on this front? Thanks for all the time.\nUrsula Hurley: I appreciate the question. So we're very focused on repairing the balance sheet. The goal is to get back to pre-COVID investment grade metrics. We have extremely pleased with the progress that we've made to date in regards to delevering. We are ensuring that we don't get ahead of ourselves given potential variants and international travel restrictions. So I do want to maintain a healthy cash balance as we go forward. We have identified future debt prepayment opportunities and you should be assured that going forward this is a priority to get back to the 30% to 40% debt to cap target that we had coming into COVID.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Bert Subin with Stifel.\nBert Subin: Hi, good morning, and thanks for the time. What's the best way to think about the renewed credit card agreement longer-term? Is the baseline of that deal adds something around $60 million to revenue this year? And then you guys just build on that in the future through acquisitions and increase spend?\nJoanna Geraghty: Hi, great. Thanks for the question. This is Joanna. So first, just really proud of the work that team has done specifically around the co-brand agreement. Obviously, this was initially tied to the potential for securing the government loan, and I think they did an excellent job pivoting around a longer-term renewal with a number of very interested parties. Barclays, MasterCard have been just tremendous partners during this. So as we mentioned during opening remarks, this will add 1 point of revenue, based purely on the economics of the program and that's based off of 2019 numbers. There is a few sources of value tied to both co-brand but also longer term TrueBlue. Obviously, seeing strong improvements in unit economics of the overall co-brand deal and additional incremental value if you think about the growth of the program. We've designed the partnership to really incentivize everybody involved to double down in terms of card acquisition, tapping into parts of the economy that maybe haven't been able to necessarily secure credit card, very much supporting some of our DE&I initiatives. If you look at the JetBlue Plus Card, we think there is tremendous opportunity there. We've seen record-breaking numbers of subscriptions and acquisition rates to the JetBlue Plus Card, which obviously has stronger, spend as well. And so if you think about co-brand specifically, we are very much at the front end of, I think what we believe is, very strong growth trajectory. Then if you pivot into TrueBlue, the underlying loyalty program, there is a number of areas of opportunities there. We are in the midst of redesigning that program to be far more customer-centric. It's already an award winning program. Customers love it, but we think we can drive greater attachment and greater stickiness through a design that really speaks to customers' wants and needs, also continuing to double down on earn and burn redemption opportunities with OA partners and then obviously the NEA is going to give even additional incremental sort of value to our underlying TrueBlue program. So it kind of cuts across a number of different areas. We often talk about how JetBlue's co-brand and TrueBlue program is relatively immature. In this case, I think what that means for us is tremendous ramp and tremendous growth over the coming years and very much closing what has been a gap for us for quite some time.\nBert Subin: Thanks for that, Joanna. Just one follow-up for Ursula on the cost side. So inflationary pressures, you certainly talked about them and clearly they're more acute in your core airports. As we go forward, maybe just on a longer-term basis, what do you see as the relative advantages to your peers? Is it really just going to be, you get stage growth from adding Europe and other parts to your network and then gauge growth from refreshing the fleet? Are there other items that you would put in those buckets? Thank you.\nUrsula Hurley: Yes. Thanks for the question. So we're extremely focused on ensuring that we continue to take out the $150 million to $200 million of fixed costs. We need to ensure that these are maintained into 2022. I think the other area of opportunity is doubling down on productivity; so as the operation and the network settles back into a new norm, ensuring that we're gaining efficiencies across the work groups to ensure that we're offsetting some of the labor and external inflation that we're seeing today. Also, what I would note is, in regards to our first structural cost program, 50% of the savings within that program are deemed variable. And so what's happening at the moment is that those savings are being masked by COVID. And so, again, as we reset the network and the operation comes back to a new norm, we expect to see efficiencies as we scale back up. So between the fixed costs, $150 million to $200 million, the structural cost program's 50% savings, which are variable, and then doubling down on productivity, I feel very confident in our path in delivering a low single-digit CASM ex-fuel number in 2022.\nBert Subin: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, morning, everyone. I'm sorry if I missed this in the prepared comments, but did you quantify how much the NEA contributed to revenue and EBIT in 2Q and kind of how we see that pacing over the next, like, 12 months and even longer maybe?\nScott Laurence: Hey, it's Scott. So I think we're very pleased with how the NEA is rolling out so far. And while we're not quantifying that, I would say that we're in the very initial stages. We've got about 40% of, sort of, code deployed on non-stops and very little code deployed on the connecting markets. And as we move forward in some of the announcements that are out there on frequent traveler reciprocity, those kind of things, we look forward to ramping up quickly. The other piece here is that, as we see business traffic return and you've seen some of the adds that we've announced and whether that's Boston-LaGuardia or Boston-DCA coming back to higher frequency schedules as well, there is the whole point of sort of looking at some channel shift. And I think that's one of the things about the NEA that we're pretty excited about because we create an environment where corporate customers see more JetBlue service, they see our fare structures, which means that their realized fares and the average fares will actually come down in a number of these markets as you see JetBlue competing. At the same time, we've been traditionally sitting around 20% leisure customers. And as we look at that rate, every point of that that we increase is worth about $25 million, so just in revenue. So, again, I think, across the board, we look at this and know that it's a win-win for us and as we roll that out, as we see the customer response, we're happy so far.\nJoanna Geraghty: If I could just maybe add as well, I mean, we're \u2013 to say we're excited is an understatement. I mean, this is providing a very formidable third competitor in our Northeast geography that customers will not only benefit from lower fares, but also greater competition in a much more robust network. And if you think about just the size of what we're accomplishing, LaGuardia pre-NEA was about 16 daily flights, it's going to grow to 50 to 60 daily flights a day; JFK was 175, that's going to grow to 220 to 240; Newark, 35 to 70 to 80; Boston, 180 to well over 200. So, I mean, this is a meaningful partnership alliance and we could not be more excited about the value that it's going to drive for JetBlue, but even as importantly for our customers who are in need of that third competitor and frankly just greater competition across the Northeast.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. Thanks for the color. And maybe as a follow-up, I know that things are pretty uncertain with the U.K. right now, but can you just help us understand, like, what are the next steps there? What do we track? Kind of, do you guys need a plan B? What are you hearing in terms of dropping travel restrictions in the U.K.? Thanks.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Ravi. I'm the London guy, so I'll take that.\nRavi Shanker: Lucky you.\nRobin Hayes: Yes, yes, I know. Look, I think you know the history, right? I mean, we've all been very frustrated that the corridor haven't opened. I mean, there's what no reason for opening, it's not data-driven because there's many other countries where there are lower vaccination rates that are open. So, we'll move on. We'll continue to sort of work that issue. We are going to fly. We do expect to successfully complete our ETOPS certification. We will continue with our first flight in August \u2013 August 11th. We will fly our schedule every day, per plan initially. There is a lot of sort of training events that go with this type of flying that we need to get through. So we will do that. And then as I sort of made in my remarks, it was a little bit tucked away and I probably butchered one or two of the words, but the plan is, we\u2019re looking at September [indiscernible] of weak September just to sort of bring down some of the flying and then we'll keep it \u2013 we'll continue to review on a month-by-month basis. There was news today that the U.K. will open for U.S. vaccinated travelers. I don't know if that's going to happen or not. We've been here so many times with potential good news that have been dashed. But we'll continue to stay flexible and we'll sort of match the capacity to the demand.\nRavi Shanker: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the time. Congratulations to all the new participants on the call. So two questions, one is congestion at these Northeast airports. And I'm kind of wondering about the decision to fly LaGuardia-Boston. As you think about those 12 flights a today in that market, is that really like the best thing to do with those aircraft? And can you make better use of those slots in routes that may have more business utility?\nJoanna Geraghty: Hey, Helane, thanks for the question. Our focus is always about putting our aircraft in the most margin-accretive routes. At this point in time, given the partnership with American Airlines, we believe that's the strongest use of those aircraft moving forward. Obviously, congested airport, as you noted, but it's congested for a reason, that's where the people are, and that's where they want to fly, and frankly, we view it as a smart investment. Obviously, some of this is dependent on the return of our business travel. So we're watching that very closely, but we've seen nothing in our bookings to suggest that business travel won't be coming back in the fall, but again we'll remain nimble as we need to.\nHelane Becker: Gotcha. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then one thing nobody talked about this time was the investment in Joby. And I guess they're getting ready to come public. So I don't know how you guys are thinking about that, what you're doing with that. Are you just going to keep that investment? Is there a point in time where you're going to monetize it? I don't know, any color you might want to give on that is\u2026\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. Maybe I'll just give a little comment. Ursula, feel free to add. We're very excited about that partnership. I'm not going to get into the details of their current potential public offering. But I will say, it's an important part of our strategy moving forward, particularly around eVTOL \u2013 electric takeoff and landing. I can't pronounce it correctly. And we're very excited about what that brings. I think you've seen a number of additional announcements from other carriers in the recent months. We very much believe that our partnership is much further advanced than where those announcements are, and excited about what they are going to bring to the future of that type of travel.\nHelane Becker: That's really great. Thanks very much, Joanna.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning, everyone. And congrats Ursula and Joe on your new positions. Quick one here to either Dave or Scott. When you look at your yields, I guess on a year-over-two-year basis, it looks like you're probably down maybe 10%, 11%, 12%, but then your stage length is up. And I don't know what it is up on a year-over-two-year basis. So on a stage length adjusted basis, are yields roughly flattish? Is that the right math?\nDavid Clark: Hi, Mike. Good morning, thanks for the question. We're really pleased with how both fares and yields are coming up. It really depends throughout the network. Since we've pivoted to a much more leisure-centric network over the past few quarters and for the summer, we're really pleased with where the yields are even if they are slightly below historical 2019 levels. To go one level deeper in some regions, like, especially transcon and the East, we are seeing yields to be higher and then other parts of the network, they're lower, but overall really pleased with the total result.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thanks, Dave. And then just my second question, just, Ursula in the non-op area, there is a $39 million, I guess, some of its interest income and then there is some sort of charge there. I'm not sure if that was called out in specials or if in the release. What is that?\nUrsula Hurley: Thanks, Mike, for the question. So there was a level of investment that we needed to put forth in order to pay down the $722 million term-loan.\nMike Linenberg: I see. All right, very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Baker with J.P. Morgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nRobin Hayes: Hi, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: Robin, morning, probably for you, just a couple of London-related technical questions. I know you've been operating some proving runs. I'm curious if that's mostly related to crew familiarization or if there are any aircraft performance issues you could share with us right now.\nRobin Hayes: No, so we had a three round trip of proving runs that is part of the FAA certification process and you should even assume the diversion to [indiscernible] which you probably saw was also part of that whole process. They went very well and we're very confident, our ability to \u2013 with the ETOPS authorization.\nJamie Baker: Okay. And a related follow-up, the configuration, I believe its 138 seats; correct me if I'm wrong. Is that dictated by the aircraft itself, given the range or is that the profit-maximizing configuration based on JetBlue's analysis? I'm just curious why 138 is the right configuration?\nRobin Hayes: What would you have done differently, Jamie? I'm just curious.\nJamie Baker: It's been too long for me to be able to answer that question.\nRobin Hayes: Yes. No. Yes, look, clearly, we've spent a lot of time with that \u2013 on that. As you know, when we launched Mint on transcon, we had a front cabin of 16, we spent a lot of time thinking through the optimization. We ended up where we are with 24 at the front and then the sort of the back takes care of itself. And we sort of look at the mix of even more and core. I would also say, because it's a newer airplane, the configuration does have a high level of flexibility if we want to change it in the future compared to the sort of traditional [indiscernible] airplane.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That'll do it for me. Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: See you, Robin. You bet.\nJoe Caiado: And that concludes our second quarter 2021 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: And again that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-04-27 17:47:11", "content": "Operator: Good morning, my name is Fate [ph]. I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue's Head of Treasury and Investor Relations, Ursula Hurley.

You will notice that change of voice, so Ursula congratulations on your new position and assuming the Investor Relations portfolio, also my thanks to Juan Carlos and Scott here in the room with me who are of our IR team. And also, obviously, we have to say farewell to David Fintzen, he's not leaving JetBlue, but Dave has done an amazing job as the Head of our IR team for many years, and like many leaders in JetBlue, he's been doing double duty for the best part of the year. So David is now leading our efforts as a VP of NEA, which is the - our partnership with American Airlines and David single-mindedly focused on delivering the benefits of the NEA in terms of growth and low fares for JetBlue and our customers. So Dave the very best in your new role as well. And as I said, we also have Andres Barry joining us on the call today as a new addition President of JetBlue Travel Products. So with that let's get on with the call again. Good morning everyone. And as we've done since the start of the pandemic, I'd like to take a moment to remember another crew member, we have lost to COVID-19. Alexander [ph] was a member of our JetBlue family for nearly a decade. Alex, joined us in October 2011 as a ground ops crew member in Tampa and our hearts go out to Alex's family, friends, and the fellow crew members that he worked with, as it does to all of us who have been impacted by COVID-19. I would now like to thank start by thanking our amazing 20,000 crew members for their extraordinary work through the most challenging time in our history. They continue to work together to serve our customers with just such incredible passion and determination. Our crew members have demonstrated our decisiveness as a team to overcome the many challenges presented by the pandemic while setting the foundation for JetBlue's recovery and future success. Starting with the presentation, let's move to slide 4. I'll start with an update on our ESG efforts, an area where JetBlue continues to lead the airline industry and generate value for our stakeholders. We are taking actions to reduce our impact on the environment and address societal changes and demand, mitigating business risks and enhancing our long-term financial plan. I'll provide an overview of the targets we announced last quarter. Starting with the environment. Our ultimate goal is to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040. Since last July, we achieved carbon neutrality for all domestic flying using carbon offsets, we've also set interim 2030 goals, which include reducing emissions per ASM by 25% from 2015 levels, converting 10% of our jet fuel to sustainable aviation fuels, and changing over half of our ground support equipment vehicles to electric. In the short term, we are investing in next-generation fuel-efficient aircraft to reduce our emissions and increase returns. Our technology venture subsidiary is positioning JetBlue to help us charter a path towards net zero emissions over the long term with investments in start-up companies like JB and Universal Hydrogen. Moving onto social, we're focused on empowering our crewmembers and protecting our talent pipeline through our enhanced diversity equity and inclusion strategy. The recent direct Chauvin verdict reminds us how George Floyd's murder has been a catalyst for change and over the past year we have examined - we have re-examined how we can help tackle systemic societal racism by focusing on diversity and equity at JetBlue. We have accelerated our effort towards building a more diverse slate of leaders and are creating greater access to select clear parts with our emerging talent platform including our new gateway college program. We are also committed to growing our spend with minority and women-owned businesses and we are ensuring our brand strategy enhances trust and build connections with customers and the diverse communities we serve. Lastly, regarding governance, we have embedded controls and increased our accountability with oversight from an ESG sub-committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, we recently incorporated ESG factors as performance measures into our senior leadership incentive compensation plan. Turning now to Slide 5. In the last quarter, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.48. Although our EPS remains in negative territory, we have seen meaningful progress in the demand recovery and have started to gain momentum from the groundwork we have laid to emerge from the crisis as a stronger JetBlue. Since mid-February, we have seen a meaningful in leisure travel, we are encouraged by the improving booking trends and with COVID-19 vaccination rolling out, we believe the ongoing demand acceleration will continue into the summer. We are bringing back capacity in response to demand, and we plan to capture a growing share of improving revenue from our customers in our leisure and VFR, visiting friends and family visiting friends and relatives markets. More importantly, we are taking a number of actions aimed to bring us back on powerful superior margins. Moving to Slide 6, looking back to our work from 2020, I could not be more confident in our future. Our teams continue executing our comprehensive recovery plan, reducing our cash burn, rebuilding our margins, and repairing our balance sheet. Starting with cash burn. We have seen positive cash from operations for March and this milestone is our first step towards achieving positive EBITDA and returning to profitability. We expect our improving operating results and balance sheet will support JetBlue over the coming months as leisure demand approaches pre-pandemic levels. To rebuild our margins we have been executing network, commercial, fleet cost, and capital allocation initiatives designed to help as we build our margins and repair our balance sheet. With respect to network, we are focused on strengthening our six focus cities and accelerating our recovery. We have taken advantage of unique opportunities that would have not have been available to us before the pandemic. We have also expanded and diversified our route map to better serve areas of relative demand strength and some markets will remain long-term strategic investments for JetBlue. In New York and Boston, we foresee a unique alliance with American Airlines that delivers low fares, a trusted brand, and outstanding service to more customers. Lastly, we will soon announce our inaugural flight to London bringing both our award-winning Mint and co-product and low fares in the Transatlantic market starting later this summer. Moving to the revenue front, we continue to implement our plan to improve our unit revenues over the coming years. I'll highlight three areas where we have made significant progress and Joanna will provide additional details in a couple of minutes. The first is our latest update of fare options, which provides our customers with more low fares. Secondly, we are in the contracting stages of our co-brand credit card RFP, which we expect will meaningfully enhance the economics of our loyalty program. Third, we are seeing momentum with JetBlue Travel Products. Over the last two months, JetBlue Vacations has performed well ahead of 2019 levels. We are very excited about last month's launch of Paisly, a new travel site that leverages smart technology to provide tailored offers to customers based on their individual itineraries. In its early days, we are already seeing great customer engagement, I believe this will be a significant contributor for future earnings growth. On the cost front, we remain committed to executing our plan, keep our costs low as capacity comes back, our low-cost business model enables us to compete with low fares while driving higher margins. We continue to reshape our fixed and variable cost base to provide a path to produce better than 2019 CASM, ex-fuel in 2022. Regarding fleet, our order book solely consists of next-generation aircraft that will help us execute our network plans while producing structurally better margins. We are thrilled that our first A220 entered into service yesterday. We've also started selling transcon flights on our first A321neo low-density aircraft and tomorrow, we expect to take delivery of our first A321 long-range aircraft, both aircraft type equipped with our incredible next-generation cabin. Lastly, we plan to maintain a balanced approach to our capital allocation, investing in aircraft that we've built on margins while reducing debt. Last quarter, we took a step towards optimizing our capital structure, reducing our overall cost of funding with a successful convertible debt offering. In conclusion, as we continue to navigate the challenges of the current year, we are so optimistic about our future, we will make the changes needed to weather the crisis while staying true to our mission and values and placing people and culture at the heart of our company. We have a truly great opportunity ahead of us and have laid the foundation to make JetBlue, a stronger airline for years to come. Joanna, over to you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. I'll start with my deepest thanks to our crew members for ensuring a safe operation as we ramp up capacity in response to accelerating demand. We are pleased that more people in the US have been vaccinated and quarantines and testing requirements for travel have been removed in the Northeast and other key locations across our network. We are setting up our operation accordingly to serve a growing number of customers returning to JetBlue. Moving to slide 8, in the first quarter, our revenue declined 61% a year over two, a six-point sequential improvement from the prior quarter sitting at the better end of our latest planning assumption. While we initially anticipated trends improving during the quarter, we saw a bigger than expected step-up in demand for leisure travel beginning in mid-February. Our cash revenue increased from $6 million per day in early January to $15 million by the end of March. Additionally, the length of our booking curve is now largely back at pre-pandemic levels as customers increasingly plan further ahead for their travel with JetBlue as expected first quarter average load factors finished at 64% and we ended the quarter with load factors in the mid-'70s. We are pleased with the broad improvement and demand across all of our geographies. Our Latin and Caribbean franchise again proved resilient and recovered quickly from the setback that followed the CDC orders requiring testing for international arrivals. Demand to our Florida markets increased driving the quarter and our Transcon region also strengthened as quarter - as quarantine measures relaxed in our East and West Coast focus cities. For the second quarter of 2021, our planning assumption for revenue is a decline between 30% and 35% year-over-two, the largest sequential improvement in our revenue since the pandemic started. We expect unit revenue to improve meaningfully driven by both increasing load factors and improving yields. Our system load factors have been in the mid '70s since the start of April, and we expect them to remain at that level or higher through the quarter. Based on forward bookings, we are optimistic about the upcoming summer months. In April, we have seen cash revenue average as high as $17 million per day. Our latest bookings and survey data show that customers are increasingly willing to take trips they have put off since last year. We are also seeing increasing attach rates for our JetBlue Vacations products which signals that leisure traffic is ramping up well. However, we will remain flexible given the potential for future restrictions that could slow down a return to travel. As Robin mentioned, we have continued to deploy initiatives to grow our unit revenues as capacity normalizes towards pre-pandemic levels. We updated our Fare Options platform to more competitively cater to price-sensitive customers with our Blue basic offering with in-flight product and changeability, Blue basic is now the best value proposition in the ultra-low fare segments. Our new Blue and Blue extra offerings also provide unique features such as guaranteed overhead bin space and flexibility addressing longstanding customer frustration. We estimate these updates will drive an approximate 1% increase in unit revenue in steady state. In addition, we continue to make progress with our new revenue management system. The value of these tools will become increasingly beneficial as industry wide demand recovers and load factors continue to rise. We also extended our booking window to 331 days, and have seen an immediate and significant booking impact following the rollout. In the medium term, we expect a meaningful increase in our revenue base from our network investments, and notably from our alliance with American Airlines. We also anticipate to start reaping the benefits of our investments in JetBlue Travel Products. So far this year, we have seen attach rates, gross sales bookings and margins at all-time highs. We believe this performance is a result of the product revamp we put in place in early 2020, our updated pricing strategy and significant advancements in merchandising and targeted marketing capabilities. Finally, we are getting ready to announce the outcome of our co-brand RFP. We believe this will help us close the gap in loyalty revenue to our peers over the next few years. We anticipate signing our revenue initiatives and the expected dollar contribution to earnings as our baseline revenue stabilizes over the next year. Turning to capacity on Slide 9. In the first quarter, our flown capacity declined 41% year-over-two. During the pandemic, we've been focused on balancing supply and demand through managing our capacity to maximize revenue and rebuild our margins. For the second quarter of 2021, our planning assumption is for capacity to decline approximately 15% year-over-two given the strong sequential improvement and demand. Our scheduled affirms through the end of June. Over the next few weeks, we plan to make some additional changes to manage the peaks and troughs for the rest of the summer. We are well-positioned to ramp our capacity in the coming months and expect only 10 aircraft from our fleet to remain in storage for the summer. Our thoughtful approach to offering crew members opt-out and voluntary time off programs early on during the pandemic has allowed us to remain nimble and help us scale back as demand normalizes. Over the past year, our crew members have continued to undergo training and are returning to work in numbers to scale up our operation and we are hiring in specific areas to address rapidly increasing demand. We will of course maintain our flexibility to scale utilization up or down as needed while protecting the financial health of JetBlue. In terms of markets, we are very pleased with our VFR and leisure performance. This quarter, we added service to Miami and Key West, which further expands our relevance in South Florida. Two weeks ago we operated our first flight to Guatemala City and in mid-June, we plan to launch our inaugural flight to Los Cabos, Mexico. We're making great progress implementing our Northeast alliance with American Airlines, which we expect will provide a path for JetBlue to grow profitably over the coming years and to better utilize scarce infrastructure at New York and Boston airports. We launched code-sharing in late February and announced a further expansion last week. Our customers are benefiting from new destinations, improved schedules, more frequencies, and of course more low fares. To date, the NII has announced a total of 58 new markets, 32 flown by JetBlue, and we are looking forward to additional announcements in the future. Through the alliance, both JetBlue and American will have new growth opportunities in the Northeast. For example, we expect to triple our flights at LaGuardia Airport from 16 flights per day prior to the pandemic to more than 50 by the summer of 2022, notably we expect to reach our largest ever number of flights in New York later this year. Our customers will benefit from more than just a greatly expanded network and more low fares. For our JBLU members, we will offer the ability to earn points and redeem travel on American and we are currently working to establish reciprocal benefits between our loyalty programs. I will close with a big thank you to the many JetBlue teams who are working tirelessly to ramp up the operation and serve our customers. While we are pleased with demand returning so quickly, we acknowledge the tremendous hard work, the team put in over the past two months. Thank you for remaining true to our values and setting the foundation for our future success. With that, over to you, Steve.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Joanna, and good morning everyone. I'd also like to thank our crew members and leaders. I could not be prouder of their resilience to overcome the challenges presented by the pandemic and to ensure the future success of JetBlue. I'll start on Slide 11 with a brief overview of our financial results for the quarter. Revenue was $733 million, down 61% year-over-two; operating expenses were down 43% year-over-two excluding the benefit from PSP2, operating expenses were down 26% year-over-two; adjusted EBITDA loss was $458 million and GAAP loss per share was $0.78 and adjusted loss per share was $1.48. As Robin mentioned in March, we reached breakeven cash from operations and we took the first step towards repairing our balance sheet. Starting with our operational performance, our first quarter adjusted EBITDA was ahead of the range we anticipated in mid-March. This was a result of improving revenue trends and continue to successfully manage our cost structure despite increasing fuel prices. For the second quarter, we estimate our EBITDA will range between negative $100 million and negative $200 million reflecting an acceleration of demand partly offset by cost pressures from fuel prices and airport rents and landing fees. On an EBITDA basis, we will believe that we will reach breakeven in the third quarter and expect to remain in positive territory through the end of the year. Turning to Slide 12, we are managing through the volatile demand environment with a laser focus on cost control as we bring that capacity to meet demand. During the first quarter, our adjusted operating expenses declined 26% year-over-two better than our initial assumptions and despite higher fuel prices. This excludes the payroll benefit of $299 million from PSP2. Our planning assumption for the second quarter is a reduction in our total operating expenses of approximately 8% year-over-two. This quarter-over-quarter increase of 18 points is primarily due to scheduled increases in capacity as we ramp up the operations to serve customers during the summer. As we navigate the current environment, we will continue to manage our cost structure while mitigating near-term headwinds namely higher fuel prices, rents and landing fees, maintenance and labor cost driven by the scaleup. We are pleased as a result of our aggressive cost management, we are starting to see CASM, ex-fuel declining meaningfully from 41% year-over-two in the first quarter to 17% in the second quarter. Moving to Slide 13, since the start of the pandemic, we have gone deep on our cost structure with a focus on our fixed cost base adding to the continued momentum from our Structural Cost Program. We expect to achieve better than 2019 CASM, ex-fuel in 2022, providing a path to expand our EBITDA and ultimately our pre-tax margins. Last quarter, we announced our plan to reduce our 2021 fixed costs between $150 million and $200 million compared to 2019. We intend to preserve these savings as we get capacity back to pre-pandemic levels. Our work focusses on five key areas, one, driving automation and evolving our technology to improve processes and support functions, two, driving efficiencies in our IT infrastructure for example by consolidating our data centers and moving data and applications into the cloud, three, consolidating our real estate footprint in both support centers and airports, four, continue to rationalize our business partners spend, and, five, remaining disciplined and limiting our discretionary spend. Regarding our variable costs, we continue to focus on driving efficiencies and productivity across the business as we bring back our frontline crew members to support the operational ramp-up. We expect to continue to see the run rate savings associated with our Structural Cost Program and we will continue to execute our plan to increase our fuel efficiency. For the rest of 2021, we expect some headwinds related to maintenance as we approach 2019 capacity levels, a continuation of higher rents and landing fees in our airports as well as some inflationary headwinds. I would like to thank our teams again for their hard work and engagement to rebuild our margins as we execute our revenue and cost initiatives. Now, turning to liquidity on Slide 14. At the end of March, our unrestricted cash and short-term investments were $3.2 billion or 40% of 2019 revenue. Given our strong liquidity and improving revenue trends, we are switching our focus to repairing our balance sheet and lowering our total cost of debt. In March, we successfully executed a $750 million convertible debt offering with a coupon of 0.5%. We partially used these funds to pay down our $550 million revolver facility. In the first quarter, we also received over $500 million from the second round of payroll support from the federal government to support the salaries, wages and benefits of our crew members. We expect to receive an additional $76 million in the forthcoming days related to PSP2. We are grateful to the administration for their continued support of our industry and for crew member jobs. We remain very comfortable with our liquidity position. Given our expectation for recovery through 2021 and continued support from the federal government, at this time, we do not intend to draw down on the remaining $1.8 billion available to us under the CARES Loan Act program. As a result, our loyalty program remains our most valuable unencumbered asset. In the event we need additional liquidity, we believe we can act as attractive and competitive financing in various markets. Moving to Slide 15, in the first quarter we took delivery of three A321neos including our first aircraft with our reimagined Mint cabin. The fleet currently stands at 270 aircraft and we expect to take delivery of six additional shelfs during the second quarter including two A320s, two A321neos and two A321LRs. We continue to forecast approximately $1 billion in capex spend for 2021, the majority of which consists of aircraft, which we expect to fund using cash. As the first A220 enters into service, we are particularly excited about the outstanding economics it provides with 30% better cost efficiency per seat compared to our A190. We expect to take 59 additional deliveries through the middle of the decade including seven this year. We believe this fleet will be pivotal to helping us reshape our cost structure and growing our margins. Moving to Slide 16 at the end of March, our debt to cap ratio was 59%, a small increase from the prior quarter, driven by the opportunistic convertible debt offering we made in March to pay down the revolving credit facility and lower cost of funding. Going forward as we produce positive cash from operations, we plan to prioritize paying down high-cost debt with the goal of reducing our weighted average cost of debt to below pre-pandemic levels. We also intend to continue strategic and measured approach to return to investment grade metrics and debt to cap ratio of between 30% and 40%. We believe as we grow back our amazing culture will continue to power our strategy. We are confident that our network and commercial initiatives, cost reduction efforts and long-term investments will put us back on a path to superior margins. On behalf of the JetBlue leadership team, we want to again thank our crew members as well as our business partners, our communities and our owners for all of their support. With that, we will now take your questions.\nUrsula Hurley: Thank you, Robin, Joanna, and Steve. Fate, we're now ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Savi Syth from Raymond James, your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hi, everybody. I'm just kind of curious as especially on the cost side, what the expectations are kind of embedded behind your EBITDA outlook for the second half of '21. Just wondering if there are some ramp-up costs that go away and generally, what you expect from a demand standpoint.\nSteve Priest: Hi, good morning, Savi, Steve here. It's a good question. I think the first thing I would say is obviously in a high fixed cost capital-intensive business with capacity down even 15% that continues to be inherent inefficiencies in the cost structure, but as you start to continue to grow capacity that alleviates over time, we are continuing from a, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, in terms of cost structure as we grow to drive more efficiency. So if you think about Q1 to Q2, our capacity is up 50% quarter-over-quarter, but our non-fuel costs are only going up 22%, so you have got those inherent efficiencies as you scale back, but I'm sure some of the essence of your question is regarding some of the headwinds that we've discussed. Obviously, as we embed the fixed cost initiatives that we are working through in 2021, we will continue to see efficiencies associated with that. Certainly, there are some material inefficiencies and will remain in the second quarter, until we scale back. Think about the likes of pilot minimums in terms of hours, which are obviously additionally impacted by the CARES Act, and thirdly as we get ready for the summer, we are incurring some costs as we ramp up the summer peak, think about some crew member cost associated labor and maintenance to make sure that we have, the fleet rather, and then as we've always talked about rents and landing fees. I think you'll start to see some alleviation in that when industry traffic continues to normalize because with them, particularly those cities that I've seen a precipitous drop in traffic, they have been impacted quite clearly and again when that normalizes, you'll see some sort of rationalization of costs. So there's a number of areas that I think will become more efficient as we navigate through the rest of the year and the business ultimately scales up.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful color, Steve. Thank you. And, Joanna, if I might quickly ask on the, you mentioned that the majority of the new markets are performing in line to better than expected. Just curious if there are any common trends or characteristics in the new routes that are working versus those, you have to kind of pull back on.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, thanks Savi, great question. I think the two trends. I'd say leisure is obviously performing well in those jurisdictions and locations where there are travel restrictions in place and-or higher case counts tend to lag, some of the other markets that we're seeing performance in, but overall very pleased with the performance of the new markets that we've added, very encouraged there will be some that will be lasting markets, we've also, as we always do, we've been pretty disciplined in the markets in underperforming and making sure that we scale those back.\nSavi Syth: Thanks, all. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, folks. I assume you have pretty detailed financial forecasts, at least for the first year or two of the Transatlantic expansion. Can you compare how those forecasts are looking today to what they were in early 2020, obviously the Heathrow outcome might be different than what you had planned pre COVID, but I'm curious if your overall Atlantic forecasts have strengthened and if so, by how much?\nRobin Hayes: Hey, Jamie. Good morning, it's Robin and I'm going to ask Scott to take that one.\nJamie Baker: Great.\nScott Laurence: Hey, Jamie. I appreciate the question. And obviously, the Transatlantic has seen quite a bit of change here. I think the first thing I would say is that we have a strong fundamental offering here and the ability to disrupt the premium cabin is something that we feel very confident that we're going to be able to do. I think if you sort of look at the Transatlantic vis-a-vis what we expected pre-COVID, it's clear that the initial portion of this is still going to be in a recovery mode. I think for us, we had based our business plan around the concept of people actually paying their own money to sit in business class rather than, people looking at the fares that historically been somewhat extortionate with corporate discounting in the front-cabin. So again, I think if you look overall at our forecast and our potential as we move forward, I think it is, continues to be very strong and it continues to be very similar to what we initially expected and we look to move forward confidently as we begin Transatlantic service.\nJamie Baker: Okay, that's helpful. And then second, a few years ago the LaGuardia perimeter rule was a topic, JetBlue publicly objected to a potential relaxation of the rule, if I recall, but if we fast forward to today, I mean your fleet capabilities have obviously expanded, you've got the relationship at LaGuardia with American, I mean is perimeter something you've discussed with American. Are you permitted to and could it be part of the evolution in the relationship at LaGuardia?\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Jamie, I'll take that. And first of all, as is the tradition on our April call that we are very happy about the week.\nJamie Baker: Thank you, Robin.\nRobin Hayes: But, no-look, our view on that hasn't changed. I mean, whilst our alliance with American has allowed us to make some positive changes in our LaGuardia footprint, it's still a very, very fraction of our largest competitor there, the new airports work as an ecosystem and we are talking about making some significant investments through our partners at JFK and as such that if the appointment of Woolworths to ever be modified or changed, it's our view that would need to come with a significant slot divestiture, to make sure that sort of new ecosystem, continue to work together.\nJamie Baker: Okay, fair enough. Thanks for the update. Appreciate it. Take care.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hi, thanks, good morning. Joanna, you talked about co-brand economics improving, and I think you said, closing the gap between your earnings and peer earnings over the next few years. I just want to understand kind of what the expectations are, in 2019 you guys reported about $200 million in fee revenue from the card, Alaska reported $465, is it your expectation that you can close that gap within a few years.\nJoanna Geraghty: Hi, Joe, thanks for the question. Yes, I mean we're very encouraged by what we're seeing with the results of the co-brand RFP as Robin mentioned in his opening remarks, we are in the middle of contract negotiations with the finalist and I describe it as a meaningful improvement over existing economics of our deal and we'll be prepared to discuss more in the coming weeks.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, that's helpful. And then, Steve, just on the CASM expectation for improving CASM on the same level of capacity, can you talk about maybe what's working against you and you take into account that structural cost initiatives, and just kind of having that capacity production with a leaner organization. What are some of the headwinds kind of moving against you all? Thank you.\nSteve Priest: Yes. Thank you and good morning, Joe. It really just goes back to a couple of the things in the relatively short-term, I just discussed with Savi. I think that in an industry like ours, high fixed cost capital intensive even short levels of capacity reductions, so of have a headwind. I think as we sort enter 2022, undoubtedly rents and landing fees are sorts of a key aspect, in terms of a headwind that needs to sort of normalized, general labor and price inflation of other items that we need to sorts of think about as we sort of go through and on the assumption that we continue to get the fleet and we work forward as we go through 2021, by making sure that our maintenance is in good shape as we sort of get through the year, but obviously outside of those three areas, as we get into 2022, there is a whole host of work that we completed coming into the 2020 year around the structural cost program that will meaningfully change the paradigm from a variable standpoint and the $150 million to $200 million of fixed cost initiatives, which I have outlined in our prepared comments, which will also offset some of those cost pressures.\nJoseph DeNardi: Helpful. Thank you.\nSteve Priest: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess for Robin or Steve or Joanna. Can you talk to your ability to get back to 2019 profitability levels or not or maybe even exceed it like you had in the prior plan, what are the proper threshold here, do you guys need to get back to where you were from a capacity standpoint, then see value recover, are there other levers that you guys can pull?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Brian and good to hear from you this morning, Steve here. I would sort of go back a little bit in the way back time machine and think about how we were coming into 2020 with our $2.50 to $3 of EPS and the five building blocks that would be high in the whole of our business from a commercial cost fleet, capital allocation perspective and as we've gone through the pandemic, not only have we looked from a defensive standpoint, but we've also been on the offense. So, I've talked extensively about our cost structure both in the structured cost standpoint really focusing around the variable efficiencies, but also on the fixed side, so also put that to one side. The fleet initiatives very much stand in good stead. And as Robin referred to, we took our first A220 yesterday, incredibly excited about the potential economics being added to JetBlue, as we go forward from a margin standpoint, in addition to the 321neos which are going to continue to ramp in the fleet. And then, as a whole host of revenue initiatives that we're driving forward with, Joanna talked about the co-brand RFP, we've talked about the Northeast alliance that we are incredibly excited about which will continue to drive lower fares and growth for the Northeast with American Airlines partnership, you think about the revenue management initiatives that we sort of are driving in place and then incredibly exciting travel confident we're developing with JetBlue Travel Products and the great work that Andres is going for. So when you think about costs, you think about commercial, you think about fleet and the acceleration that we've taken place with regards to balance sheet repair and capital allocation, I feel very optimistic about the future margin capabilities of JetBlue, as we evolve into next year and beyond.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate that was. And I guess, Joanna, as a quick follow-up. I think the restrictions in the Northeast and specifically in New York have been lifted in fact, I don't think get addressed by the government anymore getting off a plane. So have you seen any pent-up demand in these regions and could revenue be exceeding to the upside here as people realize that it's a lot easier now?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. I mean, it's a great question. We were very pleased to see the Northeast restrictions come off and I think that's giving us some wind in our sales, as we step into the summer timeframe. Overall, the network is performing well across multiple geographies, which has been fantastic for us particularly step into the summer in our peak travel period, so very encouraged by New York, we are encouraged by Massachusetts, also encouraged by the Caribbean, frankly and what we're seeing down there the Bahamas updated their guidance last week. So, that's all the news and we continue to encourage the islands to kind of work in a coordinated fashion to reopen in a safe thoughtful way that makes it easier for customers to travel there.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Helane Becker - sorry, Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody and thanks for the time. on the new guidance that you're giving for the second quarter, I know this is a short-term question, but how should we think about the percentage that traffic improvement versus the percentage that's fares improvement, in other words, is there opportunity to raise fares as demand increases here through the summer.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thanks, Helane. A great question, if you think about it, in terms of 50-50. I think the good news for the summer is we're growing TRASM while we're growing ASMs and that's being driven by double-digit improvements in both load factor and in yield. I'll also point out that the booking curve is normalizing which is giving Dave, Clark and his team and ability to better yield manage our flights. So that's been a great change as well.\nHelane Becker: Okay, thank you. I think - I think that with that. Those were my like two questions. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thank you. Good morning. A question for Robin, if you're still around or maybe more of an industry question. The EU commentary on letting vaccinated US passengers travel to Europe, what did we actually learn, I guess this weekend, what do you view as the next steps from a US perspective and how would you handicap the odds of this getting implemented in time to book summer travel.\nRobin Hayes: Yes, Duane, thanks. Where do you think, I went, know by the way, do you think?\nDuane Pfennigwerth: You're doing a good job of deferring and delegating.\nRobin Hayes: Well, it's a team sport, isn't it?\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Fair enough.\nRobin Hayes: Anyway, no, no, look it was a positive development and I think it's, I just want to build on what Joanna just said because I think we are seeing this now in more and more markets. We started seeing in the domestic market as states are starting to move some of the restrictions, we started to see it in some of the Caribbean markets as they sort of figure out what works and doesn't work and trying to strike that right balance between public health and making markets accessible and there's a number of EU countries as you know where tourism is a significant driver and so I'm confident, look I think it ultimately depends on the country's ability to bring down their case count and vaccinate people because that's what gives you a sense that sort of from the case count reductions are permanent. What we've seen here in the US and other markets as case count start to come up again restrictions go back in, that definitely impacts traffic and so I think providing the EU and the countries in EU can kind of catch-up with their vaccination program, hopefully that makes the summer open and accessible and if I look at the UK because obviously, that's the top of our list they've done a terrific job with the vaccines and I think they are really on track to some form of opening up here for the summer.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then if you're willing to comment on it, a question for the team, what percent of capacity would you envision pointed at Europe in the fourth quarter and then how do we think about that balance of growth longer term. So in other words, is it, is domestic a priority, until you get back to full 2019 levels or how should we be thinking about it kind of '22, '23 that balance of growth between domestic in Europe.\nRobin Hayes: Well, I'm going to deflect that to Scott, do I need I could think - I could give you a very good answer.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nScott Laurence: Team sport indeed. So again, I think if you look at Europe, for us it's going to be de minimis. In terms of the ASMs as a percent of the system, it really is limited. So I think that's the first thing that I would lay out there, again in the near future you're looking at six LRs that are coming in, they just do not produce enough ASMs to be to really push up the chart. In terms of domestic versus international, I think this continues to evolve for us, we were very concerned when we saw the testing come in for international, we've seen particularly in the Caribbean region that has recovered nicely, and so as we go forward, I think you're going to see a balance of growth for domestic versus international that has looked kind of like it has historically for us. So again, we're in the midst of a leisure-oriented recovery, I think that we are built for leisure, we're excited about that. I think that actually plays right into our strengths and as we allocate growth going forward, I think that mix of domestic, international is going to be what's optimal for us in the short to medium term.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Maybe if I could sneak one more in, can you speak to start-up costs that you're incurring here in June quarter, September quarter for the Europe launch, and thanks for taking the questions.\nScott Laurence: So again, I think as we look at this, as we went through the crisis, we did not lay people off and I think while we want to make sure that we are leading the burden and what is optimal as possible. I don't think you're going to see a significant impact from that as we go forward, and I think again as we look at the summer and the fall, we look forward to getting airplanes up in the air and doing so in a way that has our customers happy.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good morning everyone, thanks for the time. So, maybe first a question for Joanna just about the RASM drivers, you laid out. Completely understand you'll need to wait to give more details on the co-brand agreement until the contract is finalized, but just high-level, should we think about that as the largest of the three RASM drives versus the additional fare option uptick and the JetBlue Travel Products impact.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thanks. Great question, Cath, sorry my mic was off, apologies. Thanks for your question. So, I would, we're going to go out with firm numbers as we start seeing a more stable revenue environment. Clearly, the co-brand card is a significant contributor, their options 1.0 2.1, we've already communicated is one point of unit revenue and then some of the work in the Travel Products world we're calling about 100 EBIT based upon what we said in 2018 investor meetings and so that is on track, I mean, we're optimistic that we are going to hit those numbers. I would not underestimate the contribution of the American Airlines NEA agreements or frankly some of the smaller initiatives, the 331 scheduled changes or the new revenue management changes. So overall, we're encouraged by the momentum behind these initiatives, they are unique to JetBlue, we will be prepared to give greater detail in the coming months, as the revenue environment stabilizes. Co-brand is a significant contributor in line with some of the other larger initiatives.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, got it. And then, maybe a second question for Steve. So you guys noted that the first priority for cash flow when it turns positive is paying down high-cost debt, can you talk about what opportunities you have to delever over the next couple of years, maybe bolstered scheduled payments or any opportunities to prepay that and then how do you think about pacing those opportunities. Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Yes, good morning, Caty. It's a good question. We've been very measured and strategic as we've gone through the last sort of 12 to 15 months going through and not only have, we had an eye on bringing liquidity and cash into JetBlue, but based on the facilities that we have used to bring cash into JetBlue, we saw very much in terms of not only rates but sorts of China as well as we've gone through it. So we do have a number of opportunities based on how we go forward. I mean, I'm delighted that we are generating positive cash from ops in March and going forward bring that in a good position, we obviously have the PSP2 to top up and PSP3 coming. And so we are going to take every opportunity to pay down the debt and ultimately reduce the weighted average cost of debt. Coming into the pandemic, our weighted average cost of debt was in the high threes, it's sitting around four now, and as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we expect our weighted average cost of debt over the forthcoming months to actually be at a level that's lower than where it was coming into the pandemic. So, I feel not only incredibly comfortable with where our liquidity sits and the strength of the balance sheet, but also in terms of driving down financing costs as JetBlue goes forward.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, good morning everyone. Joanna, if I can just follow up on the previous response on RASM, I completely appreciate that the current environment is really messy. But given the initiatives you have with international and ventures and core bank card nevertheless, kind of much like the detail, you've given us on the CASM side in terms of thinking about '22 related to '19, can you comment or do you have really good confidence that '22 RASM can be in comfortably above 2019 given that idiosyncratic advantage that you have.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, so good question. We're not in a position right now specifically to the revenue initiatives to break out exactly where they are. As we said, we'll do that at a later date. What I would say about 2022 however is we are encouraged by what we're seeing this summer and if we believe that carries into the fall and into the winter, we are optimistic that 2022 has the potential to be a strong recovery year, leisure has led the recovery, we believe there is still pent-up demand for travel that will carry into the fall. If you look at GDP growth in 2022 versus 2019, it's four points higher and frankly, we think travelers have extra savings and with the access to the vaccine there will be additional locations opening up, you add that to our series of revenue initiatives and we think that 2022 could be a strong recovery year. The other piece, I'll mention is, if you think about JetBlue and how we're positioned, a trusted brand, unbelievable crew members committed to our success, a great product, largely domestic leisure with a history of serving these markets is what we do to coastal markets, our network, we think this is going to serve us very well for our recovery year.\nRavi Shanker: Got it, thank you. And maybe as a follow-up, a longer-term question on the venture side, obviously you are a leader and kind of investing in NSA and coming to be using that for your ESG targets, but the hydrogen investment was pretty interesting, it kind of caught my eye, can you share a little more light on, kind of what you're thinking there, kind of what you are thinking there, kind of how you think hydrogen fits into your long-term fuel plans.\nRobin Hayes: Great question, maybe I'll take that. I'll try and be brief because I could talk about this topic of ours. I think certainly JetBlue takes the view that the sustainability of our industry as we come out of the pandemic will be an extremely critical topic and something that we need to demonstrate and our continued commitment to reduce our carbon emissions in order to continue to earn the right to grow. So over the short to medium term, we are very focused on areas like sustainable aviation fuel and continuing to try to work with the US government on more efficient air traffic control procedures, as you know, JetBlue is investing billions of dollars in more fuel-efficient airplanes. We are aggressively replacing our ground equipment with much greener, electric ground equipment. But for airlines to make a reach some of the longer-term aspirations around zero net carbon and do it in a way that doesn't rely on offsets, which we clearly just view as a bridging strategy, we have to consider alternative types of aviation - alternative ways of powering aviation, so we stay close to the electric plant industry, I think we will recognize that. I think over at least over the next couple of decades is going to be confined to smaller airplanes over shorter distances, but we are intrigued Airbus has made similar comments as well about the ability for hydrogen to provide a sort of a longer-term cleaner fuel option. And so this is why we have our Tech Ventures, a subsidiary, it's allowed us to get smarter on these things, and we have a real focus at JT at the moment on considering investments in the sustainable aviation space.\nRavi Shanker: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Good morning, everybody. Thank you. How are you guys thinking about the fall after kids get back into school, obviously not looking for any revenue or capacity guidance or anything like that, but how do you think about a good case scenario and a bad case scenario in terms of just sort of how your consumers behave.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, thanks Hunter and then I'll let Dave, Clark add some color. So I think we're still in a pandemic, and so we're very mindful of that. While we are - as we've said we are encouraged by what we're seeing stepping into the summer. We also don't know what we don't know. And so that's sort of at the heart of our comments around remaining nimble and flexible with how we manage capacity stepping into the fall timeframe. We do believe based upon what we're seeing that there will continue to be pent up leisure demand and Dave will get into a bit on what we're seeing on the corporate side, but we're cautiously optimistic that assuming there aren't any increase in travel restrictions, that the vaccine continues to take a hold on the case counts, stabilize or come down. The fall has the potential to be good for JetBlue, it's obviously a trough period historically for us. As we think about the holidays and customers that have not had a chance to visit their families over the Christmas Hanukkah holidays, Thanksgiving we think that has an opportunity to be a very strong, strong period for us. Dave, do you want to add some color on the corporate side?\nDave Clark: Sure. Thanks, Joanna. And I agree, I think the fall is actually the trickiest period to forecast right now. We know leisure is holding up well, but the leisure demand base in general in the fall is lowest compared and at the time of the year. So your question is, how quickly will business and corporate ramp back up, just we've been seeing good growth in these areas, but off a quite low base early in January, our year over two corporate travel is still down about 95%. It's been improving, we're now down minus 80% or so in terms of bookings, so good improvement but off a low base, as we stay close and talk with our largest customers, we do expect to see a phased approach as we go through the summer especially returning to office in late summer, early fall and we expect to really accelerate travel. I mean the September-October timeframe, but exactly when that occurs and how robust comes back is something that we're still looking at very closely as we think about fall revenue and capacity.\nHunter Keay: All right, thank you. And then, Steve, just, just to flush out the cost commentary, a little more for '22, as we think about CASM. On the P&L, as you guys reported what do you think, which single line item on a unit cost basis has the best prospects of being below 2019 and which one you think is going to be the toughest.\nSteve Priest: Thanks, Hunter, good morning. I think the toughest and the one that we're keeping at as the cases control on, the case its focused on should I'd say is really around rents and landing fees because that has continued to be one of the headwinds for the industry and as we've mentioned that specifically, we'll have to see how that evolves. I think from a positive standpoint I would suggest distribution, I think the commercial team has done some tremendous work over the last few years in terms of driving our direct strategy, also looking through the lens of the business partners in terms of how we think about the cost of sale, not only in terms of sales but also servicing for our customers and really using automation and driving our direct proposition. So, on the negative side and the positive side we've got running phase and on the positive side to being our cost of sales and distribution.\nHunter Keay: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. Steve, just in terms of your 30% to 40% debt to cap goal what timeframe do you think you can achieve that in, and just more importantly, do you think this is a goal that you can get to organically or do you think there needs to be some other form of capital raise to get there.\nSteve Priest: Hey, Andrew, good, good morning and great question. So we talked about it there. I'm really, again, very pleased and delighted that we started generating positive cash from operations in March and also, we've sort of taken the momentum as we've gone through this and been very appreciative of the administration for the support, they've given the industry. We've always said it, we expected it to be between the 2023 year and the 2024 year. So that's why we sort of thinking about getting back into that situation. We came into the pandemic with the second strongest balance sheets in the industry, we continue to be in that place. We continue - I mean, we'll see how things evolve, but I would anticipate based on generating positive cash from ops, also going through the position that we've been through, I've been happy with the market transactions we've done, I expect this to be through organic means, but I won't get ahead of myself and 2023, 2024 is quite a way off, but that's I can't be working and planning assumption at the moment.\nAndrew Didora: Great, thank you. And then just my second is just a quick follow-up. Apologies, if I missed this, but just your comments on getting back to 2019 or better CASM levels in 2022, have you said what level of capacity you're assuming next year relative to 2019. Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Yes, so it's back at sort of '29ish levels of capacity, so that's a level that we talked about.\nAndrew Didora: 2019, okay, thank you. So you've got 2019 behind.\nSteve Priest: I'm sorry, 2019.\nAndrew Didora: Understood. Thank you.\nSteve Priest: It must be the British accent, apologize for that.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning everyone. Joanna, you brought this up and maybe you or Dave just about the move to 331 days in the booking window, what was it before. And presumably, this is graduations, weddings, family reunions, maybe people who book cruises out nine, 10 months, a less price-sensitive segment. Is that's the pickup there or is there something else related?\nDave Clark: Hi, Mike, this is Dave Clark. I'll take that one.\nMike Linenberg: Hi, Dave.\nDave Clark: Previously, we were selling between seven to 10 months of schedule sort of on a seasonal block basis and now we're consistently at 20, 21 days, and you're right on the type of traffic that books 10 or 11 months in advance, these are big events either family events, big milestones, things, where the trip and getting the reservation booked is important, getting it booked ahead of time, the most important parts of the customer, so we're happy to be able to take more of that traffic, put some revenue on earlier in the booking curve and generally, yes, it's not as price-sensitive as closer in traffic.\nMike Linenberg: Dave, have you thought, I know there is at least one carrier, I can think of that's now gone beyond the 331 and with the cruise industry saying that people are now booking out more than a year, have you and because you guys are big in Fort Lauderdale, have you thought about actually extending it so that type of passenger or is it just too far out?\nDave Clark: I think for now, we're really pleased with where we are, it's only been a couple of months and the municipal results are good. So, we'll keep our eyes in the future, no short-term plans.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up on the fleet. I think it was mentioned that this summer, you only have 10 aircraft in storage, but if we look at the fleet that's operating through the summer. How does the utilization compare versus what it was back in 2019, I mean if you have sort of a block hour per day in summer '21 versus 2019? Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, thanks for the question. So we're slightly below 2019 levels at this point, we expect them to approach closer to 2019 as we step into the summer time frame, a little bit lower but getting back there.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thanks.\nMike Linenberg: Thanks, Joanna. Thanks, Dave.\nOperator: Your next question is from Myles Walton from UBS. Your line is open.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering if you could comment in the context of the down 15% capacity and down 30% to 35% year-over-two what LatAm Caribbean looks like versus 2019, I mentioned, those are probably trending above 2019 levels. And if you think you are disproportionately benefiting from lockdowns elsewhere in the world, if these kinds of gains become more sustainable on a go-forward basis in leisure destinations that you currently serve.\nDave Clark: Hi, Myles, this is Dave Clark. I'll take that one. The LatAm and Caribbean region has been at the very top end of our strong performing regions both from a revenue and a capacity standpoint. If you look ahead of our selling schedules, we actually have capacity to that region up year-over-two in July and August reflecting the strong demand and performance there.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And then could you give a little bit more specific on the PSP3 cash that you're going to get in this current quarter, Steve. Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Yes, so thanks to sort of the administration. If you think about it from a US industry standpoint, PSP2 was around $15 billion, PSP3 is $14 billion for the industry. So you're talking low 90% versus the PSP2 numbers. So should be in the ballpark for JetBlue around $500 million and obviously...\nMyles Walton: Thank you.\nSteve Priest: There is a blend of grants and loans embedded in that.\nMyles Walton: Yes.\nOperator: Our last question is from Dan McKenzie from Seaport Global. Your line is open.\nDaniel McKenzie: Thanks for squeezing me in here. A couple of questions. I appreciate the corporate demand is pretty depressed right now, but regarding the relationship with American, are there any examples of accounts that you've already talked to jointly and whether or not you've seen any corporate wins and so I guess I'm just trying to get some perspective on - are these smaller fortunate accounts or are they say Fortune 100 accounts, the bigger ones and just related to that, what is the cumulative collective corporate spend that you've been blocked from historically that you could potentially tap into for the first time.\nScott Laurence: So, this is Scott. I will say that we're early enough and that we're still sort of working through the process to handle joint sales and again I think the goal here is to make sure that we're providing competition in our case lower fares and a great experience to customers in the NEA market. So, I think it's something we're going to be rolling out here in the short term and we look forward to working jointly with our partner on that and I think again providing appropriate competition in a number of the markets, particularly in New York that we haven't played in previously.\nDaniel McKenzie: And that collective spend is at $10 billion, $15 billion potentially that you could, the wallet you're looking to tap into.\nScott Laurence: So we're kind of looking at each other here, I think we'll follow up on that. I have a good answer for you.\nDaniel McKenzie: Okay. Second question here. The new flying in the first quarter I think it was 15% of the total flying, what percent of that flying was in support of the new American partnership and what percent of the overall network does the American relationship cover.\nScott Laurence: So the relationship itself covers about 66% of our network which touches sort of any airports and that number has grown a little bit as we move forward. So you're going to see as we're able to enter LaGuardia based upon the NEA that number comes up a bit. So a big chunk of what we added, it was either added associated with the NEA or in anticipation of the NEA. So a number of the markets we're able to provide competition, whether that's in New York with the dominant carrier there, at LaGuardia with the dominant carrier there. I think what we're doing is sort of enjoying the benefits of breaking up a number of monopolies here and I think that's something that can work for us as we're playing the role of a disrupter.\nDaniel McKenzie: Very good, thanks.\nUrsula Hurley: And that concludes our first quarter 2021 conference call. Thank you all for joining us this morning and we hope you all have a great day.\nOperator: And again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 4, "year": 2020, "date": "2021-01-28 16:57:06", "content": "Operator: Good morning, my name is Mel, and I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue's VP of Investor Relations, David Fintzen. Please go ahead.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, Mel. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. This morning we issued our earnings release, our investor update and a presentation we'll reference during this call. All those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and have been filed with the SEC. Joining me here in New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Priest, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A are Scott Laurence, Head of Revenue and Planning and Dave Clark, VP of Sales and Revenue Management. This morning's call includes forward-looking statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors and therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on these statements. For additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ from the forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release, 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC. Also during the course of our call, we may discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. I hope you're doing okay. As we've done in previous earnings calls, since the pandemic began, I would like to pause and remember lost crew members; one of the 10 we have now lost to COVID-19. Garrett Gan [ph] was part of our ground operations team at JFK since 2005 and his teammates will remember him for his kindness, his passion and warmth, and his willingness to always go above and beyond. Our thoughts go out to Garrett's family and friends, to all of our crew members that knew him and also everyone so impacted by this pandemic. Now, I'd like to recognize our 20,000 crew members for their unwavering commitment to serve our customers. 2020 was a year like no other. And as the COVID-19 pandemic challenged our industry in ways we have never seen before. Our crew members rose to the occasion and delivered on our mission to inspire humanity. The very foundation of our business model, our culture, our passion, our customer service and our focus on safety, continue to guide us as we march towards recovery. At JetBlue, we have been investing in our culture of over 20 years and our longstanding commitment to empowering our crew members is now more important than ever. As a service company, the pandemic and cries for social justice have underscored our role in reducing biases that have existed for too long. We are starting 2021 with a reinvigorated diversity, equity and inclusion plan. Our commitment is to better embed DEI into the fabric of JetBlue and to continue our minority and female representation in officer and director ranks - continue to increase our minority and female representation in officer and director ranks between now and the end of 2025. We are also reinforcing our commitment to invest in our crew members and improve the access to development opportunities. Lastly, we intend to better reflect the diverse communities and cultures we serve in all areas of JetBlue. We believe JetBlue will continue to set the standard in our industry with our comprehensive ESG strategy, and were the first airline with FASB reporting. Our commitment to the environment is to reduce emissions across our business as we respond to the changing expectations of our customers, crew members and owners. Today, we are the only US airline that has achieved carbon neutrality for all domestic flights. We also intend to achieve net carbon emissions across all of our operations - net zero-carbon emissions across all our operations by the end of 2040 at the latest. Our plan is to accomplish these goals through a fuel-efficient aircraft, expanding our use of sustainable aviation fuels, and purchasing carbon offsets. Later this year, we plan to publish our annual ESG report, detailing new initiative, strategies and disclosures and we'll continue our conversations with all our stakeholders. I'm proud that while we are in the middle of a pandemic, our team continues to prioritize our work on ESG. Now, let's move to slide four of our presentation. In the fourth quarter, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.53. Despite the financial results, I'm proud of what our crew members have accomplished in this extraordinary year, and I could not be more confident about our future. Our team has not only managed through the ongoing demand challenges, but also have made important progress on strategic initiatives, including revenue, capacity and cost actions. Through this work, we believe we will emerge as a stronger JetBlue. Moving to slide five. We continue on our path to recovery, which consists of three steps. First, reducing our cash burn, second, rebuilding our margins, and third, repairing our balance sheet. As we moved through 2020 and meaningfully reduced our cash burn and we are now starting to shift our focus to rebuilding our margins. We remain cautiously optimistic that demand trends will improve later this year. More importantly, this crisis has made us a more agile, creative and resilient airline. And we believe our initiatives will allow us to emerge with structurally better margins. Let's start with our network plan. We have taken aggressive actions to protect cash and remain relevant in our focus cities and announced over 80 new markets, while accelerating our expansion in historically constrained markets such as New York and LAX. We are thrilled to incorporate new aircraft into our fleet that will support our network plans. This year, we are bringing in the game-changing A220 and it's fantastic economics. We'll also fly the low-density A321neo and the A321LR, both of which include our incredibly exciting new mint product, which will carry forward our success in disrupting and re-imagining premium travel at significantly lower fares. We're so excited to shortly launch our landmark Northeast alliance with American Airlines. This is a truly innovative partnership between two independent airlines. Through our different business models, we expect to expand flying in highly constrained markets and bring more low fares to more customers. We plan to offer new and increased flight options, improved schedules, better connections and more competitive fares. Our customers will have access to more domestic and international destination and an improved frequent flyer program. For JetBlue, this alliance will help us recover more quickly, while also protecting jobs. Beyond fleet and network, we plan to continue to enhance our digital experience and develop our JetBlue travel products offering. Last year, we re-launched JetBlue Vacations, bringing innovative new benefit to vacation packages such as personalized service in destination, travel perks, payment flexibility, and a best price guarantee. We also enhanced our travel insurance product. We are now working to scale up our platform to help our customers easily add products for their travel plans with JetBlue. The initial results are encouraging and we believe that as leisure traffic returns, we will see attach rates improving compared to our pre-COVID rates. Lastly, we remain committed to keeping our costs low and ensuring that our efforts across JetBlue translate into better margins and higher earnings. We continue to find meaningful opportunities to both - in both our fixed and variable cost structures, which reinforces our low cost, low fare leisure model. Steve will provide more detail on our 2021 cost plan and how this adds to the cost savings we achieved through our structural cost program. Of course, all these efforts would not be possible without our incredible crew members. I want to thank them for their personal sacrifice, as this crisis has impacted their lives with reduced hours and reduced paychecks. And on behalf of all of our crew members, I want to thank our government leaders, particularly at the U.S. Treasury for their continued and vital support for our industry, which has helped save many jobs. We are, as we all know, navigating the most challenging times in our history. But we are starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. Our team will continue to do everything we can to protect the future of JetBlue, protect our crew members and emerge as a stronger airline. Joanna, over to you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. First, a shout out to our crew members who continue to manage all of the challenges and operational complexities associated with COVID. They are delivering a safe and healthy experience day in and day out for our customers and have truly been at the center of our Safety from the Ground Up Program. They continue to instill confidence that flying remains a safe mode of travel. And thanks to them, we saw, in 2020, one of the highest NPS scores in our recorded history. Consistently delivering on our safety commitments remains one of the top reasons why customers are returning to air travel and why when given the choice, they are choosing JetBlue. And we continue to evolve our program to reflect the most current information about COVID and addressing the areas that customers tell us they need to see addressed to get them flying again. Our focus remains on cleanliness, reduce touchpoints and air quality. And we are also prioritizing efforts to educate our customers about the changing regulatory requirements associated with air travel, including testing, quarantine and documentation requirements. We know that many customers want to travel and we are trying to help them more easily navigate the landscape. We are working with CommonPass, a health records platform in certain markets to help customers easily validate their COVID status prior to travel. We have an eye toward including verifiable vaccine information in such a platform as we believe this will be an important part of future travel. We are also offering pre-departure and arrival testing options in Boston and JFK with XpresCheck and we continue to grow our partnership with Vault Health, providing customers with a home-based testing option, both within the United States and internationally. We will continue to work on options that help our customers more easily navigate this landscape, while also pivoting to vaccine documentation. Moving to slide seven. In the fourth quarter, our revenue declined 67% year-over-year. This marks a nine-point sequential improvement from the prior quarter, and while demand improved in October, booking trends slowed in November following increasing case counts and the CDC recommendation to avoid travel during the holidays. However, even with this headwind, we were pleased to close the quarter with the December holidays providing our highest traffic volumes since the start of the pandemic. During the fourth quarter, our Latin and Caribbean franchise continued to perform relatively well with demand being led by our VFR markets, as well as a modest increase of customers traveling to leisure markets. All of our domestic regions also saw revenue growth quarter-over-quarter with Florida markets having the greatest improvement domestically. Despite this progress in the fourth quarter, our geographic challenges persist with elevated case counts and continued quarantine measures, particularly, in the Northeast and California. For the first quarter of 2021, our planning assumption for revenue is a decline between 65% and 70% versus the first quarter of 2019. We saw increased demand from Martin Luther King weekend and are seeing a similar pattern for Presidents Day weekend, but we do not anticipate traffic to reach the levels of late December. The CDC order, effective earlier this week, requiring all customers over the age of two to present a negative COVID test before entering the U.S. is also pressuring bookings in our international markets. As a result of these international travel restrictions, we are seeing increased leisure demand to Florida, including our new Blue cities of Miami and Key West. However, Florida fares are low with relatively high levels of industry capacity. Our revenue plan for 2021 continues to evolve, and as we've said all along, we do not expect that recovery will be linear. We believe that we will begin to see material revenue recovery when there is a meaningful and sustained decrease in COVID case counts. As proof points, we saw demand accelerate back in May and August when case counts started to decline. We expect to see much of the same as case counts decrease in the coming weeks and months, particularly in the Northeast, where we believe demand may accelerate at a higher pace, given more stringent quarantines. We are optimistic that this decrease will come when there is increased immunity across the population. We also believe that governments will adjust travel restrictions with decrease in case counts, further fueling demand. At present, the booking curve is relatively short. As case counts come down, customers will be able to more confidently plan future trips, leading to a lengthening of the booking curve. As we move to a recovery phase, we believe that our predominantly leisure footprint and low-cost structure supported by our strategic initiatives should position JetBlue well, exiting the pandemic. We are excited about our recent upgrade to a new revenue management system, part of our continuous improvement in our revenue management tools. The system enables us to better forecast demand and better understand customer elasticity, which is a key tool for driving increased revenue. We are also implementing EMD capabilities that will allow us to sell ancillary products more broadly and also to price them more dynamically. We also continue to optimize our ancillary offerings, making our product and price proposition more competitive and more attractive to customers. We remain very pleased with the up-sell behavior of fare options 2.0 since the rollout in 2019. As we continue to refine and improve our segmentation strategy, we will announce updates to fare option features in the coming weeks. We've made additional strides toward a direct distribution strategy and have reduced the number of external partners that we work with. There are numerous channels for our customers to view our fares and offerings, but we are always encouraging them to book their travel at JetBlue.com. Lastly, and certainly not least, our loyalty program is an area ripe for evolution. We see an opportunity for JetBlue to grow our revenue base substantially over the coming years via personalization and a program tailored to different types of customers and their preferences. We are also currently out with an RFP for our co-brand partnership to enhance our value proposition to the customers. Turning to capacity on slide eight. In the fourth quarter, our flown capacity declined 47% year-over-year. For the first quarter of 2021, our planning assumption is for capacity to decline at least 40% versus Q1 2019. The sequential growth is driven in part by expectations for improving demand trends in the back half of the quarter, and also by the extension of the Payroll Support Program, which brings down our cash breakeven load factors despite the headwinds of high fuel prices and seasonally lower fares. I want to recognize the many JetBlue teams who've been managing the peaks and troughs of the quarter, quickly ramping up the operation to over 700 flights per day during the holiday and dialing our flights back to less than 300 per day during troughs. We continue to adjust our flying to areas of relative strength and over 15% of our capacity in the first quarter of 2021 is in new markets. We've been quick to add new flying in areas of strength, but also quick to pull capacity in underperforming areas. Thank you to our network team for finding new and creative opportunities to deploy our fleet to support cash generation and the financial sustainability of JetBlue, as well as our operations, customer experience, and revenue teams for executing these opportunities so well. As we move through 2021, we plan to bring capacity back in line with demand trends, addressing short term pressures, while solidify our long-term position in our focus cities. Thank you again to our crew members for closing out another year with their commitment to safety during what has been the most challenging year in JetBlue's history. With that, over to you, Steve.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Joanna. And good morning everyone. I would like to add my thanks to our crew members for doing a phenomenal job in 2020 taking care of each other and our customers and ensuring the financial health of JetBlue. Turning to slide 10 and a brief overview of our financial results for the quarter. Revenue was $661 million, down 67% year-over-year. Operating expenses were down 38% year-over-year. Excluding the benefit from CARES Act and charges related to fleets and voluntary leave programs for our crew members, operating expenses were down 34% year-over-year. GAAP loss per diluted share was $1.34 and adjusted loss per diluted share was $1.53. Moving on to slide 11. As Robin mentioned, we continue to make progress towards recovery, reducing our cash burn, laying the foundation to rebuild our margins and remaining committed to balance sheet repair. Our average daily cash burn for the fourth quarter was $6.7 million towards the lower end of the $6 million to $8 million range previously expected. This was a result of variable cost savings achieved through our balanced approach to capacity and the actions to minimize fixed costs across our business. At the end of December, our total liquidity, including restricted and unrestricted cash, was $3.1 billion or 38% of our 2019 revenue. Our liquidity includes funds from the equity transaction we executed in December and sale leasebacks to finance aircraft deliveries. Starting this quarter, we will transition from reporting all-in cash burn to EBITDA. We believe that this metric brings better visibility to JetBlue's underlying performance as we move towards recovery. We estimate our EBITDA for the first quarter will range between negative $525 million to $625 million, reflecting similar revenue trends for the fourth quarter, but also manifesting recent cost pressures from rents and landing fees, as well as fuel prices. For reference, we have included a reconciliation table in the Appendix section of our presentation. As Joanna mentioned, we are starting the year with challenging demand trends and how we fall within the planned EBITDA range will depend on the pace of revenue recovery during the quarter. Turning to slide 12. During the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating expenses declined 34% year-over-year. This excludes the payroll benefit from CARES Act of $49 million. The CARES Act benefit related to employee retention credits for $36 million. It also included a $15 million charge related to fleet impairments and $1 million in charges related to crew member opt-out programs. This performance, relative to our expectations, was driven by our capacity actions and solid cost execution during the quarter. Our working assumption for the first quarter is a reduction in our total operating expenses of approximately 25% year-over-two. The sequential quarterly increase is driven by our capacity plan and external cost headwinds, particularly rents and landing fees, as well as fuel prices. We anticipate some of these cost pressures will normalize over time as traffic volumes recover. Moving to slide 13. We continue to take aggressive approach to improve our cost structure and to help rebuild our margins. Our 2021 plan reduces our total operating costs by over $1.2 billion compared to 2019. We believe that executing our plan will put us on a path to emerge from the crisis with better CASM, ex-fuel in 2022 than 2019. Naturally, achieving our plan will be a function of demand recovery, bringing back capacity and ultimately taking our aircraft utilization to pre-crisis levels. In order to achieve our unit cost growth and improve our margins going forward, we are targeting a reduction in our 2021 fixed costs between $150 million to $200 million compared to 2019. For perspective, this is a 6% decline on our fixed cost base on a 6% larger fleet year-over-two. Our fixed cost savings will come from our support functions and business partners. We've restarted our support footprint through crew member opt-out programs and consolidating our real estate assets and plan on driving additional efficiencies across JetBlue. This includes automation, standardization of internal processes and, of course, aggressively managing our discretionary spend. Throughout 2020, we worked closely with our business partners to adjust our commitments and secure rate reductions, as well as payments modifications. This year, we will continue collaborating with them to right-size our contracts, increase the variable components of our pricing and further drive down our overall costs. In addition to our work on fixed costs, we are aligning the variable portion of our cost structure to our capacity and network plan. We are focused on achieving savings by optimizing engine maintenance events, as we bring aircraft back to the operation and continuing to drive frontline productivity with the support of technology. Moreover, we are incorporating more fuel-efficient aircrafts into our fleet and increasing fuel efficiency measures throughout the operation. We do expect some headwinds in 2021, which will undoubtedly develop, including investment to protect the health and safety of our customers. Low cost remains an absolutely strategic focus of JetBlue. At the beginning of 2020, we reported the completion of our structural cost program, resulting in run rate savings which will manifest in our P&L as we return to growth. We look forward to continuing the momentum and controlling our unit cost trajectory over the next few years. Moving to slide 14. In the fourth quarter, we took delivery of two A321neo's and our first A320 aircraft, bringing our year end fleet count to 267 aircrafts. During 2021, we expect delivery of seven A320, five A321neo's and three A321LRs with annual CapEx of approximately $1 billion. For the swing of periods, 2020 to 2022, we lowered our CapEx by $2 billion compared to our pre-pandemic time. Our reworked order book would support our network strategy, protect our A320 deliveries, a platform we expect to deliver 30% lower direct operating cost per seat compared to our A1 launches [ph]. Moving to slide 15. We continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry with a debt-to-cap ratio of 57% at the year end of 2020. We believe our current liquidity, our efforts to reduce cash burn, and our balance sheet strength will enable us to navigate the demand challenges of 2021. This quarter, we anticipate receiving over $500 million from the second round of the COVID Payroll Support Program, helping us protect jobs at JetBlue. I'll close with a final thank you to all of our crew members. We remain confident in our ability to protect JetBlue and position us for better days ahead. Although 2021 will be another challenging year, we remain nimble and continue to execute on our cost plan and commercial initiatives. We believe our hard work will begin to pay off and will make us stronger for the years to come. With that, we will now take your questions.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, everyone. We're now ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I'm just looking at your slides here with the reduction in total OpEx expected for 2021. What is the capacity base that you're assuming? And I guess what is the implication for unit costs? Obviously, it's a little confusing here in the early part of the year. But just as we roll forward, kind of what does this imply for second half capacity in unit costs?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Duane. It's Steve here. Good morning, good to hear from you. Duane, if you just refer to slide 13 that you've talked about, you will see a footnote in terms of the assumption for capacity, full year 2021 capacity at 70% [ph] of 2019 capacity. The way that we are planning our business, Duane, is that we continue to see sequential improvement in the demand environment and hence capacity as we progress through 2021. Leaving '21 and entering '22 with comparable capacity for the sort of 2019 year. So from a unit cost progression, I would expect that, that will improve as we gain momentum through 2021 because, naturally, we become more efficient as a business as we fly more of the fleet and we get back to sort of sense of normality. And our planning assumptions underpinning the economics that we've laid out from a cost standpoint is at 2022's capacity move of that 2019. But, obviously, that's all predicated on what happens in the demand environment, where things lie with vaccinations and coming out of the other side of COVID. Hopefully, that makes sense to you, sir.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yeah, that's good perspective. And then just on some of the fleet movement, as you bring on a new fleet type here and you're preparing for London flying, presumably, can you just quantify that the training or the approval cost associated with kind of new fleet types and Europe approval?\nSteve Priest: Yeah, good question, Duane. We have been ruthless over the last year about privatization across JetBlue. You can imagine an airline in many different priorities coming into 2020, and we have done a really great job at consolidating those. We've been really driven on some specific ones. For example, the A220 that has got game-changing economics to protect and grow our margins as we go forward. And so embedded in our sort of 2021 cost plan are obviously the training and transition costs of bringing both the A220 and the A321LD - the new neo-LD, low density and the LR into the fleet and our launch to London later this year. So that's all incorporated into our numbers and the teams have worked tirelessly to make sure we do this both in the right way, but we do it with the right economics. So that's all sort of embedded in there. And so that's where we are with that. Not, obviously, going to get into the specifics of those items. But just to give you confidence, that's all embedded in there and we're looking forward to having both aircraft enter into service during this year.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Maybe just another one on cost for you, Steve. So can you share how we should think about what, if any, of that $1.2 billion and lower 2021 cost for 2019 is permanent as opposed to volume related? Is it just that $150 million to $200 million fixed cost amount you called out or there's more than that?\nSteve Priest: Hi, good morning, Cathy. Yes. So this is why we have laid out and giving you some transparency in our planning assumption between fixed and variable costs. And so, obviously, we have had the opportunity off the back of the structural cost program and during this pandemic to turnover every stone again and go even deeper to look at the fixed cost structure and keep and maintain as much of that fixed cost structure out as we sort of come back to normality going forward. And that, candidly, is where the $150 million to $200 million comes from in a number of areas like, as we sort of previously discussed, our support footprint, real estate consolidation, IT infrastructure and transition from data centers to the cloud, et cetera, just to mention a couple. Now, when I think about the variable cost structure, we did a huge amount of work associated with structural cost program where we really get the benefits with scale. And as we've come into 2021 with a compromised network, you obviously aren't getting economies of scale as that returns. And so the way we're thinking about is, there's a huge level of stickiness associated with fixed costs that we've taken out and we'll do everything, obviously, not to put them back in. But also as we scale our business and we get our fleet utilization back up, you are going to see the fruits of our labor on our variable cost structure, which will continue to drive economies of scale. So again, hopefully, that gives you some color about how we've laid this out in a very transparent way so that you can see our game plan for the next couple of years.\nCatherine O'Brien: Yes, definitely. Thanks, Steve. And then maybe my second one, I think might be for Joanna, but - so with your network exposure to some of the more restricted parts of the country, the Northeast and California, what flying are you able to reallocate the parts of your network that might be seeing better demand trends? Are there any additional new markets you look at in addition to that, like, 15% of capacity you've got planned for the first quarter? And then, I guess, like, lastly, you probably told us, is there any way for us to think about order of magnitude, how much California and Northeast are underperforming in the rest of your network? Thanks for the time.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thanks a lot. Let me try to piece it apart. So, maybe broadly speaking, I think the team has done an exceptional job redeploying capacity to those areas where there is demand. So as Robin mentioned in his opening remarks, we've announced more than 80 new routes since the pandemic started. 15% of what we're seeing in 2021 is actually flying in new geographies, which is just, I think, fantastic and I think reflects the nimbleness and creativity of the team to address and try to mitigate that disproportionate impact that we are seeing in the Northeast. In so far as California is concerned, it still represents a relatively small portion of our overall network. That said, we are pleased to see the stay-at-home orders lifting and optimistic that we will see demand recover in, I'd say, medium time frame for California as we've seen in other parts of the country where quarantine have been lifted and where case counts have dropped. So we're encouraged by that. At the end of the day, as we think about the Northeast and our footprint here, I think we've been very transparent. It is an area that's been disproportionately impacted, but we do believe, when case counts come down, when more customers are vaccinated, when quarantines are lifted, that there will be an even greater level of pent-up demand in the Northeast because of these stricter quarantines, and we're well positioned for recovery in those areas as an airline that was born to do leisure travel for low fares for customers at a low cost.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nJamie Baker: Hey. Good morning everybody. Joanna, I'm going to ask a question that reveals my ignorance about revenue management. But I'm going to ask it anyway. So please bear with me while I publicly embarrass myself. After the Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia, fares in the shuttle market, including those of JetBlue, shot up to levels that I don't think anybody had ever witnessed, airlines were accused of price gouging. But the reality as I understand it is the pricing systems were just overwhelmed and passengers were pushed into fare categories that I don't think any airline ever intended to charge. When the U.K. first went into lockdown, Ryan Air experienced something similar, folks trying to rush home before a deadline. It wasn't that they raised fares, it's just that the systems were overwhelmed. I'm not suggesting we're going to see a nationwide repeat of this, but my question relates to pricing automation. I mean, are the systems just being left on cruise control? How much human intervention typically takes place? I'm not asking about future pricing. I just wonder if there is an RM or a pricing angle related to automation that might influence yield when you consider that demand could come back in a way that your systems aren't ordinarily calibrated for. Does that make any sense?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yeah. I'm going to throw it to Robin because he is anxious to answer this question.\nRobin Hayes: Hey, Jamie. Good morning. I'm not going to answer your question as you would expect, but I'm going to call the flag on your self-proclaimed statement that revenue management is not your thing. We know that's not true.\nJamie Baker: You're too kind.\nRobin Hayes: Maybe like a hobby of yours, and we will now do the best to answer your questions. So, Joanna, and then maybe, Dave.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yeah, I'll just start. I think it's a great question, Jamie. And there has obviously been quite a bit of human intervention this year because so much of the data that we've historically relied upon in our systems has not been indicative of demand trends and some of these external factors that have factored into whether customers are flying, pandemic case counts, travel bans and quarantines. And so I'm going to have Dave get into a little detail. I'm going to ask Dave not to take the entire earnings call to do that because I know he would love to. But Dave, maybe you can provide a little detail on your thinking and then the new system - the new automation system that we're thinking of.\nDave Clark: Yes, thanks, Jamie, for the question. This is Dave. It's a really good one. It's a difficult time for revenue management systems in general because demand is so choppy and can change frequently in volatility. So there has been more human intervention, I think, than normal, certainly at JetBlue and just in general. And historically, you mentioned some, say, big shocks like a natural disaster, which has driven prices up because the system sort of normally do that if left on other [ph]. But we focused a lot in the last few years on, one, ensuring that doesn't happen through manual intervention and we've had a very good several year track record of making sure we have focus on low fares. And, two, just sort of ensuring that we have low fares in general, not even during shocks like that, but overall. So going forward, hopefully we will see, in the coming quarter or two, a nice demand increase as case counts comes down and vaccinations go up. I don't think it will be anywhere near the level we've seen in some of the past shocks. But it will certainly be something that we'll be working closely to ensure that fares stay relatively low and appropriate, and that we get more customers on board as demand recovers.\nRobin Hayes: And I think, Jamie, it's Robin. I just want to close that out. It's a great question. I mean, I'm actually very proud of JetBlue's record when these events have happened. I mean, you talked about the Amtrak tragic accident, but I think about think about hurricane Irma, Maria some of these other natural disasters we had that do it a similar thing. I mean, we have led the industry in fare caps, making sure fares are artificially low so that we can get people to travel at those times and at affordable level. And that's something that we're going to continue to do when these types of events happen.\nJamie Baker: Thank you for answering my question so gracefully. I appreciate it. Real quick follow-up, it will be short. I do remember Continental top-ticking the market with its Heathrow slot purchase. I think they paid something like, I don't know, $200 million for four pairs. I'm not going to ask what your willingness to pay is, but I haven't kept up with recent transactions for the time slots you're interested in. Where is the market right now?\nRobin Hayes: Hey, Jamie, you do an amazing job. And I'm not going to go there either. I would say that, obviously, we are still on track for a Q3 London launch. Obviously, we are paying attention to what's going on. We will - we'll go out for sale when we think the time is right and that's when we'll share our thinking on slots. What I'd say, at a general level, about Heathrow slots, as you know, with the slot waivers that have gone in there, the sort of scenario last year may be that - maybe some commentary around airlines who were cash-strapped, they would sort of monetize Heathrow slots because they couldn't fly them obviously with the way waiver process that hasn't happened. And so, again, we continue to sort of have path to more than one London airport and more in due course.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nHelane Becker: Thanks, operator. Kind of touch or follow Jamie, but would - there's still some discussion on domestic testing, so I have two questions regarding that. Would you support it is the first one? And the second one is what - you fly a lot of VFR into the Caribbean and Puerto Rico, specifically, what's the - what does it look like there from a testing capability and from a demand capability to continue flying those routes and are people there also getting vaccinated enough in timely fashion?\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. So I'll start with your second question first. So, Puerto Rico, we definitely see some constraints with testing in that environment. We've actually partnered with Vault Health, which is an at-home option to try to encourage more customers to use that option in Puerto Rico for travel. I know that Puerto Rico tourism is very encouraged by that. And we are seeing a decent amount of domestic bookings, given the CDC quarantine coming into the international market. So we are seeing an uptick in that area. With regard to our views on domestic testing, I think, first, we're trying to take a step back and recognize that the government is trying to balance a number of factors. It's a new administration, they're crying about economic recovery, public health considerations and stepping into a crisis like this. Air travel, we know it's safe, there's numerous scientific studies that have shown the aircraft is safe. We are not supportive of testing on the domestic front for a few reasons. I think, first the virus is here, there is community spread, we really want the CDC to work with the industry to come up with pragmatic solutions to help mitigate the right risks, and frankly address some of the real operational complexities. The testing regime that CDC put in place for international, that's, I think, then as good as you can get, given that international already has a framework for document checking and whatnot. And that was really - the goal towards that was really to use that as an alternative to quarantines. Obviously, it hasn't quite worked out in the same way, but there is a framework there and we would expect, in the coming days, for the CDC testing framework to kind of settle in and folks would adjust to that. But on the domestic front, it's hard to see practically something like that working at that scale. Air travel is just one mode of travel. You obviously have rail, road transportation, people need to travel, they'll figure out a way to get there. They'll figure out a way to see Mom, Dad and frankly putting this burden on air travel is, we think, far too cumbersome. I also have concerns around just the testing capacity in the United States, I think, teasing out a little bit about what you're saying about Puerto Rico. In many parts of the country, testing slots are scarce and it takes, frankly, many days and some cases actually get results back. We know based on what U.S. Travel and Tourism has recently said that if you start testing domestically, we'd see 42% more people introduced into the current testing framework on a daily basis. And so when you start thinking about a framework that's already overburdened, and you add domestic travelers into that, this puts a ton of pressure on an already fragile system and, frankly, we're concerned that it would actually reduce the ability of some people who legitimately need to get tested for health reasons to get tested. And then you look at our crew members and asking them to, whether it's check documentation, check attestation domestically, we already have them as the mask police. We already have them as the social distance police, adding document checks and testing validations put them in, frankly, an untenable position and in an environment where we're trying to promote social distancing. So we have real concerns about this. We are open to reasonable measures. But we don't believe a domestic testing regime is feasible, given the existing framework.\nHelane Becker: That is great, and it's very helpful and hugely detailed. Thanks, Joanna. That was my question. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nSavi Syth: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Steve, maybe just on the CapEx front, I was kind of curious how you're thinking about like 2022 or normalized levels. It seems like there will be fewer aircraft deliveries, especially in 2022. Curious, if like 2021 is a high watermark. And also related to that, is the E190 retirement, it looks like they're delayed, is that because there is slower A321s coming in?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Savi. Good morning. Good to speak to you. I've been very pleased and proud of the work that has taken place over the last nine months and a little shout out to our partner Airbus who sort of did two amendments to our order book and to take $2 billion of CapEx out over the 2020-22 period. It has been incredibly helpful as we've navigated this pandemic and also thoughts about aircraft needs as we go forward. However, I suppose to your tangential point, the A220, we're incredibly excited about taking that shell. We had our first one arrive on December 31, can't wait to get into operation, and they'll provide game-changing economics. So with regards to '22, when you look at the order book, you're right, we have sort of a lower order book than we had before the pandemic. And as you look out, we will continue to refine and look at our order book. Obviously, one has more flexibility the further out that you go to make sure that we got the balance right between our CapEx profile and also investing in high return, high margin aircraft to support our operation and drive margins for JetBlue. Specifically for the E190, nothing has changed. Our first A220 has arrived, we're going through the prices as a reminder. It's a - the plan is for a one-to-one replacement, looking forward to the A220 coming in for EIS. We currently have over 25% of our current E190 in storage at the moment. And so there is nothing to sort of say or nothing to change there. And you can expect this in due course is that we got a penetration of A220s into the fleet that we'll see the E190s rolled out. So a very considered and strategic approach to our fleet plan which will support margins for the years to come.\nSavi Syth: So then maybe thinking of 2021 CapEx as a high watermark is probably not a fair comment. Is it?\nSteve Priest: I think it is when you look into this near-term because of what we've done to rationalize our sort of '22 order book. Even if we've got spiky levels of CapEx, as we go further out, naturally, you end up smoothing things accordingly. So as I said, this should be a high watermark in relation to 2022. But, sort of the '23 and beyond, we'll continue to work on the order book to get our balance right.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yeah. Hey, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. I guess, Robin or Joanna, if I listen to every airlines conference calls this quarter, everyone has got a good plan and a positive view on the future. But specific to you guys, with your focus on margins, what happens if everyone comes back to pre-pandemic levels of capacity, but we just don't see the level of business demand or maybe leisure demand as we think it will be? What are some of the levers you can pull? Especially we see United getting back into the Transcon from JFK. Isn't this potentially going to be a much more competitive environment, especially, domestically, looking forward?\nJoanna Geraghty: Thanks. I'll take that. So we recognize that other carriers are redeploying their fleets. I think at the end of the day, this is what JetBlue does. We fly leisure customers from the North to the South at low fares and we have a cost structure that enables us to do that and to do that very well. Our loyalty program is built for leisure, our operation is built for leisure. Obviously, our goal is always to balance supply and demand, but at the end of the day that we're going to be competitive here. And so I think we're proud of this track record. We'll continue to lean into leisure VFR markets where the demand is, as we move forward, and that's our plan for the future. We've got a number of interesting revenue initiatives in the hopper as we've discussed on the call, and we think that will give us some additional wind in our sail. Robin, you want to add?\nRobin Hayes: Joanna, I think that's great and just a bit on - Brandon, obviously, we are - we very firmly believe that we have some very specific JetBlue tailwinds. I mean, we're excited about our partnership with American Airlines. Joanna mentioned our focus on loyalty and the co-brand RFP. We think that is a total value. I think we had a lot of conversations honestly about CapEx and what is the right mix of CapEx right now, but the fleet changes we're making are very margin-accretive and important, and then of course just our focus on costs. I mean, we, I think, have over a period of four-years changed the culture of how we think about costs at JetBlue. And that is, as you know, a critical part of managing margin. So there's the sort of overall macro environment where I think leisure - I'm still convinced leisure will come up. There is so much pent-up demand, so much pent-up demand, I think we recognize that. And then there is all the JetBlue specific things that we've talked about before and I think all of those position us really well for margin expansion in the years ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yeah. I appreciate that response. I guess, Joanna, you did talk about changes to your fare and ancillary pricing strategy. Is that - should we read, hey, we want to get to lower fare in front of consumers and maybe put more emphasis on the ancillary going forward?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yeah, I'd say, put more emphasis on ancillaries and, frankly, better providing customers in different segments what they value. And that's - I'll leave it at that.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nMike Linenberg: Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Two here, I guess, first to - it's probably Scott and Joanna on, one, congrats on getting the agreement with the DoT and the agreement with American in place. How should we think about how that agreement ramps up? I asked because on the American call, they talked about how they have negotiated, I guess, their first corporate contracts with Alaska for West Coast accounts. So presumably, you're going to participate. That's probably part of the agreement with American in the Northeast. Is it code-sharing first followed by frequent flyer reciprocity, maybe there is club room access on American? Can you just kind of run through how things ramped through 2021 on that agreement? Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Yeah. Hi, Mike, great question. It's Robin. Obviously, I will - I'll start it and then maybe hand over to Scott on some of the more specifics, but we are, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are very excited about this. If I think about one of our biggest frustrations at JetBlue over the last several years is that we couldn't do more in the Northeast to bring our great product and service and our low fares to more people. And also some of our challenge is being competitive with some of the corporate accounts because of a lack of our global network. And so, when I think about why we at JetBlue are excited about this and we've been through a very extensive six-month review with DoT on this, is that this is going to allow us to do - and Joanna said it earlier, what we do best at JetBlue, flying JetBlue to more markets and to bring more low fares, and it has been documented over many years. When JetBlue is flying in the market, the positive impact it has on competition. There are still too many routes in the Northeast where our competition doesn't exist. And so that's why we're excited. I know that's not the question that you asked, but I wanted to sort of get that out there. And then maybe, Scott, obviously, on some of the specifics.\nScott Laurence: Sure and thanks, Robin and thanks, Mike, for the question. I think we're really excited about this as Robin talked about. What I foresee is moving very quickly on code, that's something that definitely will take place in the first quarter and we're doing everything we can to accelerate that to get the customer benefits out there. Moving into that, I think we'll have more to report on frequent traveler reciprocity and what we're doing on the sales side as well, because that leans in very nicely to some of the things that, frankly, we couldn't do without this partnership and Robin referred to that, so things like growth in LaGuardia. There is a number of LaGuardia markets right now that are served by a monopolist. We think that's a great opportunity for us to disrupt, certainly into the coastal Southeast, that's the case. And then going forward, when we think about sales contracts and things like that, I think, as the Transcon recovers, bringing Mint to bear, doing so with access in some cases to the corporate accounts that our partner has, I think, is really something that's powerful in terms of bringing competition, bringing lower fares. And then lastly, as we bring code, going forward, we're seeing American launching long-haul flying from New York, we look forward to feeding that and creating again a sort of third global competitor in the Northeast, that's really important, it's highly beneficial for us. It means faster recovery, it means - it's frankly - it's saving jobs. It's all sorts of the things that we look at to recover more quickly and I think that excitement that we've got is building here, because we really want to get moving.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Great, that's fantastic, Scott and Robin. Just one quick one on Heathrow slots, your access to Heathrow. Just remind me, as I recall, I think that there were some remedy slots. I think there was a pair tied to Boston and one tied to South Florida. Are those still out there or maybe others are using? And then does the A321neoXLR, would that have the range from South Florida to London? I apologize it's sort of a two-parter but.\nScott Laurence: So, this is Scott. I'll take that one. There's three slots over there we pursued, continue to pursue. They were awarded to another carrier who we have not seen them moving forward with those. So we'll see what direction that goes. I think we'll continue to move forward and pursue that. But we have not seen a lot of eagerness by that competitor to frankly serve those markets. So as far as the 321XLR, it's a very interesting airplane. It does bring a level of - a lot more capability that exceeds the 321LR as far as Florida to Europe. I don't want to put the cart before the horse, but the airplane is likely capable there. There are some specific issues to Fort Lauderdale that we would have to overcome, but we're pretty interested in, when that airplane does come in, what we can do with it.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nHunter Keay: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting me in. Hey, Dave Clark, a question for you. When you think about adding back supply with improving demand and you see these weekly or daily revenue runs, which metrics can you see and which is the one that you prioritize most?\nDave Clark: Thanks, Hunter, for the question. We've been really focused in the past months on volume and on getting customers on board, on getting them traveling, getting them to have a good experience so they come back and tell their family, tell their friends and it keeps sort of the virtuous circle going. So for the past month and I expect, in the coming weeks and months, we'll be quite focused on our customers volume and getting people in the skies again.\nHunter Keay: So you're looking like a book-to-load factor exclusively at this point pretty much.\nDave Clark: Just in general, again, incentivizing travel, stimulating more traffic. We've had a lot of promotions, just generally driving volume has been the number one, returning to revenue through a volume and on-board customer focus.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks for getting me in. Joanna, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about the co-brand RFP, maybe why that path was chosen rather than an extension. And is now a good time or a bad time to be going through the RFP process? I guess, I could see both sides but just interested in your perspective. Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Joe. So let me start with we've been very pleased with the performance, historically, of our co-brand card. I mean Barclays has and continues to be just a tremendous partner. We accelerated an RFP for our co-brand. We felt that it was the right time to do so. Various carriers had renegotiated their deals recently and I don't want to get the cart ahead of the horse, but at the end of the day, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing and all I'd say is more to come when we're ready to come out with further analysis.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then for Robin, just on this notion that there's all this pent-up demand, which I would tend to agree with, if that's the case, why shouldn't demand in 2022 for you all be higher than it was in 2019? Like, where are you expecting the offsets to come from? Is it a certain demographic or maybe just speak to kind of why that shouldn't produce higher demand structurally in the future? Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Sure. I mean, maybe I'll just build on a thought that Dave had earlier about the short-term and then sort of segue to a longer term. I mean, right now, I think it's important to get people on airplanes because what our research tells us is that our customer NPS scores are really active at record highs. People have an overall very positive reaction to how safe the industry has made air travel. And so what we find is once people have that experience, they tell people and that's part of how we're building confidence. So, yes, it drives an environment in the short term where people are focused on volume, but that is about revenue maximization because that's what we think is going to drive the recovery most quickest. When we look at the longer-term view, look, we just don't know. I mean, I think, what we want to do is plan conservatively, plan cautiously. We certainly don't want to build a business plan that relies on a huge amount of demand recovery. So we have to focus on costs and we have to focus on some of the other things that we can control. We also are excited about the American partnership because we know that is something that's going to help our recovery. If it's there, we'll be there to take it. We are - we built a very nimble response and JetBlue knows how to drive very high aircraft utilization. So we know how to sort of put that incremental capacity back if the demand is there. So we're going to continue, I think, to take a cautious view in the short term. I don't think there's any medals right now for over-promising on revenue. We need to be focused and we need to be creative to do everything we can to build recovery and we need to size our company for margin expansion and we need to be there to take advantage of the demand as and when it comes back. And that's what we like setting out to do.\nOperator: Thank you. Question from the line of Dan McKenzie from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nDan McKenzie: Yeah. Hey, thanks. A couple of questions here. Just going back to the partnership with American, I'm just wondering if you can help us understand what that ultimately is going to mean. So ballpark, big picture, what could the economics ultimately look like in a normalized world? And I guess just thinking even big picture, business travel 20% historically. Is the goal to get it to 22%, 25% or what can this partnership actually help you accomplish, 30%? Big picture, what can you share?\nRobin Hayes: Scott, do you want to take that?\nScott Laurence: Yeah. So - I'll take that. I think we're not in a mode to sort of disclose where this can go in part because the environment, we're in right now makes the longer-term recovery a difficult question. But I would say this, I think, if you look at the potential there and sort of the ability to serve business customers, I think that this partnership is prime for that for two reasons. One is, it brings sorely needed competition where you've got two large legacies who have dominated the Northeast for business customers. There is an opportunity here to kind of break that up and open things up. And as business recovers, one of the things that's going to be there is providing competition and lower fares is something that we can do and better access. So, I think we're very excited about that. I think also as you think about access to markets like LaGuardia, and again, I think for JetBlue, that's something that we coveted for some time. The ability to work with American to be able to grow at LaGuardia, to take advantage, not only have that access, but then again, as we work together to have additional relevance in some of the more business-oriented markets in the Midwest, for example, that we have not been able to break into, historically, I think that gives us a chance to push that number up. So again, I think, on a percentage of customers flying for business, I think, that's going to be heavily dependent upon how quickly we see a recovery move. And again, I think as you look into 2023, years like that where other carriers are talking about a business traffic recovery, I think we end up with a number better than we've seen historically.\nDan McKenzie: Okay, very good. Second question here. I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on discussions with the Caribbean or Latin American governments and their willingness to embrace a travel passport. I guess, what are you learning from a pilot program that may be underway currently? What are the logistical hurdles to wide-scale rollout? Is it just simply government saying yes or no and does it get turned on the next day or how can we think about how that would enable a potential recovery?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yeah, I'll take that. So we definitely think it will enable a potential recovery. I think, more importantly, it will just make the experience easier and more seamless for customers and hopefully assist crew members and airline employees with document validation. So East Caribbean Island is an individual Caribbean island, and you need to work individually with them, some are further along, I'll call out Aruba, for example. They've done an exceptional job. We - we're working very closely with them. I know other carriers are as well. And as an industry, we've actually agreed to a set of principles that outline, I mean, a health passport, ideally, a standardized set of, call them, requirements. Obviously different carriers are going to pick different health passport providers, but ideally you would have a common framework and a common set of standards, regardless of that platform to make it easy across platforms and across different islands, so encouraging, obviously, those governments to use that same set of criteria. So it is on an individual by island basis, which does make it take a little bit longer, but we do think that necessity is the mother of invention. And if you actually look at the CDC order that came out this week, we've had very few denied boardings in most of our international locations. Day one was bumpy, day two, a lot better, day three will be a lot better. Testing centers are popping up in all sorts of places. You've got hotels offering testing. And so things will adjust and we think that we'll all adjust with it and that will support and bring back demand recovery as we step into the late spring and early summer.\nDavid Fintzen: And that concludes our fourth quarter 2020 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. And again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 3, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-10-27 15:24:07", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Mary. I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would like to turn the call over to JetBlue's Vice President of Investor Relations, David Fintzen. Please go ahead.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, Mary. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, our investor update and the presentation that we'll reference during this call. All of those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and have been filed with the SEC. Joining me here in New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer, Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Steve Priest, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A are Scott Laurence, Head of Revenue & Planning and Dave Clark, VP of Sales & Revenue Management. This morning's call includes forward-looking statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements due to many factors, and therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on these statements. For additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ from the forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release, 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC. Also during the course of our call, we may discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the table at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue\u2019s CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to start with my thanks to our crew members for their dedication to our customers. I also want to thank our crew members for their sacrifice during the most difficult period in our 20-year history. We are now over seven months into the pandemic. And day in and day out, our crew members deliver on our mission to inspire humanity. Their dedication and passion for delivering outstanding service has been truly remarkable, especially as we work to restore our customers' confidence in air travel. We have responded to this unprecedented crisis with action, leading the industry with health and safety protocols to keep our crew members and customers safe. We're grateful that all of our teams are bringing our industry-leading safety from the ground up program to life every day. Our customers are recognizing their efforts, and we are seeing record high customer satisfaction scores as a result of their professionalism and care. Let's slide - let's turn to slide 4 of our presentation. In the third quarter, we reported an adjusted loss of $1.75 per share. Despite the ongoing demand challenges, we have worked to stabilize and protect JetBlue. Our efforts to raise liquidity, reshape our network and reduce our costs are bearing fruit and have helped us navigate the immediate crisis. We remain cautiously optimistic that we will see further steady improvement in bookings into the upcoming holiday season. We have seen signs of pent-up demand from customers who want to visit their family and friends or go on vacation. And we believe that we will remain extremely well positioned to serve these customers as they return to air travel. Moving now to slide 5. We are confident that our low-cost, low-fare leisure model with the best crew members in the industry and the brand that customers trust will all help JetBlue to emerge stronger from the crisis. Since March, we have been focused on a three-step recovery process. First, we have made great strides in reducing our cash burn. We continue to manage our daily flying and take tactical actions to ensure we generate cash as demand recovers. Secondly, to rebuild our margins, we are executing on revenue and cost initiatives. Our margins today reflect the challenging revenue environment. And in the near term, we are redeploying our aircraft to new cash accretive markets where we see demand. Further out, we are setting JetBlue up for a strong rebound, taking advantage of opportunities in our network and strengthening our focus cities to produce structurally better margins in the coming years. Starting in the Northeast, we are building a strategic partnership with American Airlines. We believe this alliance, which is currently under regulatory review, will help accelerate our recovery, preserve jobs and allow us to continue our 20-year track record of disrupting the market with low fair and great service. I'd like to pause for a moment and highlight that while we are grateful to Washington for helping to save our industry in the spring, JetBlue made a clear choice this past summer to accelerate the speed of our recovery from the crisis when we announced our exciting New York and Boston partnership with American. We've been working tirelessly with both DOT and DOJ. I want to thank the leadership teams of each agency for their team's serious attention to reviewing our proposal. Getting this partnership off the ground quickly is critical to our self-help effort to expand low fares in New York and Boston and get us on the road to a faster recovery and job growth. In other parts of our network, we are positioning JetBlue for future success at LAX and Newark, making our Transcon franchise stronger. In Fort Lauderdale, we are adding connectivity to enhance our position in South Florida and in the Latin and Caribbean region. We are looking forward to repeat of our JetBlue travel product subsidiary. As demand recovers, we believe it will give us a competitive advantage in providing a unique value offering to leisure travelers who are looking for a trusted brand that offers flexibility and a personalized experience. On the cost side, our teams are working to realign JetBlue's cost structure to a temporarily smaller revenue base. Steve will provide some early details about our efforts that we believe will help us remain true to our low-cost routes as we recover from the crisis. Finally, in terms of balance sheet, we have successfully raised more than $4 billion since March, and we have access to further capital should we need it. Naturally, we aim to be free cash flow positive with the goal of repairing our balance sheet over the coming years. Of course, the timing will largely be a result of executing on our cost initiatives and the pace of demand returning. As we look forward to the expected recovery, we continue to work with our elected leaders to help find the best public policies and technologies that will support a safe return to travel. Rapid testing, we believe, can help reopen domestic and international markets and be a critical step in balance in public health considerations while promoting an economic recovery. The landscape continues to evolve, and we are cautiously optimistic that we will see major advancements in this space in the near future. Before closing, and on behalf of all of our crew members, I would like to take a moment to thank the federal government and their advisers for their continued support. The Cares Act payroll support and loan program has helped save many jobs at JetBlue and across the country. The reality is that we are still navigating this unprecedented crisis, and we expect demand to remain depressed for some time. We are optimistic that the leaders of our country will soon find a path to provide additional support for jobs in our industry, giving us vital time to execute our recovery plan. Thanks, again, to our amazing and inspiring crew members who, despite the current hardships, continue to show their dedication to safely serving our customers and taking care of each other. Joanna, over to you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. I'd like to start by expressing my profound thanks and gratitude to our crew members for their extraordinary efforts, both on behalf of each other and on behalf of our customers and delivering day in and day out on the commitments we've made in our safety from the ground-up program. Our crew members are the face of JetBlue. And as customers become more confident and return to air travel, we know it will be our crew members who lead the way, convincing the flying public that with the safety measures we have undertaken and observed air travel is indeed safe for all. We continue to see new data that proves that the controlled aircraft cabin environment limits the transmission of COVID. Because how often, cabin air is continuously re-circulated, the top to bottom airflow patterns that avoid spreading bacteria and the hospital grade HEPA filters, which removed 99.9% of particles and bacteria. Independent research studies by Harvard, IATA and the Department of Defense, to name just a few, indicate that air travel is safe and the risk of contracting COVID-19 on board an aircraft, particularly when wearing a mask, is very low. Our customers are telling us that we are taking the right actions to keep them safe, with nearly 95% of customers who have flown with us during the pandemic saying they will fly JetBlue again in the very near future. Our Net Promoter scores are near an all-time high, with a 10-point increase reflecting that our crew members are doing an exceptional job delivering a safe experience during these unique times. This is simply remarkable. Customers trust JetBlue, and we remain their first airline of choice in our key markets. That said, the lack of uniformity in foreign and U.S. state government regulations related to quarantining present additional challenges to recovery, and we are working to support our customers to understand and comply with these rules. And for those that need a coronavirus test prior to travel, we are building partnerships to make COVID testing more accessible. Moving to slide 7. In the third quarter, our revenue declined 76% year-over-year. A welcome improvement compared to our initial expectation. We saw a modest sequential improvement in August and September demand as new case counts decreased and quarantine restrictions in some states were eased. During the quarter, we were pleased to see states such as Connecticut and Massachusetts rollout testing options to help travelers manage through quarantines. Our Northeast geography continues to be disproportionately impacted. So we believe it will undoubtedly rebound as it always has with past challenges. In terms of key markets, we saw relative strength in our Latin and Caribbean region, especially driven by visiting friends and relative demand. By the end of the quarter, 20 of our 35 international destinations were open to customers from the U.S., albeit with varying travel requirements. We expect more destinations to reopen subject to foreign government rules. TransCon demand trends modestly improved, following the removal of quarantine measures from travel between New York and California. Lastly, northeast of Florida traffic was a relative source of strength, despite the tristate quarantine and pricing pressures from elevated industry capacity. Our planning assumption for the fourth quarter is a revenue decline of approximately 65% year-over-year. We are encouraged by customers responding positively to our promotional activity, including an early holiday sale in late September. And although there is still quite a lot of uncertainty about the evolution of coronavirus, we are starting to see the booking curve extend slightly into the upcoming Thanksgiving and December holiday travel period. Booking trends remain largely close in, but continued to improve despite the recent rise in case counts. In terms of markets, we continue to see demand recovering quickest to Latin Caribbean and Florida destinations.  Turning to capacity on slide eight. We are managing through the volatile demand environment with a laser focus on capacity, planning or scheduled a few months out and adapting it to close in trends. During the fourth - sorry, during the third quarter, our flowing capacity declined 58% year-over-year, lower than our initial planning assumptions as we optimize flying to manage cash burn. As revenue trends improved slightly through the summer months, our system load factor increased to approximately 50% at the end of the quarter.  For the fourth quarter, our current planning assumption is for capacity to decline approximately 45% year-over-year given our current expectations for improved bookings.  In the near term, we have reallocated some aircraft to new markets to capture VFR and leisure demand, helping us generate additional cash in our focus cities and in non-traditional markets for JetBlue. These include the approximate 60 routes we announced during the summer months, which we expect will contribute to our cash during this fall and into the holiday season.  Our new routes are performing within expectations. To-date, our new markets from Newark, particularly transcon Mint are performing better than we anticipated. We are seeing similar results in our recently added flying in Florida, Providence and Hartford.  We are excited about our strategic partnership with American Airlines. This alliance is expected to bring more low fares to more customers, allow us to offer improved schedules, offer more options for connectivity in Boston in New York, and offer an enhanced loyalty program. Along those lines, we have just completed the terms of our frequent flyer agreement with American.  We look forward to activating the partnership, which should help generate cash, recover faster and preserve jobs in our industry. I want to close by thanking again our incredible crew members for serving our customers with passion in everything that they do.  Over to you, Steve.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Joanna. I'd also like to add my thanks to our crew members and leaders. I could not be proud of their determination and efforts to keep each other and a customer safe and to ensure the financial sustainability of JetBlue.  I'll start on slide 10 with a brief overview of our financial results for the quarter. Revenue was $492 million, down 76% year-over-year. Operating expenses were down 45% year-over-year. Excluding the benefit from CARES Act and charges related to fleet and voluntary lead programs for our crew members, operating expense was down 39% year-over-year. GAAP loss per diluted share was $1.44 and adjusted loss per diluted share was $1.75.  Moving on to slide 11. Our average daily cash burn for the third quarter was $6.1 million, ahead of the $7 million to $9 million range we anticipated three months ago. This was the result of a modest improvement in demand beginning in August, variable cost savings achieved through a balanced approach to capacity and the many actions we took to minimize fixed costs across our business.  For the fourth quarter, we estimate our daily cash burn to be between $4 million and $6 million. The sequential improvement reflects our continued actions to minimize cash costs.  In addition, as Joanna mentioned, we are cautiously optimistic that the demand trends we saw in August and September will continue, and we are taking consequential capacity actions as needed to manage costs and support our revenue recovery. While we fall within the range will again depend on the pace of the revenue recovery we see during the quarter. At the end of September, our total liquidity, included restricted and unrestricted cash was $3.1 billion, or 38% of our 2019 revenue. During the quarter, we drew down $114 million from the CARES Act loan program and raised over $300 million of sale-leaseback proceeds on a mix of existing and new aircraft deliveries. In addition, we refinanced our $1 billion term loan facility with two EETC transactions. We have approximately $1 billion of traditional unencumbered assets on the balance sheet, excluding our loyalty program and subsidiaries. With regard to our loyalty program, we continue to explore parallel paths with both U.S. treasury and the capital markets to raise up to $2 billion of additional liquidity. Turning to slide 12. During the third quarter, our adjusted operating expenses declined 39% year-over-year. This excludes the payroll benefit from CARES Act of $332 million, $58 million in charges related to crew member opt-out programs, a $56 million charge related to a fleet impairment and $106 million charge related to the loss incurred on sale leasebacks. Since the start of COVID-19, we have offered a significant number of voluntary programs that help us preserve jobs and avoid furloughs. On a cumulative basis, over 6,600 crew members are volunteers for opt outs or extended lead programs, and we continue to offer similar initiatives to help us adjust resources to support our flying. We are grateful to those crew members who stepped up to participate in these programs. Their contribution has been instrumental in preserving the financial health of JetBlue. Our working assumption for the fourth quarter is a reduction in our total operating expenses of approximately 30% year-over-year. The sequential change is primarily due to scheduled increase in capacity to support revenue mitigated by our continued efforts to lower fixed costs. As we navigate the current environment with a steady hand, we are shifting our work to rebuilding our margins. We are taking an aggressive approach to improving our cost structure, better aligning our fixed and variable cost base to temporarily low revenue and capacity. We believe that our work will return JetBlue to profitability with structurally better margins, and our ultimate intention is to achieve superior pre-tax margins versus the industry. We are currently working on our budget for 2021, assuming a prolonged revenue recovery. Using 2019 as a reference, our emphasis will be lowering our costs on a permanent basis, reducing external spend and driving efficiency. Our recent delivery of our structural cost program gives us full confidence that we can emerge from this crisis in an even stronger cost position, which we believe will reinforce our margin recovery as demand returns. Moving to slide 13. In the third quarter, we took delivery of two A321neos and in the fourth, we expect delivery of two additional A321neos and our first A220. All of our 321 deliveries in the second half of 2020 are covered by sale leasebacks. The JetBlue fleet currently stands at 265 aircraft, including a recent delivery in early October. Earlier this month, we reached the second negotiated agreement with Airbus to defer additional aircraft and associated capital expenditure over the next few years. Since the beginning of the crisis, we have reduced aircraft and non-aircraft CapEx, by approximately $2 billion, between 2020 and 2022. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Airbus, for their tremendous partnership, as we collectively navigate these unprecedented times, for our industry. We continue to look forward to bringing both the, A321LR and the A220 into the JetBlue fleet, to help execute our network strategy. And rebuild our margins, through their outstanding economics. We are forecasting approximately $200 million of CapEx spend, for the remainder of 2020, the majority of which will be funded through sale-leasebacks. We continue to expect our CapEx, in 2021 to be less than $1 billion. We have laid out our advised order book in the appendix section of our deck. Moving to slide 14, at the end of September, our debt-to-cap ratio was 58%, a small increase from the prior quarter, driven by sale-leasebacks. And the recent draw on the Cares Act loan program. Our balance sheet remains amongst the strongest in the industry. And we believe that our current leverage is very manageable. Over the coming years, we intend to return our balance sheet to pre-pandemic levels, while making strategic investments in our network and our fleet to accelerate our recovery efforts. We entered the crisis with a strong financial foundation. And while the pandemic has proven to be a truly unprecedented downturn, we believe our efforts, both past and present, will enable us to recover faster and to ultimately reestablish our full earnings potential. As we move towards 2021, and what appears to be a prolonged recovery, we will continue to work to protect JetBlue in the short-term, while positioning us for success in the years to come. I want to again thank our crew members for their relentless work. And also thank our owners for their continued support. With that, we will now take your questions.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, everyone. Mary, we're ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead, with the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. Just on the cash burn. I was wondering, kind of towards the end of September, I think the indication of cash burn was coming in at the lower end of guidance. Is the difference that improved so much, related to kind of the fare sales that you had towards the end of September? And also, just what's the kind of the biggest drivers of the improvement that you're expecting from kind of Q3 to Q4, is that all revenue? Or do we see some cost benefits in there as well? Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Good morning Savi, its Steve here. I'll take that. I think it's about the balanced approach. So the $6.1 million of cash burn that we talked about Q3 was the average of the overall quarter. I think the way I would describe it, is that we're getting the balance right, between our capacity, our revenue and our cost structure. And the teams are doing a fantastic job of dynamically managing the capacity to the demand, which is really helping our overall cost -- our and obviously, our cash flow and performance. As we think about quarter three going into Q4, it's a continued steady increasing demand that we are, sort of, forecasting as we - sort of come through in terms of Q4. But it's also the ruthless focus that we've had on our overall cost structure as we continue to take things down. And that's why we are predicting sequential improvement from the $6.1 million in quarter three to the $4 million to $6 million that we forecast for Q4. So big thank you to our crew members. I think the work has been tremendous. And it's a balance of both revenue and cost.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. And Steve, if I might follow-up, you mentioned the kind of trying to monetize the loyalty or raise liquidity with the loyalty program. I just wanted to clarify. I think you said with the treasury or capital market. So if you go with the treasury, you -- would you just swap out whatever collateral you have in there right now? Or is there an opportunity to kind of get more financing there?\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Savi. I think the way I would describe our approach with a very steady hand on the tiller, it's about having flexibility. Robin talked about the support we've had from the government in our prepared comments. We continue, obviously, to look to the federal government to wonder what's going to happen with CARES too. And we don't know what the outcome of that is at the moment. We also are not very clear ultimately what's going to happen to demand environment. So for me, it's about having the access to liquidity and continue to have the flexibility about what to draw and when. And so we are running a parallel path, both with the sort of federal government but also looking at a public market transaction. With regards to the government loan, we do have access up to $1.9 billion. So we've just drawn a small slither of that as we did the -- by the end of September with the $114 million. And so the loyalty program, if we chose to go down that route, would supplement the collateral that we've already committed. Obviously, if we decide to go forward, then we determine we need actual liquidity and go forward in the public markets then we'd obviously look at pledging the loyalty program in the public markets. But I think the overall message I would give the analysts and the investor community is that we've built flexibility, both in terms of the path we take but also in terms of assessing whether we need the liquidity or not in terms of the provisions we've put in place to go forward.\nSavi Syth: Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolf Research. Your line is open. \nHunter Keay: Good morning, everybody. Robin, I realize your own pay is not your priority right now. But how do you think -- how are you and the Board thinking about what's going to shape drivers of executive compensation over the next few years given the prior drivers of target EPS and target ROIC are probably not appropriate for the next few years? Have you, sort of, have those discussions yet to sort of shape what drives the variable component of comp?\nRobin Hayes: Sure. Hi, Hunter. Good morning. Yes, I mean, obviously, right now, we're focused on the short-term. As we've said before, and I laid out in my comments, we've -- we laid out a three-stage approach this about minimizing cash burn. We're building margins and then repairing the balance sheet. What we try to do is ensure that executive compensation targets align with our priorities as a business. So that's what we're focused on right now. I actually -- I think margins and EPS, I mean, our goal is to get us back on track with that as soon as possible. I think we've also taken a flexible approach to targets over the years where we've adjusted them to reflect what are the priorities of the time. I will remind you, though, that at least for next period of time and longer if we take the government loan, the exact comp is limited by the CARES Act restrictions. And so that is also something we have to be mindful of and ensure we comply with.\nHunter Keay: Understood. And then I'm sorry for the ridiculous specificity of this follow-up, but you're striking a tone of cautious optimism on holiday bookings. Did you write that script last week? I mean, do you -- because it feels like things got maybe a little bit worse over the last few days here over the weekend, at least. Is that - obviously, you've had the opportunity to edit that, of course, knowing what we know, but I just want to make sure we're not sort of like top ticking demand commentary to set expectations for the fourth quarter that maybe things are sort of worsening a little bit around the periphery?\nRobin Hayes: Hunter, just a point of clarity, what are you looking at when you say things got worse over the weekend?\nHunter Keay: I'm looking at the positivity tests in the tri-state area in New York City area, Connecticut specifically. Again, like this is such a ridiculous specific question rather than I know, but\u2026\nRobin Hayes: Yeah. No, no, I just was making sure that you didn't have a secret source of data that we didn't see.\nHunter Keay: Okay. No, your point is taken, obviously, you've already answered the question. I get it. But I just -- I want to make sure that normally as of this morning, you still feel like this is realist on\u2026\nRobin Hayes: Yeah. Let me say one thing and then maybe hand it over to Joanna to more details. I think that what we did see back in the summer was our case count study gap in the Sunbelt. We did see an impact on bookings. We've talked about that before. We haven't seen that yet. So as case counts have started to come up around the country, we haven't seen that yet. I think some of that is just -- there's been a big pent-up demand for travel. We're also in the Thanksgiving holiday period, there's lots of students coming home and moving around Thanksgiving and we think that traffic is going to be -- hold up pretty well. But as we said before, this is a non-linear recovery path. We expect it to \u2013 ebb and wane, we give insight that we think we see. We're pretty plugged into what's going on in different jurisdictions around quarantines and sort of try to make an estimate around that. But as you know, Hunter, this thing can move very quickly. I think we have about 28 states or maybe 30 states now where the - our rate is sort of at or close to about 1.2% - sorry, 1.2, and we'll see what that makes. But right now, we're cautiously optimistic, and we continue to see that over the last several days, especially into the Thanksgiving and holiday period in December.\nHunter Keay: Great. Thanks, Robin. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning everybody. My first question is sort of a follow-up to Hunter\u2019s. I know there's talk about New York abandoning the current quarantine structure or modifying it somehow. I've done a couple of quarantines myself. It's really mostly an honor system. You talked about Florida resilience. I mean, what I really care about is whether there would be a surge in bookings if New York resented the quarantine, your comments maybe make me think otherwise and that maybe people are just blowing off the quarantine, blowing off some of the recent headlines. Any further color on that?\nRobin Hayes: Yes. I'll hand you over to our quarantine expert, Joanna, Jamie, for this one.\nJamie Baker: Thanks, Robin.\nJoanna Geraghty: Hi, Jamie. How are you doing? Maybe to provide a little bit of color, when California came off the quarantine list, we saw upside in bookings. And so as we think about the Northeast and potential upside there, that's how we see it. I will say that when the quarantines were first put into place, we definitely saw more cancels and it's slowing. But as people have adjusted to those quarantines. And in the case of Connecticut, Massachusetts, with the testing out options, they understand the ability to reduce the link of the quarantine through a negative test or eliminate entirely. We've absolutely seen demand coming back. From our perspective, we're spending an enormous amount of time on testing. And maybe to provide a little color there. There's a lot of talk about a vaccine. We don't believe a vaccine is necessarily a panacea. We definitely think it's critical to longer-term recovery. But in terms of returning to something that even looks remotely like a pre-pandemic travel level, we're going to need to have in the short and medium term, a rapid testing strategy that balances the public health considerations economic recovery and allows countries and states to reopen or relax and eliminate what we see is largely ineffective quarantines and other travel restrictions. So we're spending a lot of time on that right now. Spending a lot of time with states and international, many of our Caribbean destinations. But we believe there's a combination of testing and longer-term vaccine that will be the method by which quarantines, which we believe are largely ineffective, will be reduced or eliminated.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That's helpful. Second question for Steve. On the sale-leaseback activity, can you give us an idea as to the economics of the lease component? How monthly rates - any deals compared to what you were being offered before the downturn? And also, have you thought about any sort of revised lease versus own ratio going forward just in hopes of better variabilizing, which I guess is the increasingly popular term, variabilizing your cost structure?\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Jamie, and good morning. I'd sort of bifurcate the sale leaseback activity in terms of the work we did on some of the older vintage aircraft, the older A320s and the newer neos that we've been doing sale lease back on. I have been pleasantly surprised. I'm obviously not going to get into the economics on the call. But I've been pleasantly surprised about the transactions that we've managed to go forward with. We did them obviously towards the start of the last quarter. And the work has been done, and there was a pretty good demand for JetBlue metal. So I was pretty pleased with where we ended up with -- from a sort of rates perspective. And so the team and a big shout-out to the team, there were complex transactions and the work that the teams worked through to make that happen was outstanding. With regard to your question about sales-lease back, so I've been very public about my views of this over the last 3 years, which we have leaned because of the relatively strong position that JetBlue has had, the strength of our balance sheet, the cash that we've thrown off from operations meant that for the aircraft deliveries, we generally steered away from sale-lease backs. Obviously, we're in unprecedented times, and we've used this as a balance to continue to generate cash for JetBlue and bring cash into the business. And so in the short term, we have notched up our proportionality of the fleet is in the sale-lease back. But I certainly - looking forward back to pre-pandemic situation, we're genuinely more geared towards the ownership side of things on our fleet going forward.\nJamie Baker: Got it. Thank you both. Take care.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thank you. Good morning. As much as I want to ask another quarantine New York question and play out my holiday \u2013 as much as I want to ask you another quarantine question, I won't. So just with respect to the value of a premium cabin right now in the early stages of recovery if you compare like-for-like, say, A320 high-density to A321, or A321 high-density to A321 with Mint. Which one is more profitable? And if you had a clean slate right now, would you be leaning more on density or premium?\nJoanna Geraghty: I'll take it and then ask Dave to add any color. So at this point, both are performing about the same. We do like Mint in terms of providing the additional space and the additional opportunity for customers on longer haul travel. It's performing \u2013 TransCon is actually performing pretty well relative to our other markets. Dave, do you have anything you'd like to add?\nDave Clark: I think you've covered it well. Clearly, customers appreciate the extra space an excellent product that goes with our cabin. So it's always been extremely popular. As mentioned before, the [indiscernible] on Transcon is coming back. You have to really knit out the mix of routes though because the high densities, which largely go down in the Caribbean are performing quite well in that region, given the strength of the Transcon traffic.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I think you pushed the pause button on it, but can you just tell us how you're thinking about the A320 refresh? And where that stands today and kind of where that would be in order of your priorities when you begin to invest again?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Duane, I'll pick that up. It's Steve here. We did initially put the full pause button on the 320 program. As of September, we have started back up again. It's pretty de minimis, Duane, to be honest, we're sort of doing one shell at a time. The big thing I would say is that, the vast majority of the capital expenditure that we had at our leased back program was already sunk. We sort of brought that into the fleet in terms of the kits, the seats, et cetera. But we've \u2013 obviously, our customers appreciate the Newark cabin as they sort of come through. So we're sort of steadily doing one at a time as we sort of go through as a very, very slow ramp. And then we'll \u2013 depending on the demand environment, depending on the revenue environment, we'll assess in 2021 when we start ramping things up again to complete the fleet.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nSteve Priest: Thanks, Duane. Have a good day.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. So this one for Steve, just a question on your structural cost program. I know before COVID, you'd already locked in above the high end of your $250 million to $300 million run rate target. And that was before the engine deal you've secured in time. But how should we think about the incremental cost savings we should be expecting next year versus maybe 2019, just from this program exclusively. So what of that cost savings of over 100 \u2013 over, excuse me, $300 million is flowing through in 2020? And then, what will be incremental next year? Thanks.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Catherine. Good morning. First of all, I would like to say how pleased in terms of where we are with our continuing focus on our cost structure. The structural cost program set us up extremely well to your point, I think for two reasons. One, it's really embedded a culture of cost consciousness across the whole of JetBlue.  And secondly, there was a very significant number of initiatives that we've been able to build upon as we've navigated through the crisis. I think when I stand back and think about our cost structure, outside fuel, obviously, the biggest costs associated with both sort of labor, our crew members and our business partners from external spend perspective. And so the way we're thinking about this, Katy, is a couple of things. Number one, taking a real sort of focused look at taking fixed costs out of our business. And we've already started doing a lot of things in the short term, which will stand the test of time, so they truly will be structural as we sort of did before and building on the $320 million that we delivered coming into the 2020 year. The way we think about this is, obviously, we'll continue to use that -- those initiatives and additional cost savings as we go through '21. The thing we're thinking about is, as we get at some point in 2022 and back to some sort of normality around capacity is getting back on that industry-leading curve in terms of unit cost progression. We were leading consensus for the whole industry in 2020. We're top of the industry in 2019. And we're looking forward to at some point in 2022, getting back on to that unit cost progression that you saw in early 2020.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Got it. And then probably another one for you, Steve, actually, just on the aircraft deferrals, with the neo delays over the last couple of years and then production cuts in the COVID era. Were any of these deferrals at the request of Airbus asking to push back deliveries? Or will these all push back at the request of JetBlue? And then should we assume that any of that $2 billion reduction in CapEx is concessions and delays? Or are those all aircraft just moving out of the period? Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Thanks, Kate. And I'll mention this in my prepared comments. I do want to again thank our partner Airbus. I think we've navigated this crisis together. It's been a partnership as we've had numerous discussions over the preceding months. Just to keep this very simple. It shells, right? We have moved over 50% of our A321 order book out of 2020, 2022 to a point in the future, which has delivered the reduction of the sort of $2 billion-ish of CapEx over those two years, so it's been a joint process. This is purely around deferral of aircraft. And I feel now that we've got the balance right between navigating the crisis we sort of go through this and bringing in sort of high margin, high-return aircraft to supplement the JetBlue fleet.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Good morning. Two easy ones for me. Steve, what level of ASMs do you think you need to fly to get CASM ex back to 2019?\nSteve Priest: Well, in terms of -- it's interesting when we sort of look at it with regards to 2022. There's a couple of things I would sort of say. So obviously, it depends on the demand and capacity recovery. But having deferred over sort of $2 billion -- around $2 billion of deferred CapEx, we are expecting less growth than we had with regards to the pre-COVID environment. And so the denominator and dose is going to be lower than we had expected in '22. But in terms of our overall cost structure, the initiatives that we've sort of taken going forward puts us in good shape, and that's why we're sort of assuming that we'll get back to sort of that level in 2022. But it's very, very early at this point, Joe, to start sort of thinking about exactly what capacity we're intending to fly. But this is the planned assumption that we're working through, and we'll continue to evolve that as we navigate through 2021 and getting towards that. But I remain confident in the tremendous work that the company and our crew members are doing to wrestle with our overall cost structure, to make sure we drive back to those efficiencies.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Steve, is it closer to 80% of 2019 capacity you need to get to or is it 95%?\nSteve Priest: I think the way I would describe it is, we have anticipated -- I mean, who knows what's going to happen in the demand environment. But by the time we're getting back into sort of 2022, I would expect us to be nearer to the higher end of the sort of 2019 capacity.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then maybe a question for Dave or Joanna, just the mix of business versus leisure from a revenue standpoint for you all, and then kind of the importance of the business traffic to your pre-COVID earnings power? Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. So, it's largely leisure. I mean there's very de minimis business travel in there. And as we've said, since the onset of this pandemic, we do believe leisure VFR traffic will be the sort of path to recovery out of this well before business travel. VFR tends to be quite resilient in times like this, and we're seeing that absolutely play out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Joanna, I want to come back to a response, you had to one of the questions. I think you mentioned testing. Do you guys think that could play a bigger role? And can you be proactive in helping bridge the gap between authorities and travel restrictions? And I guess, as a follow-up to that, who's going to bear the cost of that if it is a solution?\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. So we are absolutely being proactive with regard to testing from a few angles. First, we're actively working with governments, states, whether it's states or international governments to put into place a consistent testing framework. First, that customers understand, part of the challenges, they're all different. So that creates a level of confusion for customers. And then ultimately, that countries and states will, upon providing proof of a negative test, allow a customer to test out of or reduce the length of these quarantines. Right now, as we see it, there's home testing options, which we've announced one, and we're working on a few others, and then also looking at pre-departure testing facilities in the airport. Environment, there's a number of locations that have rolled those out. We're also exploring that. At the end of the day, we believe we need a cost-effective, so very inexpensive, rapid, think five minutes antigen test that can accurately detect COVID in both symptomatic and asymptomatic people. So ideally, a test that can be applied on a pre-departure basis or even one that you could use in your home, think of like a lateral flow pregnancy test that you could actually take before you leave that you could do on your own. And I think that's how we see kind of the future moving. In terms of who would bear the cost, obviously, it depends on whether it's a government initiative, whether it's an airline initiative right now, the cost of test, they're all PCR tests largely are about $150, give or take, that we're not adding any kind of revenue share or anything of that. We're just passing on the cost of the test to customers when they purchase through Bolt, which is our current partner. But we haven't explored how we would cost share anything around testing. We think you need a very inexpensive $10, $15 test. And the key here is a test that can detect COVID in asymptomatic people. Right now, there are not any tests out there that are antigen rapid test that can actually detect, COVID in asymptomatic people. The PCR test that many of you take that we take, that's sort of the gold standard. That's pretty expensive. It needs to be administered by a clinician, by a doctor. And we do not see that as a longer-term cost effective solution.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yeah. I guess you kind of answered it, but there is a lot of price elasticity there, right, if things get too expensive?\nJoanna Geraghty: Sorry, this thing is clicked. So a lot of price elasticity with testing?\nBrandon Oglenski: Yeah. I guess, on your customer base, right?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yeah. I mean, I don't think it's something that customers necessarily are going to be willing to -- it's not something, I think we envision passing on through our far or anything in that nature. This is something, I think, we -- as we are right now, setting up a partnership with various companies. And customers would reach out and directly procure the test from those companies and pay for it on their own.\nBrandon Oglenski: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Hey Joanna, I thought, I heard you mention that you had sort of finished up the work with American, on the loyalty program. And I'm just curious, what elements of the partnership can you rollout now before DOT, DOJ approval? Or can you proceed without their blessing at this point?\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. I'm going to have Scott take that one.\nScott Laurence: Hey Mike. It's Scott here. How are you? So again, I think we want to be respectful of, what we're doing with regulators. And again, I think as we move forward with that, obviously, we're excited about all the elements of this, including frequent traveler. But I think the -- our focus, obviously, is bringing low fares and growth to the Northeast points and a faster recovery. So again, I think it's sort of what we could do. We're moving toward, I think, a close on this. And I think we'll be in a better position to kind of move forward more holistically. So I don't think it's a matter of what we can do, versus what we want to do. I believe that we're moving forward in a timeframe that allows us to kind of move in a way that makes sense.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Great, that's helpful. And then, just on my second question. And Scott, this is maybe for you, and/or Dave, when you look at just your yields relative to others, you guys are running a lot a bit higher? I mean, you've been in positive territory for the past couple of quarters, but your loads are also a lot lower. And I realize that some of that may be a function of blocking the Middle seat. And I know that I think it was mid-October, you sort of modified that to go from blocking the middle seat to maybe booking up to, I think, 70% or something. And then it looks like maybe in early December that goes away. You haven't seen anything maybe to counteract that. How should we think about though the yield trends, as that lifts? Are we going to get, as we move into the fourth quarter? Will we see lower yields, higher, higher loads and ultimately, a better RASM there? I mean, do you feel like maybe you're leaving some revenue on the table, because you have this middle seat block? So sort of a multi-pronged question, however best you can answer? Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. I'll take it. And then I'll ask Dave or Scott to add some color. So as we've said since the onset, the Middle seat block has largely been about rebuilding customer confidence in travel. And w absolutely recognize that longer term it's not something that's sustainable and that as loads come back, the cost of the middle seat block is quite expensive. And so what you've seen us announce through December 1 is that we are letting seats just below 70%, and we'll continue to increase those lids longer-term based upon what the recent safety studies have come out saying that the aircraft cabin is inherently safe, safer than most indoor events. And so as we see into the holidays upside, frankly, as seats open up both in terms of fair, but also in terms of load.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thanks, Joanna.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJoe Caiado: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks very much. Steve, your Q4 average daily cash burn outlook excludes any onetime costs associated with severance or employee separation-related expenses. Is that right? And if so, could you just tell us what those expenses are expected to be in Q4? And if you got it for 2021 as well, please?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Joe. It's Steve. You're correct. It's excluded. We actually -- obviously, in the sort of public statement, and I'll answer in the prepared comments. The opt-out provision that we took about special item in Q2 is $58 million. And so that is absolute lion's share of what you're going to see with regards to that in terms of what we know at the moment. We've - our crewmembers have really sort of stepped up, and I won't say it's opportunity to thank them to support us through that. Obviously, with regard to slide 21, we're not sort of getting into any of that yet because we don't know what the future holds. But the lion's share, the absolute lion's share has already been booked in Q3. \nJoe Caiado: Got it. Thanks for clarifying that. And then just a quick follow-up, maybe for Joanna. I think as part of your revenue initiatives, you highlighted on the slide an upgrade of the revenue management optimization system. And I'm just curious, didn't you recently upgrade the RM system in the last year or two? And so can you describe exactly what this upgrade is and what capabilities you're unlocking with that? Thanks for the time everyone.\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. Dave Clark is very excited to talk about our new RM system, so I'll pass it over to him. \nDave Clark: Sure. Thanks for the question. As mentioned, we're in the process of upgrading to Sabre's newest version of the revenue management system called Revenue Optimizer. We have been talking about this for a few years. This is part of our continuous improvement of revenue management tools, which was part of our 2018 Investor Day. It's a more sophisticated system. We'll have better abilities to forecast demand, understand customer elasticity, things like that. Planning to cut over later this quarter and reworking the team process, the business process and the team structure to maximize the benefits of the new tool. So I'm excited later this quarter when we start using it in production.\nJoe Caiado: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. My first question is for Robin or Joanna. Just on, obviously, leisure has been leading the recovery here. General consensus is that leisure continues to outperform corporate over the next few years, you clearly have this major oriented network. And based on your comments today, it doesn't really seem like your Northeast flying is as big of a hindrance as maybe it could be.  But just when I look at your total revenue growth here, it's been more in line with network carriers and your 4Q kind projection is similar to them as well. I guess my question is, what do you think is the catalyst for JetBlue to begin to outperform on the top line? Or do you think just this big fight for the leisure traveler might prevent that from happening? Would love to get your thoughts there.\nRobin Hayes: Yes. No. Thanks, I'll maybe start that and then pass over to Joanna. Look, the Northeast issue has been very, very significant. We saw in Q2, for example, and we all know this, how the Northeast was the most impacted in terms of coronavirus. And I think we did a really, really good job in Q2, bringing down our OpEx accordingly. As we've gone into Q3, we are still whilst, of course, the Northeast states have done a terrific job over the last few months on keeping the case count down. There are still significant parts of New York that people come and visit that aren't open. So Broadway, for example, is shut down well into next year. So I do think that some of the demand trends that we've seen into the Northeast, both business and leisure. And then we also have -- Joanna talked about the quarantines. And yes, compliance the quarantines, I would say, is mixed at best, and I'm being kind, but nevertheless, it is a barrier for people to fly. And we also see positive traction when states create test out exceptions for quarantine -- that is a positive catalyst. So I can't understate -- I mean, I think the team has done a terrific job mitigating the impact. We were the first airline to redeploy a large amount of new flying. Those 30 new routes. We've done it again, but -- and those act is a good mitigant. And so I think that we will continue to do that. We will continue to manage that accordingly, but we're going to continue, I think, to see headwinds into the Northeast for the coming months. And I think as we think about Thanksgiving, we're encouraging states to think about a testing option. I mean, if people are coming back for Thanksgiving and quarantine in at home, yes, but what we're seeing now, of course, is virus spread in people's homes. So actually testing either before you leave or when you get here, actually you could have, I think, a really positive impact on public health as well as helping us, I think, deal with some of the demand headwinds that quarantine bring. Joanna, anything to add?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. I mean, I think I'd just add, leisure VFR is what we are built to do. It's what we were founded on, and we got a product, a price point, a cost structure all built for leisure. And as we navigate through this crisis and see that, that's where the demand is. We are uniquely positioned to meet that demand and recover more quickly when carriers that are overly reliant on business travel.\nAndrew Didora: Understood. Thank you. And then my second question just for Steve. I know you get this -- you probably get this question a lot, but just wanted to get your thoughts on where you think kind of liquidity requirements move to sort of on the back end of the pandemic? And I ask because you clearly have a couple of years' worth of liquidity on your balance sheet right now at fourth quarter cash burn levels. So just trying to get a -- just trying to figure out how quickly the balance sheet can be repaired once we start to see demand recover more robustly here? Thank you. \nSteve Priest: Thanks, Andrew. And I'll make this brief. I've again, been delighted with the work the treasury team have done. I've described it before as having a steady hand on the tiller. We've been flexible. We've been measured in terms of how we've gone through and raise liquidity coming into the crisis with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. We kept about 10% to 12% cash of trailing 12 months revenue. I think undoubtedly, Andrew, we are in a position where the industry as a whole will be rethinking that going forward. Obviously, we're in a once in a generational pandemic but at the same time, I think those that have had stronger balance sheets like us coming into this will obviously benefit going forward. So we'll certainly assess that as we come out to the size. During the pandemic, as we are at the moment, having over $3 billion in the bank and sort of navigating that through making sure that I can speak well at night. And balance sheet repair is absolutely at the forefront of our thinking. We've got to get down to eliminate the cash burn, really focus on the margins and start driving positive cash from operations. But, as Robin said in his prepared comments, the balance sheet repair is right at the front of our thinking as we come out this side of the crisis.\nAndrew Didora: Thank you everyone.\nSteve Priest: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Myles Walton from UBS. Your line is open.\nMyles Walton: Great. Thanks. So the last couple of quarters, last quarter and then this upcoming quarter, you're looking at, your guiding to a 30% incremental drop through. And Steve, maybe just looking into 2021, is that an appropriate drop-through to be looking at for operating earnings relative to revenue growth? Or are there other costs perhaps coming back to the system that you've maybe avoided or better cost savings that are going to be in the structural run rate?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Myles. I think I'd start off with a couple of the headwinds. I think that generally, people have got to sort of think about, obviously, in the very, very short-term, you're going to sort of have a bit of a peak in terms of medical costs as you sort of come out the back end of the quarter where people have put some elective procedures off, et cetera. But the biggest two that I think we've got a navigate in the sort of immediate future, is rents and landing fees, where you think about the sort of public entities and the airports where they have less traffic going through. So, that puts natural pressure on the cost structure. And in addition, as the volumes of our customers go up, thinking about sort of the amount of sort of cleaning services and initiatives that the industry as a whole has got to put forward. So when I think about the headwinds they are probably the couple. In terms of the work that we're doing in terms of the tailwinds, that's really, as I've said before in my previous answers to questions. We've done a tremendous job at JetBlue through the structural cost program. We've really taken a HAM into some of the bigger cost items. Think about engine maintenance, think about heavy maintenance. Think about taking fixed costs out. But also predominantly over the last few months, we've been shifting fixed cost to variable. We've done some outsourcing from an airport standpoint. We've done some in-sourcing to drive millions of dollars of benefits in our tech UPS organization. We're bringing some heavy maintenance work. So we're leaving no stone unturned to make sure we get back on to that sort of 2020 -- early 2020 trajectory as we get into the sort of 2022 financial year. So I'm pleased with the progress we're making.\nMyles Walton: Okay. I\u2019ll leave that one. Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Thank you very much, Myles.\nDavid Fintzen: And that concludes our third quarter 2020 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: And again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 2, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-07-28 17:21:06", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Nora. I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations, David Fintzen.

And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue\u2019s CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Dave. And good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. As forth with all of our crew members who have been impacted by the ongoing pandemic, especially the families, friends and loved ones of those we have lost at JetBlue. I am sorry to say, that we are deeply saddened to have lost two more crew members to coronavirus both on July the 16th. We remember Brittany Jones from our Airport Operations team at Fort Lauderdale who join JetBlue just over a year ago. She was known for her kindness and optimism with customers and her colleagues alike. We also have remember; Orlando Tavares, who was a Quality Control Inspector in Technical Operations and he most recently served on a temporary duty assignment in Fort Lauderdale. During his eight year career with JetBlue, he exhibited our values working with passion and pride in everything he did and considered himself \u201d JetBlue 100%\u201d. Losing two beloved members of our JetBlue family, on the same day is a painful reminder of this pandemics reach and severity. In the last quarter, we\u2019ve also seen issues of racial equality come to the forefront and prompted the long overdue dialogue around racial equality and justice in this country. At JetBlue, we were born with a mission to inspire humanity and there\u2019s no more opportune time for us to show exactly what this means than through our actions. We\u2019re looking inward, addressing our own processes and policies at JetBlue. We have started to work with our crew members to prioritize meaningful changes that they would like to see in support of inclusiveness and racial equality. Leading with our values, we are committed to ensuring that we look at our business practices, through the lens of diversity, equality, and inclusion. As a company, we\u2019ve also faced - we are also faced with a historic decline in demand. And the reality of needing to be a smaller company for the time being. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the sacrifice made by our crew members who have decided to take voluntary opt out or participate in our voluntary time off programs which helps us adjust our staffing to the incredible drop in demand that our industry is facing. By stepping up, they have protected, many jobs at JetBlue, helping us to navigate the most difficult period in our history. We wholeheartedly thank them for their amazing contributions at JetBlue and to those of you who are leaving, we wish you all the very best in your next chapter. Turning to slide four of our presentation. For the second quarter, we reported a gap loss of $1.18 per share. Despite reporting a truly staggering loss that reflects the steep fall in demand that started in late February, we have been decisive in taking actions to protect JetBlue and to emerge stronger as we manage the recovery. In the past two months, we\u2019ve made progress in reducing our cash burn and have been quick to resize operations in this dynamic demand environment. Despite a recent softening in demand, we are still on track to take our cash burn to between $7 million to $9 million a day in the third quarter. Since April, we raised nearly $1 billion in liquidity and our balance sheet remains among the strongest in the industry. While demand have improved materially from the historic low we thought in April, bookings remain choppy and we remain focused on addressing changing trends as we progress the summer. Our network continues to be impacted by Scott spikes in COVID cases and quarantine measures. But we have seen that customers are willing to travel to see their family and friends. It is highly likely that this recovery would not be linear, but our smaller size allows us to respond quickly to changes in demand. We are confident that our low cost, low fare leisure model, coupled with our trusted brand will be instrumental, and central in navigating recovery. Let\u2019s move on to slide five of our presentation. We recognize that recovery starts with rebuilding customers\u2019 competence in flying again. At the onset of this crisis, we created a comprehensive approach we call safety from the ground up. Our focus has been on taking all precautions with health and safety protocols, so that our crew members and customers are safe on the ground and of course in the air. We\u2019ve laid out a three step recovery framework to set JetBlue up for success, and to emerge stronger over the coming years. The first is to reduce our cash burn. Despite the challenge and volatile revenue environment, we have been nimble, taking capacity actions to add revenue and minimize variable costs and continue to make progress in reducing our daily cash burn. The second step is to rebuild our margins. On the revenue front, we are working through - we are working on a series of initiatives that we believe will accelerate revenue recovery and strengthen our relevance and our focus it is. We are seizing on unique network opportunities repurposing our assets and entering into strategic partnerships. These actions will make us stronger and make us more competitive and ultimately bring our superior product and service to more customers. On the cost front, we\u2019re resizing JetBlue meaningfully to mitigate the impact of lower demand and Steve shortly will provide details about our efforts to double down on our low cost model. We believe that executing on our costs will again be pivotal to rebuilding our margins. The third and last step is to repair our balance sheet. Although, we have raised a substantial amount of liquidity in a short period, we are committed to returning to pre-COVID leveraged metrics. I want to briefly touch upon our network strategy to position JetBlue for recovery, continuing the work we\u2019ve put in place prior to the start of the pandemic. We recently announced a significant reallocation of our assets in our network flying to 30 new markets, launching between July and October. In the near term, we believe this move will support our efforts to generate cash and respond to demand. In the longer-term, it will strengthen our New York focus city, with more flying out of New York, including award-winning Mint Transcon service On the West Coast, moving our primary base of operations from Long Beach to LA will bring new competition to the airport and position JetBlue strategically to grow in the future, including International Service that was just not possible at Long Beach. I\u2019d like to take a moment and thank Los Angeles World Airports for their continued support, our efforts to grow our presence in LA. Lastly, we have entered into a strategic partnership with American Airlines. This new and unique partnership will accelerate our recovery from the impact of the coronavirus and strengthen our ability to compete with our peers in the northeast, offering our low fares and improved service to more routes to both to customers in both New York and Boston. For the past 20 years, we have succeeded against the odds, and we firmly believe that we are laying the foundation and repositioning JetBlue has come out of this crisis as a stronger global player in the years to come. Once again, thanks to all our incredible crew members for playing such an incredibly vital role to JetBlue during these most challenging times. With that, I\u2019d like to pass over to Joanna.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. I\u2019ll start with a heartfelt thank you to our crew members. These past few months have been the most challenging in our 20-year history, and we cannot be more thankful and proud of their kindness and professionalism, caring for one another, and caring for our customers. I\u2019d also like to give them a special shout out for their amazing work, which was recently recognized by Travel + Leisure magazine. For the second year in a row, JetBlue was rated the number one domestic airline in the 2020 world. During this unique time, this award speaks to the hard work and exceptional service that our crew members deliver every day. In addition, we\u2019re also very pleased to see our industry leading and record high Net Promoter Scores, reflecting how well JetBlue is meeting the commitments of our safety from the ground up program. Customers historically chose JetBlue for our fares, great service and product. Choice drivers have shifted to cleanliness, physical distancing and facial covering compliance, and customers are telling us what is working and how well we are performing against our own plans. JetBlue already offers a leading differentiated and preferred experience and I cannot be more proud of our crew members who are delivering on our safety promise, which matters now more than ever. Moving on to slide seven, as Robin mentioned, we\u2019re laser focused on managing the current volatile demand environment, due to increasing case counts and shifting government quarantine and international entry requirements. In the short-term, we\u2019re managing and shifting capacity with a focus on operating only those flights that cover our variable costs. In the long-term, we are solidifying our network strategy to build and consolidate our focus cities. We\u2019re taking advantage of unique opportunities presented by the pandemic that will allow us to rebuild our margins, when demand return. Starting with new work, our added flying solidifies our relevance in the New York metro area by bringing low fares, and our industry leading product and service, including Mint to more customers. This will ultimately bring our New York operations to 60 daily flights post recovery. South Florida, we remain steadfast in our long-term plan to grow Fort Lauderdale to 140 flights per day, bringing our product and our service to more customers. With the addition of two international gates, our focus is on connectivity to promote origin and destination traffic between our domestic and Latin networks. We believe that improving scheduled connectivity will enhance our already successful point to point strategy in this high value geography. On the West Coast, we announced the closure of Long Beach, due to performance, and are moving the operation to LAX, one of the strongest markets in our network. This consolidation and an otherwise gate constrained airport will help us reduce costs and improve our margins, with more profitable flying. It will also set us up longer term to expand both domestically and internationally. Longer term, we think 2025, we envision taking LAX to 70 flights per day. We look forward to growing in the future with the support of Los Angeles World Airports. Moving on to our recently announced Northeast partnership with American Airlines. We\u2019ve built a strategic relationship that combines the strengths of both airlines, positions JetBlue as a global player, and we believe creates a faster path to recovery. By adding more routes to our network, our customers will have access to more destinations, and frequencies. This partnership includes 130 new routes for American customers and 60 new non-stop for JetBlue customers. Our combined networks will also significantly strengthen our Boston and New York focus cities. In Boston, this partnership will allow us to bring our low fares to more markets quicker. In the case of New York, we will be able to compete more effectively with larger airlines, overcoming the current limitations to grow in the slot constrained airspace. While we are currently working through the regulatory process, we anticipate entering into reciprocal codeshare and loyalty agreements, offering low fares, improved schedules and options for connectivity. Loyalty members for both airlines will also be able to earn and burn miles on both airlines networks. Driving loyalty is a significant focus for JetBlue, and these enhancements will go a long way toward making TrueBlue even more beneficial to our customers. We look forward to bringing the JetBlue effect to more customers, and more markets in the near-future. Turning to slide eight, and the current demand environment. Bookings and traffic volumes improved revenue sequentially during May and June, from down 93% to down 83% year-over-year, volumes have increased since demand bottom now in April, and during the second quarter, our revenue broadly tracked to our L-shaped recovery forecast. Although, we saw some demand recovery. The COVID resurgence in late June and the tri-state quarantine has not surprisingly, pressured demand. We expect demand will continue to be volatile, and recovery will not be perfectly linear as customer\u2019s willingness to travel evolves as regions reopen for business, and as infection rates change over time. In terms of geography, during the second quarter, traffic between the Northeast and South Florida held up relatively better throughout the back half of the quarter, and we saw a relative strengthening of our transcon markets. Both of these regions have traditionally been strong profit drivers for JetBlue supported by the strong VFR, and leisure demands. Due to the tri-state quarantine, and increasing case counts in much of the south, we continue to experience near-term volatility. When these regions stabilize, we expect they will support our recovery, given the pent up demand we saw for travel. Latin VFR demand remained strong through the quarter, especially in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, where we have tactically added back capacity in response to demand. We have resumed service to 15 Latin destinations during the month of July, with more coming online in the later portion of the summer as always, driven by demand strength. The situation in the region continues to evolve as foreign governments are starting to reopen their borders to international flying. Our government affairs team and international stations have done a great job managing a concerted effort to bring this important region back online, subject to restrictions, we expect more than 50% of our Latin capacity to be in place by the end of the summer. And we remain committed to this region as a long-term source of superior margins. Based on forward bookings and current planning assumptions, we are estimating our third quarter revenue to decline approximately 80% year-over-year, in some markets industry capacity has returned faster than demand, putting downward pressure on fares and creating a headwind to revenue, even as more customers travel given the choppiness in demand, we will continue to take a conservative approach and planning capacity. We recently extended our middle seat blocking policy through Labor Day, continuing our efforts to instill confidence in customers, and deliberately making investments to protect our revenue base. The cost of our policy is relatively small and less than 10% of our flights are currently reaching the lids we put in place to maintain physical distance in the cabin. We believe that this is the right decision at present, because our customers continue to tell us that this policy is important for them as they choose JetBlue, among many carriers. We continue to evaluate our seat policy, balancing the needs of our customers with our efforts to reduce cash burn and rebuild our margins. Moving to capacity on slide 9. We\u2019ve managed our capacity to safeguard the financial security of JetBlue, since the start of the pandemic we have been among the most aggressive carriers to make schedule reductions, we\u2019re also putting into place a process for closing cancellations to avoid costs and mitigate cash burns. As a result of our actions, our second quarter capacity declined 85% year-over-year after making deep cuts in our forward schedule during March, we adjusted our flying following demand. In May and June, we added capacity back to generate cash when demand was improving. As we saw signs of demand trends stalling, we shifted back to reducing capacity. And I\u2019ve recently pulled 15 to 20 points from our August schedules. Overall, we will continue to monitor demand trends and we\u2019ll adjust capacity to reflect the current demand environment. For the third quarter, our current planning assumption is for capacity to decline, at least 45% year-over-year, our guiding criteria is cash generation, and we will continue to react to changes in demand trends rationalizing and pulling capacity is needed before each schedule month is flown. Our teams have done an outstanding job in strategically managing our fleet to minimize maintenance and fuel costs. Well, we have started to bring some aircraft back from temporary storage; we will remain flexible supporting our goals to generate cash. We have a firm grip on cash breakeven economics and a solid process to manage capacity towards cash generation. Thank you again to our crew members for continuing to serve our customers and maintaining a safe operation. Steve, over to you.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Joanna. And good morning, everyone. I would like to add my thanks to our crew members. Even with the challenges presented in their personal lives, they\u2019ve continued to live our values and work tirelessly to protect the financial sustainability of JetBlue. I\u2019ll start on slide 11, with a brief overview of our financial results for the quarter. Revenue was 215 million down 90% year-over-year operating expenses were down 66% year-over-year excluding the benefits from care that, on salaries wages and benefits, operating expenses about 50% year-over-year. GAAP loss per diluted share was $1.18 and adjusted last diluted share was $2.2. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27% on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to manage through this fluid environment with a near-term focus on preserving liquidity. Just as importantly we are positioning JetBlue to thrive as we emerge from the pandemic. We\u2019re putting JetBlue back on a path to long-term success following a three step framework that Robin introduced. First, reducing our cash burn, second, we\u2019re building our margins. And third, we are paying our balance sheet. Moving to slide 12, our treasury team has done an exceptional job, executing capital raises and exceeded that goal to raise at least $750 million of additional liquidity. Last month we raised just under $750 million with a new term loan backed by JFK, LaGuardia and Washington Reagan slots, as well as, as JetBlue brands. This is the first time in the industry that an airline has used its brand as collateral. We also entered into a sale and leaseback transaction that raised nearly $120 million during the quarter. Our total liquidity, including restricted and unrestricted cash the crisis of $3.4 billion at the close of June or 42% of our 2019 revenue. In July, we have executed further sell these backs that will add an additional $200 million to our liquidity, bringing the total amount raised since April to roughly $1 billion. We are now shifting our focus to refinancing the 364 term loan that we executed back in March. The team has also been working closely with the U.S. government and its advisors PJT on our application for the CARES Act loan. As a reminder, we are eligible for up to $1.14 billion, over the forthcoming weeks, we will assess our needs to access the loan. As early cash burn improved every single month since April to earned $8 million at the end of June. We\u2019ve proven during the quarter came mainly from our efforts to manage capacity, reduce our cash base and manage payment terms. Small improvements in revenue trends during the quarter also contributed to our progress in cash burn. Looking into the third quarter, we continue to estimate our daily cash burn between $7 and $9 million, mainly driven by a continuation of our work to reduce our cost base and capacity actions to respond to the changes in demand. While we fall within the range will depend on the revenue environment during the third quarter. Our expectation is to further reduce our daily cash burn, in the fourth quarter, but a mindful of the continued uncertainty, in the revenue environment. Turning to slide 13, while we\u2019re focused on the near-term, and reducing our cash burn. We\u2019re also laying down the foundation to rebuild our margins. We are in the midst of a company wide effort to resize JetBlue to add demand assumptions, cost is one of the most important levers that we can control, so much stronger from the crisis. During the second quarter, our operating expenses in our P&L declined 50% year-over-year. This figure excludes the payroll benefit from the CARES Act. This impressive achievement is a result of a concerted effort of our teams who have been relentless to protect the financial viability of JetBlue. In the short term, we succeeded at reducing our variable costs by taking aggressive capacity actions and quickly reducing the size of our operation, our focus is shifted to restructuring our fixed cost base, by making the organization even better to respond to rapid changes in demand. We continue to focus on external spend with our business partners and to make our support centers more efficient. We are pleased to announce that we have entered into a long term maintenance agreement for our SelectOne engines, helping us manage through one of the largest items of external spend. We have also added flexibility in staffing for most of our frontline work groups through time-off programs. This added flexibility will serve us well from a need to dial down capacity and will give us the ability to ramp up quickly when demand returns. We\u2019re truly thankful to all of our crew members who have stepped up to protect the financial future of JetBlue. Given the uncertainty of recovery, we are managing headcount needs in this fluid environment through voluntary programs. We\u2019ve already had around 25% of our crew members sign up for volunteer time off program or opt-out package, and we expect to see these numbers increase as we continue to offer additional voluntary programs. Our goal has been to make it through this period without furloughing crew members, if at all possible. With the CARES Act payroll support that gets us through September and our voluntary programs in the way, we believe we have a path to protecting many jobs. Our crewmembers willingness to take voluntary actions speaks very highly about culture and the resilience as a team. For the third quarter, we expect total operating expenses to decline by nearly 35% year-over-year, in line with capacity ads that respond to the demand trends we saw during the second quarter. Based upon the recent execution of our restructure cost program, we are confident that we will again succeed in reaching our cost goals. We believe that our network actions, coupled with our cost restructuring efforts will help us rebuild our margins. Moving to slide 14. In early July, we took delivery of one A321neo, taking our fleet to 263 aircraft. We are currently managing the economics of bringing back aircraft into our network, and have the ability to start retiring some aircraft early. As we move through recovery, we will continue to evaluate the size and shape of our fleet to support our goals to reduce cash burn and execute our network plans to rebuild our margins. We expect that total CapEx for 2020 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million, and we expect to finance the remaining deliveries this year through sale leasebacks. We view our future CapEx as an investment to rebuild our margins, given the economics of adding newer and more fuel efficient aircraft into our fleet. We are mindful of the financial commitments tied to our current order book and we will continue to revisit our CapEx forecasts, as we navigate the crisis. Moving to slide 15. At the end of June, our debt to cap ratio is 55%, which reflects our recent financing transactions. Given our current debt level, we anticipate cash, principal and interest payments through the end of 2020 of approximately $130 million per quarter. We remain committed to working again towards reaching investment grade metrics, similar to those that we proudly exhibited, not too long ago. Over the next couple of years we expect to approach our capital structure by balancing our goal of repairing our balance sheet, while making creative investments that create value for our stakeholders. We remain optimistic about the future of JetBlue. As in past crises, we believe we can emerge stronger as an airline. We certainly have the best crew members in the industry and brands that customers truly love. We operate in high-value geography with our low cost leisure model that positions us well for future success. On behalf of the JetBlue leadership team, I want to again thank all of our crew members as well as our business partners and our communities for all of their tremendous support during the past few months. We will now take your questions.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, everyone. Nora, we\u2019re ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning to the team. So my first question relates to the pilot deal that was announced at the beginning of the month. It appears that the primary impetus from management\u2019s perspective was being able to announce the American relationship partnership, but there do appear to be some other smallish tweaks in the deal. Should we be thinking about any temporary or even permanent cost reductions or efficiencies? Or is the pilot deal really best viewed as something you needed in order to do proceed with the American announcement?\nJoanna Geraghty: Hi, Jamie, this is Joanna. I\u2019ll take that question. First, I\u2019d just like to say our pilots have been great partners over the past several months, particularly given the challenges that the business is facing. The work we\u2019ve done with pilots provides JetBlue, a level of relief, so far as their minimum hour schedule requirements that have been reduced. And we also achieved a level of scope relief. The scope clause and the pilot contract required us to grow and hire certain number of new pilots. And obviously, in this environment, that\u2019s not something that\u2019s happening. So there\u2019s a level of scope relief in there and then also, a level of commitment to no furlough through the end of April. So we\u2019re really pleased with the partnership over the past months, and they, along with our other work groups, have been absolutely committed to making JetBlue successful as we navigate through this crisis.\nJamie Baker: But do you consider the scope component to be the most relevant?\nJoanna Geraghty: I think they all work together, and all were important to both JetBlue and to our pilots.\nJamie Baker: Okay. And then, Steve, could you run down the incremental sources of liquidity remaining, what you envision pledging for the loan, should you draw it? The brand was pledged already, but is there other intellectual property? Where are we with unencumbered aircraft, just an update in that regard would be helpful. Thank you.\nSteve Priest: Good morning, Jamie, and thank you for the question. I have to say as a starting point, I couldn\u2019t be happier with, a, the fact that we came into this crisis with probably the second strongest balance sheet in the industry; and then sort of secondly, the incredible levels of urgency and focus and execution that the team has gone through over the last few months. In fact, we\u2019ve raised a total of $3.7 billion since we started the crisis. And our debt-to-cap is only sort of sitting at 55%, which candidly is pretty strong when you relate that to the competitive set. With regards to additional liquidity sources that we have, I would describe this as a sort of continued focus, which is, one, we continue to have north of $1 billion of unencumbered assets available to us on the balance sheet, and that excludes our loyalty program and also excludes our subsidiaries within JetBlue. The key areas of focus for us will be, one, as I mentioned, in the prepared remarks, will be the refi of 364 facility that we took out in March. And then in terms of the focus of additional liquidity one, we\u2019ve got some sale-leaseback activity that is under contract and we view at the moment. Secondly, we will continue to use the balance sheet for any additional debt raises depending how we navigate the store. And then thirdly, we\u2019re working a close focus with the government on the CARES Act loan facility. We continue to propose that we\u2019ll use the loyalty program associated with that. And we are also parallel passing that in the capital markets, just to make sure we\u2019ll end up with the best return on that investment as we think about our liquidity going forward, so that\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about navigate in the next few months.\nJamie Baker: Any recent third-party appraisal of the program - the loyalty program?\nSteve Priest: We have sort of gone through that recent appraisal, and that\u2019s been part of our work that we\u2019ve been going through the government, and we continue to work through that facility as we go forward.\nJamie Baker: Thank you very much.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. Just in terms of the sequential drivers of your cash burn improvement, high level, it looks like your planning assumptions call for OpEx down less sequentially by about 15 percentage points and revenue down less by about 10 percentage points, CapEx slightly higher sequentially, 3Q versus 2Q. So not a question unique to JetBlue, it\u2019s one I\u2019ve asked most of the airlines. What is the driver of sequential cash burn improvement?\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Duane. And good morning. And I\u2019ll pick that up. It\u2019s Steve here. So first, I would say, I think the work we\u2019ve done sequentially on month-on-month, just as a reminder to everyone, we left March with a cash burn of $18 million a day. And we ended June at 7.7%. So absolutely tremendous progress that we\u2019ve made in terms of humming our fixed costs, going very, very deep on our variable costs, and obviously we saw some revenue recovery in June. The biggest thing, Duane, I would really focus on the coordination between the finance team and the planning team has been exceptional. And obviously, in this COVID environment, we are brutally focused on making sure that all of our flying is cash positive. And so as you look at that, that\u2019s really the sort of core driver of the continued focus going forward in this COVID environment, as I mentioned. In terms of thinking about the sequential move from June at 7.7% to the reaffirmed range of Q3 from 7% to 9%, it\u2019s candidly a reflection on sort of revenue environment. And I say that because we\u2019re looking at sort of sequential capacity growth in Q3 versus Q2 as a result of some of the - of what we saw as we came into that. And obviously, as a result of sequential capacity growth, you are so seeing some slight increase in our variable cost structure. And obviously, as I mentioned, through our strategic and tactical process, Joanna, Scott and the team are incredibly focused on making sure that we align the schedule to cash positive flying. And so the 15% to 20% reduction in our recent reduction in our August schedule will show that. In terms of the CapEx side, we have been doing a lot of work on sale and leasebacks. It\u2019s a little choppy, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest it\u2019s material. When I look at our combination of CapEx and cost of financing on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it\u2019s relatively flat. And so it\u2019s really a function of the revenue environment coming off the back of June and into Q3 and our sort of, marginal, sort of, operating costs as we navigate this through. And the big driver, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve ranged it, Duane, between 7% and 9%. That will really be a reflection of the providing revenue environment that we see as we navigate through the quarter.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thanks for that. And then on intermediate term demand, maybe 4Q and into 2021, what baseline do you think? And this is a follow-up maybe from Jamie\u2019s question, what baseline do you the JetBlue needs to align its cost structure too. As we look into 2021 relative to 2019, how much smaller do you think the airline needs to be or is it simply a hope that things get better over time? And certainly appreciate the difficulty of this question. Thanks for your thoughts.\nRobin Hayes: It\u2019s an excellent question, Ryan. It\u2019s probably one of the, sort of, top three questions that sort of go through my mind and the leadership teams mind as we go through that. Let me just give you a little bit of a flavor about what our planning assumption is. We\u2019ve mentioned our capacity assumption of Q3, which will be a reduction of at least the 45%. And as I said, we\u2019ll be very nimble and quick to sort of think about that. We\u2019re expecting from a planning standpoint, position where in Q4, we\u2019re thinking about operating around two-third of the schedule. So that will give you a sort of sense in terms of how we, sort of, go forward. And obviously, that will have its impact on, sort of, the revenue environment. When I step back and think about how we leave this year and go forward, it\u2019s all about our cost structure and making sure we size correctly. As we\u2019ve said, we expect to be a smaller carrier as we exit COVID. And when I think about our cost structure and the more relevant cost structure is around cash. So if you take D&A as of the equation, we\u2019re currently in a, sort of, prior to the COVID crisis on a cash basis, 70% of our costs, including fuel were variable, and about 30% was fixed. As we come out of fares that is a smaller business, around 60% of our cash costs available versus 70% pre-COVID. So our whole philosophy as we go forward here is how do we hammer our cost structure back to the sort of 70% variability. So that we can very clearly manage our cost structure in line with the capacity and ultimately the revenue. And that\u2019s really about three things. One, the work we\u2019ve been doing on eliminating our fixed cost structure, thinking about things like our footprint, thinking about things like IT infrastructure and our architecture. Secondly, which is incredibly important, transitioning fixed costs or variable. We\u2019ve gone very, very deep on our business partner contracts and brought variability into those contracts. And obviously, more recently, made the difficult decisions in some of our smaller airports to transition from our crew members to outsourced provision. And then thirdly, really hammering down our variable unit costs. Think about things like the maintenance agreements, including the sort of V2500 deal that we\u2019ve just done. And secondly, a good example of this is our distribution cost structure, where we\u2019re driving more and more direct distribution and also driving down our cost of indirect distribution. So I think at the top level, it\u2019s getting fixed costs out, turning more fixed costs to variable, going into 2021, understanding post that that we\u2019re going to be a smaller business and making sure that as much of our cost available as possible, so that we can continue to focus on driving our margins going forward.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the thoughts.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks. Duane.\nOperator: Next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Maybe just a question on CapEx. So some aircraft leasing companies have shared that after an aircraft is 12 months or more late, you can cancel an order, get all your PDPs back and basically no penalty. With this in mind, I guess, first, do the same conditions in your contract with Airbus? And then second, how much flexibility you have in your future CapEx? And how are you thinking about CapEx over the next couple of years? And then I have one more\u2026\nRobin Hayes: Hi, Catie. Good morning, Catie. I heard your question about what\u2019s the contract with Airbus and how much flexibility you have going forward. But I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear you particularly well for the first half of your question. Could you repeat it, please?\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Yes. Sure. Sorry about that. Can you hear me now?\nRobin Hayes: Yes, it\u2019s much better.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, great. Yes. So I was just noting some aircraft leasing companies have shared that after an aircraft is 12 months or more late, you can cancel, get all your PDPs back, so basically no penalty. And so I was just wondering, is this the case with your contract with Airbus? I know you\u2019ve been running late on delivery for a couple of years now. So just wondering what the flexibility in your future CapEx looks like and how you\u2019re thinking about CapEx over the next couple of years?\nRobin Hayes: Great question, Catie. I think the first thing I would say, I think the sort of commentary and the market data you\u2019re talking about is really pertaining to some of the challenges with the 737 MAXs and some of the stuff that\u2019s out in the market. I mean, you obviously wouldn\u2019t expect me to get here today in terms of any details about our contractual arrangements with Airbus. But what I would say is that as we\u2019ve been in this crisis, as ever for 20 years, they\u2019ve been a good partner. Particularly since we\u2019ve come into this crisis, they\u2019ve continued to sit side-by-side with us to the tune where, as you\u2019ll remember, last quarter, we announced deferral of $1.3 billion of CapEx between last earnings call in 2022. Obviously, as you go a little bit further out with regards to the order book, naturally you would expect to have deferral rights. The closer in you are, it\u2019s just generally between the OEMs and the airlines, it\u2019s the sort of commercial discussion, but we continue to engage with Airbus. Again, they\u2019re a good partner, and we are very conscious about balancing our CapEx needs, our aircraft needs, the new and improved aircraft that drive better sort of sustainability from a financial and environmental standpoint. And we\u2019re getting that balance right, and we\u2019ll continue to update the markets as we navigate in the next few months.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, great. And then some follow-up, actually a bit of a follow-up to Duane\u2019s question. So you noted that revenue is the driver of 3Q versus 2Q cash burn and revenue is declining less quarter-to-quarter, but cost will be relatively less negative year-over-year, quarter-to-quarter. So are those top line productions masking a better net sales improvement with refunds falling off? Is there something going on with aircraft financing? I know you\u2019re talking about the leaseback. Just trying to better understand that sequential improvement given the mix of the change in revenue and costs there?\nRobin Hayes: I think the first thing I would say, Catie, our size helps us. And so JetBlue is in a position that we\u2019re able to be very nimble. I think from the competitive earnings call, everybody is aware of what we saw as we navigated June, and think about JetBlue\u2019s geography in terms of where we are. So I was particularly pleased with our cash burn that we, sort of, came out of June with, thinking about our geography. It does continue to be choppy. I think the balance you\u2019ve got to think about is, it\u2019s really around getting our capacity right, and as we sort of \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019ve ranged the 7% to 9% as we came into Q3, because it\u2019s a reflection on demand and where we are with our variable cost structure. I don\u2019t really think from where you look at where we are and we look at Q3 and Q4, obviously, the CARES Act rolls off in Q4, but there\u2019s nothing material that\u2019s moving some from a cost structure standpoint, except the capacity side of things as we go forward. So the reflection of cash burn is really a product of the capacity that we fly and the revenue that we start bringing into the business.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Thank you, Catie. Have a good day.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Darryl Genovesi of Vertical. Your line is open.\nDarryl Genovesi: Hi, guys. Thanks for your time. I just wanted to follow-up on with Duane and Catie just asked. I mean, you\u2019re planning for a 45% capacity decline in the third quarter, which is a reduction of 7.3 billion ASMs. On that reduction, you\u2019re talking about a 35% OpEx decline, which is about $650 million or $0.09 per ASM on the reduction. This is incredibly strong cost performance. You\u2019re demonstrating a much more variable cost structure than I would have thought you\u2019d achieve going into the crisis, especially with no furloughs and what I assume is probably higher rent expense in Q3. But this also makes for a very high hurdle to put capacity back in sequentially. And so I\u2019m trying to understand, how your marginal flight can be cash flow positive as you suggest because you\u2019re implying Q3 total RASM in kind of the 4.5% range. And correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I\u2019d imagine that your marginal RASMs are even lower than that. So if that\u2019s the case, and if you save $0.09 for every ASM that you pull down, then why isn\u2019t capacity down a lot more versus the 45% that you\u2019re talking about? Thanks and sorry for the long question.\nRobin Hayes: No, worries, Darryl. I\u2019ll kick this one-off, and I\u2019ll give it to Joanna and Scott, if they got any additional thoughts on the revenue environment. I am very, very pleased with the work we\u2019ve done from an OpEx standpoint. Our crew members have really stepped up. And so we\u2019ve got a tremendous amount of voluntary time off during the quarter, and that continues to go forward into quarter three. And that really gives us, despite we\u2019re in the CARES Act environment. We\u2019ve been able to not only rationalize our business partner spend and continue to push things on available basis. So as I said in my comments to Duane, I feel like the company has really got hold of this fixed to variable shift. But I think some of the markets are thinking that your labor is \u2013 in essence, is very, very fixed. We\u2019ve continued to see some of that VTO standpoint coming through. Again, we\u2019ll continue to hammer that home. In terms of the depth that we go through with regards to our cost revenue standpoint, I\u2019ll hand over to Joanna just to see if she wants to add any color from a revenue standpoint?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, sure. Thanks. I think what I would say is we\u2019re very focused on ensuring our capacity is in line with demand. And picking up on Steve\u2019s point about being nimble, our planning process has become much closer in. And we lock our capacity decisions just a few months out. This is enabling us to really adjust quickly to that changing demand environment. It\u2019s been somewhat disruptive, obviously, to crew members, but they\u2019ve been unbelievably supportive given the current environment. We understand our cash breakeven economics for flights. We will not operate flights that are not cash positive. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s factoring into what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the numbers.\nDarryl Genovesi: Well, I guess, yes, just to push back a little bit. I mean, if total RASM is $0.045, which is just the math of what you said on revenue and capacity versus last year. And $0.045 is clearly below the $0.09 per ASM marginal CASM that you guys were talking about. I mean, is it that\u2019s a marginal play it actually has higher RASM than the average flight? I mean, is this a - I mean, I\u2019ve heard you tell stories like that during good times. But I guess I just have a hard time believe that that\u2019s the case today that you probably deploy your capacity in sort of good markets first and each incremental market that you\u2019re entering or each additional frequency that you\u2019re adding is likely to be rather dilutive? Or is that not the case?\nScott Laurence: Yes, Darryl, it\u2019s Scott. I\u2019ll give this one a try here because I think I know where you\u2019re going with this. Look, I think when Joanna and Steve talk about how we make these incremental decisions and how we\u2019re planning versus variable cost, it sort of take it up a level and think about it as - again, the first piece, the governing piece there is the variable breakeven load factor between about 20% and 30%. The other portion of that is the potential to recapture in a market with multiple frequencies. So as we plan the network, what we look at is what\u2019s the appropriate frequency count, what can we actually fly? And then as Joanna talked about, this process we\u2019ve got to sort of move closer in has got a couple of fill safes in it. So we plan the schedule, we then take a scrub of it a couple of weeks out and then we take a scrub of it a couple of days out. And that allows us to move in and obviously try to combine and -- cancel and combine, if necessary. That\u2019s sort of the tricky part of this is making sure that the frequencies were flying and the incremental frequencies in markets make sense. Now across our network, of course, we\u2019re relatively low frequency in a lot of places, we got one flight a day. But that\u2019s the goal. And if you sort of look at the bottom line associated with that, that allows us to drive a better cash result at the end of the day.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay. Thanks very much guys. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Next question comes from Helane Becker of Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thank you very much operator. So I appreciate all the information. Thank you very much. I just have a question about moving from Long beach to LAX. So I guess the driver there was the fact that Long Beach isn\u2019t allowing or didn\u2019t allow international flights and you have international opportunities that LAX which I think you talked about. So I was just kind of wondering if you could talk about the - because LAX seems like a very competitive market, I guess I\u2019m interested in the fact that LAX had better margins. Is that better margins relative to Long Beach or relative to the whole network? Or maybe you could just talk a little bit about that? Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Hi, Helane. This is Joanne. I\u2019ll take that one. There\u2019s a few reasons in July why we consolidated Long Beach into Los Angeles. I think, I look at it through two lenses, short-term, relocating our operation at a Long Beach has enabled us to consolidate our capacity into a single station. This creates efficiencies and cost savings in the short term. And you\u2019re correct, yes, we were disappointed years ago when Long Beach \u2013 when the city council didn\u2019t approve the airport to move forward with a customs facility, thereby not permitting international flights and Long Beach and that was part of our plan, longer-term for Long Beach. So that was absolutely one of the reasons behind consolidating those operations. In terms of L.A., this is a really great opportunity for JetBlue. Our Transcon flying has performed extremely well. Los Angeles outperforms Long Beach by quite a wide margin. As we think about international, we have that opportunity in Los Angeles. You should think longer term, obviously, for international flying. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re really looking forward to. And the West Coast move, it allows us to take advantage of reduced capacity from our peers in Los Angeles. So yes, it\u2019s a competitive airport, but we compete extremely well against the legacy carriers currently out of Los Angeles, and we expect to continue to do so moving forward.\nHelane Becker: And then would you be able to, through the American? I guess the code here is just on the \u2013 in the Northeast, right? It\u2019s not going to include West Coast, so you couldn\u2019t necessarily hook up with them or Alaska air?\nJoanna Geraghty: It won\u2019t include \u2013 into West, it would include flights that touch the New York area, so a JFK, L.A. flight, a Boston LA flight will be covered.\nHelane Becker: Got you. And then just for my follow-up, has there been any movement on the A190s, any decision there?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Helane, it\u2019s Steve here. Good morning.\nHelane Becker: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Priest: We continue to work through that. I mean, it goes back to sort of Catie\u2019s question about the order book and going through. Obviously, we are expecting to come on this crisis a smaller airline. This does enable us to give some thought to potential retirements of the fleet. And we\u2019re going through that analysis, and we\u2019ll give that some \u2013 we can give that continued thought over the next few months. And once we make any specific decisions as we sort of get through this then we\u2019ll go forward.\nHelane Becker: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brandon Oglenski at Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my question. Steve, I hate to come back to that chain of questions. But I guess, should investors expect that JetBlue should be managing to earnings outcomes before we get any sort of cure to this virus? And I\u2019ve asked is some other airline management teams, too. But is that even the right outcome for JetBlue to manage to cutting costs so much with revenue down where it is today? Or are you making longer-term plans to get that margin recovery once we get things \u2018back to normal?\u2019\nSteve Priest: Hi, Brandon. Good morning. Our number focus is cash. Cash, cash, cash, cash, cash, as you would expect it to be in this environment. And so the point we made earlier in terms of the co-automation we\u2019re flying the capacity, which is cash positive. And as you can imagine, in the CARES Act environment, with a higher level of our cost structure being fixed, the work we\u2019re doing, as Scott outlined earlier, is really about that. But if you think about managing the short term and then migrating to the longer term, we are resetting our cost structure because as you come out of this as a smaller airline, not only do you have to have a smaller cost structure but in order to preserve cash in the short term and restructure for the margins in the longer term. It\u2019s pivoting the fixed cost to the variable cost structure. So I don\u2019t view this as like one or the other. There\u2019s a sort of complete alignment with the short-term to long-term. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen the leadership team at JetBlue do is a, conserve cash; and as I\u2019ve said earlier, I\u2019ve been very, very pleased with our sequential improvement in the cash burn in the short term; but we are also setting ourselves up for success as we come out the other side of the crisis to make sure that strategically. We\u2019re in a good place with our margins to then ultimately repair the balance sheet, as Robin alluded to in his prepared comments. So, I suppose, it\u2019s not one or the other, but in the short-term, we\u2019re absolutely focused on cash.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yes. I definitely appreciate that response. And maybe, Joanna, can you just talk to us about where you see the smart size of the network and the flexibility you maybe have with some of your unencumbered assets, how do you get to a smaller JetBlue? What are you willing to share today?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. I mean, I think what I will say is there remains a lot of uncertainty around the timing of recovery. And so, we talked to the last earnings call about planning to an L-shaped recovery. That assumes a slow, yet steady ramp-up of revenue for the rest of the year. That said, if you look toward 2021, we\u2019re planning for a wide range of assumptions. Right now, our focus is entirely on building customer confidence and flying again, remaining nimble as capacity needs to change. As Steve mentioned, getting costs out of the business, so shifting fixed to variable, our resource plans around crew members, reducing our capital spending. We feel that we\u2019re well positioned for recovery when it does happen, trusted brand, superior product, a much lower cost structure. So, we\u2019re planning for a variety of scenarios. I\u2019m not going to get into smaller - how much smaller we are. I mean, for Q3, we expect revenue to be down by 80%. Q4, we\u2019re looking at 60% to 70%. But this is all what we are planning currently and it\u2019s an incredibly volatile environment, and things could change, which is why I\u2019ll flip back to Steve and say, we are focused on cash preservation at the moment.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just on the CapEx side, I realize things are very fluid, but I was wondering what a realistic range might be for 2021.\nSteve Priest: Hi, Savi. Good morning. Steve here. We\u2019ve talked about -- I mean we haven\u2019t gone, as you can imagine - yes, but we\u2019ve said several billion. Now, there\u2019s obviously a headline CapEx number, but we\u2019ve also got to think about a cash basis. And I think it\u2019s probably useful just to, sort of, share with you how effective we\u2019ve been as you think about the sort of cash in the short-term. So, when I think about Q4 this year, there\u2019s obviously the headline CapEx number that we\u2019ve talked about. But because of the activities and the success we\u2019ve had with certain leasebacks thinking about the order book, you\u2019re only sort of seeing about $100 million to $150 million leave the business from a cash standpoint in Q4. So when we pivot to 2021, and we think about our CapEx, at a macro level, it\u2019s basically $7 billion, but we are obviously going to be turning our attention to our CapEx profile looks like as we navigate the recovery and we see what the next few months bring.\nSavi Syth: That makes sense. And then just on the voluntary programs. I wonder if you could provide a little bit more detail, particularly what portion of the 25% is related to kind of opt outs versus time off and also the time off, like how long that goes through, that you have the flexibility to work with?\nRobin Hayes: Hey Savi, it\u2019s Robin. I\u2019ll take that and good morning. And I think just a comment on philosophy before I get into some of the details. What we really try to do is align a resourcing philosophy that mirrors sort of uncertainty that we see in terms of the future. I think that we keep using the word choppy. It is. We can see changes in the course of two or three weeks and so just as we need to take a cost down and in an environment where the demand isn\u2019t there, we also need to better move quickly to capture it when it when they did that. And, there are always some flickers I mean, our vacations business for example, over the last seven days has sold as many vacations as they did in the same seven days as they did last year. Now, the timing has shifted so it was sort of left in August than we would have expected and so we had to remain extremely flexible in this environment. So, the way we approached it, we said look we know we\u2019re going to be smaller, we know that there\u2019s a number of roles here that we can take out of the business permanently. And so, we had a number of long-term opt outs. We also created long-term time off programs that varied for most work groups, between the nine and the 12 month option. And we have a significant amount of take up in that in other workers groups like in-flight, we credit time-off programs that go between one week -- one month and nine months. And so what we\u2019ve really tried to do the operation planning team, the people team, the resulting team, kind of monitoring that. And then as we get closer in, and we have line of sight on the schedule sort of two or three months out, we then roll out more short-term programs to kind of if you like fill up the gap we have between what the schedule is calling for, and the amount of interest, we\u2019ve had in opt out and longer term programs. So, that 25% that we shared with you today is a combination of opt out long-term time-off program and also some of the shorter time-off programs in work with what we\u2019ve got them. It excludes a number of short-term programs that we haven\u2019t gone out with yet for the last quarter of the year. So, that number actually will go higher and a quote I gave on the last call was when we put in the programs out in the summer, we had 60% of our crew members take some form of time off, either short-term or long-term. So, we\u2019re not sharing a specific numbers, because it\u2019s constantly in flux. We have programs going out all the time, but bottom-line is we\u2019ve already had 25% out on medium, long-term, and opt out program, and that excludes additional medium time programs and short-term programs that we will be going out with into the future.\nSavi Syth: Appreciate the details. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Good morning. Steve is $150 million from the Barclays point purchase is that all the cash you\u2019re getting from Barclays? Or is that kind of a combination of an advanced purchase plus the normal cash transactions?\nSteve Priest: Hi. Good morning, Joe. That was just the advanced transaction. So, obviously, we sort of have the loyalty -- the steady state loyalty activity that goes on with that. That was a one-off sort of liquidity transaction they were executed back in April.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And that\u2019s the second transaction. There was $150 million in first quarter. That\u2019s the only one.\nSteve Priest: No, it\u2019s the only ones, and we executed it back in April for $150 million.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. Robin, in an environment where an industry is capital-intensive as airlines and one with margins is relatively low as they are, one where the revenue environment is structurally lower for a multiyear period, why shouldn\u2019t investors assume that there will be a period of consolidation on the other side of this as there has been in prior cycles?\nRobin Hayes: A great question and obviously, I can\u2019t tell what investors should or shouldn\u2019t assume. But what I would say is, I think the difference this time is that whilst the severity of this event is clearly more than we\u2019ve ever seen, certainly in my memory of this industry, that goes quite a way back, every U.S. airline came into this with a strong balance sheet or liquidity position. And so, our ability, I think, to weather this, I think, is significant. And I think as we come out of this, I\u2019m still optimistic that in the leisure markets and in the VFR markets, most of which is what we do. And when I think about the routes that we announced, most of that was just sort of acknowledging, I think some of the business line we do is likely to stay suppressed for we do is likely to stay suppressed for a while, so moving that more into leisure and VFR markets. I am still confident that a significant amount of that will recover by 2021. We saw strong and quick recovery as we were in June, and it was really only suppressed again once the case counts went up, once the quarantine came in. And so, I think once case counts get under control, once people get more comfort either with a vaccine or better therapeutics or sort of herd immunity that may even exist in some places after a while, I think that demand is going to come back quickly. And so, I think that as we exit this, we\u2019ll be focusing on reducing our cost structure, improving our balance sheet, delevering. But I think our ability in the industry over the next two or three years to recover from this should be pretty strong especially for those of us focused on the leisure side. And I think I\u2019m excited about our partnership with American Airlines because I think it\u2019s a very innovative way for us to grow organically. What we know that, what JetBlue does is bring low fares and competition to more markets. But we sometimes lack scale and I think in many ways, this gives us the ability to continue to do what we do really well, but also partner with American to build some of the benefits of a larger network.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Your line is open.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. Maybe just the first one, I want to take the other side of the Joe\u2019s question, why should investors not assume that airlines are getting assume that airlines are getting more than enough liquidity - ample liquidity different than prior downturns? And could this be a situation where M&A and natural restructuring doesn\u2019t take place and we\u2019re in a prolonged war situation?\nSteve Priest: So Myles, I\u2019ll sort of pick that up. I think from a liquidity standpoint, we are just raising cash to weather the storm, right? I think the uncertainty around this as we\u2019ve sort of seen; you don\u2019t want anyone being sort of proverbially at the wheel. And so we\u2019ve all gone out - JetBlue has gone out and done some significant work around making sure we\u2019ve got the balance sheet and the cash to weather this storm. So, it\u2019s nothing to do with the perspective in terms of M&A just so from Robin\u2019s perspective. It\u2019s really just about making sure we\u2019ve got the cash to weather the storm and get to the other side of this. And we will be quick as feasible as possible to start paying that back to get ourselves back to sort of the position we were pre-COVID. So I don\u2019t see this cash position as anything beyond protecting the balance sheets and the viability of the airlines in airlines in the US sector.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And then the follow-up on the delta of $7 million to $9 million per day, and getting to breakeven, should we think about that as formulaic from the top line and the incremental accretion from revenue or to kind of the conversation around cost, how much more is left on the cost side below the $7 million to $9 million burn?\nSteve Priest: It\u2019s a good question. So on the 7 to 9 basis, again, we\u2019ve given sort of a perspective around the capacity where we\u2019ve said like at least a sort of 45% reduction. It\u2019s a combination of the two. We\u2019ve been incredibly focused, as you can imagine, Myles, on our cost structure. But it is going to be a question about what the prevailing revenue environment is. And obviously, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball at this point. But I think the 7 to 9 based on the work we\u2019ve done on our variable cost structure and cash breakeven load factors gives us a good range to look good range to look at for Q3. And the prevailing revenue environment will determine whether at the top end of that range or towards the bottom of that range.\nMyles Walton: All right. Thank you.\nSteve Priest: Thanks, Myles.\nOperator: Next question comes from Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Joanna, a question for you just on the American agreement, you did talk about code sharing connections and the like. I know it\u2019s been reported in the press that there was also the transaction would include a slot swap, and there\u2019s been sort of differing reports out there about what that actually entails. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s LaGuardia and Kennedy or if that\u2019s space at Newark. Any color that you can share on it?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. I\u2019ll ask Scott to step in and answer that question.\nMike Linenberg: Hi, Scott.\nScott Laurence: So thanks for the question. So as we continue to work through this, we\u2019ve talked a bit about what we\u2019re going to do. I think the first part of this is there\u2019s -- obviously, for us, we\u2019re excited about this because there\u2019s a ton of benefit, right? There\u2019s low fares, there\u2019s great service. That\u2019s going to come to new markets. And as we look at slots and we look at how we move forward, American has talked about things like LaGuardia, where they\u2019re going to be removing airplanes. That creates some room for JetBlue at LaGuardia slots are freed up. There\u2019s also potential for us to look at other opportunities. Certainly, in the afternoon at JFK, not only does that allow our transcon network to come in and arrive and feed American\u2019s long-haul network, but it also brings competition to some of those long-haul markets. So again, we\u2019re working this right now. We obviously are talking to regulators when we respectful -- I want to respect that the ability to look at this. But again, I think we look at the benefits here, we look at the ability to move forward and recover faster because of this, and we\u2019re certainly excited about it.\nMike Linenberg: Great. And then just the second question and this is either Joanna or Robin. I believe, I think it was a day or two ago, it looks like the house is proposing an extension of the PSP. And I\u2019m curious where, as a curious where, as a company, you stand, acknowledging the fact that it looks like you already have a deal with your pilots that takes you into next year. So it looks like you\u2019re protected there. And if others - if competitors in the industry do take up an extension of the PSP, are you as a company compelled for competitive reasons to do the same, knowing that there could be strings attached, right, more debt and maybe warrant dilution. So, sort of, a multipronged question, but sort of, where you stand as a company? Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Sure. Yes, I\u2019ll take the CARES. So what I\u2019ll call CARES 2. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the technical term of it, but you know what I mean.\nMike Linenberg: Yes.\nRobin Hayes: I think that, the way I think about it is, CARES save the industry and CARES 2 is about job. And so we have a planning assumption going into Q4. We have some planning assumptions going into next year, as Joanna mentioned. There\u2019s a high level of uncertainty around that. So as a team, we\u2019re having to play a lot of scenarios. And one of the hardest things planning to scale up or down is our people. And so we make certain assumptions and we push hard on voluntary programs, but voluntary programs will only get you so far. And if you - if we take a view and some of the sort of more pessimistic outcomes as to where demand could go is you get to a point where it\u2019s hard to bridge that gap without considering furloughs. And so we\u2019re confident right now based on what we see in front of us over the next few months that we can get there through voluntary means, but there\u2019s a high level of uncertainty. Well, I think you can mirror that across the industry and some airlines who perhaps have a different business mix to us, look at that and may be kind of see the more concerning forecast. And so when we look at it as a industry, there\u2019s no doubt that CASES 2 would be a significant game changer in protecting jobs and giving the industry more time to recover. And so that\u2019s how I think about it. And we can certainly manage through this as JetBlue, but as an industry, but I think the ability to protect a significant number of jobs if CAS2 would happen I think, is there. And if we think about the alternative of furloughs or other things, that too have a cost. And so that\u2019s how I think about it. We\u2019ll see how it plays out. Certainly, if CARES 2 is offered on similar terms as CARES 1, I think that would be of interest. But let\u2019s just see how it plays out. I think this is going to be a very difficult negotiation in the house and in the senate and with the administration, and we\u2019ll see where we sit at the end of it.\nMike Linenberg: Very good. Thanks, Robin. Thanks, everyone.\nDavid Fintzen: All right. That concludes our second quarter 2020 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: And again, that will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 1, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-05-07 17:54:05", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Erica. I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue\u2019s VP of Investor Relations, David Fintzen. Please go ahead.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, Erica. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings call.

And Dave, before I start, congratulations on your promotion, which occurred since the last earnings call. And, of course, with everything else has happened, we haven\u2019t really had a chance to celebrate that, but you do a terrific job, and thanks to what you do for the JetBlue team.\nDavid Fintzen: Thank you, Robin.\nRobin Hayes: I could not be prouder about JetBlue family, not just over the past two decades, but for their service to each other, our customers and our communities, as they provide an essential service during this coronavirus pandemic. In our 20th anniversary year, we are facing the biggest threat we\u2019ve seen to our company and our industry. Our crewmembers, though, yet again have risen to the challenge to inspire humanity at a difficult time, all while living our founding values of safety, caring, integrity, passion and fun. We\u2019re deeply saddened to have lost six crewmembers to the coronavirus, including a pilot, two members of our in-flight community, one support center colleague and two airport crewmembers. Ralph Gismondi, Charles Chuck Lewis, Jared Lovos, Kevin McAdoo, Ray Pabon, and Nikki Thorne were valued and amazing members of our JetBlue team, each with a special and unique story. Ralph joined us from after retiring from the New York City Fire Department, including two tours of duty at ground zero, and we honor him with the cover of our earnings deck today. Chuck was known his fellow ground ops crewmembers as a natural and confident leader. Jared brought the same warmth and compassion to our PEP team here in LSC, Long Island Support Center, that he demonstrated in his previous role as an in-flight crewmember. Kevin retired after distinguished service with the U.S. Air Force, where he served for 20 years and had multiple tours. Ray was known for his caring nature. And Nikki was known amongst her airport crew colleagues for being extremely kind hearted and having an excellent sense of humor. Our hearts go out to their families and loved ones as we are supporting them, and also to all of our crewmembers who have been impacted by this virus. For those that we have lost, we remember them every day, and we pause briefly now as we remember them as our beloved members of the JetBlue family. Turning to Slide 4 of our presentation. For the first quarter, we reported an adjusted loss of $0.42 per share, driven by an unprecedented fall in demand that started late in February. It has been a couple of very challenging months, and our team have responded with extreme urgency and taking actions at every level to protect JetBlue. We were fortunate to have entered this crisis with the second strongest balance sheet among U.S. airlines. In the last two months, we have moved quickly to both protect and strengthen our liquidity position. Since the beginning of March, we have made decisive changes to our growth plan to minimize cash burns, including deep capacity cuts to our schedule. We have reduced our CapEx plan by $1.3 billion between now and the end of 2022. And by the end of May, we anticipate we would have lowered our operating expenses by about \u2013 by around 50% year-over-year. We are so incredibly grateful for the support received from our business partners and crewmembers, who have helped us minimize cash burn during these challenging times. In March, Congress passed and the President signed into law the CARES Act. JetBlue is very grateful to President Trump and his administration, particularly Secretaries, Mnuchin and Chow, as well as Congress, especially Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, for strongly recognizing the value of our industry and for supporting our crewmembers. I also want to thank, Nick Calio, and the team at Airlines for America for their amazing teamwork, as we came together to protect jobs. This law alone will not solve the longer-term problems that the coronavirus pandemic is creating. But it does provide much needed temporary support for our crewmembers and biases vital time to plan for both a changed demand environment and, of course, eventual recovery. We reached an agreement with the Department of treasury and received $936 million in payroll support. In exchange for these funds, the U.S. government received approximately $2.6 million warrants as consideration for the amount granted to JetBlue. And of the $936 million, $251 million must be repaid to the U.S. government. In late April, we also applied for the Federal loan program, which would provide up to $1.14 billion in further liquidity. We will continue to evaluate alternatives to raise cash and plan to access the facility, if needed. Given our actions and government support, we believe our balance sheet remains one of the strongest among U.S. airlines, and our cash and short-term investments currently equates to over $3 billion. The demand environment continues to be exceptionally challenged due to the coronavirus. As we move towards recovery, we have three priorities. The first one is the immediate need to protect the safety of our crewmembers and customers. The second is to minimize cash burn. The third priority is to set JetBlue up for future success by restoring customer confidence by returning to cash generation and by rebuilding our margins and balance sheet. We\u2019re preparing for a number of recovery scenarios and working with different leading indicators. For JetBlue, we expect our path will look a little different for many of our peers, given our network footprint, customer demographics, low-cost model, and our customers trust in our brand. As you\u2019d expect, we\u2019re being conservative in our planning. And as states we open and the economy comes back online, we are planning on being flexible and quick to adapt. We believe that building customer confidence will be a critical part of recovery, not just for JetBlue or the airline industry, but the travel industry overall. We believe confidence will come from a cross-functional effort that includes working together with industry partners, local governments, regulators and other entities. We also believe that the border travel industry will need to make a collective effort to stimulate and promote a return to travel. Only by getting things moving again, where we get back to generating cash. We look forward to working with our travel partners throughout the recovery. We have taken a leadership position in our industry and started by giving competence and flexibility to customers with travel waivers. We were also the first carrier to provide free flights to health care professionals for relief efforts and transport essential medical equipment. It remains critical that we collaborate and support each other in these challenging times. We believe that not only will we get through this crisis, but we will emerge as a stronger JetBlue. Over the past few years, we focused on strengthening our balance sheet and preparing for an eventual downturn. After the start of this pandemic, we were well on course to deliver on our financial commitments in 2020. As we move into recovery, we look forward to getting back to executing our building blocks, improving our network, our product offering, investing in our fleet, all while remaining true to our low-cost routes. Just as in past downturns, along the way, we anticipate looking for opportunities that may not have been possible for JetBlue just a few months ago. JetBlue has been a true force for good in our industry and we have been resilient through for over 20 years. Most importantly of all, I want to once again thank our 23,000 amazing inspiring crewmembers for their vital role in this tremendously challenging time. And with that, I\u2019d like to pass over to Joanna.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. I\u2019d like to start by thanking most profusely our crewmembers for their outstanding service and loyalty not only to our customers, but to each other. From the very beginning of this pandemic, a few short months ago, predictions and forecasts of every type each day only proved how uncertain the future could be. At JetBlue, however, each new day brought one absolute certainty. And that was the professionalism, humanity and commitment of our crewmembers to delivering a safe and secure JetBlue experience, while living our values. This constant has been and continues to be an inspiration to us all. Our first priority since the onset of the pandemic has been equally constant, ensure the safety of our customers and crewmembers. We\u2019ve responded quickly to changing conditions and overseeing the rapid evolution of policies and programs designed to address the threats to crewmembers and customer safety posed by this virus. We were early to announce the COVID-19 sick pay and quarantine framework and to implement an internal contact tracing and notification process. And as the press recently reported, we were the first to require customers to wear face coverings. We have aggressively managed capacity from the very outset, doing our best to eliminate any nonessential flying, while also ensuring CARES Act compliance. We\u2019ve focused on crew protection by increasing cleaning and disinfection across our operation in all facilities, eliminating New York City overnight crew layovers, working with crew transportation companies to ensure social distancing, implementing jump seat buffers, mandating the use of facial coverings and the use of other PPE, reducing service touch points on-boarding the aircraft, modifying in-flight briefings and deferring training events. I would now like to turn to Slide 6 and our revenue and demand trends. Beginning of the last week of February, we saw a sharp fall in forward bookings across our network, and revenues in March were down 52% year-over-year. Following a very solid start to the year, our first quarter revenues declined 15% year-over-year, resulting from both lower demand volumes and a very challenging fare environment. During April, our revenues were down approximately 95% year-over-year. While the overall number of bookings remained extremely limited during the second quarter, we expect to see small increases in demand as various geographies in our network begin a phased reopening. To provide some additional detail regarding the level of our capacity changes, we are currently operating around 100 flights per day. This compares to our previous average of approximately 1,000 flights per day. The customers we fly today are largely people who are traveling for critical reasons, or due to essential needs. And our load factors averaged between 10% and 15% for much of April. We believe that we have reached the bottom in terms of demand around mid-April. That said, we expect to have a better sense of the third and fourth quarter of 2020 by early summer. We envision this environment of very limited demand will continue into at least the short, if not, medium-term, and believe our inherent strengths as a trusted brand with an unparalleled culture and superior product should serve as well, as customers evaluate their air travel options. We plan to continue to be thoughtful as we adapt to changing customer needs. As Robin mentioned, we are working on a number of scenarios for recovery. And although we are conservative in our planning assumptions, we will respond quickly to changes in demand with capacity, pricing, and customer policies. Moving to capacity on Slide 7. Our March capacity declined 19% year-over-year as a result of scheduled reductions and close in cancellations. As the pandemic began to manifest during the month, we adjusted our March flying levels to mitigate cash losses and rapidly declining load factors. We typically would have managed reductions at this level through a schedule change. But due to the speed and impact of the pandemic, we are put in a position of having to make these changes much closer into the travel date. I\u2019m very proud of our crewmembers for reshaping our operation in such a short period of time and reaccommodating our customers under enormous pressure. For April and May, we\u2019ve had more time to adjust our schedules and our working assumption for the second quarter is for capacity to be down about 80% compared to our original plan. We\u2019ve been aggressively managing all past capacity decisions with the goal of maintaining only an essential level of flying in our markets and complying with the CARES Act. In mid-April, we consolidated operations across five metro areas through June 30, and now operate at only one or two airports in each, including Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Washington D.C. Based on our production \u2013 projections for continuing low demand in the near-term, we expect to reduce many markets to less than one flight per day. Due to ongoing border closures, we have already suspended service to more than 20 of our international cities. We anticipate the situation will remain fluid as we head into the summer, as states and foreign governments reopen their geographies. Giving the meaningful capacity reductions, we\u2019ve grounded approximately 170 aircraft. This has been a significant source of cash savings. As we look to future quarters, we expect to remain flexible, managing our fleet and adjusting our capacity in response to travel demand. While much of our team is focused on navigating the near-term challenges, we are also laser-focused on how the business will look for customers and crewmembers as we transition to recovery. Our focus will be on safety from the ground-up, which includes healthy crewmembers, clean air services, more space, fewer touch points and travel flexibility. Even the goodwill and trust that we built in our brand over the last 20 years, our mission to inspire humanity is now more important than ever. We believe we are well positioned to be the airline of choice for customers, as they become more comfortable returning to flying. Thank you, again, to our crewmembers for continuing to serve our customers and maintaining a safe operation. Over to you, Steve.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Joanna. I would like to add my thanks to our crewmembers on the frontline support centers, who in this time of crisis are working day and night to take care of each other and our customers. I\u2019ll start on Slide 9 with a brief overview of our financial results for the quarter. Revenue was $1.6 billion, down 15% year-over-year. Adjusted pre-tax margin was minus 9.5%, down 13 percentage points from the first quarter of last year. GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.97 and adjusted loss per diluted share was $0.42. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24%. In just a few short months, the coronavirus has significantly disrupted our business. Thanks to our continued focus over the last few years on managing JetBlue to investment-grade metrics, building a strong balance sheet, improving our cost structure and strengthening our margins. We believe we are in the best position of any time in our 20-year history to effectively weather this crisis and emerge even stronger. From a financial perspective, we are focusing our efforts over the coming months on three key areas: preserving our liquidity, reducing operating expenses and managing our capital expenditures. Moving on to Slide 10, and our actions to preserve liquidity. We started the year with good momentum ending 2019 with over $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Since the start of the crisis, our treasury team has done an incredible job raising additional liquidity. In mid-March, we\u2019ve quickly raised $1 billion under a term loan arrangements. And in April, we drew down our revolver of $550 million. We also raised $150 million of cash to the sale of future points. Finally, two weeks ago, we received the cash injection for $936 million from the CARES Act to support our crewmembers. At the close of April, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments reached $3.1 billion, or 38% of our 2019 revenue. As we move into the summer, we plan to take further actions to bolster liquidity. We recently applied for the Federal CARES Act loan for $1.1 billion. However, we are now prioritizing additional liquidity raises in the public markets, including issuing secured debt and entering to sale-leaseback transactions to take advantage of our unencumbered asset base. Excluding the CARES Act loan, our goal is to raise up to $750 million over the next couple of months, which would take our total liquidity to approximately $3.25 billion by the end of the second quarter. In addition to successfully raising liquidity in a short period, we have acted with urgency to minimize our cash burn, reduce our expenses and rework our plan for capital expenditures. We lowered our cash burn from an average of $18 million per day during the second-half of March to an average of $12 million in April. As we enter May, we expect that cash burn to be just under $10 million per day. We expect to see further improvements in the third quarter aiming our cash burn to range between $7 million and $9 million per day. To be clear, all of our cash burn assumptions do not include the CARES Act proceeds. We are leaving no stone unturned to protect the financial security of JetBlue. Turning to Slide 11. We spent the last three years executing our structural cost program and building a cost-conscious culture across the whole of JetBlue. We are all in this together. And since the start of the pandemic, all of our 23,000 crewmembers have been relentlessly focused on finding ways to manage our costs and preserve our liquidity. Starting in March, we quickly reduced our operating expenses to lower our daily cash burn and extended our liquidity. We took action eliminating all nonessential discretionary spend and minimizing marketing, training, catering, and onboard services. In addition, we took the opportunity to in-source services across 29 airports in order to reduce our cash costs. As Joanna mentioned, we are able to cancel some of our flying for the month to avoid some variable costs. However, much of our cost base is relatively fixed, partly due to the timing of bid periods. As we moved into April and especially now into May, we are improving our daily cash burn as we further reduce our variable and fixed cost structure. We continue pulling down capacity aggressively to ensure we achieve variable cost savings and we are taking steps to hammer down our fixed costs across the organization. This includes consolidating airport operations, parking aircraft, reducing landing fees, and optimizing maintenance expenses. Looking ahead, anticipate shifting our focus to more permanent structural cost program savings. Thanks to these assets. We successfully moved around $150 million from our cost base during the first quarter. We expect operating costs, including fuel, to decline approximately 50% year-over-year in May. I\u2019d like to extend a massive thank you to our amazing crewmembers, who have volunteered to participate in time of programs and to all of us in the JetBlue family for making a personal sacrifice. I\u2019d also like to thank our business partners for their flexibility and for working with us to extend payment terms and renegotiate contracts. Moving to Slide 12. During the past couple of months, we negotiated a deal with Airbus to rationalize our order book. We appreciate their partnership in supporting a new delivery schedule that helps our efforts to protect JetBlue. As a result, we expect to take fewer aircrafts than our original plan and our CapEx for 2020 to 2022 is now lower by $1.3 billion. In addition, we suspended our plans to take the four leased aircraft we announced in January, deferring associated ending CapEx required to add those aircraft to our fleet. We also halted our A320 restarting program, having completed over half of our fleet. We appreciate the related impact on customer experience, but we do not anticipate resuming our efforts until demand increase. Lastly, we have reduced non-aircraft CapEx by suspending all nonessential projects across the organization. Moving to Slide 13. At the end of March, our debt-to-cap ratio was 44%. We anticipate principal and interest payments through the end of 2020 of approximately $100 million per quarter. Over the past few years, we invested the majority of our cash from operations back into JetBlue. It\u2019s too early to know what the right level of leverage and liquidity will be during recovery. But our conservative approach in managing our balance sheet will not change. We remain confident that we will navigate this crisis as we have in the past and emerge even better positioned for success in the years to come. As a trusted travel brand, we believe that our efforts to inspire confidence will help support recovery. On behalf of the JetBlue leadership team, again, I would like to thank our incredible crewmembers, as well as our business partners and our communities for all of their support as we navigate these unprecedented times. We also want to thank the many government agencies out there on the frontline, supporting essential travel needs. Our hearts are with those, including friends and neighbors who have been impacted by COVID-19. We will now take your questions.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, everyone. Erica, we\u2019re now ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning.\nRobin Hayes: Good morning, Duane.\nSteve Priest: Good morning, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just on the CapEx, so you\u2019ve taken that down nicely and I just want to check that implies about $500 million for the remainder of the year. And are you done? Should we consider this sort of your final work on 2020, or are your continuing to work that down?\nRobin Hayes: Good morning, Duane. Just before we go any further, I just wanted to have a shout out to our partner, Airbus. I think, where \u2013 such as challenging time where they\u2019re going through their own sorts of response to the crisis, they\u2019ve been true partners as we navigate through this event. You\u2019re not far off in terms of your math, Duane, you\u2019re pretty much in a ballpark. And with regards to like, are we done? Our work is never done. We are ruthlessly focused at taking down the cash burn as we navigate through 2020. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the work of the team, taken us down from, as I said, $18 million at the back-end of March per day down to sort of $10 million in May. And hence, whether it\u2019s on the CapEx side of the business, or the OpEx side of the business, you can expect us to continue to act with rigor and expediency to set their cost structure down and continue to reduce our cash burn.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And then just for my follow-up, maybe for Robin or whoever wants to take a shot at it. But just given the environment, all the work you\u2019re doing, how do we think about plans for Europe and timing for Europe, given the state of affairs? Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Yes. No, thanks, Duane. I\u2019ll take that. And look, first, we know the vast majority of our focus, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get questions on this later in the call is, you\u2019re going to play a lot of defense like this when you go to something of this magnitude. And we\u2019ve got 2008, 2009. We had 2001. We had nothing like this. And so as we emerge from it, as I talked about earlier, in terms of our three objectives, the third one was to emerge knowing that, our debt is going to be higher. We\u2019re going to do \u2013 we\u2019re doing everything we can. We mitigate that. But the priority for us over the next two to three years have to be to delever and repair our balance sheet. So most of what you have to do is to play defense to get you there. Having said that, for an airline like JetBlue, I think, there are also opportunities to play a bit of offense. And I think that our decision to which we previously announced to fly to Europe to start flights to London, I think that certainly, we wouldn\u2019t be selling that today. Certainly, I think, you should expect the timing impact in terms of \u2013 we\u2019re probably going a little bit later than we intended. But the market will recover at some point. And I think that the need for us to enter that market and bring more competition is still as relevant in the future as it was in the past. So expected timing impact, and I only had a chance to see the news outside from the UK this morning from the CMA, which is a Competition Authority, not too much detail, but by the headline is entering into a sort of a consultation with BA, AA about sort of regulatory relief for slots at Heathrow and Gatwick, including markets to allow new entrants into markets like Boston-Heathrow. So, we\u2019re encouraged by that. We\u2019ve been pushing the point with regulators for the last two years that the transatlantic was not that competitive that we could bring price discipline. So I don\u2019t want to be tone-deaf to what\u2019s going on right now. We know most of what you got to do is played defense. We know we\u2019re going to emerge as a smaller airline. But as you asked me about London, we still see that opportunity albiet probably shifted back a little bit in terms of time.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, thanks. And if I could sneak one more in maybe for Robin as well. We\u2019re in uncharted territory and it obviously takes a little bit of imagination to think about what the recovery might look like. There\u2019s really no correlation to past periods. It\u2019s all broken. But as you think about the different segments within the U.S. that you serve, obviously, leisure visiting friends and relatives, transcon, Caribbean, how do you think \u2013 what do you think will recover first? And is there anything in your bookings that\u2019s giving us some hints to that? And thanks for taking the questions.\nRobin Hayes: So I\u2019m going to start that, then going to flip it over to Joanna to talk about sort of view by segment. I would say that, anyone who can \u2013 anyone who says they know how this is going to play out, is lying, no one knows. What we can do is prepare for many different scenarios and be ready to adjust and adapt quickly as they start to play out. I do believe that our network, which is predominantly domestic, our low-cost structure, our trusted brand lead us to exit this crisis in a relatively favorable position. But even that said, it\u2019s going to be sometime before demand recovers to where we were in 2019. And so we are spending a lot of time on that. We\u2019ve got a number of teams set up to look at that and work through those scenarios, Duane. In terms of the specific geographies, I think, I\u2019m going to pass it over to Joanna, because I know that\u2019s something your team has been studying very, very closely.\nJoanna Geraghty: Good morning, Duane. So as I noted during the prepared remarks, we believe demand bottomed out in mid-April. We are starting to see some very small improvements in bookings, but obviously, we\u2019re very conservative with what we\u2019re seeing, and it\u2019s too early to tell if there is a permanent change in the trend. As we look at different customer segments, we do believe leisure will return earlier than business. A reminder, there\u2019s two types of leisure. There\u2019s the pure leisure customer, those that are going on vacation and then there\u2019s the leisure customer that visits their friends and relatives. And we know based upon prior experience from Zika, and in situations where there has been civil unrest in countries that shockingly, people do still go back to visit their families. So we do think that that VFR segment has the best chance of recovering first, followed by pure leisure. As we think about the network, international versus domestic, we obviously believe domestic will recover sooner than leisure. And, as Robin pointed out, given that our network is predominantly leisure 80-20 and largely domestic, and the fact that we have a meaningful cost advantage to the legacy carriers, we feel that JetBlue is the best \u2013 is best set up for recovery when recovery happens.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Maybe just kicking off, maybe fallen on the back of your last comments, Joanna? So on the comments that you\u2019re thinking mid-April was the bottom-end demand. It sounds like that\u2019s maybe pick is based on a small pickup in bookings here. We just had Priest [ph] commenting that load factor saw a material improvement in May. I guess, first, are you seeing that? Or is that mid-April bottom more a comment on the slowing in refunds, any closer there would be helpful? Thanks.\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. Good morning, Catherine. So a couple of meaty points. We are seeing load factor pickup very, very slightly, largely Florida northeast. We also are seeing some modest improvements in no show rates. So those are, as you think about, very early leading indicators. But again, I think it\u2019s important to just go back to \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around the timing and the shape of recovery. Our focus is to be flexible. Capacity, our capacity decisions will be driven by the pace of demand recovery and cash economics and that\u2019s our focus right now.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, understood. And then, maybe one Steve or Robin. So can you talk us through your the assumptions you\u2019re making to get from under $10 million cash burn today that $7 million to $9 million throughout to the third quarter. Just trying to think about what portion of that is an improvement \u2013 is an assumption on an improvement in demand and what is further cost cut? Thanks\nSteve Priest: Hi, Cathy. It\u2019s Steve here. Good morning. It\u2019s nice to speak to you. There\u2019s a few areas in this in terms of sort of sequential improvement. Again, I\u2019m very delighted to sort of see the progression as we navigate through the year. The one thing I do want to emphasize as a starting point, in May, the $10 million a day that we talked about, basically includes everything, OpEx, CapEx and the cost of financing. But to Joanna\u2019s point, we\u2019ve been incredibly conservative on our passenger cash revenue assumption. And that is actually slightly negative due to the current demand environment. So I just want to put that out there, because I know there\u2019s a lot of confusion when you guys are trying to sort of line up airline by airline and work out the sort of cash burn. I think that\u2019s a very, very important point when we think about our starting point in May. Oh, and by the way, just for absolute clarity that excludes any sort of CARE Act [sic] [CARES Act] grant relief. And so as we navigate our way through the year when we\u2019ve seen this significant improvement from March through to May, the first thing I\u2019d say is that continued ruthless focus on our cost reduction programs, obviously, it take time in some cases to flow through and the team is working extremely well at doing that. The second key thing is really around the capital flow through for our non-aircraft CapEx spend, because as you can imagine, you stop a bunch of projects at the start of the second quarter. We obviously had a number of projects that were moving forward in March, and then you sort of catching up with the working capital. So as you navigate your way through the year, you have the impact associated with that. The third item, as I commented on our prepared remarks, we couldn\u2019t be happier and more grateful from our crewmembers for stepping up and the continuation of the voluntary programs. And by this stage, as we get later in the year, we will have the completion of a number of opt-out programs, which means that our underlying labor costs will continue to go down. And then finally, as I mentioned, from a slightly negative passenger cash basis in May, we are continuing to make some very conservative assumptions about modest improvements as we go forward from a cash standpoint on revenue. So I think this story is done a fantastic job as we come to this crisis on the cost standpoint to reduce the burn, even in a sort of negative revenue \u2013 cash revenue environment, and you\u2019ll sort of see those four factors play out as we navigate our way into the latter quarters of the year. Thank you, Cathy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Hi, can you guys hear me?\nRobin Hayes: Hi, Hunter, good morning. How are you doing? Yes, we can hear you loud and clear.\nHunter Keay: Good morning. Thanks. I was having a little bit of phone problems before, so apology if I repeat the question. By the way, Robin, I just want to say, I thought that was a really nice thing that you said on a call this morning. That was very kind and thoughtful about your crewmembers. So\u2026\nRobin Hayes: You\u2019re going to may \u2013 you\u2019re going to maybe come out and see us here, Hunter, so\u2026\nHunter Keay: No. I\u2019d just say it was a nice thing to say and it was nice. But anyway, to my question. The $750 million of cash that you talked about raising Steve, is that all debt? Or how you \u2013 or a more simple question, is that all debt?\nSteve Priest: Good morning, Hunter. Yes, it is. I\u2019ve obviously gotten quite a few external questions and thoughts in terms of seeing what the competition are doing in the markets. We enter this crisis with a very strong balance sheet in relation to others. We have a nice level of unencumbered assets on the balance sheet. Our focus at this point is continuing to tap the commercial debt market. We\u2019re active in the sale and leaseback market. When it sort of comes to equity or converts, that\u2019s much lower down the list. And so, yes, our focus at the moment is really around raising debt.\nHunter Keay: Okay, thanks. And then on the 170 planes, can you tell me what the mix of those are, and how many of those are not coming back?\nSteve Priest: In terms of the 170, obviously, as we\u2019ve gone through the network, we\u2019ve pared the selection. I mean, we\u2019ve got \u2013 basically got two fleets, right, the Airbus fleet the A320 family and the E190. We\u2019ve looked at the network. We\u2019ve looked at the city pairs that we\u2019ve gone forward with. As you know, we\u2019ve managed to consolidate services in various cities, the likes of New York, Boston, LA, as Joanna said in her various comments. In terms of when demand starts to come back, and we start thinking about the aircraft mix, we\u2019re looking at various scenarios and what that looks like and what we\u2019ve been reading back in the associated timeframes. And so we\u2019re going through that planning at the moment. The big focus for us is having the right aircraft to fly the network as it starts to come back and to sort of minimize cash burn as we go forward. And so we\u2019re working through that at the moment and you\u2019ll hear from most of us in due course.\nHunter Keay: All right, Steve. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. So, Steve, I guess, if I can follow-up there on that, you do have a pretty sizable term loan coming due next March. And I understand like that was very easy to draw down quickly, and definitely the prudent thing to do. But I guess, how do you think about, seeing the maturity profile on the balance sheet with some financing you\u2019re talking about?\nSteve Priest: Yes. Thank you, Brandon. And again, I make the point that we\u2019re sort of continuing to keep an eye on that as we navigate our way through 2020. The biggest focus we have at the moment is continue to raise liquidity. Obviously, the term loan is secured by a good set of assets behind that facility as we go forward. But again, we came into this crisis with a conservative approach to debt-to-cap. So our main key focus, as you would expect at the moment, is continuing to drive liquidity, and that\u2019s why I talked about the $750 million and making sure that we have over $3 billion as we complete the second quarter. The treasury team are brutally focused on making that a reality at the moment. As we get beyond that, we\u2019ll start thinking as we come to the latter parts of the year about future financing, and then how we play that forward. But when I think about the unencumbered asset pool of JetBlue and how that \u2013 how big that is, we\u2019ve also looked at some other potential assets as we\u2019ve continued to work with the treasury team under the guidance of Secretary Mnuchin, who would really like to thank for their support with a CARES Act, along with the partners at PJT. I\u2019m comfortable with how we\u2019re navigating that. So we\u2019ll turn to that as we get to the latter parts of the year after we secured further liquidity facilities in the near-term.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I appreciate that response, Steve. And I guess on a broader issue, I forget if it was Robin or yourself or even Joanna that mentioned JetBlue will be a smart carrier on the back-end of this. So, it\u2019s helpful that you guys disclosed the $1.3 billion reduction in aircraft CapEx over the next couple of years. But I guess, can you discuss even the need to take new deliveries even in 2021 if the outlook is that this is going to be a smaller industry, at least, for some period of time?\nSteve Priest: Yes, I think it\u2019s a good question, but I\u2019ll take it. I mean, I just wanted to say is like our immediate focus has been on 2020. You would expect nothing less. And our negotiations primarily was based on reducing cash burn during that period. You\u2019re right, I mean, every airline is going to come out of this crisis small and it\u2019s going to take sometime to ramp. I think we\u2019ve made really, really good progress in reducing our CapEx by $1.1 billion and the other CapEx going forward, and removing a third of our order book over that period. We\u2019ve made a great start, and we\u2019ve got to continue to manage this crisis and the recovery on a step-by-step basis. And as you would expect, as you\u2019ve seen from JetBlue in the past, we\u2019re conservative in nature. You\u2019ll see us go step-by-step as we navigate our way through this. But 2020 has been the key focus for now, and we\u2019ll continue to look at future years as we navigate this crisis and look into the timing and the speed of the recovery.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. Steve, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve sought aircraft lease deferrals or maybe negotiations are still taking place. Can you provide any update there?\nSteve Priest: Yes, I can. Good morning, Jamie. And just as a reminder, in terms of our overall fleet, we\u2019ve generally been in the position where we\u2019ve owned our own fleet. We have limited number of leases at JetBlue. Think around like 40, most of that\u2019s on our E190 fleet. So we are and have been in extensive discussions with our lessors around that. But as you can imagine, I wouldn\u2019t be disclosing the details on a public call. But yes, I can assure you, as you would expect, that no stone is left unturned, and that includes our lessor partners, the supporters of JetBlue.\nJamie Baker: Okay, that\u2019s fair. Can you provide an update on that unencumbered asset pool, both the size, when it was most recently appraised? And I guess, peeling back the onion a bit, the constitution of the pool. And following on the Hunter\u2019s question, does that $750 million raise over the next few months? Any specific loan to value assumptions, as part of those plan transactions as it relates to the pool? Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Great question, Jamie. So just to give you some color, we have around 70 unencumbered aircraft in the fleet, but it\u2019s not just around aircraft. Obviously, we\u2019ve got other unencumbered assets with regard to engine spares and other collateral that we sort of look at. We genuinely take quite a conservative approach. And as you would expect to do, we have been very active in terms of working with appraisers to understand the market value of our assets. So that we can be on the front foot when it comes to raising further debt. And so you should think of our collateral pool so directionally heading towards $2 billion. But that excludes things like the loyalty program or any other sort of subsidiaries where, again, we have had started to have some good extensive discussions with the treasury and their advisors around sort of the backstop of the government loans. So when you think about the $750 million debt raise. For me, we have a nice pool of assets and liquidity with a quality asset sitting behind that, where we can get the requisite loan to value to get the funds raised. And again, that will be a combination you should assume a sale-leasebacks and sort of aircraft debt markets. So that\u2019s really how we\u2019re thinking about this at the moment. And then in parallel, as I say, we\u2019re working with the treasury to have the government loan on the shelf. So in the event, we need it, we\u2019ve got it there as a backstop. So that\u2019s really how we\u2019re thinking about these things.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Oh, yes, thanks. Good morning. Robin. I appreciate that there are a number of different scenarios in terms of what a demand recovery looks like. But you\u2019re kind of raising liquidity based on one of those playing out and then I would assume you would look to raise more if things perform worse than that. So can you just help us understand with maybe what you are expecting over the next couple of quarters from a revenue standpoint, just so we can kind of have a baseline to measure against? Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Sure. Joe, actually, I\u2019m going to hand that over to Joanna to talk about the next two quarters. I just want to make a general point here about demand. I mean, raising liquidity is important in a time like this, because it talks to your sustainability as you come through it. I want to tell you and I go back to sort of the three objectives I laid out earlier. Reducing down our cash burn is important, because you can kind of limp out of this thing with a lot of debt and then spend a lot of time paying that down. So we don\u2019t want to just raise liquidity to burn it. So we\u2019re raising liquidity, but we\u2019ve got to aggressively to continue to reduce cash burn. And I want to give a shout out to the team, because they have been incredible how aggressively we have moved. I mean, Steve gave some examples in his comments. I look at how aggressive we\u2019ve been with DoT to get permission to reduce flying. When we got denied, we went back and we applied and then got some success. We put another application in a couple of days ago for an additional set of markets. So for me, because even if $1 million a day, I know it doesn\u2019t sound much. But over a three-month period, even my math tells me that\u2019s another $90 million or so that you can sort of ensure you don\u2019t have to then pay down when we come out of this. So it\u2019s liquidity, it\u2019s cash burn, it\u2019s balance sheet, and then it\u2019s a path to repairing that balance sheet as quickly as you can. So that\u2019s just how we\u2019re approaching it. And then I\u2019m going to \u2013 I\u2019ll maybe hand over to Joanna to talk about demand in the next two to \u2013 couple of quarters knowing that there are so many uncertainties here that it\u2019s actually very hard to cope.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. Thanks, Robin. So just to echo Robin\u2019 comment, there\u2019s so much uncertainty around the timing and the shape of recovery. So our focus has been on remaining flexible. We do expect a phased recovery and adapting to that changing environment. From a planning perspective, we\u2019re assuming an L-shaped curve, which has recovery beginning in earnest out into Q3 and Q4. I think at the end of the day, recovery is going to be dependent on customers being confident, returning to flying and crewmembers feeling safe to work. We do think that our model has inherent advantages that will serve us well in the recovery process. Obviously, as we\u2019ve mentioned, predominantly leisure, predominantly domestic, we definitely have a differentiated product. Our lower cost, we think will be critical during this timeframe, narrow-body airplanes and then obviously our brand. We are trying to stay incredibly close, monitoring all leading indicators, as well as measuring customer sentiment in terms of what customers are going to need to get comfortable flying again. And when we see those green shoots, we want to be in a position to take care of them. We have, in our view, led the industry throughout this pandemic from our flexible waiver program to the extension of the travel bank. We\u2019ve led the industry and capacity cuts. I think, we\u2019ve been probably third highest in terms of capacity cuts. We know we\u2019ve led the industry in social distancing. We capped flights back in March. So we\u2019re well positioned, further capped provided wipes to customers. And as you think about that recovery, all those things are going to be so critical to getting customers back on our planes when the time is right. But again, so much uncertainty. The planning has Q3, Q4 level of demand coming back, but again up in the air for every carrier right now.\nJoseph DeNardi: Sure. I appreciate that. Steve, you guys are, I think, the first airline to use an advanced sale of miles as a source of liquidity. Can you talk about what restrictions that may include in terms of using that asset as collateral, if any? And then other airlines have kind of talked about what they think the value of the program is. Can you talk about that as well? Thank you.\nSteve Priest: No. It\u2019s all great to speak. Good morning. With regards to the mileage purchase, we decided to sort of do a transaction in Barclays. It was just a relatively small liquidity raise. The terms are pretty attractive. We\u2019ve been very, very fortunate to have such a fantastic relationship with Barclays over the last few years, I really stepped up. And so we sort of took the opportunity to add a little bit of liquidity in there. It doesn\u2019t come with any restrictions that we need to be concerned about. With regards to the overall program, obviously, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we are in advanced talks with the treasury advisors. And one of the things we are sort of discussing is the loyalty program. So we have been getting a valuation done. It\u2019s not complete yet, but we\u2019re working through that process, because it is a less mature program than some of the legacy players. But with that, it is \u2013 it does give us significant value for JetBlue. So we\u2019re looking forward to having that valuation complete. And it should be a good source of asset for us as we sort of go forward.\nJoseph DeNardi: Good luck.\nRobin Hayes: And, Joe, good luck in the big debate with a Hunter. If you need an airline CEO to lead that for you, I\u2019m available.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good morning. Just \u2013 first, a quick clarification. Steve, you had mentioned four items that are kind of bridging your cash burn from what you\u2019re seeing today in May and what you think you can get to the third quarter. One was just maybe the passenger revenue drag going away, non-aircraft CapEx coming down, and then kind of the early opt-out programs kind of taking effect. I missed what the fourth factor was. I was wondering if you could remind me again?\nSteve Priest: Good morning, Savi. It\u2019s just a general continued focus on cost reduction. You know better than the most, the amount of detail we went over the last couple of years around the structural cost program, taking many hundreds of millions of dollars out of JetBlue\u2019s cost structure. That has stood us in good \u2013 put us in good shape coming into this crisis. But there\u2019s always more to do. And again, the teams have really stepped up to go that level deeper. And so you continue to see the flow of some of those initiatives going from 50%, for example, to 100% of initiative as you go through to the next few months. So that\u2019s the fourth item I was talking about.\nSavanthi Syth: Great. And actually, that fits right in with the question I had, which was the maintenance contracts for some of the big items \u2013 for the engines where some of the big items you were working on the last couple of years. And that was done in a time, where capacity was really \u2013 supply was really tight and \u2013 with \u2013 for the MROs. And so I wonder if \u2013 is this an opportunity? I know these are long-term partners, but an opportunity to go to your kind of MRO partners and get perhaps kind of better longer- term deals that have probably kind of a better \u2013 sets you up better longer-term?\nSteve Priest: Yes. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t assume Savi that we haven\u2019t been talking to them, because, again, there\u2019s a number of our partners, this is such an unprecedented crisis. I think about partners like Pratt & Whitney, as we\u2019ve gone through this crisis, they\u2019ve been shoulder to shoulder with us, as we\u2019ve worked through this liquidity crisis. And so, yes, I mean, we spent many, many months, in fact, over a year-and-a-half going through these engine maintenance contracts. But going through that sort of experience with these business partners has been terrific. And now an hour of need, they\u2019ve stepped up again. So those conversations continue and we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making.\nSavanthi Syth: Makes sense. And if I can just clarify, the four air \u2013 leased aircraft that you were planning to lease earlier this year, is that just suspended or is that just deferred?\nSteve Priest: It\u2019s suspended.\nSavanthi Syth: Okay. Thank you.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Savi. Have a good day.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. I appreciate the time and thanks for squishing me in at the end. Two questions. One is, did you talk about the number of people who took leads? Or are you having everybody continue to work and just do fewer hours?\nRobin Hayes: Hi, Helane, I\u2019ll take that. Our crewmembers have really stepped up. We\u2019ve had \u2013 since we sort of put out a series of voluntary programs about over 11,000, about 60% of our crewmembers have taken some form of voluntary time off. There is a real sense of what we are in this together. We\u2019re going to get through this together. And I couldn\u2019t be \u2013 so I couldn\u2019t be more proud of just how many have stepped up to take some voluntary time off.\nHelane Becker: Okay, all right. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then my other question is, Robin, we spent a lot of time earlier this year talking about sustainability and what you guys were doing in that front. And I know that probably takes a backseat to what\u2019s going on right now with the virus and everything like that. But how are you thinking about that, because I know that was going to be an important issue for you this year and going forward. So, I don\u2019t know, if you could talk a little bit about that?\nRobin Hayes: No, by the way, it is not taking a backseat at all, I mean, investors who are really committed to this space, they\u2019re looking at how companies handle events like this, what decisions that you take. So it is critical. And when we think about the future size and shape of JetBlue, we haven\u2019t spent that much time on this call talking about that. Under the leadership of Tracy Lawler, who leads our strategy team, we created a number of focus areas and one of them is ESG. Because as we come out of this, there were a number of things, I think, we\u2019ll be doing differently as an airline, as an industry. And I think ESG is absolutely core to that. And so it\u2019s not going to go away. We\u2019re in the middle of something now that is \u2013 we\u2019ve never been through. We know we have to be aggressive coming out the other side. We didn\u2019t work hard in the last 10 years to get the second best balance sheet in the U.S. to waste it all kind of as we go through this crisis. So we know we have a lot of difficult decisions ahead of us. We\u2019re managing that as we sort of work through what the future size and shape of JetBlue is. But ESG is actually one of the main pillars of that work, and it absolutely should be.\nHelane Becker: Great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes. Good morning, everyone. I guess, two questions here. One, just Joanna and maybe Robin or Steve can chime in, as it relates to you had mentioned earlier about Transatlantic getting pushed back, obviously, given the backdrop. How do you think about the A220? I mean, the first airplanes are coming in later this year, and I would think that probably not the most optimal time to induct a new airplane type, combined with the fact that, there\u2019s probably going to be some, call it, non-value-add expenses associated with pilot training and the like. How do you think about that? And as we move through the year, does that potentially get pushed back as well, your thoughts on that?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Mike. I copy that up. Good morning to you.\nMichael Linenberg: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Priest: As we said, I mean, we have been evaluating a number of demand scenarios as we sort of go through this. And before the crisis, we\u2019re incredibly excited about replacing the E190s and the A220 is obviously a pivotal part of that. The A220 business case, because of its sort of newer technologies and the economics of the aircraft incredibly strong economics and a real game changer for JetBlue. And so, as Robin said, we don\u2019t want to be tone-deaf. We\u2019re going through this crisis. We \u2013 when we come out the other side of this, we can seem to be excited about the A220s and the benefits that can bring to JetBlue. And it also gives us thoughts about, what can we retire and how we sort of navigate that as we go forward, thinking around the E190 fleet. And so I don\u2019t think you should think that anything changes. The economics is aircraft are spectacular and I\u2019m pleased to have them in the order book. As we sort of look and we\u2019ve been talking to Airbus as we go forward, that remains intact and I\u2019m looking forward to being in the 220s into the fleet.\nRobin Hayes: Yes. And if I can just add one thing. We\u2019re going to stay on, by the way, I know some of you might have to drop off, we have a couple of questions like, which we\u2019ll cover. But the only thing I\u2019ll add, Mike, is when we think about like demand and what\u2019s going to come back, we \u2013 we\u2019re running scenarios for different segments, different geographies. And I think we all look at business travel and where we think that we know we it\u2019s going to take sometime to come back and where we have markets that have \u2013 like a Boston DCA, where we have multiple sequences a day. Those markets may be actually better served with a less frequency for a period of time and an airplane like A220 could be really helpful for that in actually helping us serve it more profitably. So I can\u2019t think to Steve\u2019s point, we made some \u2013 I\u2019m very happy. I want to call out Airbuses while they\u2019ve been a really good partner. This was not easy for them. The priority was 2020. And we can always look at it and say, wish we could have got more. I think, it\u2019s really, really good for us that we\u2019ve got clarity on where we are, we can go forward, we can plan for a lower CapEx headline that we can focus on getting our cash burn to other initiatives around non-aircraft CapEx and operating expense for the rest of the year.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, very helpful. And then just a quick one to Steve. I\u2019m not even sure you even mentioned this in the comments. But just in the release, it talks about adding hedges through the June, September and December quarter, obviously, taking, being opportunistic and taking advantage of the low fuel price. What \u2013 to what extent are those hedges? What\u2019s the coverage? I guess, maybe that\u2019s actually very difficult to ascertain, given that you don\u2019t know what your capacity plans are going to be like over the next few months. But just if you could give us some more color on that hedge book? Thank you.\nSteve Priest: Great question. Just to clarify, my \u2013 these are not incremental hedges, these are in place before we sort of went forward. So, post crisis, obviously, we\u2019ve been completely focused on cash burn and wouldn\u2019t be sort of entertaining that. Obviously, as we pull down capacity significantly, the proportion of the fuel that\u2019s actually hedged has gone up pretty significantly when you\u2019re flying about 10% of the schedule. So you should think about the sort of lot of stuff in the sort of 50% range compared to where it was before. But in terms of overall insurance and everything else that we\u2019ve got on those things, it\u2019s not particularly significant, but nothing new since the crisis. And again, the hedge side of things has moved up as a factor of the reduced flying and the reduced ASMs that we\u2019ve got in the network.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Hey, good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just had one for Steve on the Barclays point sale. You guys seem to act pretty quick on this. Just curious, was the ability to pull forwards some of these mileage sales a part of your agreement with Barclays at already predetermined rate? Or was this all negotiated as the crisis unfolded? Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Again, I just want to reiterate, we have a number of like very strategic partners at JetBlue and Barclays are clearly there with us. They were very quick to reach out to us as we sort of got into this crisis and put attractive terms on the table. And when we looked at it until at the level of it, it was just a good opportunity for us to get a small amount of incremental liquidity attractive terms. So I wouldn\u2019t read any more into it than what what you see there.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. And so did this \u2013 did that money come in, in March or April?\nSteve Priest: I think it was in March.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with SIG.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Good morning, and thanks for getting on here. So two questions. Earlier in your prepared remarks, I believe, perhaps in response to someone you spoke about, looking at leading indicators with respect to demand in the second-half. So curious are you talking about bookings, infection rates, hospitalization rates? And then the second question is, the crisis here, obviously, is not localized to a certain part of the economy or, specific industry. So as we think about the value chain for aviation here as a whole, I\u2019m guessing that there are opportunities certainly upstream around perhaps airport costs, catering and things like that, where there costs that in the past that have been fixed and largely perhaps inflexible. I\u2019m guessing at this point, there\u2019s opportunities going forward to revisit these. So outside of all the work that you\u2019ve done on the maintenance side and some of the areas as part of your structural costs program, could you talk about perhaps, what opportunities there might be up and midstream \u2013 in the up and midstream markets with respect to costs going forward? Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Hey, Chris\u2026\nRobin Hayes: I\u2019ll hand over the first part to Joanna on the indicators. I will say that we\u2019re going to keep our comments quite high-level, because we think that some of the insights packages and some of the ways we\u2019re looking at this, we see as a source of sort of something we want to kind of keep within JetBlue. But I\u2019ll ask Joanna to maybe at a high-level, sort of share some of the things that we\u2019re looking at. Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Great. Hi, Chris. Thanks. So we have a number of indicators we\u2019re looking at. Obviously, all statistics through the WHO COVID case count, all the factors that are playing into whether the curve is flattening or not, obviously, monitoring all of the shelter and place restrictions and all the travel advisories across international locations, taking a look obviously at unemployment data and other macroeconomic factors. We\u2019re monitoring Google Trends, looks and trying to make sure that we understand what customers are shopping for, what they\u2019re looking at, how we stack up next to other carriers, credit card spend, consumer sentiment indicators. We obviously have a number of tools that we use that measure traffic to our website, our bookings, data, GDS data, so there\u2019s a whole variety of factors. We also began this week, asking a number of questions around our customer sentiment as well. So all of these sources are what we\u2019re relying on to arrive at a recovery stage indicator for each category.\nSteve Priest: Hi, Chris, Steve here. I just want to make sure I\u2019m absolutely clear, is the essence of your question, our ability to in-source activities from a cost standpoint?\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: So whether there\u2019s opportunities to revisit some costs up in midstream that in the past has, for whatever reason, you might have just accepted them for what they were, if you will. But given the pressure across pretty much the entire value chain here, I\u2019m guessing folks are looking for relief everywhere. And so as we think about costs, and perhaps also the footprint of the network as we come out of this, what opportunities there might be outside of the work you\u2019ve done on maintenance within the cost reduction program, which, my understanding was sort of like the biggest piece there?\nSteve Priest: Great question, Chris. I thank you for clarifying. I think if I bubble it up to a strategic level, we are doing a piece of work around sort of future size and shape of JetBlue in terms of what we look like coming out of this crisis. You also sort of think about, we\u2019ve traditionally looked at what the split is between the world we\u2019ve done ourselves and we\u2019ve had business partners to do. We\u2019ve taken the opportunities as we\u2019ve navigated through this crisis, as I said, in my prepared remarks, to bring some of that work in-house. I was sort of 29 airports, where we\u2019ve done certain things like that. You will, I believe and continue to see some consolidation in the business partner space as we navigate this crisis. But again, the one thing I would say, we\u2019ve spent the last three years going through every single cost line and every single function across JetBlue is part of structural cost program. So we know where the opportunities are. And as we sort of continue to go through size and shape, work with our strategic business plans as we continue to do, there will be further opportunities for us to take our cost structure down and our ultimately cash outflows down. So great question, very strategic approach. And that\u2019s something where we are focused on as we come out the other side this crisis.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, everyone. And that concludes our first quarter 2020 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: And again, that will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 4, "year": 2019, "date": "2020-01-23 16:42:09", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Levi and I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue's Director of Investor Relations, Mr. David Fintzen. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks Levi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, our investor update and a presentation that we will reference during this call. All of those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and have been filed with the SEC. Joining me here in New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Stephen Priest, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A are Scott Laurence, Head of Revenue and Planning; and Dave Clark, VP of Sales and Revenue Management. This Morning Call includes forward looking statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors and therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on the statements. For additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ from the forward-looking statements. Please refer to our press release, 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC. Also during the course of our call, we may discuss several non-GAAP financial measures for reconciliation these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website. And now, I'll turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks Dave. Good morning and thank you for joining us everyone. I'll start with my thanks to our amazing team of almost 23,000 crew members. Next month, we will celebrate our 20th birthday. And I could not be prouder of the accomplishments of the JetBlue family over two decades. Our spirit of teamwork and founding values continue to shine and in 2019 alone, we received 24 domestic and international awards. These include recognition from JD Power and TripAdvisor to name just two. None of this would be possible without our crew members, who deliver our mission to inspire humanity in everything they do. Over 20 years, we have become a force for good in our industry serving customers in some of the most important markets across the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America. We have worked hard to improve our balance sheet, expand and strengthen our network and have made investments in our fleet to improve margins and returns. More recently, we focused our efforts to reset our cost structure and return to our roots as the low-cost airline. Our low-cost structure enables us to continue to offer our differentiated products and service and low fares to our customers. Since our inception as an airline that JetBlue model has had a positive and lasting impact on the US airline industry, raising the bar for improving service while also benefiting customers with lower fares. In 2019, we took further strides towards making JetBlue a better and stronger airline. In bringing this year to a close, I'd like to highlight just a few of the accomplishments of our team. We beat the midpoint of our 2019 initial cost guidance and completed our structural cost program exceeding the original goal we established back in 2016. We rolled out Fare Options 2.0, the next iteration of fare bundling. We made significant progress in the cabin restyling program which is improving both customer satisfaction and returns. We took delivery of our first six A321neos, added our longest route ever and we are looking forward to taking our first A320 by the year end. We strengthened our focus cities and made some difficult but important changes to our network to add relevance to our leisure and business customers. We ramped up JetBlue travel products, laying the groundwork for the next period of growth. We added two new members to our Board of Directors and would like to take the opportunity to welcome Vivek Sharma who brings his extensive background in technology and digital leadership. We continue to invest in our most valuable assets, our crew members. I am proud that our crew members have earned a total of 250 college degrees through our JetBlue Scholars Higher Education program since launching in 2016. Last year, we also announced that we are expanding the program to include master's degrees. Lastly, we continue to protect our culture as we grow. And we are working on expanding JetBlue's University campus in Orlando and have some very exciting 20th anniversary celebrations planned. We remain committed to the touches that made us special for 20 years including our industry-leading crew member stock purchase plan, our community connection program and our peer-to-peer recognition programs. In 2019, our crew members reached an incredible milestone volunteering one million hours of service over the past eight years. Our crew members have given their time to help communities recovering from natural disasters and encourage stem education through the JetBlue foundation. Our crew members champion the causes they care about by volunteering with organizations they are passionate about. All of these accomplishments contribute to the building blocks as we look to deliver $2.50 to $3 earnings per share this year. Our progress towards our 2020 goal has not been without hard work. I'm humbled with how our crew members have risen to meet each obstacle we've encountered along the way. Just to mention a few examples. We successfully overcame the pressure from lower capacity headwinds on our unit costs. And cycled through our first pilot deal offset revenue challenges and still delivered on our 2019 cost goals. I'm pleased to say that as a small thank you, we'll be paying a $500 bonus to each crew member in recognition of their efforts towards meeting these important goals. And that expense is included in our fourth quarter results. 2019 saw some unexpected revenue headwinds, particularly with an unusually volatile year in our Latin and Caribbean markets. I want to pause for a moment on behalf of our crew members and leadership team our thoughts are with all of those impacted by the recent Puerto Rico earthquakes including some of our crew members, customers and their families. For the past three years, we've seen the hardships that followed Hurricane Maria and I'd like to thank those in our operation and support centers for volunteering your time helping in the relief efforts. As we have done in the past, we are working closely with the authorities and community to support short-term needs and help in the recovery. Following a natural disaster, it is common to see a lingering demand impact even in nearby areas that were not damaged. History suggests that bookings were normalized, where we expect a random impact in the first quarter. While events such as this one have masked some of the progress, we have made in our building blocks. We are confident in our plan to grow our revenues. We'll expect over two-thirds of our revenue initiatives to mature throughout the year and that progress is reflected in a significant sequential improvement in RASM growth in our first quarter's guidance. We are mindful that this year we anticipate facing heightened competition in both Boston and our Florida markets. But we believe Fare Options 2.0 will be a key contributor to support our RASM growth and [indiscernible] to compete more effectively. We again anticipate double-digit growth in ancillary revenue per customer as our loyalty program continues to mature and we expect to make some exciting announcements related to our travel product subsidiary in the near future. The continuing progress we've made in our cost base is the best evidence of our determination to deliver improve results in our building blocks. This year, we expect to deliver negative CASM Ex-Fuel growth and we will execute the final year of our [0% to 1%] [ph] CAGR growth commitments. We expect to deliver on our cost goals in 2020 once again even with the meaningful neo delays in our order book. I can't emphasize enough how challenging the delays have been to our crew members and customers during the past year. Our teams have been outstanding in adjusting plans and finding solutions to offset most of the negative impacts and lower capacities. We have put together a contingency plan to further protect our cost achievements from potential additional delays including an agreement for used aircraft. With regards to the trade dispute between the US and the European Union, we are working to address the impact of a 10% tariff imposed by the US government on new aircraft delivered from Airbus facilities in France and Germany. JetBlue has filed comments with the US Trade Representative noting the tariff and any increase or expansion of the scope of the goods covered by the tariff will negatively affect aircraft deliveries to the detriment of JetBlue, the airline industry and customers. JetBlue supports a fair international trading structure, but believe that tariffs would ultimately impacts our ability to grow our business, leads to higher fares for customers and drive less competition. We've urged the US government to reach a fair trade deal with the EU. Protecting our business requires us to act on climate change and ensure both the financially successful and more sustainable business. We are the first major US airline to announce carbon neutral domestic flights. We have also procured sustainable aviation fuel for flights out of San Francisco, giving us early access to this lower carbon fuel and we believe positioning us to move faster on supply in the future. We've also taken other actions to protect the long-term sustainability and future of our business. We continue to protect and diversify our talent pipelines, expanding our gateway select pilot program and extending our recruiting efforts with a hiring strategy that honors and supports our veterans. Our JetBlue Foundation also helps create a path for underrepresented students interested in a career in aviation. Our strategy on these issues is published annually using the SASB and TCFD standards. We are proud to be among the first companies worldwide to disclose using these standards, enabling stakeholders to better understand our long-term risk and return profile. Looking into 2020, we are thrilled to see our plan coming together. Despite some temporary headwinds and an evolving competitive environment, our improved operation and enhanced revenue tools are enabling us to compete more effectively in the future. We are pleased that our business is responding to the actions we've been taking in our network and this year we expect to continue to reaping the benefits of our commercial actions. This gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year targets and deliver a pretax margin above industry average. Thank you again to our crew members for your passion over the past two decades. Over to you Joanna?\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. First, I'd like to also recognize the hard work of our crew members who have delivered a safe and reliable operation this past year. Turning to Slide 6 in our capacity outlook. During the fourth quarter, our capacity grew 6% in the upper half of our guidance range of 4.5% to 6.5%. Our full year capacity grew 6.6% also in the upper half of our original growth plan of 5% to 7%. This was due to improve completion factor and shifting the timing of our cabin restyling program to make up for neo delays. We saw improvements in key operating metrics in 2019. I'd like to highlight our improvement in completion factor, where we are now among the best in the industry. A special thank you to our tech ops team for their tremendous efforts to strengthen our operation. In 2019, we had almost 70% fewer maintenance related cancellations compared to 2018. These are great accomplishments considering our high aircraft utilization model and the fact that almost three-quarters of our operation touches congested airspace more than any other US carrier. Turning to capacity growth. For the first quarter of 2020, we expect our year-over-year capacity growth between 1.5% and 3.5% with a full year capacity guidance range between 5.5% and 7.5%. Quarterly capacity growth in 2020 reflects our current expectations of Airbus deliveries, as well as additional seats from our cabin restyling program. Our forecasted first quarter growth is unusually low for us. And our annual growth is over two points lower than our plan from our 2018 Investor Day. By further controlling costs, we've been able to mitigate most of the impact from lower capacity. We've also identified opportunities to mitigate potential additional aircraft delays and recently signed an agreement to lease used A321 which we expect to begin flying later this year. Our capacity guidance for 2020 assumes that only 11 of our 14 contractual Neos will be delivered by Airbus in 2020. Moving to our network plan. We plan to continue taking targeted capacity actions to both strengthen relevance in our focus cities and adjust to revenue pressures in parts of our network. All of this work continues the reallocation efforts we started almost a year and a half ago. For our crew members, network changes include some difficult decisions to close not just routes but also blue cities. In doing so, we've been able to focus our growth plan on our focus cities. Some examples include adding relevance to our Boston customers with 15 daily flights to DCA and 10 daily flights to LaGuardia. We now offer the most nonstop flights between Metro New York and the LA basin. This year, we also expect to continue expanding our successful Mint cabin in our transcon markets. We are confident in our network action and are encouraged by the improving performance of our leisure and VFR international markets, which continue to produce strong margins for JetBlue. We anticipate tactical capacity adjustments will support a quarter-over-quarter improvement in Latin and Caribbean unit revenues. We are pleased with the performance of our business markets, driven by strong demand trends and we are happy with the progress in our transcon franchise. Turning to Slide 7 and the revenue outlook. Taking a step back, 2019 saw some unique challenges in our Latin and Caribbean markets. We made tactical adjustments and are seeing a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter into the first quarter of 2020. In our domestic markets, we are pleased to report that 2019 RASM meaningfully outperformed the industry on a stage adjusted basis. Regarding the fourth quarter, our RASM decreased 2.7% versus last year in line with our December update range of minus 3.5% to minus 1.5%. During the fourth quarter, close in bookings for the Thanksgiving peak were not as strong as we originally expected. By region, our international RASM reflected a sequential improvement from our early capacity actions despite competitive pressures in some markets. As expected, we saw sequential decline in our domestic RASM driven by added capacity. For the first quarter, we expect strong sequential improvement in RASM in both our domestic and Latin markets, resulting from our capacity actions, our revenue initiatives, easier comps and lower scheduled growth. Our first quarter guidance of 0% to 3% includes a headwind of approximately 0.5 point to our system RASM due to earthquakes in Puerto Rico. We remain committed to the island but given the most recent booking trends, we are temporarily reducing capacity to protect RASM. We would anticipate restoring this flying as demand recovers. I'd like to thank the various teams across JetBlue who were involved in executing and delivering fare options 2.0. We are pleased with the early performance and are seeing tangible benefits in the first quarter, which we expect will continue to ramp as the year progresses. We are also excited about further progress in our commercial building blocks. These include the maturation of our network reallocation efforts, JetBlue travel products and added growth from ancillaries including loyalty. At the end of 2019, our ancillary revenue per customer reached $34 growing 14% year-over-year. This accomplishment includes another outstanding year of growth in our co-brand credit card. We continue to see momentum from customers signing up for the card and earning and using true-blue points in our network and with our partners. Ancillary revenue performance was also driven by our efforts to optimize the pricing of checked bags and even more spaced seats. This year, we expect to continue optimizing the pricing of ancillary and adding initiatives that promote self-service such as change and cancel servicing fees. We also plan to make investments in our reservation platform and upgrade our revenue management system. We continue to work in each building block both to protect and to grow our revenue base. When normalized for Easter and Passover holiday shift, we expect that our network in pricing actions to strengthen our markets and it will result in our best quarter-over-quarter RASM acceleration since 2016. Looking beyond the first quarter, we anticipate that our initiatives will continue to ramp contributing to our earnings progression each quarter. In total, we believe that our revenue building blocks will add approximately three points of RASM growth throughout 2020. Again, a huge thank you to our amazing team across JetBlue for delivering a safe and solid operation and for continuing to deliver a great experience to our customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.\nStephen Priest: Thank you, Joanna. I'll start on Slide 9 with some highlights from the fourth quarter. Revenue is $2 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Adjusted pretax margin was 10.9%, up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year. Both GAAP and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.56. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 27% and 26% for the full year. Before going to details on our cost execution, I'd like to acknowledge the outstanding job of our crew members, who helped us exceed that cost saving initiatives in 2019. Despite a number of meaningful headwinds, the efforts of our teams over the past couple of years are helping reset our cost base and we'll set up JetBlue to success in 2020 and beyond. This year, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 23% higher than our peer average. This accomplishment has set us up nicely to deliver even on current consistent estimates, the best EPS growth in our industry in 2020, significantly outperforming our peer groups. Moving to Slide 10, CASM Ex-Fuel for the fourth quarter was flat in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Our reported figure includes a special bonus for our crew members as an acknowledgment of their outstanding efforts in 2019. If we exclude the bonus expense, our underlying CASM Ex-Fuel declined 0.9% year-over-year beating our guidance. In 2019, CASM Ex-Fuel grew 0.8% beating the midpoint of our initial full-year guidance of 0% to 2%. Again excluding the bonus, CASM Ex-Fuel grew just 0.5% for the year, well ahead of our plan. I could not be prouder of the determination of our crew members and leaders to deliver our cost targets as we return to our low-cost routes. For the first quarter of 2020, we expect CASM Ex-Fuel growth to range between 1.5% and 3.5%. For perspective, the year-over-year progression in unit cost this quarter is mainly driven by unusually low scheduled capacity growth given a timing of 2019 delivers. In addition, we have scheduled maintenance events during the trough period, the result of expenses shifting into the quarter. Heading to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Our updated 2020 CASM Ex-Fuel guidance is now between minus 2% and 0%. We are pleased that despite the capacity constraints tied to the Neo delays, our 2020 goal is very much in line with the original CASM Ex-Fuel goal we announced at our last Investor Day. Furthermore, our 2020 plan reflects our commitment to deliver on our three-year CAGR goal of 0% to 1%. Moving to Slide 11. Since 2018, we have communicated CASM Ex-Fuel guidance for the first and second half. In both 2018 and 2019, we either delivered or exceeded our guidance even at a time of expenses shifted within the year. For either perspective, we finished 2019 with one of our best CASM Ex-Fuel performances in a decade even while cycling to our first pilot contract. In 2020, we expect to deliver negative CASM Ex-Fuel caring for the achievements in 2019. The shape of the CASM Ex-Fuel for the first and second half of the year is driven by three factors. First, structural cost savings manifesting through the P&L. Second, the timing of maintenance expense. Finally, our most impactful is simply the cadence of capacity growth throughout 2020 as you work through neo delays and the cabin restyling program. Moving to Slide 12. During our progress, this will be our last semiannual update on our structural cost program. We are pleased to report cumulative run rate savings of $314 million above the high end of our $250 million $300 million targets that we set at 2016 Investor Day. As expected, this quarter we made further progress across the four pillars ranging from additional improvements in contractual terms with our business partners, technology deployments and efforts to further increase productivity across JetBlue. I'm thrilled to report that we're in the final contracting stage of the V2500 select one engine maintenance IFP following the neo and V2500 pre-select maintenance agreements and asked previously. This rounds out our efforts to reshape our long-term engine maintenance contracts which have been instrumental and exceeding our structural cost savings targets. Looking forward, structural cost is now a way of life for JetBlue. And our work is obviously never done. We expect to continue to offset inflationary pressures on our cost structure and look forward to the benefits of our neo and A220 fleet programs as we move into the next decade. Turning to Slide 13. We ended the fourth quarter with 259 aircrafts taking ownership of our sixth A321 neo in late December. We now anticipate a maximum of 11 neo deliveries in 2020 and are expecting our first A320 delivery by the year end. We have restyled 53 A320 as of today and aim to restore the balance of the fleet by early 2021. We continue to manage our restyling schedule to minimize the impact of low capacity resulting from timing of aircraft deliveries. Turning to Slide 14. Our balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in our industry. Our debt-to-cap ratio sits well within our target range of 34% at the year-end. And we are proud to manage JetBlue to investment-grade metrics. During the fourth quarter, we repaid $65 million in debt and issued a public WTC for $772 million. Our approach to diversify our debt sources is opportunistic and takes full advantage of our strong balance sheet as we reinvest in our business and return excess cash to our owners. In the fourth quarter, we entered into an agreement to repurchase $160 million of shares as part of the current $800 million authorization from the board. This authorization is part of the capital allocation building block discussed at Investor Day. We closed the year with $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, equating to 16.4% of trailing 12-month revenues. Our cash position at the end of the quarter is temporarily higher than our 10% to 12% target given that fewer aircraft delivers in 2019 resulted in some CapEx shifting to 2020. Moving to Slide 15 for an overview of our guidance for the quarter and 2020. We expect another outstanding year on cost execution to support margin improvement as we execute our commercial building blocks. As we move towards the annual EPS goal of $2.50 to $3, our guidance for the first quarter ranges between $0.10 and $0.20 in earnings per share. Before we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to highlight some changes we will be making to our guidance process. Starting this quarter, we will no longer file monthly traffic reports. I'm sure you've noticed a reformatted investor update this morning and starting in April we plan to provide an update ahead of each earnings call as normal course of business, we anticipate providing the markets and update on RASM during the quarter. I'd like to again thank our crew members for helping create further value for our customers and our owners. The fruit of their hard work and engagement is showing in our cost progression. We believe that keeping our momentum will allow us to continue to drive up our margins and benefit all of JetBlue. We remain absolutely committed to delivering our EPS goals. I look forward to executing what we believe is the best earnings growth story in our industry during 2020. We will now take your questions.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks everyone. Levi, we're now ready for the question-and-answer session with the analyst. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nDuanePfennigwerth: Hey, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask you firstly on sort of your revenue forecasting process and how you grade your own execution over the second half of 2019. Can you just let us know how you back tested and to what extent does the revenue forecasting process change based on what you learn along the way?\nJoannaGeraghty: Sure, Great. I'll have Dave Clark to answer that question for us.\nDaveClark: This is Dave. Good morning. Thanks for the question. We've done a lot of work focusing on our guidance accuracy and part of that's been studying the accuracy back to 2017 versus the rest of the industry. Our analysis showed we're doing quite well versus the industry until the summer of 2019. Clearly, we are not satisfied with the forecast performance of the last six months. And we've been putting significant focus on process improvement including how to account for some of the changes our network and our mix of competitors. We're doing some things like adding additional variables and being more granular where we need to. For example, we're no longer treating every ASM of competitive capacity the same. Lastly, we're also running in parallel a new forecast using machine learning. It's not ready for primetime yet but it's something we're working on we envision implementing in the future. So it's been a focus and we look forward to improvement.\nDuanePfennigwerth: Thanks for that color and just for my follow-up. Could you summarize the fee increases or the fee changes that you rolled out in the fourth quarter and how much of this impacted the fourth quarter? In other words when do we hit sort of true run rate on the fee changes you announced? Thanks for taking the questions.\nDaveClark: And just for clarity, we rolled out fee changes last week on optimizing bank fees with self-service as well as change cancel service fee. In the fourth quarter, we rolled out Fare Options 2.0 which will ramp significantly during the quarter. We got a little bit of the benefit in the fourth quarter. We'll get a good bit in the first quarter. It's quite a ramp up but then that will continue to progress throughout the course this year. If you look at the initiatives as a whole which might be the most helpful way, we expect three points of RASM during the year, the full year and that breaks down to low to mid two points in the first half and then mid to high three points in the second half of the progression.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nHunterKeay: Hey, thanks. It looks like a three more A321 are pushed out of 2020. Obviously, you guys - you know what you know and you give it your best guess based on what you know now. But what's your conviction level, Robin, around actually getting those 11 and if you were to sort of say, hey, 50:50, it could go down. I don't know, how would you kind of bracket and the rest of that? And then just to be clear are you leasing three used A321s or more and is Airbus paying for that? Thanks.\nRobinHayes: Good morning, Hunter. Thanks the question. Steve is very close to, so I'm going to throw that one over to him.\nStephenPriest: Hi, Hunter. Good morning. And as you aware from our materials, the Airbus post agreement outlines 14 neos for 2020. You're right with - we're planning the business on 11. And we have, as you can imagine an extensive relationship with Airbus and continue to be in close cooperation with them to understand their production delays. So that we can go forward and understand that. So as it stands at this point in time, we have confidence in the guide that can obviously evolve as things go forward. I reflect back to 2019, we had exactly the same conversations with Airbus. We anticipated a maximum of six aircraft in 2019 and we got six aircraft in 2019. Specifically with regards to additional [prudent] [ph] contingencies that we've put in place, as you heard in our prepared comments, we have gone ahead with an agreement to lease four used aircraft to go forward for 2020 to help us with any contingency plans should things move. I am obviously not going to get into any details of commercial agreements with Airbus, but I'm pleased, (a) with the dialogue we're having with them, (b) the transparency going forward and (c) that we have put good mitigant in place should anything change.\nHunterKeay: Okay, Steve. Thanks. That's helpful. Sorry, I didn't hear this before if you'd said it. Then just another one on the 321, how are the production delays potentially impacting your expansion plans to Europe? Is there a need, is there potential circumstance where you would need to use those planes domestically? And can you update us and where you are on obtaining slots? Thank you.\nStephenPriest: Again, I'll pick up the aircraft side of things. And then I'll get Joanna to give an update on the wider perspective with regard to slots. We remain confident in our plans to continue to grow relevance in both New York and Boston with the European expansion. Great amount of planning underway and again because of the close cooperation with Airbus we are confident with the delivery timeframes around the A321. So I'm going to Johanna to give a better perspective in terms of - our perspectives in terms of slots et cetera.\nJoannaGeraghty: Great. Thanks, Steve. Good morning. We continue to work multiple paths around slots and a number of London area airports were confident that our London plans can work in any number of airports. And we'll update you when we have a bit more information to share.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Baker of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nJamieBaker: Hey, good morning, everybody. Joanna, I'm sorry to ask modeling question and I know you talked about sequential RASM improvement and revenue initiatives going forward as the year progresses. But the revenue growth rate and I'm shifting from RASM to revenue here. In the first quarter you're guiding to kind of a 4% plus top line outcome. But this rate needs to more than double in the second half to hit $2.50. I know you've seen that sort of revenue growth in the past, but could you better break it down into the buckets that helped you get there? I mean like truly material pickup that's required?\nJoannaGeraghty: Yes. So I think I'll first start with capacity. If you look at capacity throughout the year, you should expect stronger revenue in the first half naturally because capacity is lower. Capacity coming in the second half will pressure revenue. As you think about the revenue building blocks, so Dave mentioned we have three points of contribution associated with our revenue initiatives. We started off the year strong with good improvement from Q4 into Q1. And as we think about the rest of the year, we have good momentum on those initiatives. Dave mentioned about three points of benefit with low to mid 2s in the first half and then further ramping into the second half of the year with high to mid-3 for a total of - a total of three points. So if you think about that in their broader context, we started strong and we're on track to continue throughout the year to deliver that $2.50 to $3 of EPS.\nJamieBaker: Okay. That's so - so that implies from revenue growth rate second quarter is your peak year-over-year.\nJoannaGeraghty: First, I'd say the first half is stronger than the back half of the year.\nJamieBaker: Okay and Steve just a quick one on the revised guidance standards. How come and don't get me wrong, I'm not critical of the decision. I'm just curious if it was something you heard from your owners. If it's just about kind of going with the flow, just wondering what the thought process was.\nStephenPriest: Yes. Thank you and good morning, Jamie. I'll just cover a couple of items. The first thing is we've reviewed this as we continue to shift towards an EPS guide as we sort of go through this and considered where we are. The core reason behind this is to drive more alignment in our guidance process with the cadence of the industry. We will obviously continue to bring the same level of transparency to analysts and our owners. And maybe just saw this opportunity just to give a little bit more clarity on the new cadence. You can expect this morning as you've probably noticed, we reformatted our Investor update which includes EPS guide. And we will give an update on RASM in the mid quarter, which is an example may come like for this court in early March. We will continue to give a final update on RASM but with broader investor update for the quarter that is actually closing. So we'll package that up together. So on the following earnings call, we can spend more time thinking about forward-looking guidance. And then as a result of that the overall traffic report ends. But investors and analysts are not losing any information. So primarily, Jamie, it's ensuring alignment with regard to the cadence of the rest of the industry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSaviSyth: Hey, good morning. Just a first question is just some clarification around the fleet. When did you expect those kinds of A321s that were delayed in kind of 2019 and 2020? Is it going to show up? And also just on the used aircraft is that beyond kind of the fleet plan that you have on the presentation? And are those kind of short-term leases there or should we expect them to be in the fleet for kind of more than a couple of years?\nRobinHayes: I'll take that. Good morning, Savi. So specifically, we look at this with Airbus on a year-by-year basis. And going to the next level of quarter-by-quarter basis as we walk through this. And so as a reminder we had 85 Airbus neo orders in the other book and we go through our neo progression and so Airbus to continue to deal with their production challenges. But as I said, it's good that we continue to get the visibility and we can forecast accordingly. So for me at the moment is about working this year-by-year versus worrying about when will they ultimately come because obviously certain things are moving to the right. What we've actually done in terms of our plan, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have assumed delivery of 11 of the 14 neos in 2020. But it is right of us to be prudent and look around the corner and think about what's happening and so we have put these agreements in place for the four leased used aircraft which if we see further delays or further challenges to our business, it gives us some contingency as we go forward. So that's really how you should think about that. And I hope that's clear.\nSaviSyth: And just to - so is becoming the four that coming that's coming that's in addition to what's in the fleet plan in the slide deck, correct?\nRobinHayes: That is correct.\nSaviSyth: Okay. And then just say another fleet question just on the cabin refresh. Could you provide an update on how many works completed at the end of 2019 and just how you're thinking about it for the rest of the year?\nJoannaGeraghty: So as of now we've completed 53 of our cabin restyling plans. As you think about the overall plan, we expect to complete the entire plan by, I'd say, early 2021. The original goal was the end of 2020 but due to the Airbus delays we've had to adjust the restyling schedule to partially backfill those delays so that we can maintain our capacity commitments.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBrandonOglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. So, Joanna, I want to come back to your response a couple earlier where I think you said first half revenue trends should actually be stronger than second half. Are you referring to RASM or yields or were you talking about top-line?\nJoannaGeraghty: I was talking about RASM.\nBrandonOglenski: Okay. And not to be too nuanced here but it does seem like to hit the EPS range which is significantly higher than your earnings level, let's call it in the first quarter, you do need to see likely favorable yield contribution even with that higher growth. So I think you were talking about three points of tailing in the first half and maybe closer to two points of tailing in the back half. How much contingency have you built in there for delays? It seems like price [Tech Difficulty]\nJoannaGeraghty: Sorry you were just bringing up a little bit, but I think I copy you were saying, so I think we, I think I'd point you back to the initiatives as we step into 2020. They continue to ramp through the year. You should think about them in terms of the network reallocation which remains on track with benefits continuing to come in. Our Fare Options 2.0 and remember that launched system-wide in early December. So that will continue to ramp through the year and then obviously growth in ancillaries.\nOperator: Your next question from Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nCatherineO'Brien: Hey, everyone. Good morning. So quiet there's another question on the restyling efforts. I guess, obviously, there could potentially be some risk if there were further delays, but I guess how confident are you in that current schedule. And then can you help us frame the benefit of those modifications to CASM Ex-Fuel efficient this year? Thanks.\nStephenPriest: Hello, Catherine. I'll pick that up. Just to sort of reiterate Joanna's comments earlier. So we are 53 today, we continue to sort of ramp up. We've increased a number of lines that we have on the restyling program, which is great. The other thing I would say is that we consciously decided to try and align the restyling effort with heavy maintenance checks on the airframes as best as we could. And so obviously if you're doing a full heavy check on the aircraft and doing restyling, the amount of mod time is higher. So what we've seen is we cycle through some of that is a physical mod time per restyling effort has reduced and a number of lines that we're pushing through is increased. So we continue to get such a good momentum. I think the one thing I would say about the great work that team has done is we've been reduced, we thought strategically about how we've continued to approach restyling and with the neo delays we've sort of taken a little bit of a pause, a short pause in 2019 as we go forward. And we'll continue to reassess that as we go forward, but we remain confident in the plans we have in place. The momentum that's going because it's great both not only for our customers but also for driving margin for JetBlue. Specifically thinking about CASM Ex and the dynamics of the numbers, you should think about restyling providing about two points of capacity for 2020 when you do - when you look at your models in terms of the ASM so that will provide in addition to the incremental shelves that come into the business.\nCatherineO'Brien: Great. Thanks. And then is there a point where you will seek compensation some Airbus on the ongoing delivery delays? I guess like if that's true is there any downside risks for CapEx figures? Thanks.\nRobinHayes: Yes, Catherine, obviously, it'll be inappropriate for me to comment on any sort of commercial discussions that we have with Airbus on an earnings call. We continue to engage them. Our continues priorities is to make sure we maintain the integrity of our schedule. We deliver for our customers and we get the aircraft onto JetBlue property but at the same time obviously this has been an incredible challenge for JetBlue as we've navigated this over the last couple of years. And we continue the commercial discussions with Airbus.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Helane Becker of Cowen. Your line is now open.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Hey, guys. It's actually Corner calling in for Helane. Just on Puerto Rico, I know it's early days there. Can you talk about a 50 basis point headwind occurring in 1Q? Just curious if your expectation is for that to linger into at least 2Q at this point? I'm just trying to get a sense that for how long it may be impactful. And I know that you talked about making capacity adjustments, just curious on the - their incremental capacity is going? Thanks.\nJoannaGeraghty: Thanks. So let me just start with Puerto Rico remains an important part of our network. It's been a significant margin contributor and we see these pressures from time to time in Puerto Rico and the rest of the industry. I think if you look at last year and some of the changes we made in Punta Cana, we've demonstrated that we will not shy away from taking temporary capacity adjustments to right size the current market and demand conditions. That said we remain very committed to Puerto Rico. We do expect to make temporary capacity adjustments in the short term. It's difficult to forecast the impact of Puerto Rico. If you look at history with NASA enduring, it would tell you that this could linger. Other examples have these situations coming off much sooner. So we're watching it closely. We're doing our best to forecast what we think the impact is. And taking tactical adjustments to mitigate the demand environment as needed.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Okay. And then just on the network may be able to continue that just so you made a lot of adjustments tonight. And I know you made some more in Long Beach just curious if like if that's been rationalized enough at this point. Or maybe you can kind of talk to your process and to how you adjust your network longer term. Thank you.\nJoannaGeraghty: Sure. So every city and every route has to earn its way into our network. The reallocations that we have done over the last year and a half are on track. And we continue to see the benefits of those changes coming in. Our focus is on growing out our key focus cities including Boston and Fort Lauderdale. And we will adjust the network to ensure that we are meeting not only our capacity commitments but also our strategic focus city plan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJosephDeNardi: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Steve or Robin, you guys have clearly had the earnings guide for this year out there for a while. And you stuck by it despite a lot of changes. Can you just talk about given that we're a little bit closer to it is the high end or the low end more within reach for you all? Thanks.\nRobinHayes: Yes, Joe. I'll take that as another chance to answer a question yet really. But, no, look, I think that I'm very pleased. There were a lot of skeptics a few years ago about our delivery on our cost commitment. And I think that we have continued to demonstrate that we have laid out exactly what we said was that we were going to do. I think the benefits on restyling and network are on track. Fair Options, it's very early but we're very pleased with what we're seeing and as Dave mentioned, we have a team in revenue management and our data science team who are sort of monitoring that daily to make sure that we are getting all the benefits we expect on Fare Options and more. I'm very pleased with the sequential change in the RASM from Q4 to Q1, actually I hadn't seen a number like that at JetBlue in terms of the change other than the Easter or Passover holiday since 2016. And again, if it wasn't for the Puerto Rico impact which has been very significant, we would be looking at a two point guide into Q1. And we continue to see the revenue initiatives ramped up. And so I think that gives me a lot of optimism. Now obviously there are risks that we don't control or we can do when those risk emerges, do it and we can to mitigate them. I think we talked about that today on some actions that we've taken in Puerto Rico. And I also - we've seen some of our initiative outperform as well. So as we sit here, all of those things together it gives us confidence in the $2.50 to $3 number. There are some tailwinds that will help us. There also some headwinds that could create some pressure. So industry capacity growth has been something that has been talked about. We've talked a lot about the macro revenue environment. I mean, again, there were a lot of question on that on the last call. We believe our revenue initiatives will allow us to deliver positive RASM even if the macro number is negative. But clearly there's a risk there. So as we go through the year and we get a better line of sight on some of those things that we don't control, both the headwinds and tailwinds. We will tighten the range, we will adjust the range to keep everyone sort of up to date. But I'm very confident where we are now and even a consensus which everyone knows is below to $2.50 to $3, we're going to have industry-leading earnings growth in 2020 by some miles. And so everyone here - I can tell everyone here is very, very focused on the $2.50 to $3. And we're giving everything we've got. And I think we've seen that on many of initiatives that we've rolled out today.\nJosephDeNardi: That's helpful, Robin. And then maybe just a question for Dave or Scott. If I exclude the revenue initiatives from the first quarter guide, it's pretty weak even with low capacity growth. So why isn't underlying just kind of core pricing power given what seems to be kind of healthy demand. The fact that your own capacity growth is pretty low. Industry growth is relatively modest. It kind of suggests that this underlying presence isn't great or there's some erosion or that the accretion from these initiatives isn't as great as maybe you think.\nJoannaGeraghty: Yes. I mean, I think I'd just say that there is sequential improvement as you look at Q4 to Q1 and the profits we are making there, and then Q1 into Q2, we're pleased with the improvements and the revenue initiatives just add to that. And as they ramp up through the year they will contribute to that sequential improvement.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMichaelLinenberg: Hey. Two quick ones here. I guess maybe, Robin and Steve, I want to say, Robin, it's admirable that JetBlue as a company is planning to be carbon neutral for 2020. And I'm just curious it would seem that there is some cost associated with that. And yet you are maintaining the $2.50 to $3. So one, any sort of a sense that you can give on what the potential cost of being carbon neutral? Even round numbers. And then from a CASM Ex perspective, I presume anything that's tied to carbon fuel et cetera finds its way into the Ex part of the cost equation. Is that equation - is that the right way to look at it?\nRobinHayes: Hi, Mike. Appreciate the question and I will get to it, but I'd like to just maybe use this as an opportunity to kind of explain what we've done and why we've done it. I mean we do look at sustainability through a lens of long-term shareholder value creation. And I think that but the airline industry this issue presents a clear and present danger, if we don't get on top of it. And I seem to be out ahead of it. We've seen that in other geographies and we should not assume that those sentiments won't come to the US. And so it's very important that airlines get on the front foot of this which is why we did - what we did. And frankly, it's part of sort of our border ESG commitment across many areas. And I talked about some of those in my comments. So that's why we did it. I do think it's going to become a cost of doing business for the industry. In terms of specifically you're at - actual question around the offsets then I'm not going to get into that. I will say that it's fully factored into our EPS guide. And in terms of where it sits in the line, it's treated as part of our fuel cost, so it won't be in the Ex-Fuel CASM line. It'll be in the fuel guidance. So as we roll, continue to roll out quarterly fuel guidance then it will be included in that. But again the cost and the investment of this is factored into the EPS guide that we provided.\nMichaelLinenberg: Great and then just quick my second question just if you were to sort of characterize how do you think about your relationship with Norwegian? Are they just another sort of inter line partner? Are they something more than that? The reason I ask is because when they announced that they had teamed up with you with a full-page press release lots of superlatives about JetBlue, it looked like it was something big and yet I'm not sure if it is all that big. So I'm just curious about how you characterize that relationship. Thank you.\nRobinHayes: I like press releases, Mike, that are brought on [Indiscernible]. No, Scott, do you want to take that part of the question?\nScottLaurence: Sure. This is Scott. So we did move forward with an LOI and we are in discussions about a partnership but we have over 50 partners. And we look forward to working more closely with Norwegian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Your line is now open.\nMylesWalton: Thanks. Good morning. Stephen, I think you talked about finalizing the engine contract and I just wanted to be clear is it a full-year benefit to 2020 or is going to be signed sometime in the first half and annualized into 2021?\nStephenPriest: Yes. Good morning, Myles. Firstly, I wanted to say a big thank you to the team at JetBlue particularly the fleet Treasury and tech op teams who did a magnificent job over the last two and a half years in terms of aligning and renegotiating for the last pending contract. This was the final piece of the jigsaw in terms of both our airframe and engine maintenance contracts to help JetBlue navigate through the next few years. This contract specifically covering half of our engines on our existing co fleet, and will bring benefits throughout 2020 year, and so you should think about that when you're sort of baking in your models.\nMylesWalton: And just a clarification on the 190 retirement. I guess if not retiring any in 2020 should we think about them ratably retiring though as the 220s come in into 2021?\nStephenPriest: Yes. I think the way that you should think about this is a sort of one for one replacement as A220 is coming. And based on our discussions with Airbus particularly Airbus Canada and how we take things forward, we remain confident in the delivery of our first A220 at the end of this year. Obviously, it would take a couple of months to get into service. As you saw we go through the first aircraft coming to the fleet, but then you're going to have a short transition time between an A220 coming in and an E190 going out for a number of months. So as they come in, we've shared with you the order book that we have. And you can sort of think of that as a one for one replacement as A220 coming in, the E190 go out.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Dan McKenzie of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.\nDanMcKenzie: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Two questions here. First of all, Fare Families 2.0 based on what I'm seeing the segmentation component, it doesn't look like it's being dynamically priced at this point. So the question is, are there IT limitations from that prevent you from doing that?\nJoannaGeraghty: Sure. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll just start with Fare Option 2.0 and what we're seeing in terms of the progress so far. So as I mentioned rolled out in December, 95% of the blue basic fare are now available across our network. We are off to a good start. Benefits will continue to ramp and we are, as we see it so far exceeding expectations in terms of the upsell and the buy up rates. It will continue to evolve as we step through the next few months in terms of a variety of factors around just dynamic pricing, but also as we learn more around how Fare Options works in different markets. The team will get smarter in terms of how we offer the different bundles. Dave, is there anything you'd like to add?\nDaveClark: Just that we're very pleased with the rollout. And this year the big focus will be how do we optimize all the Bi ops, the BI ops2 Blue Bibler flew extra, all the seat pricing, looking at both traditional and new methods to optimize those as we go through the year.\nDanMcKenzie: I see. Okay. And then going back to one of the big revenue drivers for this year is $34 per passenger and so your revenue growing double digits. And please correct me on that but what are the components that are driving that growth exactly? I mean, bag fees of course but what are the other big drivers that are in there?\nJoannaGeraghty: Yes. Sure. So maybe I'll set these in loyalty is the largest driver behind the double-digit growth then you can think of bag fees. We'll see an increase in bag fee this year largely associated with fare options and the unbundling of bags fees. And then there's a contribution from JetBlue travel products as well into our ancillary revenue numbers. So, overall, very pleased with the growth. Yes, it's 34 customer up 14% year-over-year, we expect as we step into 2020 to see strong growth throughout the year as well.\nRobin Hayes: And that concludes our fourth quarter 2019 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day everyone.\nOperator: And again that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-10-22 16:06:06", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Charles. I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue's Director of Investor Relations, Mr. David Fintzen. Sir, please go ahead.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, Charles. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, our investor update and a presentation that we will reference during this call. All of those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and have been filed with the SEC. Joining me here in New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Stephen Priest, our Chief Financial Officer.  Also joining us for question-and-answer session are Scott Laurence, Head of Revenue and Planning; and Dave Clark, VP of Sales and Revenue Management. This morning's call includes forward-looking statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors and, therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on these statements. For additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ from the forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release, 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC. Also, during the course of our call, we may discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to start with my thanks to our more than 22,000 crewmembers across JetBlue's network for their passion in delivering outstanding service to our customers through a busy and challenging summer. Starting on Slide 4 of our presentation. Third quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $239 million, adjusted pre-tax margin was 11.4%, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.59. We are pleased with our 2.4 points of pre-tax margin expansion and EPS growth. Our margins are expanding both on the absolute and relative basis even with a series of unique headwinds from the Latin/Caribbean region that ramped during the quarter. Our results were driven by the compounding benefits of the structural cost program that helped us beat the low end of our cost guidance. As we near the end of 2019, I want to thank all the teams at JetBlue for executing our plans, create long-term value for our customers and owners, including majority of crewmembers, who own JetBlue's stock. We are gaining traction on the building blocks we laid out at our last Investor Day and expect to make further progress in 2020. Despite the myths and pressures in international markets and near delays, we believe we are on track to deliver our goal of $2.50 to $3 of EPS in 2020. Furthermore, we are positioning JetBlue for continued success into the next decade. I'm particularly pleased with our improvement in unit costs. In the third quarter, we beat the low end of our CASM ex-fuel guidance despite over 0.5 point of capacity loss due to Hurricane Dorian. Our improved completion factor more than offset any storm impact and we believe this demonstrates the solid progress that Joanna and the team have made to strengthen the operation. Since 2018, we either beat the low end or the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range while CASM ex-fuel growth. I want to acknowledge the enormous efforts of all of our crewmembers in achieving this important goal that we set 2.5 years ago. The team working in the operation and our support centers understand the importance of our differentiated low-cost model, and this is clearly showing in our numbers, while keeping what is unique to JetBlue, our culture and our award-winning service. In our domestic markets, we are satisfied with our RASM performance throughout the third quarter. We expect to see steady domestic trends during the fourth quarter. In our international markets, we have seen an unusually eventful year, but despite RASM pressures in 2019, this part of the network remains above system margin and we see it as an important earnings contributor to JetBlue in the long term. Our teams are hard at work executing our commercial building blocks, and we believe that our plan to strengthen the unit revenues into 2020 can return us to positive RASM growth. Our efforts include a second year of network reallocation and ancillary initiatives, innovations from JetBlue Travel Products, our progress in loyalty as well as the contributions from Fare Options 2.0 launching this quarter. In 2019, the ancillary network and loyalty initiatives we put in place are helping us outperform domestic RASM growth on a stage-adjusted basis for the second year in a row. Turning to fleet. We are disappointed with the outcome of the dispute between the U.S. and the European Union to impose tariffs on Airbus aircraft. We believe the decision will be detrimental for JetBlue and the U.S. airline industry as a whole. We strongly support an open fare and competitive trade environment, and believe that these tariffs will ultimately lead to higher fares and less choice to our customers. We hope that U.S. and EU will reach a fair trade deal making these punitive and harmful tariffs unnecessary. Although it is still too early to discuss any potential changes we might make to our existing order book, we intend to stay disciplined in our capital deployment. We plan to continue to make capital decisions to maximize that EPS and returns, manage the positive cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet. Regarding our 2020 deliveries, there have not been any significant changes to the delivery schedule since we updated the market in July. We're flying only 1 of our 13 A321neo deliveries we originally expected for 2019, and the delays we announced last quarter have lowered our planned capacity growth for 2020 by at least 2 points versus our 2018 Investor Day plan. We have fully mitigated the capacity impact on unit cost from the NEO delays in 2019 and intend to mitigate the majority of the unit cost pressure we expect in 2020 due to slower growth. On the RASM side, the NEO delays have resulted in some near-term headwinds for the fourth quarter as we shifted flights to off-peak periods. Given our current fleet delivery plan for 2020, we anticipate this pressure to be temporary and should abate early next year. Achieving our 2020 goals is only the first step towards producing superior margins. Looking beyond next year, our goal is to maintain a flattish CASM ex-fuel trajectory. Controlling costs is a way of life for JetBlue, and we plan to remain intensely focused on cost discipline. Our decision in July 2018 to replace our 190 fleet with more cost-effective A220s is just one example of how we're managing JetBlue's cost base, enabling us to expand our margins and grow our earnings. As a reminder, on a pro forma basis from my review last year, the A220 opportunity represents an increase of $0.65 EPS. This is mainly driven by 30% decrease in direct operating cost per seat versus the E190 fleet. Before turning the call over to Joanna, looking back at our recent history, we have made impressive gains on structural costs and margin growth. We believe that the items masking our progress, the pressure in our international markets and NEO delays, are temporary in nature. Turning our RASM trajectory back to positive outlook into 2020 will compound with our gains in unit costs to keep our margin growing. We are confident in our plan to drive the earnings growth and improve margins that our owners expect from JetBlue, and believe we remain on our path to our $2.50 to $3 EPS target for 2020. Again, my thanks to all of our crewmembers for their hard work. Joanna, over to you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. I'll start with our capacity outlook on Slide 6. During the third quarter, our capacity grew 4.8%, near the high end of our guidance range of 3% to 5%. Higher capacity growth was the result of solid improvement in completion factor. We are pleased with the benefits of our operational initiatives, which more than offset the impact of Hurricane Dorian and runway construction in Fort Lauderdale and JFK. I'd like to thank the JetBlue team for the steady operational improvement throughout the year. Since the beginning of the year, we have seen year-over-year improvements in all of our operating metrics including D0, A14 and completion factor. For the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect capacity growth between 4.5% and 6.5%. As a result, we now expect full year capacity to range between 6% and 7%. The increase of our capacity guidance for the year is due to expected improvements in completion factor carrying into the fourth quarter. Scheduled capacity growth for 2019 remains below our initial plan. Turning to our network. Let me start with New York. We're continuing to grow and develop our transcon network, most recently through added frequencies to the JFK-LAX market. We are currently the carrier that offers the most nonstop flights between New York and the L.A. Basin. We also continue to develop our long-haul VFR footprint with planned service between JFK and San Jose, Costa Rica; Guayaquil, Ecuador; and Georgetown, Guyana.  In Boston, we continue to build our network, improve relevance and grow our customer base. We've been pleased with the unit trends in Boston overall, and we're particularly pleased with the growth and performance of the business markets. We now have 15 daily flights between Boston and DCA complementing the hourly service to New York. Both markets are exceeding our expectations. Our relevance in Boston and other focused cities continue to drive up customer loyalty. I'd like to take a moment and talk about our progress in Fort Lauderdale. This focused city continues to develop very well, even as the revenue performance was temporarily impacted by Hurricane Dorian and challenges in the Latin/Caribbean region. We are proud to be the largest operator in Fort Lauderdale offering more than 120 daily departures and providing a differentiated high quality, but still low-cost option to customers. This past month, Broward County approved an additional $500 million in capital improvement to further enhance the customer experience and add gate capacity. We are also proud to call Fort Lauderdale home for JetBlue Travel Products business. Fort Lauderdale will continue to play a central role in our long-term margin and earnings growth. Transcon markets showed solid improvement during the quarter. We continue to see the benefits of the network reallocation efforts we put in place stating -- starting in the fourth quarter of 2019, and mid-RASM growth again outperformed the system quarter driven by strong business segment. Lastly, our Latin and Caribbean franchise was impacted by unique events in a number of markets. We saw demand and competitive capacity challenges begin earlier this year, but ramped significantly through the summer. We've taken quick action and are redeploying capacity to manage demand in the impacted markets. We continue to be bullish on the region long term. Over the years, we've invested in a portfolio of leisure and VFR markets that had and continue to produce strong margins for JetBlue. Today, we are the largest carrier in Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and other key markets. As we look beyond short-term events, we are pleased with how the network is developing. We are very confident both in the network reallocation and disciplined growth that helps expand our margins. In the near term, we plan to continue to take network and capacity actions based on profitability and returns, aimed at building critical mass in our focus cities. Turning to Slide 7 and the revenue outlook. Third quarter RASM decreased 0.9% versus last year, slightly better than the midpoint of our updated range of minus 2% to 0%. Despite RASM trends decelerating during the third quarter due to headwinds we called out in early September, our domestic RASM grew over 3%, outperforming the industry. Latin/Caribbean RASM declined in the high single digits, reflecting reduced demand from the unique disruptions in a number of markets in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect RASM to decline between minus 3.5% and minus 0.5% year-over-year. Looking at our domestic markets, we expect steady demand led by transcon and business. From a high level, we see a broad decelerating domestic yield environment for the Jet -- for JetBlue and the industry as capacity growth ticks up. In the Latin/Caribbean region, we expect our ongoing capacity adjustments combined with demand recovery to improve RASM trends into next year. In the specific markets we called out in Q3, we anticipate third quarter headwinds to continue into the fourth quarter. As in the past, we intend to take network actions to mitigate the impact of external events on these markets and moderate the current RASM decline. As Robin mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we are facing some headwinds from the NEO delays, as we shifted flights to off-peak periods. This has come with some pressure on the quality of loan schedules. We anticipate these headwinds to be temporary given our current expectation for NEO deliveries in 2020. Beyond near-term headwinds, we continue to look forward to more progress in our commercial building blocks. Heading into 2020, we anticipate approximately 3 points of revenue initiatives to return us to positive system RASM growth including from the continued ramp of our network reallocation efforts, Fare Options 2.0, JetBlue Travel Products and our ongoing work in loyalty. We are particularly excited that later this year we expect to roll out Fare Options 2.0. We believe this platform will allow us to better segment our customers and better provide each group with the offerings they find most attractive. We are encouraged by the success of our current version of Fare Options, which launched in 2015, and believe the next iteration will add even more value to our customers, crewmembers and owners. We expect that our revenue initiatives in combination with our other building blocks will drive RASM growth consistent with our $2.50 to $3 EPS goal in 2020. I'd like to add my thanks to our amazing people across JetBlue for delivering a safe operations during the always challenging summer peak. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\nStephen Priest: Thank you, Joanna. I'll start from Slide 9 with some highlights from the third quarter. Revenue was $2.1 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Adjusted pre-tax margin was 11.4%, up 2.4 points from the third quarter of last year. Our pre-tax margin was driven by solid progress in our cost control, partially offset by revenue challenges in the Latin/Caribbean region. Our GAAP pre-tax margin also includes a small gain from our investment in JetSuite equal to $15 million. We reported a $0.63 GAAP EPS per diluted share. Adjusted EPS is $0.59 per diluted share. Our adjusted effective tax rate this quarter was 26%, and we expect a similar effective tax rate to 2019. Moving to Slide 10. During the third quarter, CASM ex-fuel increased 0.3% year-over-year beating the low end of our guidance range of 0.5% to 2.5%. CASM ex-fuel growth was driven by ongoing structural cost program benefits, but also benefited by half point of timing due to expenses shifting from the third to the fourth quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect CASM ex-fuel growth to range between minus 1% and plus 1%. I'm thrilled with the progress we are making on better controlling our CASM ex-fuel. We entered the fourth quarter ahead of the plan for the year , admitted the retirement benefits, and we are well on pace to beat the midpoint to our original full year guidance of 1%. We have lowered our CASM ex-fuel guidance for 2019 to range between 0.5% and plus 1%. I am proud of the efforts of all of our crewmembers and leaders to overcome lower scheduled capacity growth, managing through runway construction in Fort Lauderdale and JFK, and mitigating the impact of NEO delays and Hurricane Dorian. As a reminder, this year, we also cycled through a 1.75 point headwind from our first pilot contract. This accomplishment is the result of relentless execution of our structural cost program and an outstanding focus on cost by the entire JetBlue team. In 2020, we expect our progress in CASM ex-fuel to carry through. We anticipate some pressure on the unit costs coming from the NEO delays and we are working to mitigate much of that pressure through our budget plan. We are committed to delivering the unit cost guidance we laid out for next year. Our 2020 CASM ex-fuel guidance remains between minus 2.5% and minus 0.5%. Progress in unit costs during 2020 will be driven by keeping the momentum of our 2019 structural cost achievements and the impact from our A320 restyling efforts. We are fully aware that improving our margins by managing our unit costs is pivotal to creating value for JetBlue's owners. Turning to Slide 11. We ended the third quarter with 254 aircraft and received our second A321neo just three weeks ago. We continue to expect the maximum of 6 NEO deliveries in 2019 and expect four additional deliveries by year-end. As a reminder, we originally anticipated 13 NEOs in 2019. The current order book is included in the investor update and the appendix to our earnings presentation. We've restyled 40 A320s and continue to target approximately 50 aircraft by the end of 2019. Our restyling plans take accounts of aircraft shifting from 2019 to 2020 in order to minimize the impact of NEO delays on our capacity growth. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to enjoy one of the strongest balance sheets in the U.S. airline industry. Our aim is to manage JetBlue to investment grade metrics. And one example of this is our debt to capital ratio, which was just below our target range of 28% at the end of the third quarter. During the third quarter, we repaid $76 million in debt. We also executed the remaining $125 million from our prior $750 million share buyback program. We recently received authorization from the JetBlue Board to buyback up to an additional $800 million in shares. This new authorization adds to our capital allocation building block estimate for our 2020 EPS goals, which were guided to be over $0.07 in our last Investor Day. We closed the quarter with $994 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, equating to 12.4% of trailing 12-month revenue. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our 2020 EPS goals and are excited by the earnings growth we expect to see next year and into the next decade. We are taking quick actions to offset the near-term headwinds in revenue and will continue to execute on our cost and commercial initiatives. We believe that the most significant earnings benefit is yet to come and that relentless execution on 5 building blocks will drive our success in reaching our EPS goals. I'd like to add my thanks to our outstanding crewmembers for everything they do day in, day out to make JetBlue a better company.  We will now take your questions.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, everyone. Charles, we are now ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Couple of housekeeping items. The commentary on transcon showing solid performance, you identified Mint as part of that. Could you provide some transcon color excluding the front cabin?\nJoanna Geraghty: Transcon overall is performing well.\nJamie Baker: Okay, but it was close to monosyllabic. Very good. All right, I'll settle. Yes, I'll settle for that. At the Investor Day, loyalty was expected to contribute $0.35 to $0.55 in earnings. Actually, that wasn't all loyalty, but loyalty was part of that bucket. I may be mistaken, but I don't see any reference to loyalty at all in the presentation today. Is that an oversight? Or perhaps your modeling assumptions in this regard have changed somewhat?\nJoanna Geraghty: No. We actually did mention it in the script. I think maybe what I'll point out is as you look at ancillary revenue overall, ancillary revenue is up 17% year-over-year. We're now at $33.60 per customer. Loyalty is the biggest component of that. It's the fastest and largest growing component. We've seen our co-brand portfolio more than double in the last 2 years and we are very optimistic about the future of our loyalty program.\nJamie Baker: And just a real quick one for Steve. At what point -- so we can kind of keep this in our calendars, at what point will you provide a guide further out than the $2.50 to $3? Assuming you're on track, which you have said several times today. When should we expect the subsequent guide?\nStephen Priest: I mean, to be honest, we would only revise guide if anything has changed. And when we went out back in 2018 at our Investor Day, we laid out the $2.50 to $3 with some macro assumptions associated with that, and that still stands as we go forward. As we sort of approach next year and we get to the end of this year and we go into the first quarter and our quarter 4 earnings call, you can expect us to sort of talk about a little bit further. But very, very pleased with the progress we continue to make. Very happy with the margin and EPS accretion that we've seen during 2019, and look forward to JetBlue continue to keep the momentum going forward.\nRobin Hayes: Jamie, it's Robin. I just want to build on Steve's comment because I think you make a very important point. Right now, we are entirely focused on the $2.50 to $3. But as we've laid out, as we've talked about, we have a number of initiatives that will continue to deliver beyond 2020. We talked about our commitment to cost longer term, some of the fleet changes, and we are very excited about the EPS growth story we have beyond 2020 as well. And so we know that's something we're looking forward to showing at the right time. But right now, our focus is on the $2.50 to $3 and that's what we are executing too.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: I wonder if you could give us a little update on the NEO delays. Are they all caught up? Or is the optimism that the deliveries will pick up again in early next year still based on some catch up that they have to do?\nStephen Priest: Hunter, it's Steve here. I'll repeat that one. As we just referred to in our prepared comments, we were due to take 13 aircraft in 2019. We have taken 2 deliveries so far, expect another 4 by the end of the year. So 6 in 2019. We gave a pretty comprehensive update at July call, and nothing has materially changed as a result of that. We continue to work through the delays with Airbus and have discussions with them. It's certainly been a challenge for us, and as a result of that, it's resulted in us making some tactical adjustments, as you know, to restart in 2019 to protect the schedule in operations. And we'll continue to look for any further actions we need to take to mitigate if further delays come forth, but nothing has changed from the July call and the update that we gave then.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And then if you're tracking below the earnings guide or the CASM guide, is that $50 million of nonairline expense the bucket that you're willing to really cut deeply to hit the 2020 numbers given it's almost certainly a near-term P&L drag?\nStephen Priest: Well, actually, Hunter, I wouldn't really sort of start considering that at this point because we are making terrific momentum with regards to our unit costs, and I'm delighted, really delighted with the progress that we're making on our cost structure. I mean, if you look at quarter 3, as we just referred to, we were 20 basis points below the low end of our guidance range. When you look at the adjusted Q4, as a result of the 0.5 point shift in cost timing and the pilot deal that we're cycling over, you're seeing underlying negative CASM as we progressed to the second half of the year. So I'm not even thinking about that at the moment. The team at JetBlue is doing a fantastic job. We continue to execute, and I'm confident in the structured cost program and the associated impacts on CASMx.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs..\nCatherine O'Brien: Could you walk us -- just give us some color on how we should be thinking about the cadence of your cost performance through next year? It'd be helpful if you could maybe remind us when you'll hit the full run rate for your structural cost-cutting program and then how we should think about the benefits on restyling and NEO deliveries?\nStephen Priest: It's Steve here. I just wanted to clarify, did you say the cadence of our cost structure through 2020?\nCatherine O'Brien: Yes, just like how we should think about maybe when you'll hit the full 2020 run rate on the structural cost program and then how we should think about the benefits of the restyling program and NEO deliveries ramping up?\nStephen Priest: Thank you, Catie. I just wanted to make sure I heard you effectively. So again, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made with regard to the structural cost program. As we always alluded to, we give a detailed update in Q2 and Q4 on those earnings calls, but just to give you a sense of the progress we have made since July, we're currently sitting at $279 million as of the end of this quarter. So in the $250 million to $300 million, we're making very significant progress. Airports has been the biggest area this quarter with a nice mix of productivity and sourcing projects that we've taken forward. This continues to ramp. And we continue to be confident in the execution of the structural cost program as we get through to the end of 2019 to make sure we have that pillar in place as we cycle through 2020. And so, as I referred to in my prepared comments, you see the reiteration of the guide that we have 2020 on the CASM side, the minus 2.5 to the minus 0.5 on CASM.  We are leaving quarter four exactly where we need to be leaving it in order to go into 2020 as we go forward. I think the only other point I'd make, you would continue to expect 2 elements actually. One, the restyling will continue to ramp as we progress through 2020. We will -- we do anticipate having 50 of the restyled aircraft completed by the end of 2019. And now we're continuing to ramp through, so you'll see the progress as we go through that. And the second thing, the only choppiness that we generally see is associated with our maintenance costs on a quarter-to-quarter basis as we are on the time and material contracts. So other than that, you should continue to see the momentum as you progress through 2020, and we're very confident in the plan that we've put in place.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. I understood it. Maybe one quick follow-up to that one and I have something else on share repurchases. But -- so Steve, is that -- is the $279 million you just mentioned, is that running through your cost structure right now? Or is that what you've achieved in terms of what we should expect to see run through next year?\nStephen Priest: That's what you should assume runs through the 2020 P&L. We have obviously been taking the benefits of the structural cost program as we've been going through the various years. For example, we saw $30 million in 2017, we saw $60 million in 2018. You should expect just north of $100 million in 2019. And as I mentioned on my answer to Hunter, for us to be producing these levels of sort of CASM -- flattish CASM growth, you can see and certainly appreciate the amounts of structured cost benefits going through the P&L. So the $279 million is the cumulative run rate that one would see through the 2020 P&L.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. And then just quickly on the share repurchase. Can you remind us how much -- I know you had $0.07 plus in your $2.50 to $3 target when you first introduced it, but was the $800 million new program you introduced this quarter, was that at all contemplated in the $2.50 to $3? Or is that incremental?\nStephen Priest: Great question, Catie. I'd say, when we went back at our Investor Day in 2018, I obviously didn't want to get ahead of the Board and we had the existing authorization in place. So the $0.07 -- the rest $0.07 that we talked about at our Investor Day in 2018 only assume the completion of the existing $750 million share purchase program and didn't contemplate any benefits for any subsequent share purchase agreements.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: I guess, Robin, as you stick with the EPS guidance next year, it does look like you'll have to get maybe slightly better revenue performance, and I understand that you have Fare Options 2.0 coming, but I guess, my question will be if we are in the current environment, is that enough or you to need to see improvement in the marketplace to hit those revenue targets?\nRobin Hayes: I'm going to ask Joanna to take that.\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure, thanks. So I think it's worth pointing out that 2/3 of our revenue initiatives for 2020 are yet to come, and we're confident in low-single-digit RASM growth for 2020. Let me just walk you through what's behind that. So we've got 4 initiatives, 3 -- that are $350 million to $400 million worth of revenue. Fare Options launches this quarter that represents about $150 million as we think about the benefit. We're pretty conservative in the assumptions around the upsell and take rate. And as you look at what other carriers have experienced, particularly those that implemented their basic economy later, they've really learned from what has worked and what hasn't worked, and so we are confident that we can ramp up Fare Options much faster than what some of the carriers, who were early to launch basic economy, were able to do. I will also mention that Fare Options provides a platform for additional revenue initiatives beyond Fare Options late into '20 and even beyond into 2021.  We've also got our network reallocation efforts. We have another $50 million coming into 2020 from those, and I'll just point out that every city, every route has to earn its way into the network and not only if we had planned network reallocation efforts, but we also take advantage of opportunities where we see something underperforming and not the ability to, in a meaningful way, turn it around such as our actions in Mexico City this past week to ensure that we're protecting our margins. And then obviously, we have JetBlue Travel Products, which represents $25 million, and the progress there is really -- there is a 1% attach rate that we believe we can really drive upward in the next year or so, and then loyalty is also a significant contributor. So these four revenue initiatives, we believe, will comfortably get us into low-single-digit RASM growth for 2020 and we think that plan even works in a negative RASM environment -- negative industry RASM environment.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Actually that's very thorough. I appreciate that, Joanna. And maybe on JetBlue Travel Products, is that what's driving your other revenue growth right now? It seems pretty significant by the way.\nRobin Hayes: I'm going to just ask Dave to take that.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks for the question. This is Dave. We've got a number of different pieces adding. I wouldn't call JetBlue Travel Products specifically on the other, but we've got a number of things just across the whole ancillary stream. It's really driving good growth in those areas.\nRobin Hayes: Brandon, maybe I'll take that question a little bit more to JetBlue Travel Products because, again, this is a plan that we are sort of preparing to optimize next year. And as Joanna said, the core opportunity there is to -- when you fly JetBlue and you book through jetblue.com, between 1% and 1.5% of customers are attaching an additional product for sell-through the OTAs when you buy JetBlue, that number is significantly higher. So the team has been making a lot of very solid progress into 2019, and I really -- I'm very confident around the $25 million number that we are building for 2020. And the team has also identified some other travel-related products that will be rolling out into the 2020 period as well. So very excited about what we're seeing there.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Steve, it seems like over the past couple of years, there have been more headwinds than tailwinds to your kind of accomplishing the 2020 CASM story. So should we just kind of forget about the favorable end of that range, the down 2.5%, and focus more on maybe the higher end? Or is the kind of the lower end of the range still in play?\nStephen Priest: Joe, it's Steve. Good to speak to you. I think you said it all actually in your initial point, which is we have had a number of headwinds as we went into this whole program in the $2.50 to $3, and we still went forward. But as you've seen, in particular on the cost side of the house, we have overexecuted as we've gone through 2018 and 2019. And we've continued to take those headwinds in our stride. The NEO delays, be it sort of capacity adjustments, be it the continued challenge of ATC delays in the Northeast. So -- and obviously the Latin revenue that Joanna referred to in her prepared comments. So I think what you're seeing from the JetBlue leadership team and the wider JetBlue team is a relentless focus on execution. And I'm personally delighted with what we've been seeing over the last 2 years. The old JetBlue, you'd have heard a number of excuses, and you're not getting that from this team. We're absolutely focused on delivering our plan and executing too. So we will continue to do that despite any headwinds that continue to come forward towards us.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. That's helpful, Steve. And then Robin, just your commentary around tariffs, the assumption that it leads to higher fares for consumers means I think that you would be paying higher prices for those aircraft. So can you just maybe walk us through when all this actually starts to materialize? When you have to make decisions? And what your kind of thinking, a little bit more detail, is around that?\nRobin Hayes: Sure. Thanks, Joe. I'll keep my comments high level because I'm obviously not going to comment on sort of JetBlue specific conversations we're having with Airbus, but overall I think that these tariffs are extremely detrimental to the industry and JetBlue. Other airlines have said similar things. I think the concern is that it's an issue that could continue to escalate. There are other complaints in front of the WTO, which could lead the EU to issue tariffs if that goes in their direction next year. And so we're concerned about just where we are now, but also where it could become -- where it could go. Now in terms of mitigation, and -- we have our 220s on order, which will be assembled here in the U.S. Our concern about the way the tariff has been imposed, it was imposed on airplanes that have already been ordered. I mean, unlike many products, aircraft have a purchase cycle time that are years, in some cases, ahead of when they are taken. We've also been a big supporter of Airbus production in Mobile. In fact, the first airplane came off the production line down there. I was there with other JetBlue leaders. So we're, in a macro sense, concerned about sort of the tariff environment where it could go. In terms of sort of JetBlue specific commentary, I'm not going to get into -- on that with this call. Obviously, we're working that to with Airbus and it's very -- it's too early to say where that leads us at this point. Right now though, we're not making any changes to our 2019 or 2020 aircraft delivery assumptions.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: What is the profile of the international markets that are still working well for you versus those that are not? I noticed you're cutting Mexico City, I think, from all points on the East Coast. And I think the industry commentary about Mexico in particular is actually pretty good. So what are you seeing as a better use for those aircraft?\nJoanna Geraghty: Maybe I'll talk broadly speaking about the Latin region. So as we think about Latin, in Q3, there were obviously some significant capacity pressures into Q3. As we think about moving into Q4, capacity in the broader Latin region decreases to a degree, so we expect improvements there. As we look at some of the more challenged areas that we mentioned in our September report, those headwinds will continue into Q4. That said, we've made adjustments to try to mitigate the impact of some of those unique challenges. As we look at the Caribbean, it is an area where we have the ability to redeploy capacity into different markets. And we've done that in Punta Cana. In the past, we've done it in other areas. Customers will continue to travel through the Caribbean region for vacations, and they will just go to other islands to the extent that there are areas that they would prefer to not travel to. As we think about points of strength in the Caribbean, the leisure Caribbean markets continue to perform well for us and our long-haul VFR markets also continue to perform well for us. The Caribbean overall, we have had a long history operating in this region and it's a region where there are normal puts and takes. This year, we've obviously seen a bit more pressure, but based on our experience, this is temporary in nature and it will move. It's a great fit for our model. We are very committed to the region. And it's an area that produces outstanding margins, and the returns that we see there more than offset the volatility. In terms of Mexico reappointment, Scott, would you like to take that?\nScott Laurence: Sure. So Mexico redeployment is very interesting for us because I think we see a lot of strength in the nonmid-transcon, so you're going to see some daylight transcon flying from that, a mix of some Northeast to Florida and then seasonally additional -- actually Northeast to Caribbean capacity. So that for us is a really positive margin change and we're really excited about that.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then just for my follow-up, JetBlue used to spend a lot of time talking about partnerships and partnership revenue, just noticing some of your recent announcements there. Can you talk about to what extent that's still important? And what are the attributes of partners that are attractive to you? To what extent is credit quality or the fact that a partner will be a going concern in 5 years an important attribute?\nScott Laurence: This is Scott. Thanks for the question. Look, I think, we've got 50 partners that are out there and that works very well for us. It's an incredibly important part of the business and it produces for us. I think what we look for in a partner is the amount of connecting seats they fly into our focus cities, that tends to be a big deciding factor for us. And look, we manage volatility with partners, we've done that in the past and we'll probably have to do that going into the future with a portfolio as large as we have. So again, I think, we look at the potential for connections and revenue production.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes, this actually touches on some of the previous questions, but maybe just a little bit more specific. As I look to, like Cuba, for example, you've one of the largest footprints in Cuba than any U.S. carrier. Then just following the changes that the administration -- the changes, the restrictions that were reimposed earlier this year, did you -- have you guys seen a meaningful fall off in demand and then sort of as a result have you responded with your supply to that market? Just curious.\nScott Laurence: This is Scott again. I will take that one. I think the first piece is we've seen that impact in Havana, not at some of the secondary cities in Cuba. The impact corresponded almost directly to the customers that were flying under that category. And so I think, again, we continue to watch Cuba, we continue to see some of the changes there. And like Joanna noted earlier, each one of our cities and flights has to earn its way into the network. Cuba continues to do that. So we're excited about that. I think the other piece is, right, we have utilized the E190 in Cuba as a competitive tool. It's the right-sized airplane for what we're doing and when we see demand reduced, we are able to use those downgauges effectively to ensure that the economics there work for us.\nMichael Linenberg: Right. Then maybe, Scott -- this may be to you as well. Just the announcement out about this interline agreement that you guys announced with Norwegian, I saw something out there that indicated that you'd also be servicing them at T5. Is that accurate? I wasn't even sure if you had the space to handle the number of flights that they have into Kennedy.\nScott Laurence: This is Scott. I will take that one. We do handle some partners at T5. At this point, we haven't looked at that as part of the discussion with Norwegian. Again, I would just stress here. This is part of the kind of relationships we have with 50 other carriers. It's very similar to that. Some of these relationships are closer than others and they involve things like handling, but we'll see where that goes as we move forward in this discussion.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Just a couple of things on what you're seeing in some of your secondary focused cities, and how you're planning to get through, let's say this winter, as you ramp up capacity in New York, Boston and Fort Lauderdale, Boston and Fort Lauderdale specifically. How are you thinking about recovering from operations affected by weather and air traffic control delays?\nJoanna Geraghty: Helane, I'll take it. JetBlue operates in the most congested airspace than any U.S. carrier. We've got a solid operating plan that will take us through the winter and snow storms and other events. I think if you look at our performance this summer, in the face of 2 significant runway construction projects in both Fort Lauderdale and JFK, and I mentioned the JFK one continues through November, we improved operational performance year-over-year. So I think we've got a great team on the operations side that is dedicated to continuing to deliver a great experience for our customers, even in the face of Mother Nature and the significant air traffic control delays that we experience in the network footprint that we operate.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi from Vertical Research.\nDarryl Genovesi: Steve, can you just update us on where you are in your progress towards getting the transatlantic service going? I guess you have some ETOPS investments to make and some -- probably some customs stuff that you need to do. Can you just give us a sense of sort of what's already taken place and what the potential cost hit from that is in 2020?\nStephen Priest: Darryl, I'll pass it over to Joanna with regards to the transatlantic action. So Joanna, over to you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thanks, Steve. So the work is well underway. We have kicked off our ETOPS certification process with the Federal Aviation Administration, that's about an 18-month to two year process. We're confident we've got an external party that's supporting us with this. It's done it before. And we're confident that we'll move through the process as outlined by the regulations. In terms of our -- the airport that we're going to fly to and spot access, we continue to work those issues in parallel, and we'll be reporting back at a later date as to what airport we have chosen and looking forward to that time.\nStephen Priest: And, Darryl, with regards to your cost question, any cost associated with the launch of the transatlantic service within 2020 CASM, it's included within the guides, just for clarity.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay. And then just quickly on this tariff issue. I guess, following up on, I think, Joe's question, it seems like a lot of the -- lot of the trouble for JetBlue specifically, as far as I can tell, is related specifically to this ACF option. I think that's what's caused some of the delays in Hamburg. And also I think that does in someways kind of preclude you from trying to take more Airbus deliveries out of Mobile, Alabama. How important is that ACF option for you guys overall? Is it something that you would forego if this tariff stuff lingers on?\nRobin Hayes: Darryl, it's Robin. I'll take that. Actually, I was over in Hamburg a few weeks ago with the Airbus team. So I'm pretty familiar with this issue. I mean, just some background. As you know, we ended up delaying the NEOs from what we originally ordered and we sort of bought some CEOs forward and we did that because of the initial engine challenges around the GTF, and we didn't want to have engines on wing until they had gone through more than modifications that have now been underway. That left us in a position really where for simplicity and cost, the right thing for us was to move to the new ACF configuration. At some point, Airbus will move completely to the ACF configuration and it's really -- it's too late and not the right thing to go back to a non-ACF configuration. I'm not even sure Airbus will have the manufacturing capabilities to do it. And what tends to happen, Airbus' approach is to produce some of the initial -- of any kind of new config in Hamburg if it's a 321 or Toulouse if it's 320, and then move that to Mobile a bit later in the process. And so it's not just the configuration that drives Mobile, it's also the production rate. It's still a much lower production rate than, say, Hamburg or Toulouse.  So, again, all of those issues that we're currently working -- I'm actually, to build on the point Steve made, I'm extremely proud of the fact that we face significant challenges with these NEO delays and yet we haven't walked away from our cost guidance. We have found other ways to mitigate the very significant impact that these delays have been bringing. Into 2020, we have built some conservatism into our delivery plan and right now we're comfortable with what we've already guided, which is the 2-point reduction.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley.\nRajeev Lalwani: Steve, question for you. The team talked about CASM longer term beyond 2020 as being flattish. Do you think you could potentially do a bit better than that? Or maybe the other way to ask it is, what are you including in that number? I would think you'd have some pretty nice opportunities given what you're going to do next year based on your guide and then later in the A220s, the gross structural cost continuing to ramp, et cetera. So why can't you do flat to down longer term given what I described?\nStephen Priest: Rajeev, thank you very much for the question. Again, just reiterating your comments, I'm delighted with the progress that we've continued to make in '19 and through the potential for 2020 and the guide that we have and the execution that's going on. I'm not going to get ahead of myself at this point. We've only sort of guided through to 2020. For me, when I think about what makes we are growing flattish CASM, we've always said mid- to high single-digit capacity growth is the right source of growth level for sort of JetBlue. And our ongoing focus on structural cost program through the end of this decade and beyond should facilitate flattish CASM going forward. You're absolutely correct. We're very, very happy to have the A220s on order. And as we've said before, they're going to be the game changer for JetBlue as we migrate through sort of particularly '23, '24 and beyond. But again, I'm not going to go ahead of myself. We've guided through 2020. We are actually focused on execution. The only final point I would make is through the structural cost program, through the initiatives that we're doing, whether they are engine deals, whether they are fleet deals, whether longer-term contractual deals. We have got key eye onto the next decade and it's not just a very short-term focus.\nRajeev Lalwani: And, Joanna, or maybe for you, Scott, a question for you. We've seen a good amount of interest in building out LatAm South Florida from American, Delta, how do you look at that as a risk longer term? Do you see it as a threat? Or do you think you operate in different parts of the network such that there shouldn't be much overlap, even if they are building out South Florida and so on?\nScott Laurence: This is Scott. I'll take that one. Look, I think, we always watch what our competitors are doing and overlap between Miami and Fort Lauderdale. It's certainly something that we watch very closely. In this case, I think, we'll continue to monitor the impacts here with Delta and American as we do with all our competitors. I don't see a big impact for us given the LatAm issues.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: I just have kind of one follow-up on the domestic RASM commentary about it moderating. I'm guessing just, Joanna, based on your comment that it was broad-based that that you're seeing, and I'm curious what you think is driving that. Is it just a fact that we don't have the fuel pressure anymore? Do we have kind of too much supply in the domestic market? Or is there some kind of slowing in demand going on?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, maybe a little more color on that. So as we think about Q3, we outperformed the industry in domestic RASM in Q3. We also pointed out in our reguide about 1 point of domestic softness and that was largely in the back half of Q3. Demand remains steady, but consistent with the rest of the industry, we're seeing RASM deceleration largely associated with capacity ticking higher as we move into Q4. I'll also point out something unique to JetBlue. We're seeing about 0.5 point of RASM pressure tied to the NEOs because of the delays and the closing nature of the delays. We've been put in a position where we're flying a suboptimal schedule, so that obviously also pressures RASM.\nSavanthi Syth: Perfect. And I know, Joanna, you mentioned that that was short term in nature. When do you think that -- is there any clarity as to when that will ease up? Or is it kind of depends on when you get the NEOs?\nJoanna Geraghty: In terms of the NEO question, yes. The NEO, we believe, is short-term nature, obviously, based on the information that we know, managing to the existing delivery schedule, but we do believe that's short-term in nature.\nSavanthi Syth: Meaning just 4Q?\nJoanna Geraghty: Correct.\nDavid Fintzen: Operator, we'll take one last call from the analysts.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Joe Caiado from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJoe Caiado: Just a couple of quick clarification ones. First maybe for Robin or Joanna on Fare Options 2.0. Just how should we think about the rollout and the ramp up in that initiative? Is the plan to roll it out in the domestic market first and then international? And when do you expect to have that fully rolled out system-wide?\nJoanna Geraghty: So we're looking at rolling it out at the back half of quarter 4. It ramps very quickly, largely system-wide, but there will be some markets where we will not offer it.\nJoe Caiado: Okay. Got it. And then Steve, a quick follow-up for you. I'm just curious which bucket of the structural cost program is outperforming your expectations and driving a stronger underlying cost performance? Is it the tech ops bucket? Do you continue to find incremental opportunities there like wondering maybe this new contract that you just announced with AAR, looks like that might be incremental to the program?\nStephen Priest: Joe, thank you for the question. I have to say the 4 buckets that we laid out at the 2016 Investor Day, I've been delighted by the progress of all of them. Obviously, we did a warmup exercise at the time and obviously that was 2.5 years ago, as we've sort of worked through. So there's been some puts and takes, but we've gone through that. I think -- I mean, the one that has probably overachieved, as you probably saw from the July and this call update has been distribution, where we've actually overperformed in terms of the original one. But having said that, all of the other buckets that we've taken forward are progressing very, very nicely, and they have to do for us to be at $279 million as at the end of this quarter. So very happy with all the progress, happy with the progress in [indiscernible]. We're progressing quite nicely with some of those longer-term contracts that will impact beyond 2020, but happy with all buckets overall.\nDavid Fintzen: And that concludes our third quarter 2019 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: And, again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a great day."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 2, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-07-23 15:30:05", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jerome. I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, David Fintzen. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, Jerome. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2019 earnings call. This morning we issued our earnings release, our investor update, and a presentation that we\u2019ll reference during this call. All of those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and have been filed with the SEC. Joining me here in New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Priest, our EVP, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A are Scott Laurence, Head of Revenue and Planning and Dave Clark, VP of Sales & Revenue Management. This morning\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors, and therefore investors should not place undue reliance on these statements. For additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ from forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release, 10-Q, and other reports filed with the SEC. Also during the course of our call, we may discuss several non-GAAP financial [Technical Difficulty]\nRobin Hayes: \u2026hard work JetBlue is consistently recognized as one of the best airlines in the world. Earlier this month JetBlue was named number one domestic airline by Travel and Leisure and last month was the highest ranked U.S. Airlines at the World Airline Awards at the Paris Air Show. Before moving to our presentation, we would also like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank Marty St. George who departed JetBlue last month after 13 years and who had made a lasting contribution to our company. We all wish Marty all the best. We would also like to welcome Teri McClure to our Board who joins us after a distinguished career at UPS. We believe she is a great addition to the Board and we look forward to working together. Now let's start on slide four of our presentation. Our second quarter adjusted pretax income was $238 million or adjusted pretax -- our adjusted pretax margin was 11.3% and our adjusted earnings per share was $0.60. This quarter our financial performance was impacted positively by the calendar placement of Easter and Passover holidays, a strong closing revenue environment, and solid progress in our unit costs. In the second quarter, we continue to move towards our EPS goals in 2020, with steady progress on each of the five building blocks we laid out in our Investor Day last October. Our ancillary initiatives and network reallocation efforts contributed to RASM and we are pleased that we saw an improved revenue environment compared to earlier this year. On the cost side, we reached another important milestone and signed a long-term V2500 engine maintenance agreement for our A320 family. This accomplishment contributes to our now $257 million in 2020 run rate savings from our Structural Cost Program. This quarter we also made progress in positioning JetBlue to thrive beyond 2020 with two important changes to our order book. First, we converted 13 existing A321neo orders to the XLR version scheduled for delivery in 2023 and beyond. The XLR will allow us to expand our relevance in Boston and New York by adding additional destinations in Europe. The XLR adds to our 13 LR aircraft in order which supports our service to Europe starting in 2021. Secondly, we converted 10 A220 options to firm orders. As we previously said, we believe the A220 will be a game-changing aircraft for JetBlue. As we worked toward our 220 goals, we will inevitably face challenges and we will continue to take quick actions on what we can control. In June, leisure bookings in Punta Cana impacted by local events. I\u2019m proud of the team for making quick capacity adjustments to mitigate temporary headwinds RASM. Thanks to the efforts we are sustaining the progress we made from our longer term commercial initiatives, and we are pleased to see RASM accelerating in most of our network into the second half of 2019. On the fleet side, we finally received our first A321neo in June, following a four months delay. Our teams have been adjusting our schedule on working closely with Airbus to uphold our original capacity plans as much as possible. Airbus recently communicated that additional delay for our neo deliveries will impact 2020. We now anticipate that 2020 capacity growth will be lower than we expected by just over 2 points. Despite the neo headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our $2.50 to $3 earnings per share by 2020. Looking to the second half of 2019, we expect solid margin expansion and EPS growth. This is an important inflection point in our margins as revenue, fleet and cost initiative continue to ramp. I'm very pleased that after recently conducting a deep review of our five building blocks by our teams, we are confident with the progress we are making towards our 2020 financial goals. We are working together with the team, and we are laser-focused on creating value for all of our stakeholders, customers, crew members and our owners. Before turning the call over to Joanna, I would like to again thank our amazing crew members for supporting our operation and safety delivering our customers to their destinations during the ongoing summer season. Joanna, over to you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Thank you, Robin. I'll start with our capacity outlook on slide 6. During the second quarter, our capacity grew 5.9%, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range of 4.5% to 6.5%. This was due to a solid completion factor in the quarter despite runway construction in Fort Lauderdale and JFK, and smaller projects elsewhere in our network. For the third quarter of 2019, we expect capacity growth between 3% and 5%, which is unusually low for JetBlue. Our slower capacity growth this quarter reflects tactical cuts we announced earlier this year to mitigate softer RASM trends in trough periods. Our lower capacity also reflects the additional neo delays communicated by Airbus. We plan capacity growth between 5.5% and 6.5% for the full year 2019. We are taking actions to mitigate the delays by adjusting utilization of our existing fleet and the timing of our A320 restyling program. Our delivery stream remains fluid, and we expect to continue adjusting our schedules as needed. Moving to our network, we continue to grow our relevance in our focused cities. We recently announced our intention to fly non-stop between JFK and two international routes, Guadeloupe and San Jos\u00e9 Costa Rica. These new routes adds to our JFK Guayaquil service announced earlier this year as we further build on our VFR and leisure strength. In Boston, we are adjusting our network and expanding our markets. We recently announced plans to relocate our Houston operation from Hobby to Intercontinental Airport in October following feedback from our corporate customers in Boston and New York. This fall, our planned growth in Boston will come mainly in the shape of increased frequencies to business heavy markets such as Washington National and New York. We are also adding capacity in strong leisure markets such as Northeast to Florida. We saw overall strength in our transcon in mid-market during the second quarter. We are pleased with our Northeast to Florida markets and the performance of Fort Lauderdale, even with the challenges we mentioned in the Caribbean region. We continue to see the revenue benefits of our growing relevance in Fort Lauderdale and we look forward to further expanding our network in this growing focus city. As Robin mentioned, leisure bookings to Punta Cana were disrupted recently. We believe the situation is temporary and isolated almost entirely to the leisure market segments. We are making tactical redeployments accordingly to match shifting demand. We have seen stronger bookings to other Caribbean destinations as many customers are rebooking their travel. After a period of significant cancellations, we are encouraged that bookings to Punta Cana are now outpacing cancellations in July and we expect the market will fully recover. Turning to Slide 7 and the revenue outlook. Our second quarter RASM increased 3.1% above the mid-point of our original range of 1% to 4%. RASM trends accelerated over the quarter, recovering from a soft first half of April. Both in booking trends in particular improved and peaks were strong. The impact of lower demand in Punta Cana was a RASM headwind of approximately 0.1 points to the second quarter. As a reminder, the holiday calendar placement was a tailwind of 2.25 points to RASM. Looking into the third quarter we expect RASM growth between positive 0.5% and positive 0.35% year-over-year. Third quarter guidance includes our expectations for continued close in the strength. We expect the benefits of our network reallocation efforts to continue to ramp and we are pleased with the ancillary changes we implemented last year. Our guidance includes an expected headwind largely from Punta Cana of approximately three quarters of a point. I would like to add my thanks to our crew members across JetBlue for a solid operation during the quarter and for living the JetBlue values every day. With that I will turn the call over to Steve. \nSteve Priest: Thank you, Joanna. I will start from slide 9 with some highlights in the second quarter. Revenue was $2.1 billion up 9% year-over-year. Adjusted pre-tax margin was 11.3% up 3.2 points from the second quarter of last year. This is driven by calendar placement, the benefited revenue growth, the generally improved revenue environment and progress in our cost control. We reported a $0.59 GAAP EPS per diluted share. Adjusted EPS was $0.60 per diluted share. Our adjusted effective tax rate this quarter was 24%. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26% for 2019. Moving to slide 10. During the second quarter, CASM ex-Fuel increased 1.8% year-over-year near the lower end of our guidance range of 1.5% to 3.5%. CASM ex-Fuel growth was helped by ongoing structural cost program benefits but also benefited from the timing shift of marketing and other expenses. In the third quarter, we expect CASM ex-Fuel growth to range between 0.5% and 2.5%. The three factors, what we expect will impact our CASM ex-Fuel, growth this quarter include. Firstly, maintenance and marketing expenses shifted into the third quarter from earlier in the year. This is a headwind of approximately 1.5 points to the quarter. Secondly, as Joanna mentioned we expect 4% capacity growth this quarter and an unusually low growth rate for JetBlue. Lower capacity growth is driven by decision earlier in the year, to moderate capacity, to support our RASM and protect that margin as well as by small impact from the NEO delays. Finally, our plan certainly factors in some heightened impact from JFK construction during the third quarter. Taking a step back, when I look at our third quarter costs, in combination with our capacity growth and our performance in the first half we have clearly put JetBlue on a much improved cost trajectory. Moving to slide 11 and some context on our longer term unit cost trends, from a full year perspective we are sitting exactly where we need to be in terms of CASM ex-Fuel and right on-track to have annual guide. First half CASM ex-fuel growth was 1.4%, below the lower end of our guidance range of 1.5% to 3.5%. This was a result of the growing benefits of the Structural Cost Program initiatives. For the first half also benefited from approximately one point of expenses shifting to the second half and particularly into the third quarter. The combination of timing and lower capacity adds, one points of units cost growth in the second half. We now anticipate our CASM ex-Fuel to this period to range between minus 0.5% from positive 1. 5%. We have narrowed our annual CASM ex-fuel guidance to 0.5% to 1.5%, from our prior guide of 0% to 2%. As we look at the remainder of 2019, further NEO delays without some pressure to CASM ex-Fuel. As in past years, our team will continue to identify additional opportunities to offset the impact of any changes to our annual capacity plans in our unit costs. Looking into 2020, we expect some pressure on unit costs due to the lower capacity plans, resulting from the NEO delays. Fortunately, we've enough notice to incorporate a new delivery schedule, into our 2020 planning process. At this point, we expect very limited impact to our EPS guidance. We anticipate to remains within our 2020 guidance, of minus 2.5% to minus 0.5% CASM ex-Fuel growth for the year. Furthermore, we remain confident in achieving our zero to one CASM CAGR through 2020. We will continue to work with Airbus to determine the timing from NEO deliveries, as the delivery schedule evolves. Moving to Slide 12, for an update on over Structural Cost Program, we have made significant progress during the past six months. We are pleased to report that we have now achieved $257 million in run rate savings by 2020, up from the $199 million we called out in January. We recently signed a long-term engine maintenance agreement with our business partner MTU. This agreement carries over half of the V2500 engines, supporting our Airbus CEO fleet. This deal along with other engines initiatives serving smarter parts has been an important contributor to our cost goals of 2020. The team has also made significant progress with a long-term deal that covers of remaining fleet of engines. We're nearing the end of our three-year effort to deliver run rate savings between $250 million and $300 million by 2020. Estimate to our progress in checkups over the past few months, we continue to renegotiate multiyear agreements with business partners in all of our pillars not only addressing near-term challenges, but also mitigating cost growth over the next decade.  We are seeing tangible benefits this technology and an increase in productivity in our frontline operation and support centers. Our Structure Cost Program has become a new way of life to JetBlue and our intention is to keep our cost growth at a flattish rate over the next decade.  Turning to slide 13. We ended the second quarter with 254 aircrafts have received our first A321neo last month, and we expect five more deliveries this year. We originally anticipated 13 NEOs in 2019 and we now expect to maximum of six deliveries. We've included our updated order book in our presentation and investor update reflected the NEO delays and the recent fleet transactions mentioned by Robin. As of today we have reached out 28 A320s. The compensation in the NEO delays and to minimize the impact of our capacity growth, we have adjusted our restarting program, shifting some aircrafts in 2019 into 2020. We expect to accelerate the program next year to remain on track to complete our fleet of A320 aircraft by the end of 2020. We slightly narrowed our CapEx range for 2019 which is now between $1.2 billion and $1.35 billion. Given the recent changes to our expected delivery stream, we have lowered our 2020 CapEx to a range of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion. We continue to expect the minimal impact to CapEx from the conversion to the LR and XLR versions and this is included in our current guidance. Turning to slide 14. Our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry, and we continue to have investment grade metrics with the debt-to-cap ratio of 27%. We expect to maintain a balanced approach to capital allocation, with a focus on making accretive investments in aircraft and opportunistic share repurchases. During the second quarter, we repaid $49 million in debt and executed share repurchase for $125 million. We closed the quarter with $909 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, equating to 11.4% of trailing 12-month revenue. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to highlight that I appreciate the timing shifts in the quarter to mask our progress at some point. I'm thrilled that how the organization is coming together on cost control, and I'm confident that we are on tracking to our full year plans. We have narrowed over 2019 CASM ex-fuel guide and we're exactly where we needed to be into our cost progression towards the annual goal we established back in January. As we move into the second half of 2019, I'm very pleased with how we're executing our plan and I can see our progress towards our 2020 goal of $2.50 to $3 of earnings per share. We are seeing the benefits of our Structural Cost Program through the organization adding to our network reallocation, fleet and commercial building blocks. Thanks to all of our crew members and our support centers and front-line operations for their continued support in executing our plan, and setting JetBlue up to success in 2020 and beyond. We will now take your questions.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, everyone. Jerome, we\u2019re ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. You are now live.\nHunter Keay: Hi. Thank you. Can you give us a little bit more color on the 321neo delays, and any -- sort of what's happening there, and any indication to how quickly Airbus maybe able to catch up that will provide a little positive surprise as you think about 2020? Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Good morning, Hunter. This is Steve here. Thank you for the questions. At this stage, just a macro level, we're very disappointed with the continued delays to our A321neo program as a result of the Airbus production issues, including a further delay that we've received in the last week and half. Just success some more context, in 2019 we were due to receive 13 shelves, and as we said in our prepared remarks in the presentation, we will now receive a maximum of six. In 2020 we are due to receive 15, and now we expect to receive 14. Obviously the capacity is back-end loaded, and we don't have the full year benefits of flow through 2020 from the 2019 shelf. The good news is that we are working exclusively with Airbus to work through these production challenges, and get an understanding from what they are and working together as a team. And I am also pleased to say having got an early heads up in terms of where these deliveries are, but we remain on track with our cost commitments in 2019 as we've taken some tactical opportunities to tweak the restarting program to manage the capacity challenge in 2019. And we've got ahead of the impacts for the capacity around 3 points to 2020 to ensure that we remain intact with our EPS commitments to $2.50 to $3 for 2020. So it\u2019s a disappointing situation for us, but we're ahead of it. We're working with Airbus, and we\u2019ve got a good plan going forward.\nHunter Keay: Okay, Steve thanks. And then another one for you on the new agreement with the MTU, I'm a little surprised as you see go to the incumbent given how strongly you discussed the maintenance headwinds that you guys have seen in the past. Can you give us a little bit of color on how this agreement came to be? And anything you want to share with us in terms of maybe pricing concessions you've got? Or the degree of magnitude of -- really the deal roll-off your baseline expectations? Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Again great question. Just to be very clear they are not our incumbent. We have two other business partners that are currently doing the maintenance for our V2500 engines. Just for the audience on the call to give you some flavor around V2500 fleet, these are the engines that power our Airbus current engine options, which covers the A320s on the A321s. We have about 400 of those engines in the fleet. That fleet is bifurcated between something called pre-select engines and select ones. The pre-selected the older engines to select ones to the newer engines, amnesty the deal that we have secured to our partner MTU that we are delighted with \u2013 and we are delighted with the partnership to cover the older engines, the pre-select engines which is just over half of those 400 engines. Our target as always been to make sure that from a cost per maintenance event is in line with the market. And I'm confident not only through this deal but also with the rest of our engine deals that we will aim to get completed by the end of the year that we're making great progress on is to ensure that the cost per maintenance event for JetBlue is in line with the market. I'm obviously not going to get into any specific details about the commercial arrangements except that we have been very diligent about the process we've gone through. We've taken the required amount of time to make sure we've got the very best deal for JetBlue. And I'm very happy to be partner with MTU again. And we're very pleased with the future partnership as we go forward with the maintenance of those engines. \nHunter Keay: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. You are now live.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, team JetBlue. You cited strength in closing yields is benefiting the second quarter continuing into third. You call that the transcon. Would you associate this simply with further recovery from the first quarter trough? Or are we actually now punching into positive year-on-year territory? I'm just trying to square the current trends with the pressures that we saw last winter? \nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. Hi, Jamie, thanks. So I'd describe it as current positive trending. If you look at what we're seeing tremendous transcon strengths some of the things that we predicted back in March associated with the challenges in the transcon markets those were temporary as we saw in the market. Market has strengthened during the second quarter. In Q2 there were quite a number of low tactical fares and those exited the market during the quarter. So -- we continue to see that strong demand in our Transcon markets into the 3Q. And this region is now a tailwind for us. The other area of strength really is the Northeast Florida strengths both in yield and in load factor also are very strong for us. \nJamie Baker: Great color. And second question probably for Steve or Robin. Back to costs. You know, you\u2019re clearly quite close to achieving the mid-range of the -- $250 million to $300 million target. But despite this your margin gap to peers isn't really showing much momentum if any. I'm not beating you up on this necessarily, but could you articulate what will potentially close the margin gap from here? I mean, I know that 2020 [ph] should help. I know you're bullish on loyalty despite being a smaller operator. The cost performance has been strong, everybody has acknowledge that but if that doesn't resolve in margin gap closure -- again relative basis what will? \nSteve Priest: Hi, Jamie, Steve here. I'll put that one up.\nJamie Baker: Thanks.\nSteve Priest: As I said I'm delighted with the progress we continue to make on the structural cost program and thank you for recognizing that progress across the JetBlue organization. I would point you to our Investor Day presentation back in October of last year and the core five building blocks that we have which will drive us towards this margin contraction with in comparison to the years back. It's not just about the structural cost program but the work that we\u2019ve been doing on the network reallocation is obviously bringing dividends. The fare options process that we are going to be launching as we come into sort of 2020. We're excited about and that\u2019s going to drive forward. We're making significant progress with the fleet dynamics with regards to restyling and the NEOs that will come into the fleet. And I've talked about the costs and obviously we've got capital allocation. The other thing I would like to, point you to is the predominant benefits that we think about with regards to building blocks refer to CASM ex-Fuel and RASM. And there is another area that we believe is not fully recognized in terms of the opportunity and that's around fuel efficiency. That's ultimately going to manifest itself through both the network and the fleet building blocks, as we have the restarting I've mentioned A320 -- A321 growth on a proportionate basis because as a shows come in and obviously the benefits for the NEO. That benefit of the fuel efficiency, should lead to around three points of efficiency in the 2020 plan. And I'll give you some perspective, that each point is close about $0.05 of EPS. So, we've got a great plan ahead of us. We are executing. And the 2020 building blocks will ensure that we drive forward with margin accretions as we go forward.\nJamie Baker: That's great color. Thanks, Steve. I appreciate it.\nSteve Priest: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev you are now live.\nRajeev Lalwani: I had a question on RASM. As you think about next year in heading some of your targets as you mentioned and just now Steve that\u2019s a big part of it hitting the $2.50 to $3, I mean, how do you -- how do you get there. Well a single digit, mid-single digits RASM, if we're going to have an industry environment where capacity growth assuming the max gets normalize, which may be double or triple, where we're seeing today. And if you layer that in with Marty's departure I mean one could be a bit more concerned with being able to hit those top line targets. So just trying to get some comfort there?\nRobin Hayes: Thanks Rajeev. It's Robin and good morning. I'll respond to your question about Marty. And then I'll allow the team to address your comment more specifically. Because I think we have some revenue initiatives as Steve already outlined that you need to ask. But -- welcoming we miss Marty a lot after 13 years, but I think one of the Marty's greatest legacy is we're building a great talent bench on the new team. So, we now have -- obviously we made John as been in the seat of the year. We have leaders like Scott Laurence and Dave Clark who are here and will part of that team. And so, I'm very confident that -- as much as we will miss Marty we're not going to skip a beat in terms of our ability to execute on these commercial initiatives. So, having maximum individuals, I'm going to hand it over to talk about some of the revenue items you raised.\nJoanna Geraghty: So maybe if I could just pick up. I think I would describe JetBlue's revenue framework as one of the momentum. We outlined a series of building blocks at our Investor Day, equating to between $350 million and $400 million of revenue by 2020. And we're really at the front half of those initiatives. They are broken down into several categories network. We've made a number of network changes. The long beach redeployments, we had a series of changes, last fall into earlier this year around optimizing our network. We just announced a series of changes. We expect $100 million to $120 million of run rate benefit associated with those changes by 2020. And those changes largely benefit some of our key points of strength. So, Boston, Fort Lauderdale and then adjusting Long Beach into our point of strength around transcon. We also have a series initiatives around the product offering. So, Fare Options 2.0 that has not happened yet. So, we have that to look forward to. And then if you look at the ancillary changes that we made last year, we're very pleased with the development that we've seen associated with our ancillary changes. This quarter alone, ancillary revenue was up 15% for customer year-over-year. We're now at $33 a customer, an all-time high for JetBlue. If you look at the drivers behind that, bag fees up 15% year-over-year, change fees even more space continue to grow into the double-digits. Loyalty, I know we've spoken about that, but we think there's tremendous upside for loyalties growing at a rate of 24% year-over-year. So, as you look at these revenue building blocks, we're very energized by what the future holds. \nRajeev Lalwani: That's helpful. And then Robin, one for you specifically. And as obviously lots of discussion around the $2.50 to $3 and you are obviously well on your way to meeting that range. What will happen if you don't use start evaluating strategic alternatives? I mean, that certainly something that investors are talking about. I'd love to just get your thoughts on sort of Plan B, even if you may not want to go there?\nRobin Hayes: Yeah. No, we're very focused on the $2.50 to $3. We're making great progress. In fact, we just did a fairly significant review internally where we went to each of these items. We've updated macro assumptions. And when you talk about some of the initiatives that got outline and then Steve talked about the sort of fuel efficiency which we don't think is in most people\u2019s forecast. I mean, we are confident that the time we have in place we will get us to $2.50 to $3. And we're focused on that, and we're not distracted by anything else.\nRajeev Lalwani: Okay. I'll leave there. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. You're now live.\nSavi Syth: Hi. Good morning. Just -- I have a couple of clarifying questions. Just on the restyling. I know you had previously thought you get about 60 done this year, I was wondering what the new plan was? And also just on the 2020 deliveries. The total 14, does that include 14 plus the seven that's pushed out from this deal or just 14 total? And what I'm trying to get out is as you kind of look at 2020 capacity growth, does the two points you make up for the two points? Or that's going to be the two-point pressure mean that you probably be growing at the lower half of that kind of mid to high single-digit range versus upper half previously? \nJoanna Geraghty: Great. I'll the first half on restyling and then I'll flip it over to Steve to give you a little more color on the NEOs. So, the program is on track for completion through the end of 2020. We would expect just about 50 this year. With some of the NEO deals, we've made tax adjustments to our restyling campaign, so that we could save some ASMs associated with restyling to make up for the loss for the NEO delays. We've completed 28 NEOs -- sorry -- 28 restyled aircraft to date. The customer results are fantastic. We're seeing about seven-point increase in net promoter score versus the A320s that have not been restyled. So, we think the program is great. It's well on track to complete by the end of 2020, and we're very excited by the initial results of the first 28. Steve, over to you for the NEO. \nSteve Priest: Hi. Good morning Savi. Yeah. Let me just give you a little bit of clarity. So, originally when we talked about it on Investor Day, we were into the -- we assumed you we would receive 15 A321neos in 2020 and now it's 14. On the face of it you might think well, that's not significant. What's really driving the capacity reduction is the fact that we have assumed 13 shelves in 2019, and that was pretty much back-end loaded and that is a maximum of 6. So when you get to the full year impact of those, it has about a 2-point reduction in our original capacity assumptions for 2020. To sorts of give you a bit of a sense of that, we were -- this is in higher end of our mid to high-single-digit capacity growth assumption for 2020. And with that 2-point reduction, we saw just under the midpoint of that mid to high-single-digit growth. So that gives you a sense in terms of the impact of the shelves and the impacts on our capacity in 2020.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. Thank you, guys. And then just a follow-up on that, so when you think about kind of the \u2013 actually, just a follow-up on the kind of stage length side of things. It looks like for the full year, it increased about 1 point, and then looks like 3Q is on the up one. So it seems like the stage length is increasing. Is that of -- every kind of assuming as -- kind of a higher stage length of the year for next year as well, because it seems like we are exiting the year with a pretty high stage length growth?\nJoanna Geraghty: No. I wouldn't assume a higher stage length growth for next year.\nSavi Syth: Okay. All right, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. You are now live.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for the time. I just have two questions. One with all of the demonstrations that are going on in Puerto Rico, I was just kind of wondering if you could talk about how that\u2019s impacting if at all your business? And the second question I had was with respect to the competitive situation in Boston. I was kind of wondering if you could just address that a little bit? It seems like there's been a big increase in competitive capacity growth, and I'm just kind of wondering how you're handling that? So those are my questions. Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Great. Thanks Helane. As far as San Juan concerned, we're obviously monitoring the situation very closely. As of today, we have not seen any material financial impact and we are very committed to Puerto Rico. It's a great focus City for JetBlue. Shifting to your question on Boston, maybe I'll address it in two parts. First just what we're seeing in terms of the JetBlue experience in Boston, and I'll address the capacity point you raised. We are very profitable in Boston, solid. We are committed to winning in Boston. We've built the network in Boston based on carrying customer where they want to go. We are focused on local customers where we see a very clear first choice preference for JetBlue. We've got the best people, the best products and a point-to-point model that is just perfect for the Boston geography. We are investing in meaningful ways in our Boston franchise. We've started with the strong leisure franchise. We continue maintain this, and have now grown a great business franchise. If you take a look at what we're doing up there, we've got 15 daily departures between Boston and DCA. We've hourly departures across our New York City area airports where we're allocating flights to important business markets that our customers have told us they want to fly to. Transcon is performing very well. We're launching Europe in 2021 to deliver European relevance to our Boston customers. We have a strong loyal base of corporate customers. We're investing with Mass Port. They are great business partner for JetBlue. Bottom line, it\u2019s solidly profitable with great growth potential. And we are all very energized here with regard to Boston performance. With regard to your capacity point, I describe it as puts and takes. Some competitors are adding capacity, others are pulling capacity. You know, while the net capacity does accelerate a bit in Q4 it's still well within the range of what we have historically seen in Boston so we are quite comfortable with it.\nHelane Becker: That's very helpful. Thanks, Joanna.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. You are now live.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thank you. Not sure if Scott is on the line or who wants to comment, but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about changes you're seeing in the booking curve. Further out, it feels like there's good availability of very low fares. Close-in things feel pretty tight. So do you find that you start a month down in RASM and make it up closing? And do you feel like monthly revenue production is more reliant on closing yield strength versus earlier in the year on this time last year? \nDave Clark: Good morning, Duane. Thanks for the question. This is Dave Clark. I'll take this one. We're seeing good strength throughout the booking curve. We're certainly in some periods where intentionally getting ahead a bit farther away where we think we have ability to gain because we had lower load factor and some empty seats. But then looking very clearly to making sure that we have the right pricing and inventory in place for that closing yield strength so really trying to optimize the whole range of the booking curve based on the latest customer behavior we're seeing. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: So you wouldn't say from an industry perspective that we're more reliant on closing yield strength? \nDave Clark: We've seen a little moment in that direction over the past sort of year or two, but nothing too large. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thanks. And then sorry to stumble on the same issue again but why would neo delays cause you to slow the A320 restyle? It seems intuitively it would -- you would want to accelerate it? \nJoanna Geraghty: Yes. I mean at the end of the day we know that the benefit of the ASMs we had for the neos outweighs the number of seats we're adding for the restyling campaign. So by slowing that we're able to get -- 150 seats of A320s flying around. The incremental 12 seats just isn't enough to make up for the loss in ASMs associated with the neo delays. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. So the pacing on the restyle is not changing? Or are you slowing the restyle also? \nJoanna Geraghty: So we've always communicated that the restyling campaign will be done by the end of 2020. We just adjusted the timing within the restyling campaigns that we can ensure that -- we can offset the ASM impact from neos -- from the neo delays. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then just lastly two points lower capacity next year on neo delays -- two points lower than what? \nRobin Hayes: I'll take that, Duane. Good morning. Two points lower than guide that we gave at our Investor Day. So if you recall in October 2018, we laid out a very comprehensive plan through 2020 that include our capacity assumptions, our fleet assumptions, our CASM guidance, targets et cetera. So we're just referring back to what we laid at our Investor Day. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Which was high single-digits? Or what was that -- what would you say that?\nRobin Hayes: It was at the upper end of our mid to high single digits sweet spot. Because -- as we always talk at JetBlue in terms of ensuring that we maintain our continued growth in margins and on our point about relevance in our focus it is. The sweet spot of the growth is mid to high single digits. For 2020 we had -- in the Investor Day in 2018, we talked about being at the upper end of that. And now with these changes to the neo deliveries is more soft towards the midpoint of that range. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. You are now live.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey! Good morning everyone. So maybe a quick modeling one for Steve, could you just maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes, assuming you guys have hit the midpoint of your third quarter CASM ex guidance. Would the swing factor in the fourth quarter that could get us maybe closer to the bottom end or higher end of that 2019 CASM ex guide? Thanks.\nRobin Hayes: No problem. Good morning, Catherine. Maybe I can just give a little bit around the timing. Because as I mentioned in prepared comments, I mean in prepared comments, you've got a sense of a little bit of a movement. The first thing I wanted to say is I'm upset July 2 the progress you've made in addressing out to the cost structure. As we mentioned on previous calls, our CASM progression is also a little choppy on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So, with regards to H1 and I think this is personal because it does impact three and four so just to give you some visibility. And half 1, we printed 1.4% CASM ex growth which was below the low end of our guide. Obviously with the strong traction from the Structural Cost Program, but we had a one point timing benefit. If you take that half one timing benefit it reverses in the second half. Around 2/3 of it impacts Q3. And about 1/3 of it goes into Q4. And at that one point around half of it is maintenance timing. And as a reminder we have honored time of material contract for the V2500 engine, so you've got some timing. About 1/4 of the point is our marketing spend. And the remainder is the mix of the spend items including IT spend. So that explains the half one to half two and the split between Q3 and Q4. I think that sort of then reflects with regards to Q4, we obviously have a situation where we don't have the pilot contract that we've already cycled through. We have a much lower timing impact that we had in Q3. The structural compact -- the Structural Cost Program continues to ramp into Q4 and we have much more normalized JetBlue capacity growth in Q4. So that's why you see the timing shift into H2. It's more impact for Q3 but less impacted in Q4 and we don't have some of those not headwinds that we're experiencing in Q3 for that flowing through to Q4, hopefully Catherine that gets into the essence of the question that you are raising.\nCatherine O'Brien: Yeah. Sure no that's all really helpful. I guess I was also wondering if there is anything in the Structural Cost Program or other things that we're looking at that maybe could go a little better or maybe not. It might just swing you a little bit and where you are at the full year\u2026\nRobin Hayes: So I mean\u2026\nCatherine O'Brien: \u2026anything like that which we are aware of?\nRobin Hayes: So I mean the point I would refer to here is not on our full-year CASM guide. And we've done that intentionally because of the progress that we're committed to make on the Structural Cost Program. We have over 160 initiatives that we have either executed or we're working through. There are 100 kinds of those that we've actually done. We're working on the remaining 50 and that will be undoubtedly more to come. So, great progress is getting made. And so we've made very clear. We've clearly put our guide out there that you can refer to for the rest of the year.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Great thanks. And maybe there is one quick one on Fare Options 2.0 here. So I know you're saying that that should get rolled out a little bit as we've kind go into 2020. Do you have any thoughts on when maybe we'll see the testing programs, on the initial rollout is? Just any updates on timing there that will be great?\nRobin Hayes: Yeah. Sure. So to just reminder, we believe we'll see about $125 million to $175 million RASM benefit steady state, that steady state will occur sort of the end of 2020 into 2021. We're currently tracking to launch Fare Options towards the end of 2019 and we're working on the communication plan as we speak around what -- how we will roll that out and how we'll communicate out the various elements of Fare Options in advance of what actually gets loaded onto our website.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from [indiscernible] with Vertical Research Partners. You are now live.\nUnidentified Conference Call Participant: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Steve, you took 200 basis points out of your 2020 capacity plan, but you still maintained your negative 0.5% to negative 2.5% CASM ex-guide. Would you just comment on given how far out into the future that is? What is the CASM ex impact that you would attribute to the capacity reduction and then assuming that that's a significant number? Where are you running ahead of plan to offset that?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Dal. Good to hear from you. Just to give you some context on macroeconomics, two points of capacity is circa like one point of CASM within the year. So that sort of gives you a lot of pressure. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, whilst we're disappointed in the delays, because it is the line of sights on it and then enable us to get some visibility and gives us time to get our fixed cost structure and start sort of adjusting that. And as I mentioned earlier, we've continued to make various steady and good progress on the Structural Cost Program with 160 initiatives going forward. So, there is always going to be puts and takes in the industry. These are going to be changes to capacity, but we're ruthlessly focused on the execution of our $2.50 to $3 EPS target for 2020 and more money accordingly.\nUnidentified Conference Call Participant: Great. Thanks very much. And then, hey Joanna, can you just provide an update on the loyalty component of your commercial building blocks that you laid out at the Investor Day last year. Just wondering how you see that plan unfolding -- I think like $40 million in there. So, just wondering how you see that number today and what if any are the kind of moving pieces in your forecast there?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yeah. So, there is a number of initiatives around loyalty. We've obviously seen strong performance. It's actually growing faster than ancillaries as a whole. And that's largely due to our co-brand card with Barclays. We're extremely happy with our relationship. I think as I mentioned it's growing 24%. There were a number of tactical initiatives that we're focused on largely around due to math statement credits that will open the booking flow, pre-populating applications in different channels, looking at additional earn and burn opportunities to increase utility at the program. We've also recently announced a new VP of loyalty and there is a tremendous opportunity here we believe to really increase the value of this program in terms of both its utility, but also just overall value to JetBlue. It's a very immature program relative to other carriers. And when you think about upside in our plan, this is where I would view the upside being. \nUnidentified Conference Call Participant: Great. Thanks a lot everybody. Good quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. You are now live.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning, everybody. Robin, just a clarification. I think I have not heard you say about RASM trends are accelerating from those -- network from the second half of 2019. And I look at the guide versus what you giving the second quarter really doesn't seem to be the case. But then you made them referencing RASM on an absolute basis. Did I miss you on that?\nDave Clark: Sure Mike, thanks for the question. This is Dave Clark. If you look at our all in RASM and you clean it up for the holiday placement and then compare the second quarter to the third quarter, we feel good about the acceleration we're seeing sequentially.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, that's helpful. And Dave actually to you or Scott my second question, when I see you call out of a market like JFK Charlotte and I think over the years we've seen \u2013 other sort of you know New York to medium size business type markets, I think Columbus is another that I can think of. The question is, is that a market where you might still be able to generate a profit but because of the flight constraints that Kennedy, its far more -- makes much more sense for JetBlue to target kind of lot of Looper than as a Costa Rica using a bigger airplane, just thoughts on that? What drove that decision?\nScott Laurence: Sure Mike, its Scott. I listen -- I think a couple of things about that. The first is, in something like JFK to Charlotte, you know the routes that we cancel are performing below system average. And that was a good example of one. The other piece was we took that and given limited gate space in Charlotte, we buttress the Boston schedule and added the frequency there. And JFK, we clearly do have slight constraints and we are optimizing those and continue to optimize those in anticipation of operating to Europe soon as well. So look it's not a matter in some cases of huge loss making, it's a matter of optimization.\nScott Laurence: If I can just add, I think one of the things I think you're seeing is that, we are taking action when we see soft spots in the network whether it was some of the changes to Long Beach or network optimization 1.0 or network options and optimization 2.0. The team is being proactive and making network adjustments as needed.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thanks everyone. Thanks Joanna.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You are now live.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning everyone. Steve, I'm sorry if you answer this to Darryl's question. But I just want to come back to the 2020 CASM ex guide of down 50 best to 250. You know with capacity growth coming in a little bit lower and I think you said, you're going to move around the restyling program, but still haven\u2019t completed by the end of the year. I guess what changed on the cost side that you still feel confident in that range?\nSteve Priest: I think Brandon if you look in the rear view mirror and I think a case of trying to give you some sort of faith points in terms of where we are and are particularly focused on Q3 to give you some of sense of where the progress we're making. We're currently growing Q3 at 4% capacity which is below the mid -- of the mid to high single digit capacity growth. We've got 0.1 of pilot contract headwinds in the quarter and we have 1.5 points of timing that's moved from the first half into Q3. And we're printing a midpoint of 1.5 CASM. This is clearly a result of cost efficiencies driven by the stretch of cost program and clearly progress across the holiday JetBlue in terms of how we're driving this forward. So we have a momentum case. As I mentioned earlier to Darryl, there are always going to be puts and takes in industry and Joanna referred to the capacity changes that we make. We have to react in an appropriate way to take this forward. Since we launched the structure cost program at the end of 2016, we have taken capacity down four times proactively, because of what we've seen in the market. So this is not unusual for us. Again we've gain early heads up on this, so it enables us to think about our planning process for 2020. And as I said, we are absolutely focused on delivering our commitments of the $2.50 to $3 of EPS for 2020. And that's how we\u2019re taking this forward.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I appreciate that Steve. And then Joanna if you don't mind, you guys haven't launched Fare Options 2.0, but I'm assuming that it's going to come with more ancillary focused fare at the low end I would guess. My question would be as you face more and more competition with basic economy fares in the market, do you feel that it's actually limited your revenue production this year in any way. Just because you have to compete at those lower fare levels, but can't necessarily recoup at all?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yeah, I mean we're excited about what Fare Options 2.0 is going to bring. I can't speak to whether or not have we had it in place earlier, whether there would be differences in how customers purchase fares. I think at the end of the day, we know it will provide us with an opportunity to better compete at both ends of the spectrum. It gives additional options for customers whether you're extremely price sensitive or whether you're somebody who wants a more inclusive offering. We have markets today where ULCC carriers are in and we think that this will provide options to some customers that might not have necessarily considered JetBlue because on an OTA when the fares are displayed, our fare shows up as higher because it's an all inclusive offering. So whether that contributed to loss of revenue is anybody's guess. I think we're excited about where it's going to take us for the future and I think the good news is unlike most carriers that have already launch basic economy and are seeing the results, we still have all of this ahead of us.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jose Caiado with Credit Suisse. You're now live.\nJose Caiado: Hey, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Robin, big picture question that I'd love to get your thoughts on. As a U.S. operator of Airbus aircraft soon to be an all Airbus operator, what is your position or your view on the potential for the U.S. to impose tariffs on European aircraft, potentially as early as this summer after we get a WTO ruling. I mean what recourse is available to JetBlue in that case, would you have to just take all of your Airbus aircraft from Alabama maybe, or would you just have to pay the tariffs, and therefore higher prices for the aircraft?\nRobin Hayes: Thanks for the question Joe, and actually we did actually testify on this issue against the proposed tariffs. I mean, there clearly needs to be a settlement here between the U.S. and Europe because this will end up in a tit for tat that will be bad for both Airbus, bad for Boeing and bad for all operators. And so we're confident that eventually that will get resolved. Right now I think it's not helpful speculating as to how likely that is. But it will be devastating the whole airline industry whether you are going with Airbus operator if tariffs get imposed.\nJose Caiado: Yeah, it certainly would. Thanks, I appreciate your insight there Robin. Just maybe a quick follow up on the neo delays, and I know that you're transatlantic launch is still a few years away. But right now is there any reason to think that the planned launch in 2021 would be impacted by those delays, maybe get pushed to the right a bit, or do you think you'll all be caught up on deliveries by then.\nRobin Hayes: We don't anticipate any impact to our 2021 European plans with the neo delays.\nJose Caiado: Okay great. Thanks everyone.\nDavid Fintzen: And that concludes our second quarter 2013 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: And again that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for participation."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 1, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-04-23 16:46:25", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Tammy. And I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue's Director of Investor Relations, David Fintzen. Please go ahead.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, Tammy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2019 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, our investor update, and a presentation that we will reference during this call. All of those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and have been filed with the SEC.  Joining me here in New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Marty St. George, our Chief Commercial Officer; Steve Priest, our EVP, Chief Financial Officer; and Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer. This morning's call includes forward-looking statements about future events.  Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors and therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on these statements. For additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ from forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release, 10-Q, and other reports filed with the SEC. Also, during the course of our call, we may discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Robin.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks Dave. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us. I'd like to start with my thanks to our more than 22,000 crew members across our network. We are very proud of our team and the work they do every day to deliver the JetBlue experience. Our customers noticed and recognized the work of our crew members. And as a result, JetBlue was awarded top honors as the best regional business class and passenger comfort in North America by trip adviser. We were also delighted that JetBlue was awarded a top spot amongst America\u2019s best employers by Forbes. Starting on Slide 4 of our presentation. Our first quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $70 million. Our adjusted pre-tax margin was 3.7% and our adjusted earnings per share was $0.16. This quarter, our financial performance was impacted by the calendar placement of Easter and Passover holidays, the increased cost of the pilot contract, and as we disclosed in March a software revenue environment then initially expected. In recent years, we have repeatedly demonstrated our ability to adapt to the changing revenue environment. To date, 2019 is proving to be no different. In early March, we highlighted some specific pressure points in our network, as well as a softening in overall trough demand. To mitigate that headwind, we responded very quickly, lowered our scheduled capacity growth for a third year in a row, to the lowest annual rate since the 2009 recession. We believe we have seen the bottom of the softening RASM environment. Based on current bookings, we are cautiously optimistic about trends improving. In our industry, there are many factors, which we cannot control such as fuel prices and GDP, but there are plenty of areas that we do control at JetBlue, and we\u2019re excited by our progress to continue to position our company to thrive. We believe we will successfully execute our five building blocks later in our investor day and we remain committed to our goal delivering earnings per share between $2.50 and $3 by 2020. We also continue to expect margin expansion in 2019 and to further expand our margins in 2020. We are making steady progress in each of our five building blocks to deliver our 2020 EPS goals. Our network reallocations and our ancillary revenue initiatives are ramping as expected. We are getting to rollout Fare Options 2.0 by the end of 2019. We are very pleased with our progress in our structural cost program, which allowed us to deliver our CASM ex-fuel guidance during 2018 and in the first quarter of this year. Furthermore, today, we remain on track to deliver our annual cost goals once again in 2019, despite lower capacity growth. On our fleet building block, we are pleased with the customer response to our growing fleet of restyled A320s. We are incorporating the latest in-flight entertainment technology in the second phase of this program. We are scheduled to take our first A321neo. In addition to bringing an enhanced customer experience, the neo should deliver fuel savings and also range capabilities. As an example, we recently announced flights from New York to Guayaquil, Ecuador. Beyond executing our five building blocks, we cannot be more excited about our work to position JetBlue for success beyond 2020. Next year, we anticipate the first delivery of our margin accretive A220s. We believe this will be a game changing aircraft to help us further reduce our unit costs, improve our margins and increase our EPS. As announced two-weeks ago, we recently converted 13 A321s in our order book to A321LRs. We expect to begin our European service by adding London from Boston and New York starting in 2021. Other beyond 2020 project include a new digital platform aimed at enhancing functionality and the customer experience, incentivizing self-service, and reducing transactional costs. In our airports, we are testing biometrics at Boston, JFK, DCA and Fort Lauderdale. Currently, approximately 50 international flights per week are boarded using this cutting-edge technology in partnership with CBP and the TSA. We are currently developing the next generation of a new customer relationship management platform. We also invested in our partner gladly to provide our crew members with a platform that aggregates all touch points with our customers under a single view increasing efficiency and service levels as we grow. We have talked about our progress in securing and developing valuable real estate in our network. This includes our plans to redevelop Terminal 6 and 7 at JFK and our work to ensure we have the right infrastructure in Boston, Fort Lauderdale, and Orlando, to support our growth. To that end, tomorrow, we are breaking ground on an expansion of our training facilities in Orlando. This investment, which will include facilities for additional flight simulators will support our growth into our third decade of operations. As you can see, our work today not only helps drive our commitment to delivering our EPS goals by 2020, but also strengthens our position to success into the next decade. Before turning the call over to Marty, I would like to again thank our crew members for delivering differentiated experience helping us improve our operational and financial performance and delivering our goals. Marty?\nMartin George: Thank you, Robin. I\u2019ll start with our capacity outlook on Slide 6. During the first quarter, our flown capacity growth was 10.1%, well above the upper end of our guidance range of 7.5% to 9.5%. This was due to strong completion factor in the quarter. This quarter we had fewer cancellations resulting from a lower number of significant winter storms than we expected in our original guidance from January. From the second quarter 2019, we expect capacity growth between 4.5% and 6.5%. For the full year, we continue to plan capacity growth between 4.5% and 6.5%. This annual growth rate is the updated guidance from early March. When we lowered our annual capacity by half a point to mitigate software RASM trends. As discussed in March, our capacity reduction for 2019 are focused on addressing specific points of softness in our network. These changes included reallocations in the Caribbean to Porto Rico, more broadly we made tactical reductions in underperforming markets to address off peak softness, mainly in the form of day a week adjustment. Regarding other parts of the network, during the first quarter we took another step in our efforts to reach our goal of 200 flights per day in Boston. Beginning this summer, we intend to deepen our schedules to increase relevance offering hourly service to Washington D.C. and the New York Metro area. We believe this move will benefit both leisure and business customers as we expect to fly to more nonstop destinations, operate more flights, and serve more customers than any other airline at Boston. We're delighted that for the eighth consecutive quarter Fort Lauderdale RASM growth outpaced our system average as we expand our domestic and international markets. Our unique model allows us to grow this key focus setting and appeals to both leisure and corporate customer to recognize the value of our differentiated product and service. The success of our Mint Franchise out of Fort Lauderdale is just one more example of our ability to offer a superior product at lower fares. Turning to Slide 7 and the revenue outlook. Our first quarter RASM declined 3.1%. We are disappointed with our RASM performance relative to our original guidance from January, but we are happy to see where we closed the quarter relative to our updated guidance from early March. Considering the puts and takes this quarter, our clean RASM growth was equal to approximately 0.7% year-over-year. Our RASM was impacted by three drivers. This year's holiday calendar placement, completion factor, and certain areas of softness will be observed during the trough periods. Regarding the calendar, this year the Easter Passover replacement was a headwind of 2.25 points to first quarter RASM. We expect the completion factor. This quarter we had a headwind to RASM from fewer cancellations. In contrast, recalled in the first quarter of 2018, RASM was positively impacted by a tailwind from low completion factor that resulted from a very active winter. The combined impact of these two opposite completion factor scenarios and our operation is equal to a net headwind of 1.5 points to first quarter of 2019. Finally, during the first quarter, we saw a few areas of softness at our network that counted for most of our two-point RASM going down in early March. Looking into the second quarter of 2019, we expect RASM growth between positive 1% and positive 4% year-over-year. Our guidance included the 2.25-point positive impact of the holiday calendar shift in the second quarter.  With regard to RASM highlights by market, we expect continued pressure from elevated capacity in our Florida to Latin and Caribbean markets. We expect to see continued demand softness in Haiti following the April peak. However, bookings do appear to be recovering. Conversely, Puerto Rico recovery continues to exceed our expectations.  We are seeing signs of pricing improvement for closing bookings in Transcon. We are pleased with the development and anticipate continued positive momentum in this franchise as we move closer to summer peak season. March RASM showed clear signs of a weaker trough, which extended into the first half of April. The April peak, however, is showing the strength we had expected, and very early looks at May and June point to sequential RASM acceleration.  We will continue to monitor the trough months and close entrance for the second quarter. And we are cautiously optimistic about the RASM outlook for the third quarter. We remain focused on improving our RASM by executing our ancillary plans. In the first we surpassed $33 in ancillary revenues per customer, an increase of 12% per customer, relative to the first quarter of 2019. We are pleased with the early results from our network reallocation efforts and continue to work to rollout Fare Option 2.0 by year-end. I would like to add my own thanks to our crewmembers across JetBlue for their hard work during the winter season, and for delivering outstanding service to our customers. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Marty. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'll start on Slide 9 with some highlights from the first quarter. Revenue was $1.9 billion, up 6.7% year-over-year. Adjusted pre-tax margin was 3.7% down 2.7 points for the first quarter of last year, mainly due to calendar placements that impacted revenues and the increased cost of the pilot contract. We reported a $0.14 GAAP EPS per diluted share. Adjusted EPS was $0.16 per diluted share. Our adjusted effective tax rate this quarter was 28% and we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26% for 2019. Moving to Slide 10, during the first quarter, CASM ex-fuel increased 0.9% year-over-year below the low end of our guidance of 1.5% to 3.5%. This includes a benefit of approximately 0.75 points and improved completion factors during the quarter, and represents a unit cost increase below the mid-point of our guidance range. For the second quarter, we expect CASM ex-fuel growth to range between 1.5% and 3.5%. As a reminder, both our first quarter and second quarter guidance include an approximate 3 percentage point increase from our pilot contract signed last August. This quarter we adopted new lease accounting standards and restated results back to 2017. The appendix section of this presentation includes details of the accounting changes to our income statement and balance sheet. Moving to Slide 11, we could not be prouder of the hard work across Jet blue to deliver on our commitments to hit our goals. We\u2019re encouraged by the CASM ex-fuel progress we made in the first quarter and the progression we anticipate for the rest of the year. In the first half, we will continue to digest our first pilot contract. And despite our capacity reduction from early March, our guidance range remains between 0% and 2%. During the first quarter of 2019, we made good progress in the distribution pillar of the structural cost program, signing an LOI with Sabre to update and upgrade our CSS system. In the second half of 2019, we continue to expect to see the benefits from the Structural Cost Program compounding in addition to the impact of our A320 fleet restyling efforts. In regards to our recent capacity reduction from early March, recall that in 2018, we successfully mitigated added unit cost pressures from three capacity reductions and executed our cost goals according to plan even exceeding our initial expectations. As we move throughout 2019, we expect to find additional opportunities to offset unexpected pressure in unit costs keeping to our guidance for 2019 and 2020. Turning to Slide 12, during the first quarter, we had no aircraft deliveries and hence we continue to have 253 aircraft in our fleet. We expect our first A321neo to be delivered shortly and it will enter into service during the third quarter. For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect a minimum of six neo deliveries. We\u2019re excited about incorporating the neo into our fleet, given the increase in fuel efficiency by at least 15%, compared to our existing fleet of aircraft. As of today, we have restored 19 A320s and we remain on track to complete our fleet by 2020. The same year we anticipate receiving our first A220. We are thrilled about our plan to convert 13 A321neo aircraft from our order book to LRs and start serving our first European destination for our Northeast focus, which is in 2021. The LR delivers wide-body economics on a narrow body platform, and we believe it will be an EPS accretive way to further increase relevance to our customers. We look forward to incorporating these aircraft into our fleet without impacting our CASM ex-fuel guide or our financial commitments. We anticipate the impact to CapEx from the conversion will be minor and is included in our guidance. This recent updated fleet pattern is part of JetBlue\u2019s vision to continue to improve its earnings per share beyond 2020. Our CapEx guide for 2019 remains unchanged between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, as well as our 2020 guidance expected between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. Our CapEx continues to focus on return accretive Aircraft pursuits in addition to our restyling efforts. Turning to Slide 13. We continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets in our industry with investment grade metrics. This allows to maintain a balanced approach to capital allocation. In the first quarter, we repaid $133 million in debt, bringing us to a total of 113 unencumbered aircraft in the fleet. We closed the quarter with $876 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments with 11.3% of trailing 12-month revenue. During the first quarter, we executed share repurchases to $125 million as part of the share buyback program authorized by the board and we have a remaining balance of $250 million and authorization. We will continue to be opportunistic and maintain a balanced approach in our capital allocation including returns to our owners. As a result of changes in the valuation methodology of our aircraft leases associated with the new lease accounting standards, our current adjusted debt-to-cap ratio is now equal to 28%. This is down from 29% at the end of the last quarter calculated under the new standards. Before we turn to the Q&A session, I would like to add my thanks to all of our crewmembers in our frontline operation and support centers for their continued work in executing our plan and helping us create value for all of our stakeholders. We will now take your questions.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks everyone. Tammy, we\u2019re now ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.\nRajeev Lalwani: Hi, good morning guys.\nMartin George: Good morning, Rajeev.\nRajeev Lalwani: Robin, first a question for you, on the entry into the Transatlantic market and if you combine that with your exposure to Lat Am and Caribbean, how do you get comfortable and how do you get the board comfortable that the investment community isn't going to look at you like a legacy carrier and start derating your valuation?\nRobin Hayes: Thanks Rajeev and good morning. I mean, right now about 30% of our capacity is exposed to international markets, about 70% domestic. I would say one of the most successful things we've done at JetBlue over the years is to diversify our network and that certainly has been very helpful when we've seen the growth in Boston. Now when we think about London and the opportunity that presents is really about making our focus it is in New York and Boston, more relevant. It's about adding the next market that we don\u2019t like to and adding them so that we can fly to them and serve our customers.  So, we said much more in terms of developing the maturity of our focus city markets and just flying to different geographies. And so, I think the investment community should feel good that we are taking a very measured approach to growth and that we are focusing on the markets where we can drive the highest returns out of New York and Boston.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thanks. And Steve a question for you on the CASM side, you've obviously done a done a pretty good job so far. Now as we look forward and lap the pilot deal, what's going to be the cadence on unit costs? I'm trying to assess the potential for you sort of be consistently declining as opposed to sort of flat or up a bit?\nSteve Priest: Good morning, Rajeev and thank you very much for the question. I have to say I'm very, very pleased with the progress that we not only made in terms of CASM progression in 2018, but as you can see the progress, we made in quarter one. Admittedly, the completion factor helped, but we printed, even if you include the completion factor, we printed at the low end of the guidance for Q1. As you recall, we did lay out our CASM plan in January and we brought that down by half, and we're very comfortable about reiterating that plan for 2Q.  As we've mentioned, we do cycle over the pilot deal as we get into the second half of this year and we do expect CASM ex-growth to turn negative at the midpoint of the guide as we sort of go forward. And this actually includes the impact of the half point reduction in capacity that we talked about. So, I'm very happy with the progression that we see, you'll continue to see an inflection point in the second half of the year, and this is very, very important to us as we continue to execute on our cost goals as part of the $2.50 to $3.00 EPS target that we have to 2020.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thanks, I\u2019ll leave it there.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Rajeev.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hi, thanks good morning.\nRobin Hayes: Good morning, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just on the full-year capacity it looks like it implies about below 4%, about 3.5% in the second half versus about 8% growth in the first half, any fuel for cadence by quarter? And I guess related just a follow-up to Rajeev, you know the same with sort of down CASM in the back half on that 3.5% growth rate, could you put a final point on cadence by quarter?\nMartin George: Hi Duane, it\u2019s Marty. I'll take the first half of that and I\u2019ll let Steve take the CASM comment. So, yes, we definitely have a capacity plan in 2019 that does decelerate the second half of the year. I don't have a number in the 3s, I have number in the 4s, but notwithstanding that is how we are seeing the year play out, mostly based on delivery schedules. As you know, and as we\u2019ve already announced we had some changes to our original 321neo schedule. So, it\u2019s not what we\u2019d original expected when we were planning out the year, but again, I figure Airbus has reacted well and we look forward to taking the neo very, very soon. Steve on the cost?\nSteve Priest: Good morning, Duane. Again, just to reiterate what I said to Rajeev. I\u2019m very comfortable with the progress we\u2019re making. We've purposely have been very transparent ever since that we went through the outside Investor Day in terms of laying out our cost guidance for 2019 and 2020 and even to a greater detail. So, it's a half by half as we did in 2018 and 2019. Irrespective of the lower capacity environment, which remain committed to the guide that we've got out there. The way I would also think about timing. We won\u2019t at this stage breakout quarter 3 and quarter 4. As we\u2019ve historically talked about, you do sometimes get a little bit of choppiness, particularly in maintenance cost between the respective quarters and that's why we've laid the halves out, but if you sort of thinking about your modeling, you should think about 3Q being pretty similar on a broad perspective to Q4.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And then Robin. I think a portion of the attribution when you took down 1Q RASM guidance was softer macro or the economy. I wondered if you just update us or mark-to-market those views on what your business is telling you about the economy as we sit here today?\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Duane. I think again going back to early March. I think we called out a couple of things. We called out a couple of markets where we were seeing very low walk-up fares. We called out Transcon. We called out South Florida to the Caribbean and as we anticipated some of those fares have now come out, and then we also saw some what we described as broad-based economic softness across everywhere else. And I think what was uncertain to us at that time was with the sort of shop down related or was it something more broader than that. I think I'm very pleased to see that as we look forward. Some of the normality of those walk-up fares is restored and we continue to see very good close-in strength as well. So, I'm cautiously optimistic and we kind of \u2013 hopefully that is behind us and we can be more optimistic about months ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you. And if I could sneak one last one in, can you update us on how many of the A320s are restyled today and what that sort of percentage looks like as we roll through the year? Thanks for taking the questions.\nRobin Hayes: I\u2019m going to hand over to Joanna Duane, because she\u2019s been running that.\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure Robin. Hi Duane. So, we\u2019re up 19 this year. It\u2019s tracking nicely. Just a reminder of that, our restyling is coupled with our heavy check, so that we\u2019re as efficient as we can be. We\u2019ll be completing our full restyling campaign by the end of 2020.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hi, good morning everybody. First question for anyone who wants to take it and the topic is loyalty. You had a slide on the topic at Investor Day, I didn't consider it, you know, real core thrust from that event, but I do think to say \u2013 I do think it's safe to say that at the industry level it\u2019s a growing value driver, it\u2019s something that investors increasingly care about. You\u2019re obviously aware of Delta's progress, United's ambitions and so forth. Now, when I think about the value drivers for the issuing banks, so card member wealth and spend, the breadth of the underlying airline network, the sheer volume of card transactions, this seems like a competitive area where the big three are going to increasingly dominate at the expense of smaller operators like JetBlue, why am I wrong?\nMartin George: Hey, Jamie. It\u2019s Marty. I\u2019ll take that one.\nJamie Baker: Hi, Marty.\nMartin George: So, on the \u2013 and I\u2019ll start by \u2013 you know one of the comments we made in the prepared remarks, which is our in-flight for customer this quarter was up 12% year-over-year, and, you know, the loyalty contribution of that was well above 12%, so we love the trajectory we\u2019re on right now. We\u2019ve talked about the benefits we\u2019ve gotten from going from AmEx to Barclays, and very happy with that partnership. That being the case, you know, the bank keeps going up and, you know, we and Barclays both fully agree that this is something that is a great opportunity for both of us. I actually feel like the details of the contract that we have with Barclays has the two company\u2019s interest aligned very, very closely, and I think it\u2019s a lot of upside there. You know I \u2013 it\u2019s worth remembering that TrueBlue is still a relatively young program, compared to others and I think it\u2019s honestly why we\u2019ve had, you know, that more than doubling of the portfolio since we transitioned. And that being the case, I think the opportunity for us is to continue to increase the value proposition of the TrueBlue point in general, and frankly I\u2019ll point the two events that have done that. You know I\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve got \u2013 we have a partner in Hawaii and he is flying from Boston, Honolulu with a reciprocal royalty arrangement with JetBlue. And then, you know, I have to point out the flying to London, and then whatever else we end up flying in Europe. Two things are significant help in trying to improve the value proposition of JetBlue.  I will also say that \u2013 and I\u2019m not going to call specific airlines, but if you look at the value proposition of every deemed point at JetBlue versus certainly one of our biggest competitors, you know, we give a lot of utility to customers and that\u2019s why customers have flocked to this credit card. But again, I think you are making a key point and that\u2019s one that we talked about internally constantly, which is, you know, we never ever, ever stop raising the bar for more, and I think given the starting point around I think that JetBlue, TrueBlue versus the mature program, I think we actually have more potential than some of our competitors.\nJamie Baker: Excellent. Solid answer, Marty. And second just a small issue related to guidance. You know I\u2019ve attributed the 300-basis point TRASM range to be reflective of one, a more leisure oriented and therefore potentially sickle passenger base, and two, systems that at least historically were perhaps not the most cutting edge. When I think about further corporate penetrations, particularly the one implying, is it fair to ask whether you\u2019ll migrate to that industry standard, 200 basis point range, and if so when? Small name?\nMartin George: You know, honestly, I \u2013 you know, we are less than two years into guiding by the quarter like this. And the one thing I\u2019d say about JetBlue is, although we are a, you know, a relatively established carrier, we still take a lot of bookings very close in, even though, we are very heavily leisure. I mean right now for May, you know, we basically have half of May on the books; and we were weak from the start of the month. June, we have less than a third on the books. The most important thing for us is that the number that we give you is a number that is not going to result in misses or misleading.\nJamie Baker : Sure.\nMartin George: I mean frankly when we get to the point where, you know, if our booking growth changes, because we\u2019re more predictable, I\u2019d love to have a smaller range, but the most important thing is we want to make sure we made our commitments. So, I\u2019ll never say never, but, you know, based on our history at least for the five or six quarters, we have been doing this. I think we\u2019re actually pretty good at it, but I do appreciate that range when we have so little on the books.\nJamie Baker : Marty, thanks for the answers. Take care.\nRobin Hayes: And Jamie, before you sign off, I think you\u2019re going to have very busy day on Thursday with a number of other earnings calls, but I wish you a very happy birthday anyway.\nMartin George: Keeping the JetBlue tradition alive. Thank you, Robin. I appreciate that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien : Hi, good morning everyone. \nRobin Hayes: Good morning, Catherine.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien : Hi. So, with respect to your cost guidance, I want to confirm that any start-up costs related to Transatlantic service, anything for airport costs or ETOPS are baked into that flat to up 1% CAGR? And if so, will this cost always contemplate in the guidance or have you found additional cost savings to fund those?\nSteve Priest: Good morning, Catherine. I\u2019ll pick that up. Yes, I \u2013 those costs are certainly included in our guide, and we will consistently do that. The progression we have continued to make on our structural cost program, the structure of the company means that we are apparently looking at these things. So, you know, there\u2019s ebbs and flows in terms of our cost structures we guide forward. So, some of the incremental costs associated with this are obviously being contemplated and incorporated in the guide. And so, we are very happy with where we stand on that.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien : And maybe one quick follow-up to that one, Steve. Could you just give us the number for the update on where you are in the run rate for the $250 million to $300 million? I believe at year-end you had $199 million?\nSteve Priest: Yes, I\u2019m very happy to do that. Just as a reminder for everybody, the cadence that we have in terms of the detailed update on the structural cost program is Q2 and Q4 where we get into quite a lot of detail. So, the next detailed update will be July. But I\u2019m very pleased to say our run rate for 2020 is currently sitting at $224 million. We continue to make terrific progress, and I think this quarter, I\u2019ll define as being very focused around our sourcing efforts. One of the biggest sourcing contracts that we drove forward during the quarter was with our partner Sabre as we concluded the CSS RFP. So, very happy with the continued progress on the accounting standard $224 million.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien : Congratulations on that. And maybe just one quick one for Marty, so at the midpoint, your guidance implies acceleration from the March quarter, even excluding that impact of Easter. What\u2019s driving that? Is that all the turnaround in the Transcon? Or that, you know, the 50% and one third of bookings you have in April and May? Or you know just that much better than we saw in the March quarter? Any color there will be really helpful.\nMartin George: Hi, Kate. Thanks for the question. You know I think the fundamental issue; it goes back to what we had said earlier about what we saw in the first quarter and going into the second, is that it\u2019s very heavily sort for peak versus trough related. It\u2019s actually \u2013 the environment feels kind of like it did in the first half of 2017 where we had really solid results in peaks, but a little more challenged in the troughs, and I think, you know, part of the acceleration is the fact that the third quarter does have, on a relative basis \u2013 excuse me, second quarter has, on a relative basis, a few more peak days.  And the second thing is, you know, we talked earlier \u2013 actually in late 2018 about the initiatives we were undertaking, you know, whether its fee changes, network changes etcetera, and, you know, those do fold in as the year goes forward. So, you know, I think that from a progression perspective, you know, this is sort of what hope further in the year other than that blip sort of between, you know, end of February until middle of April, but, you know, based on what we\u2019re seeing in the books right now, you know, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about what\u2019s going forward.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien : Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hi, good morning everyone, and thanks for taking my question. \nRobin Hayes: Good morning, Brandon.\nBrandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning. Robin, in your prepared remarks, you know, you talk about the focus on margins and obviously we agree that, you know, to hit your EPS guide for next year you do need to see continued improvement. But you did mention, you know, putting building blocks in place on the ancillary side and I think you guys have really, you know, highlighted that you\u2019ve been giving traction there, so do you just feel like you\u2019re leaving money on the table right now with how you transact with your customers? Or does this go back to that loyalty discussion?\nRobin Hayes : No. Thanks, Brandon. No, I think \u2013 again, we won\u2019t go into all the building blocks now because we talked about them before, but, you know, I think that we continue to feel very confident about the revenue trajectory at JetBlue both from a flown perspective and ancillary, and Marty has already touched on that. You know I think Marty gave an answer earlier, which I wholeheartedly agree with that, our opportunity on loyalty is that we\u2019re coming from a point where we\u2019ve been behind everybody else. And so, we are seeing a lot of strong growth in that area. You know I also \u2013 we\u2019ve created longer term new ancillary revenue streams. You know we\u2019ve created a JetBlue travel product subsidiary, which is now up and running in Fort Lauderdale, and we\u2019re very excited about where that will last to grow longer-term. You know we\u2019ve created a very strong brand in the leisure travel industry, and we need to do more to monetize that. You know Marty talked about Fare Options later in the year as well. So, we\u2019re excited about that. And then, really now the thing that we \u2013 the challenges over the years, and I\u2019m delighted to see how much progress we are starting to make is on the cost side. You know we\u2019ve left margin on the table over the years because we\u2019ve done a nice job on the revenue side, but we\u2019ve also seen high unit cost growth. And so, that is what we are all about and I think putting those things together will allow us to drive those superior margins into 2020 and beyond.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. And I guess along those lines, on the structural cost program, it sounds like you\u2019ve achieved a lot of the run rate that you will set out to initially at least Steve. What are priorities as you look into the back half of the year? Is this really just the, you know, the restyling and the A321 growth that\u2019s going to drive unit economics favorably for you?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Brandon. I have to say the journey continues. We have executed and continued to execute over 160 such initiatives that are impacting our CASM ex at JetBlue, and the journey is not complete yet, and candidly the journey will never be over. We make commitments to our owners that we will have flattish CASM, not only through 2020, but beyond. And so, when we are executing these contracts, we\u2019re looking through two lenses. Number one, how do we make sure that we continue to stretch in short-term and deliver the $2.50 to $3.00 in 2020, but also at the same time, resetting the cost trajectory for JetBlue as we enter the next decade, and I\u2019ll give you some key examples. As there\u2019s no secret as far as my primary focus at JetBlue. In terms of our business priority, the structural cost PRASM is my Number 1 priority from a business standpoint. And one of the largest areas that we have at JetBlue around the structure of the cost is around maintenance. So, we will continue to focus along with some of the initiatives as we progress through the year. But as ever, we will put the finishing touches to the loyalty maintenance agreements as we progress through the \u2013 this \u2013 next quarter and the remaining half of 2019.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate it Steve, thanks.\nSteve Priest: Thanks Brandon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes, hi. I just \u2013 I want to follow up on Cate O'Brien's question. Steve, just on the cost next year, you know, in addition to ETOPS and startup, you know, your inducting the A320s, is the plan to directly expense those costs? Or you \u2013 will you also \u2013 will some or all of them be capitalized? And then, what's the underlying \u2013 can you remind us what the capacity growth is planned for 2020?\nSteve Priest: Good morning, Michael. I\u2019m Steve here.\nMichael Linenberg: Hi.\nSteve Priest: We will take the usual approach, which is when we have costs associated with startup with the license of A320 coming to the fleet or the LR, it primarily will be on expense item that sits in the P&L. Obviously, you know, whether its CapEx involved like the purchase of aircrafts and engines, that will obviously be capitalized, but primarily this will be a source of an expense item. With regards to the capacity that we laid out in 2020, we laid out the guide both from a 2019 and 2020 perspective when we went through the Investor Day, back in August. Note that capacity guide ensures that we get to a CASM level of between minus 0.5% and minus 2.5% from a CASM standpoint. So, on the A220, as I mentioned before, our first aircraft comes in at the back end of 2020, so it\u2019s rather de minimis in terms of the overall capacity guide for 2020.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. Very good, and just the second question to Marty, I know you sort of still call Long Beach out as either a focus city or market that \u2013 where you\u2019re leading, but are we at a point now where your revenue generation at LAX is either equal to or greater than Long Beach as we look into 2019?\nMartin George : Hi, Mike. \nMichael Linenberg : Hi.\nMartin George: Thanks for the question. You know we\u2019ve specifically called out LA Basin as our focal point in the basin and I think because of the benefits we\u2019re getting from our franchise, not just at Long Beach, but also at LAX and even at Burbank where we\u2019ve added some additional Transcon service. So, from that perspective, you know, Mint has been wildly successful at LAX, and I think a public data shows that. I actually haven\u2019t done the math as far as whether LAX total revenue is generating more, but I\u2019d say some nail on head, I\u2019m pretty sure it does. But again, we don't \u2013 we don't even really look at it that way and, you know, frankly its sort of \u2013 it\u2019s a basin level conversation for us.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, very good. Thanks Marty. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey with Citigroup.\nKevin Crissey: Hi, thanks everybody. Thanks for the time. Can you talk about the JFK Terminal project completion and the objectives for that?\nSteve Priest: Good morning, Kevin. Steve here, I'll pick that up. I think the way I would describe the JFK Terminal project is making sure that JetBlue has the right facilities for growth as we go through the next decade. This is a long-term perspective for JetBlue, and if you think about some of the potential challenges for growth in some of the key urban areas across the United States, gates access, terminal access is something that is obviously critical to the ongoing growth and I'm delighted that my predecessor did extremely good job in terms of securing rights around JFK and also delighted that the Governor of New York decided to back the JetBlue proposal for developments of Terminal 6 and Terminal 7 in addition to our award-winning Terminal 5 at JFK. So, we're excited about the prospect. The other key thing that we've made sure that we've done going forward is that we're doing this in partnership. So, we will not be using JetBlue's balance sheet in terms of the funding, et cetera to make this happen. We would be doing this in partnership with JFK Millennium Partners and we couldn't be happier with the team that we are working with. But again, this is not something that you should be thinking about, between now and the end of this decade, it's a long-term perspective and it's something that would ensure that we've got the right access for JetBlue as we migrate to the next decade.\nKevin Crissey: Perfect, thank you. And then, if we could switch over to maybe the \u2013 Robin, you were discussing the \u2013 I know if it's vacations now at this point. Can you talk about where the systems to stand and status on and your progression on the cross-sell of other products? I know, you touched on it, but maybe you could go into a little more as to where we're heading on that?\nRobin Hayes: Sure. Thanks, Kevin and good morning. Yes, we have \u2013 as you know, we've hired a new President of JetBlue Travel Products, Andres Barry, and he now built his team; they are based down in Fort Lauderdale and we \u2013 had went through a number of challenges last year with the website. I'm very pleased to say that those are behind us and we have started to see that business grow very significantly. And in addition, Andres and his team is thinking about new opportunities in the travel space in the sort of very asset light way where we see opportunities to continue to grow on high-margin ancillary revenue. As I said before, only a very \u2013 given that we have leisure network between \u2013 only between \u2013 only 1% to 2% of customers flying on JetBlue are buying some additional travel-related products and so we think that's a very big opportunity for us. The acquisition cost of these customers is very de minimis because they're flying us anyway and the investments that we're making into this business are relatively modest compared to our sort of overall CapEx. So, it's very asset light. So, as we said fairly modest in the next couple of years, but something that will continue to grow and when we think about EPS growth beyond 2020, it will be much more significant part of our ability to sustain that EPS growth.\nKevin Crissey: Thank you very much for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nMatt Roberts: Hi, good morning. This is Matt on for Savi. I was wondering if you could talk about your longer-term capacity growth given the outlook of the lower end of that mid-to-high single-digit range you previously provided. What is the likely mix is both stage and gauge in 2019 and 2020 and should we expect the market focus to be similar in 2020 as it was in 2019?\nMartin George: Hi, Matt, it's Marty. As far as long-term guide and we don't guide more than a quarter at a time other than the annual guide we give without a lot of color on it and mid to high single digits is where we are and where we've been. We're going to move around that range based on our margin goals and I think if you look at what we've done in 2019, you've seen us do that. Notwithstanding what we've seen as far as fuel, we run this place with that sort of, I would call, high fuel cost mentality. I mean, we're not going to \u2013 I used this line before, you don't cheer for balls and strikes in the game and there is a lot of volatility \u2013 and lot of volatility we feel right now that we're trying not to get too hung up on. I think we're very comfortable that the guide that we've laid out that mid-to-high single-digit number, that's what works best for JetBlue, and I've been here for 13 years, I was here we were growing in the 20s. That's very, very challenging for us as far as maintaining the quality and maintaining commitments to our shareholders. So, I think what you're see right now, I think is what we think is best for JetBlue, and I think is best for JetBlue in long-term. With respect to \u2013 I think for stage versus gauge that moves back and forth year-to-year. This year is a little bit heavier on stage, mostly because of the redeployment of Long Beach short hauls into Transcons. But that\u2019s going to move going forward, I would look at that as a long-term predictor. I want to make that clear because it's \u2013 this is not necessarily a long-term trend.\nMatt Roberts: Okay, great. I appreciate the clarification there. And going back again, longer-term growth, could you talk about operational considerations implications of certain operating multiple sub-fleets, particularly starting in 2021, if I am not getting ahead of myself here transitioning from the E190 to the A220, as well as having a second Mint configuration.\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, hi, this is Joanna. So, I mean, we currently have, obviously, the 190 and the 320, there are \u2013 and the 321, there are different performance standards with even those fleets. So, we're confident that we can manage multiple sub-fleets and then obviously working on the plan to exit out of the E190 \u2013 I mean, transition into the A220 over the next year or so. So, we're confident with the transition plans that we have in that.\nMatt Roberts: Alright. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I just want to follow up on Mike's question, you compared the start-up costs with the LR to the 220; I thought you excluded some of the A220 costs from 0% to 1% CAGR, just to be clear and \u2013 expense, Steve, I want to make sure you're going to include that in the CAGR target and what you're talking about the CAGR target. Can you also tell me what's going on with these pilot CBA implementation costs you are excluding to? Thank you.\nSteve Priest: Good morning, Hunter. Good to hear from you. So, let me just be really, really clear about our 0% to 1% guide. We specifically talked about the E190 transition to the A220 as being out side of our 0% to 1% CAGR, when we announced that at the Investor Day in 2016. And so, there were some relatively de minimis transition costs as we went out of the E190 \u2013 projecting stat E190 to 220s, which had a pretty de minimis small impact in the 2020 guide. So that's really, really clear. When it comes to the LR, any operating costs associated with the LR and the transition to those are that might \u2013 may come in June of 2020 are included in the 0% to 1% guide. So, there will be no further impact on the 0% to 1% outside of the previous guidance we gave with regards to the E190 to the 220 transition. So, hopefully that's clear. We've said that consistently ever since the end of 2016 and that message certainly has not changed to any of our investors and we are absolutely committed to the 0% to 1% and I\u2019m very happy with the progress. With regards to your second question, obviously, there was two key items with regards to the pilots negotiation and agreement that we went forward with, a change to sort of one-off transition cost. The first one with regards to the signature of the program and a signing bonus; the second item was the IT costs associated with the transition to go from the direct relationship to the new agreement going forward.  Those are relatively de minimis amount that was just getting mocked up this quarter that was aligned to the final elements of the IT transition. So that's what that relates to, but it's incredibly de minimis and that really sets \u2013 it puts a bar around the one-off costs associated with the transition with regards to the pilots agreement. So hopefully those two items are very clear and I\u2019m pleased to follow up if you don't have clarity on those two items.\nHunter Keay: Yes. No. Steve, that's great, thank you very much. And then maybe this is one for you, Rob, and it looks like you guys added the longer-term EPS target to the proxy as part of your long-term comp payout. I know that the answer to this is both are important, I know that, but is it fair to assume that maybe the EPS target has slightly sort of pulled ahead of the CASM ex target in terms of you're driving priorities, like if you were forced to make a decision to sacrifice one over the other. Is it fair to assume that EPS has maybe sort of pulled ahead a little bit of the CASM ex?\nRobin Hayes: No. I think, I mean, I view our CASM ex performance as integral and central to achieving our EPS goals. I mean, they are one and the same. We \u2013 to accomplish it to $2.50 to $3.00, we laid out five building blocks and there were some revenue initiatives and then also the importance of the Structural Cost program. I think we made two changes to the bonus structure this year. So, for example \u2013 so for our third annual management bonus, we have now moved the last year, the combination of margin and ex-fuel CASM was 50% of that management bonus from this year going forward, it's actually 67%. So, it's two-thirds. The other one that we're measuring is customer satisfaction. So that is \u2013 takes the \u2013 so we have now going forward a third on margin, a third on ex-fuel CASM and a third on customer NPS.  So, again that up weights the importance of both margin and ex-fuel CASM and then part of the LTIP incentive and we were getting this question at the Analyst Day going forward, we've made the change. So, for those leaders like me and others who are part of the LTIP that measured going forward on both ROIC and EPS, so that the compensation of the leadership team is directly aligned to those goals. And then also, we will continue to track that. But I think we had that question and I think we've closed loop on that to make sure the incentive of the leadership team is aligned with those EPS goals.\nHunter Keay: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelaneBecker: Thanks very much, operator. Thanks for the time, team. I just have two questions. One is, can you just talk about what you're seeing in Puerto Rico specifically? Has the market recovered there now? And I know you talked about some weakness in Florida, the Caribbean, but I'm wondering if you could speak about PR specifically. And then the other question I have is with respect to your balance sheet growth, I think, Steve, you said that you were at 28% debt-to-cap at the end of the quarter. So, what's the goal for that and if you're there, any plans to increase the existing share repurchase program? Thank you.\nMartin George: Hi, Helane, it's Marty, I'll take the first question on Puerto Rico. Actually, I'll start talking about the Caribbean overall. We specifically carved out Puerto Rico because the trends there are different than we're seeing in the rest of the Caribbean. And obviously, because of the storms, there's a lot of noise in there. I think even if you look on a year or two basis, Puerto Rico is now larger than it was three years ago and producing solid RASM growth over that time period. We have seen a change in the complexion of the customers. It's a little bit more VFR focused, but frankly, we've had a good holiday \u2013 excuse me, a good vacation season really sort of October, November for the last few really big hotels opened. So, it's been a nice \u2013 it's been a nice mix there and I do want to mention that after the storms, obviously, we had a big impact \u2013 we had several hundred crew members down there. It's been tough in the Island overall. But we are very bullish on Puerto Rico, just like we were before the storms and look forward to future growth there.\nSteve Priest: Hi, Helane, Steve here. I just wanted to give a little bit of color because there is some noise in terms of the adjusted debt-to-cap this quarter as we adopted the lease accounting change. So, just to make sure that we bought as much transparency as possible, we did restate our results back to 2017 under the new accounting rules, and for those of you that want to get into any the detail, as a reminder in, Appendix B of the earnings deck we've laid out all the details for you. So, pertaining specifically to your question Helane, our debt to cap \u2013 our adjusted debt-to-cap is roughly about 5 points lower than it was under the old accounting rules, and that's primarily as a result of our leased aircraft. We have 42 leased aircraft at JetBlue and where they were traditionally done with the old rule of thumb of 7 times the annual lease payments and the change is fundamentally attributed to three specific areas of on the aircraft leases. One is the length of the remaining aircraft leases that we have. Secondly, is the interest rate that one discounts on. And third is probably the most materialize and is when we do the present value calculation. It's done off the cash lease payment rather than expense line on the P&L.  And therefore, where you've had a high to low payment on the lease that that obviously benefits our adjusted debt-to-cap, so that's why \u2013 under the new accounting method it would have gone from 29% at the end of last quarter to 28% to the end of this quarter, I suppose, in terms of what does this mean for us going forward, I'm incredibly comfortable with our balance sheet. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. I'm very, very pleased with our price to capital allocation, and frankly, we are running a balance sheet with investment grade metrics, and we're not going to change our approach to capital allocation, just because of a restatement associated accounting change. So, very happy with where we are. We'll continue to take a balanced approach, and we'll continue to look at where we spend our CapEx and how we proactively return capital to our owners as we did in quarter one.\nHelane Becker: That's very helpful. Thanks very much.\nSteve Priest: No problem. Thanks for you and have a good day.\nDavid Fintzen: And Tammy, we\u2019ll take one more question from the analysts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Just first one here is on the transatlantic flying. Could you kind of walk us through some of the key milestones that you'll be looking to head over the next two years as you work to ramp that service?\nRobin Hayes: Sure. It's Robin. I'll keep it really tight because of the time. So, the aircraft are coming in 2021. We've executed that amendment with Airbus. The item that is on the critical path before that, which is we are very focused on is the ability to fly extended range operations across the Atlantic. In other words, ETOPS certification, so we have a whole team set up around that and we are very confident that we will be able to hit those timelines. We have a lot of people in our company who have had similar experience at other airlines. And really, those are the big lift items; in terms of everything else in terms of the product and schedule and working through with the different London airports that we are considering that is all in hand and easily will be accomplished ahead of that 2021 plan.\nJack Atkins: Okay. That's fantastic. Just one last follow-up on that, if I could, Rob, and I guess as you think about sort of your next round of negotiations from a labor perspective and your ongoing negotiations with your flight attendants, are there any sort of concessions or changes that need to be made in terms of how your labor agreements work with regard to the transatlantic flying? Anything that may be in new contract, if you're flying over to Europe, that sort of, wasn't there before.\nRobin Hayes: I will pass on to you, Joanna.\nJoanna Geraghty: Sure. Thanks. So obviously negotiations are ongoing. They're quite productive. Our first contract for pilots took about four years. We expect in place to be in the similar range three to four years, and the team will continue to work on the various work rules and different provisions under the contract.\nJack Atkins: Okay, that's great. Thank you for the time.\nDavid Fintzen: And that concludes our first quarter 2019 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: And again, that will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 4, "year": 2018, "date": "2019-01-24 16:18:08", "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Felicia. And I would like to welcome everyone to the JetBlue Airways Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I will now like to turn the call over to JetBlue's Director of Investor Relations, David Fintzen. Please go ahead.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, Felicia. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning, we issued our earnings release, our investor update and a presentation that we will reference during this call. All of those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and have been filed with the SEC. Joining me here in New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Marty St. George, EVP, Commercial and Planning; Steve Priest, our EVP, Chief Financial Officer; and Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer. This morning's call includes forward-looking statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors and, therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on these statements. For additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ from the forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release, 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC. Also during the course of our call, we may discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to start with my thanks to our 22,000 crew members across our network for all their hard work through 2018. I'd also like to congratulate our crew members for operating at the airline at a 100% completion from December 10 through January 11th. This is an impressive achievement as we safely delivered our customers to their destinations during one of the busiest times of the year. We also want to acknowledge the hard work of our federal government partners, especially our partners at the TSA, Customs and Border Protection, and our partners at the FAA and air traffic control for their continued support and professionalism during the shutdown. At this point, we've not seen a significant impact to our operations nor our bookings. However, we are increasingly concerned about the shutdown's consequences for convenient and efficient air travel and for the economy overall. We are close to a tipping point as many of these employees are about to miss a second paycheck. Our crew members and customers are likely to face extended security delays -- extended security lines, flight delays and even cancellations. And the longer this goes on, the longer it will take for the air travel infrastructure to rebound. Our nation believes they must find a resolution to this stalemate today. We will be closely monitoring the events and will provide any updates if needed. During 2018, we continued to work on our plan to strengthen the foundation of JetBlue and position the company to thrive. In bringing this very busy year to a close, I could not be proud of our accomplishments. Just to mention some of them. We executed on our cost guidance, taking a strong step towards our 0 to 1% CASM CAGR goal, even as we invested to improve our operations. We completed the negotiation of our first major labor contract. In fleet, we grew both our all-core and our award winning Mint A321 fleets, kicked off our 320 restyling program and announced our plans to replace our E190 fleet with the A220 aircraft. We made significant progress ensuring we have the gates and infrastructure we need to continue to grow relevance in our 3 largest focus cities. We continued investing in our crew members and customer experience, completing 23 self-service lobbies, employing technology to improve customer service and enhancing our digital platform. We invested in our subsidiaries, JetBlue Tech Ventures and JetBlue Travel Products, and positioned travel products for growth with new leadership. Finally at our Investor Day in early October, we announced our comprehensive financial plan comprised of 5 building blocks to create long-term value for our owners. 2018 was a year of significant fuel volatility. We cannot directly control the price of oil or economic growth, but we can focus on executing the plan we laid out at Investor Day. We believe that our network pricing, fleet and cost initiatives will drive higher margins and returns and produce significant EPS growth going forward. We remain confident in our ability to execute on our building blocks, and we believe we will be able to achieve our $2.50 to $3 EPS target for 2020. We expect to take a strong step towards our 2020 financial goals in 2019. We will, of course, be nimble and respond to any short-term pressures should they emerge. Our team remains relentlessly focused on executing our plan, and we are pleased with the progress we've made to date on our building blocks. Over the past 2 quarters, we took actions to recapture higher fuel costs with ancillary revenue initiatives and have implemented our announced network reallocations. We are already seeing the positive impacts of these actions flowing through revenue. We're also seeing the results of our structural cost program and have secured approximately $200 million in 2020 cost savings to the full earnings. We remain on track to hit our 3-year cost commitment and are delighted that we reported better-than-expected unit cost results from the fourth quarter and full year even after 3 reductions in capacity. We recognize that managing cost is perhaps the most important of all the areas we can directly control. We expect 2019 will be a stepping stone year to deliver on our 2020 goals, and to drive further improvements beyond 2020. Fuel prices have gone down since our last earnings call, but we continue to work towards improved margins even if jet fuel prices move back higher. In 2019, we expect to see the full revenue benefit of ancillary and network reallocation efforts. We also plan to continue strengthening our customer value proposition, maturing our loyalty program and ancillary revenue are making the ITF grades required to roll our Fare Option 2.0 later this year. We're mindful of the external environment, but remain focused and committed on executing the initiatives we control, which we believe will create value and drive returns for our owners. Thanks, again, to our crew members for helping us execute our plan and putting JetBlue on the path of drive. Marty, over to you.\nMartin George: Thank you, Robin. Let me start with the capacity outlook on Slide 6. During the fourth quarter, our flown capacity growth was 9.3%, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range of 7.5% to 9.5% due to strong completion in the quarter. We call it in the fourth quarter of 2017, flown capacity was 2.5 points above scheduled growth due to the impact of hurricane in 2017. For the first quarter 2019, we expect capacity growth between 7.5% and 9.5%, and continue to plan for 5% to 7% growth in 2019. Our sweet spot for growth remains in the mid to high single-digit range. And our target in 2019 remains to be on the low half of that range. To be clear, we continue to manage our business out of the assumption of higher fuel prices. We believe that the at a mid to high single-digit growth rate, we can continue to build and strengthen relevance in our focus cities, while still growing our margins. We aim to sustain a solid revenue trends and convert capacity growth to EPS as we improve our CASM ex-fuel performance.  Moving to our network. Early this month, we implemented the second phase of our network reallocation building block as discussed at Investor Day and redeployed underperforming routes. We expect this building block will support our RASM and further improve margins in our focus cities. As a reminder, the January network changes followed redeployments from Long Beach to transcon markets which took effect during the third and fourth quarter of 2018. During the fourth quarter, we also continued upguage routes from our 2 largest focus cities, New York and Boston, with a margin accretive A321 all-core aircraft and our newly restyled A320s. We are delighted that once again and for the 7th consecutive quarter, Fort Lauderdale RASM growth outpaced system average. Our transcon franchise remained strong in both Mint and non-Mint markets, with the best year-over-year improvements in the Mint also coming in Fort Lauderdale. Turning to Slide 7 and the revenue outlooks. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter RASM performance of 2.4%, which was largely driven by strong close-in demand trends across the network. We ended the quarter above the midpoint of our initial guidance range, excluding a 0.3 point impact from higher completion factor. Our RASM showed a sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter. Then in the fourth quarter, it performed very much in line with expectations, with strong peaks especially close-in and continued improvement in trough periods. New York and Fort Lauderdale continue to show RASM strengths, and we were encouraged by sequential improvement in Boston. We were pleased with our RASM performance in the Caribbean, although looking forward we do see capacity growth in parts of the region in respond to strong demand.  Turning to our fourth quarter outlook. We expect RASM growth to be between minus 2% and positive 1% year-over-year. Up your modeling, our first quarter RASM guidance translates to an underlying guide of 0.75% to 3.75%, which added back the impact of calendar shift and weather. This year, the Easter, Passover calendar shift placement shifts roughly 2 points of RASM between the first and second quarters. Also recall that in the first quarter of 2018, RASM was positively impacted by a more active winter that impacted trough weeks. With regards to the government shutdown, to date we have seen very modest impact on demand. At this point, we have not seen material impact in first quarter RASM. We are modeling demand carefully, but our focus remains on strengthening our RASM by executing our ancillary plan. In 2019, we are going to focus around our ancillary initiatives and ensuring we deploy our aircraft to the best and highest uses in the network. We've been pleased with the changes we've made to our ancillary pricing last August and expect to realize the full $50 million in annualized run rate benefits in the first quarter. We continue to expect revenue initiatives will add 1 point to 1.5 points of RASM benefit for calendar 2019. I would like to add my thanks to the crew members across JetBlue for the support and executing our plan, and for their hard work and taking care of our customers. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\nStephen Priest: Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9 with some highlights from the fourth quarter. Revenue was $2 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Adjusted pretax margin was 10.4%, up 0.7 points from the fourth quarter of last year, mainly due to non-fuel cost control and strong revenue performance through the quarter. We reported a $0.55 GAAP EPS. Adjusted EPS was $0.50 per diluted share. This includes onetime costs related to the E190 fleet transition and the recently signed pilot contract as well as an $18 million benefit principally related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law at the end of 2017. Our adjusted effective tax rate this quarter was 24%. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26% for 2019. Moving to Slide 10. Executing on our cost initiatives remains my #1 business priority. Exactly 1-year ago, we laid our 2018 cost guidance, including the second half inflection in our underlying CASM ex-fuel growth. I'm delighted to say, we exceeded our plan and reported underlying CASM ex-fuel growth below the midpoint of our full year guidance. We successfully mitigated, added unit cost pressures from lower capacity, executing our cost-reduction efforts according to plan in both the first and second half of 2018. I'm pleased we ended our fourth quarter below our initial guidance. The team did a phenomenal job managing through a very active 2018 winter, mitigating capacity adjustments to manage ATC risks and higher fuel prices, and continuing to execute our structural cost program. I want to thank all teams within JetBlue for their hard work and finding additional opportunities to mitigate these pressures and deliver their budgets. Moving on to Slide 11. During the fourth quarter, CASM ex-fuel decreased 3.6% year-over-year, below the low end of our guidance of minus 3.5% to minus 1.5%. This includes a small benefit of approximately 30 basis points from improved completion factor during the quarter. Our reported annual CASM ex-growth for 2018 was 1.1%. Looking into the first quarter, we expect CASM ex-fuel growth to range between 1.5% and 3.5%. As a reminder, this guidance includes approximately 3-point impact from our pilot contract signed last August.  Moving to Slide 12. In 2019, we continue to expect our unit cost to range between 0% and 2%. We anticipate CASM ex-fuel growth to be higher in the first half than the second half, largely result of the pilot contract signed on August 1, 2018. In the second half of 2019, we expect to see further benefits from the ramp of the structural cost program and the greater impact of our A320 fleet restyling efforts as we work to end the year with 70 modified A320s. Moving on to Slide 13, and our progress report on our structural cost program. We have now achieved $199 million in run rate savings by 2020, from $173 million we called out in late October. We continue to expect that our 3 efforts will result in run rate savings between $250 million and $300 million. The progress we're seeing as a result of nearly 160 individual initiatives, which are helping us reset our cost base throughout JetBlue. These initiatives encompass renegotiated more cost-effective agreements with our business partners, integrating technology into our processes and increasing productivity of our crew members on our assets. To give some examples on the sourcing side, we recently signed parts and components agreements for our current A321ceo fleet, and future NEO fleets and a long-term contract for heavy maintenance on our E190 airplanes.  Turning to technology. We've decreased customer support costs while improving service levels and making customer communications more efficient. Finally on productivity gains. We completed 23 self-service lobbies, improving our customer experience, while reducing cost and reinforcing scale benefits of up-gauging aircraft. We're also thrilled with the early results of our biometrics efforts, which includes multi-proof-of-concept projects currently within our network.  Turning to Slide 14. We ended 2018 with 253 aircraft in our fleet. We've officially been notified by Airbus of widely known delays in NEO deliveries. We expect a minimum of 6 A321neo deliveries in 2019 shifting as many as 7 aircraft to 2020. There is no impact on our 2019 or 2020 capacity and our CASM guidance given that we anticipated there will be changes to our order book when we gave the guidance accordingly. We recently executed the purchase agreement with Airbus for our 60 A220 aircraft, a transaction we announced in July last year to replace our fleet of E190s. Two A320 delivers also shift from 2020 to 2021, and 2 deliveries from 2020 to 2025. We continue to retain flexibility in our order book. For reference, we have included our anticipated order book in the appendix section of our earnings desk and in our investor update. We have restyled 10 A320 aircraft and anticipate additional an 60 restyled aircraft in 2019, with the balance of the fleet during 2020. We continue to see improved NPS scores and reduced unit costs on the restyled aircraft. This year, we also expect to take our first A321neo, which includes the latest technology in fuel efficiency. Given the recent and anticipated changes in our order book, we are lowering our CapEx guidance for 2019 to range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, and increasing our 2020 guidance to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. Our CapEx is focused on purchasing aircraft engines and our restyling efforts. Turning to Slide 15. This quarter, we repaid $44 million in debt and raised nearly $147 million in secured aircraft debt. We closed the quarter with an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of 33%, and our cash and investments was 11.6% of trailing 12-month revenue. Our strong balance sheet continues to allow us to invest in the business and to opportunistically return excess capital to our owners. We currently have a remaining balance of $375 million under authorization to repurchase shares. Before we turn to Q&A, I would like to thank our crew members for their hard work in helping further create value for our customers and our owners. We are thrilled to see the emerging benefits of resetting our unit cost trajectory to grow our margins and earnings. We will now take your questions.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, everyone. Felicia, we are now ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jamie Baker of JP Morgan.\nJamie Baker: Can you help us better understand the degree to which your assumptions on IROPs influence the ex-fuel CASM outcome? So if I think about the 1.5% to 3.5% ex-fuel CASM guide for the first quarter, is it a foregone conclusion that if we don't see another flake of snow in the Northeast, then capacity will come in at the high end and the 1.5% is achieved. I'm just never really understood the degree, if any, that how much influence the weather really has on that cost range and how we think about that as we live through the weather ourselves as the quarter moves on, any color?\nStephen Priest: Hi, Jamie. Steve here. I'll pick this one up. Jamie, we are very used to inclement weather during the winter in the Northeast based on our focus cities and the network that we fly, and we generally budget for a typical winter in the Northeast. So when you think about a normal winter with a number of seasonal storms, that's what we plan for and that's what we budget for. The only time you would see us guide anything differently and change capacity guidance, if we saw a prolonged challenging winter and then you would see us call out a specific item. But I think what you should think about is, it is a pretty standard winter. We have normal weather patterns that we'd expect. That's all included in our capacity guide and our CASM guide that we put out for quarter 1 of 2019.\nJamie Baker: So that would imply sort of a midrange outcome if we have one of those typical winters more or less?\nStephen Priest: Yes, absolutely correct.\nJamie Baker: Okay, that helps. And second question, On Fare Options 2.0, how should we be thinking about execution risk? I mean, 1.0 went smoothly, but it didn't introduce any lower price points. 2.0 specifically does identify lower price offerings. I realize you may have some of those fares out there and ultra low-cost carrier overlap markets already. I realize basic economy has been accretive for others. I'm just trying to assess how likely it is that 2.0 for JetBlue is similarly accretive. Also does it go live systemwide all at once or does it roll out in phases?\nMartin George: Jamie, it's Marty. Thanks for the question. We've looked at the execution of these different price points by other carriers, and we're very comfortable with our guide that we gave at Investor Day as far as the benefits of Fare Options 2.0. From an execution risk perspective, I'll speak from the economic side, which is, I just love having more price points with the [indiscernible] segment, the customer base. I was very successful in Fare Options 1.0 as far as how we created the bundles that would help customers get the most value. And I'm looking forward for different combination in 2.0.\nJamie Baker: And you will roll out all at once?\nMartin George: Well, again. I think going back to what we had said earlier, it's really a fourth quarter '19 event going forward and it's like most initiatives of JetBlue. We'll test and learn in individual markets, just like we do with pricing today. It's sort of normal course of business for us, just with different bundles.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just on your JetBlue vacations that you've split off. Can you give us an update on where you are in ramping that revenue backup? And what the longer-term opportunity you see with respect to attach rates, et cetera?\nRobin Hayes: Duane, it's Robin. I'll take that. I think as we highlighted previously, we were challenged in 2018 with a cutover that we had in the middle of the year. We definitely had some issues with that, we were transparent. The good news is that we've now cycled against that and we are sort of back as we look at, sort of, Q1, 2019. We are back where we were and can look to build forward. Andres, who is our president of our tech -- travel products has now hired his team, they've taken some space. There is a number of different sort of new businesses that we're working on, and we're very comfortable that we're in a trajectory to hit the numbers that we shared as part of our 2020 EPS goal.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then, sorry, could you update us on where attach rates are today and where you think you can get them to?\nRobin Hayes: So we talked before about sort of our attach rate in very low single-digits. Of course, the 1.5%. I think, we said 1.4% at Investor Day. So you should take 1.5% as rounding, Duane, and not sort of me signaling a incremental improvement already. But I do think that -- now that's an average, and so on certain Caribbean markets the attach rate is higher than that. But that's where we see the opportunity and certainly the focus of the team in the first year or 2 is to increase those attach rate. It's very low hanging fruit. We know the customers. We have the customers. They're buying this product today. We just have to do a better job converting them over to JetBlue product other than the flight. And so that's what the focus is on, we've seen upside to that attach rate.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then just for my follow-up, and I apologize if you said it already. But how many A320s are restyled currently? And how do you see that progressing over the course of the year? So what's that number by the fourth quarter of this year?\nStephen Priest: Duane, it's Steve here. As of the end of the year, we completed 10 restyled aircraft. We now have 11 done. We got 4 lines running. And by the end of 2019, we will have completed an additional 60 aircraft. So you can expect 17 total by the year-end.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Maybe a question just on the complexion of your capacity growth for this year. What's really driving that? Is it gauge, destination, the combination of both? And then maybe some color on how to think about that on domestic versus International would be helpful?\nMartin George: Cate, it's Matty. Thanks for the question. So I think if you look at our 2019 growth and especially in light of some of the fleet plan changes that Steve announced little bit earlier on the call, our growth this year is definitely focused on gauge and to a lesser extent stage. And from a direction geographically, still very much focused on Caribbean, Florida and transcon. I will mention that we took our last Mint configured 321 at the end of last year for a while. This year, the planes we are getting will be the all-core configuration. I think, as Steve had said earlier, both of those plans are our highest margin airplanes and very happy with how Mint has grown. I think we're going to take some of the all-core planes for a while before we switch back to more Mint at some unannounced point in the future.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, got it. And maybe one for Steve. So what are the biggest buckets left on your cost program to get from $199 million run rate you've locked in now to the full $250 million to $300 million? And when should we expect update on these main items?\nStephen Priest: Catherine, thanks very much for the question. I firstly wanted to say, I've been delighted with the progress that we've made. And I just refer back to my prepared comments where we basically had $200 million in terms of run rate for 2020. And there's a 160 initiatives that we've completed all are underway. We continue to execute against those significant items. And if you refer to Page 13 of our deck, you can see a little bit of color on those. I think the 2 -- a couple of the bigger areas that we continue to progress forward with, one is, I suppose, one of the final pillars of technical operations, which are the RFP that we've got out on the V2500 engines that power our 193 Airbus aircraft, and also around components where we will be doing more work as we progress through 2019. The other area continues to be excited about is in distribution. We've told you before on our earnings calls and with investors about the CSS RFP that we've got going forward, so that's well underway. And then from the core pillar, we've invested heavily in our outsourcing -- our strategic sourcing team and the leadership, and they've made tremendous progress over 2017 and 2018, and there's more to come in 2019 as we go through that. So I am confident in the glide path that we have to get to the $250 million to $300 million. There's plenty of initiatives to go, and we're well on track in terms of going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Two questions here. I guess, first to Robin. Robin, as you think about launching transatlantic, and I think 2019 is maybe the decision year for that or at least as it pertains to, I guess, the longer haul version of the Airbus narrow body. As you think about that and you sort of see some of the commentary coming up from some of the other carriers talking about may be some softness that we're seeing in transatlantic and then some of the data points that we're hearing from there as well, as well as the geopolitical issues. Does that give you pause? And I'm also sort of asking this within the context of hitting that $2.50 to $3 EPS target for 2020. You sort of put all that together. Does that give you pause? And if you do consider the Atlantic, it's something that's going to be a 2022, 2023 phenomenon? How do you think about it given just all those moving parts?\nRobin Hayes: Mike, thanks for the question. As I said before, ultimately what will guide us is margin. And when we talked about our transatlantic thoughts, it's very much geared around how we think about Boston and New York, how we build out relevance. And some of these the European markets like London and now some of the largest markets in Boston that we don't serve. And so that is the context. But we really take that decision in the same way we look at any other new route that we may add at any important time. What is the choice that's going to drive the most margin. Obviously, if we do take a decision to fly to Europe, there are number of other issues that we need to work through in terms of airport access and ETOPS certification, those things take time. Now I expect that during the course of the year, we will sort of communicate a decision on most of these, not ready to say anything now. Clearly, we're mindful of sort of economic factors that come. And but these things do tend to be cyclical. And I think if we were to fly transatlantic, the opportunity we have is to offer a very strong premium offering and at a much lower fare than people are paying -- a significant number those customers are paying today. And as we saw on the Mint -- when we launched Mint on the transcon in 2014, that in itself has a stimulation effect on the market. So all of those things that will put into a big part, we're constantly evaluating them. But even if we were to go, it would still remain a relatively small part of our overall ASM and cost structure.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And just my second question to either Robin or maybe even Joanna as it relates to ops. So I think over this past week, we had storms come through in Northeast. And I noticed, I think, JetBlue basically canceled all of its Boston on one of the days and the others did not. I mean, I think most other carriers tried to maintain some semblance of a schedule, but I know it was still bit of a challenge. The fact that your -- for all intents and purposes, the North Eastern centric carrier, do you -- when weather comes through, do you have to take a more conservative approach given that a lot of your traffic, a lot of your assets flow through Boston and New York. And is that what drove Boston, the shutdown that day or was it just somebody moved maybe a little bit more quickly and maybe afterwards they realized they probably were too conservative in dealing with it?\nJoanna Geraghty: Thanks so much for the question. So we plan our cancellation strategy based upon the forecast known at the time. And that's what guides us in those decisions. And based on the forecast for the Boston area, we believe the decision to cancel our Boston plane on Sunday was the correct decision. And I think if you actually look at some of the challenges other carriers faced when trying to operate portions of their schedule, you saw delays that exceeded 8, 9, 10, 11 hours. And from a customer perspective, that's a rather unpleasant experience. So we plan our operation based on the forecast. We plan our operation based upon the resources that we have. Robin and I were actually up in Boston over the weekend and into Monday, so we saw firsthand. And I think if you look Boston, the Boston struggled with the recovery given the weather conditions that continue in terms of some of the icing challenges. So other carriers cancel a lot on Sunday as well. Unfortunately, a lot of those ended up being real time, which is not optimal for anybody.\nRobin Hayes: Michael, just to bit on Joanna's point because we were up there. Monday was actually the biggest challenge, because it was slow to get the field open and back to running. And during the day, we had 7 hours ground delay programs. And so this does become a judgment call as to whether you should cancel in advance, and we protect customers into other flights or whether you want them to come to the airport and experience long delay. So we have a very experienced team looking at that. I think we've been through this more than anybody else because of our geography, and our team overall did a very, very good job balancing all of these factors.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: I guess, Robin, when we look at the outlook here through 2020, there is a lot of positive aspects to the story here on the revenue side, the cost side. But -- and I don't want to focus on the single quarter. But the metrics here, with RASM potentially down, CASM up, maybe a little bit higher than we initially thought. I mean it just feels like the initial step here is in the wrong direction. So how do we reconcile this? And do we think we get a lot of this revenue back in second quarter, and so should just view this more as timing than anything?\nRobin Hayes: Brandon, I want to throw that out to Steve because he hasn't answered a question in a few, and he's thinking to answer it. Steve?\nStephen Priest: Brandon, a couple of things. From the RASM standpoint, let's not forget about the Easter and Passover shift that moves 2 points from quarter 1 to quarter 2. So the Q1 RASM side of the house is purely timing. And Marty, soft of -- you heard Marty's prepared comments earlier about the current environment. I think it's probably worth spending a little bit of time explaining the CASM trajectory for the full year on what's happening in the quarter because candidly, it is a little bit of choppiness. The first thing I do want to say is that I have been very pleased with the impact of structural cost program has had on our underlying cost performance. And when I do look at Q1, it is in line with where we need to be to hit that 2019 plan, which delivers underlying negative CASM and keeps us on the path to our 0 to 1 CAGR commitment that we've laid out. The choppiness is really around the time and materials elements for our Airbus engines and that maintenance CASM does move around from quarter-to-quarter. And so the savings that you see on a quarter-to-quarter basis are not equally shown. I would encourage you to take a look at our 2018 unit maintenance costs on a quarter-by-quarter basis and see how they progressed as a reference point. And that's why we laid out both Q1, H1 and a H2 guide for both 2018 and 2019. As we showed in Slide 10 of the deck, which really clarifies that sort of choppiness. So I would encourage you to look at H1 versus H2 from that standpoint for each quarter. It's exactly the process we laid out in 2018, and it's exactly how we delivered. And you look at 2019, and we're doing exactly the same. So I'm very, very pleased with what we delivered in '18. I'm very pleased with the cost trajectory for '19 and the guide outlines exactly the progression that we're going to make as we go through the year.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate that, Steve. And I guess, maintenance was a big portion of that tech ops savings that you guys highlighted even 2 years ago and recently at the analyst meeting. Do you believe that you have the contracts in place to deliver on those 2020 goals and to get CASM lower?\nStephen Priest: We have, I would say, disproportionately focused over the last 18 months on maintenance, firstly because it's a significant cost for the business. And as we laid out at Investor Day, we have seen significant percentages of CASM increase over a number of years. The journey is not over yet, Brandon. Again, we made significant progress both through the initiatives we've done with the NEO's and the A320s. And when we strategically been looking at those, we have been bearing in mind our existing fleet be it with our CF34 engines on the E190s and our V2500 engines on the Airbus fleet. The good news on the Airbus fleet and actually on the GE fleet as we go forward. We have not only been using some leverage from those bigger deals, but we're more been using a proportion of used materials and some generic parts, which we call them PMA. In addition to looking at both scope optimization with the MRO's who are servicing those engines. So there is more to come. And we are, as I mentioned earlier, in a large RFP for the V2500 engines going forward, which is nicely on track. As I've said before, we're not going to rush it for our quarter-to-quarter CASM savings because we are resetting the cost trajectory for the long-term. But look at 2018 maintenance CASM. Look at what we're laying out for maintenance CASM for 2019. I'm confident in the path, and I'm confident in the team to execute what we need to deliver.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Crissey with Citi Group.\nKevin Crissey: My line cut off, so I apologize. I doubt this one is a repeat. Maybe it's for Marty or Dave Clark, if he is in the room. Talking about revenue management evolution, I see you have hiring for a position with NextGen revenue management tools as part of the, kind of the essential responsibilities as well as something called revenue integrity robotics. Would you be able to talk about kind of the things that you're doing in the revenue management, obviously, without giving away any competitive information?\nMartin George: No. Thanks for the question. Listen, I think from a JetBlue perspective, when it comes to things like pricing and revenue management, we have a different model than most of our competitors. We're primarily a point-to-point airline, carry very little number of [indiscernible] customers. We spent a lot of years working with relatively simplistic models. We started a effort last year -- earlier last year about trying to figure out what the future would be of pricing and again, I think, the one thing I would say is my view of revenue management is, it's all encompassing, its pricing, it's inventory, it's the sizing of what's in our individual customer bundles and we see a lot of opportunities there. I think that because we are not sort of a follower like a lot of our competitors are, and we do our own things, we think there is a great opportunity here. I don't really have any details to announce. I mean, but we are very optimistic about it. I think it's going to be an awful lot of upside. We realize that the world of machine learning and AI is much, much bigger than we would even imagine. We made a lot of progress in that, but we're not going to announce right now.\nKevin Crissey: Okay. I know it's difficult question to answer. Do I remember an RFP for reservation system or something like that or maybe I missed an update on that or maybe I'm just totally wrong.\nStephen Priest: Kevin, it's Steve here. As I -- unfortunately you dropped off. Catherine had asked a similar question about what the opportunities are. So we don't know RFP at the moment and when we have anything to announce we certainly will.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: I just wanted to clarify little bit on the core RASM trends. You are seeing it go from 2.4% to 1.75%, even though you have the kind of network and ancillary contribution. Is that really driven by kind of higher capacity growth because I think last quarter, there was some of the capacity was not real capacity growth, but schedule-to-schedule issues. Just kind of curious about the sequential trend there on the core side?\nMartin George: Savi, it's Marty. I think if you look at the guidance we've laid out and look at our performance across 2018, I think it was actually very consistent with sort of that two handle on our RASM growth. We're basically all cleaned in the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 2.25%, which is more or less where we've been for the entire year other than in blip in the third -- fourth quarter. We're really not seeing material slowing in our view. This is sort of chugging along just like we thought it was.\nSavanthi Syth: That's helpful. And then just on the kind of focus city breakout. I was just kind of curious on the transcon. Mint now is probably kind of fully in there. And I know you called out kind of the trends are strong. Are you seeing kind of unit revenue is that trend accelerating, just similar, consistent or is it decelerating because of the Mint contribution is going to lapping itself?\nMartin George: With respect to our regional performance, the transcon is doing well both in Mint and non-Mint markets. One thing -- the one thing I'll give you about Mint, specifically about Mint premium travel. Our Mint RASM is up 6% and the capacity growth is in the mid-to high-teens. We continue to see amazing demand for this product for any of you who have flown it, I think you've recognized why. You have a combination of the best product in the industry and everyday low pricing and no upgrades. It has absolutely been really great margin builder for us. And frankly, with the service delivery that our crew members provide both on the ground and in the air, we've had no trouble maximizing and using that as an opportunity to get RASM up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Robin, you guys have been pretty vocal in your opposition to U.S. airlines forming JVs with foreign airlines. And I'm kind of curious if that's going to dovetail with your own International plans. Obviously, I know, the difference in a JV and a codeshare, but does the opposition to International JV, sort of, preclude you guys from pursuing that path down the road when you decide to do it?\nRobin Hayes: Hunter, thanks for the question. Actually, just to clarify, we've actually -- my comments are public in a number of talks I've given. What we said is we're not necessarily opposed to JVs, but they need to have better conditions to promote and allow new entrant competition around it. So if you look, for example, our Delta Aeromexico filing, there were 3 remedies that we proposed that landed up being in the final order. The first was to remove the exclusivity provisions because we believe that those act as a barrier to competition. Now we have other airlines come us, who are in JVs, who want to work with us, but they were unable to do so. Secondly, to put a time line around it because these things get approved and they are forever. Other regulatory authorities don't do that and so, again, we proposed a 3 to 5-year time line, 5-years was actually adopted in the Delta Aeromexico joint venture. And the third thing is, when these joint ventures fly into congested airports, that slot needs to be divested to promote competition. And so, again, we are very clearly with our language. It wasn't sort of a no per se. It was a -- if they continue, there needs to be better protection so that new entrants and other airlines can compete against the JVs and have a chance of being successful. Hope that helps in clarifying comments on that.\nHunter Keay: That's good. I appreciate it. And then question for Steve. On Slide 13, I'm kind of curious to know why you dropped in this multiyear contract with an IFE system for new aircraft into the distribution bucket. I mean, it's a mistake, and I don't really see it is related unless there is some angle that I'm missing and something unique you guys are doing, maybe something NDC related. But can you help me understand why that is there?\nStephen Priest: Hunter, great question. We're not being cute at all, Hunter. The key thing for us is that we laid out 4 pillars of the Structural Cost Program back in December 2016. And not all initiatives fits perfectly into each of those pillars. And so you're going to see a couple of outliers in terms of the descriptions. So the last thing we want to do is to stop confusing our investors, and you guys have noticed as analysts. So it is what you would expect it to be. It's an IFE system, RFP that we went out with. We're pleased with the results of it. So nothing to see here. It's just a initiative that happens to be under that specific pillar.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: So if I look at page -- slide 15 on your balance sheet, and as we think about 2019 and the CapEx you have for this year as well as natural, I guess, debt repayment. So two questions. One, are you thinking of financing aircraft deliveries in the market or are you thinking of paying cash? And two, how should we think about the slide, a year from now, after your CapEx decisions and your other priority investments.\nStephen Priest: Helane, the first thing I would say is how pleased and proud I am of the shape of the balance sheet. I mean, when I look at the peer set across the U.S., first to have a balance sheet with the 33% adjusted debt-to-cap and sort of between the 10 to 12 liquidity level, it's certainly a place of strength that I would like to see JetBlue in. To be honest, when we think about aircraft purchases, it's our normal course of business. I'm pleased to say in 2018, we delivered free cash flow as you'll start to see in our results when we close the K. We continue to forecast and expect continued free cash flow generation during 2019 and 2020. We will, as we throw cash of the business, we're thinking about the best deployments of that. So really as ever we continue with the balanced approach to capital allocation. You could continue to expect a blend of cash and sort of debt raises to purchase aircraft going forward. But again, I'm very, very happy and confident with the trajectory of JetBlue's balance sheet. And as things progress going forward, we'll continue to keep the markets updated.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Marty, it seems like we've heard some positive commentary from other airlines about Latin, South America RASM trends. Just given your exposure there, can you comment on kind of what your expectation from that piece of your business are going forward. The exposure you guys have in Puerto Rico, makes it a little bit unique, but just maybe talk about what you're seeing there and what your expectations are?\nMartin George: Sure. I think when we look at Latin overall, I think the only real story for 2019 is, we have seen some capacity come into the region. It's really -- it's sort of spotty in different places. It's non-hurricane markets or not hurricane-impacted markets, some hurricane markets. Certainly the high point of our performance for several years has been Caribbean. We're very optimistic on our position there. It's a bit of a mix bag now. But again, capacity ebs and flows. So I don't think we look at any of this as a market-term trend.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then, Steve, just on the CapEx profile. Can you give us, just based on your current order book, when and what peak CapEx is just given that book?\nStephen Priest: Yes, it's a very, very good question. Obviously, we're moving through that. We're sort of -- I think what you should think about is how the order book progresses as we navigate through the replacement of the E190 fleet in addition to our organic growth. That delivery schedule is laid out in appendix C of our presentation this morning. I think you can start to see in 2023 and 2024, where that peaks as we transition from the E190 to the incredibly accretive from both the margin and revenue standpoint of the A320s. So it will ramp a little bit. And I think you're probably thinking about peak in '23, 2024. The other thing that we've looked at and we've presented in the deck is, and I alluded to in my prepared comments, was the shift in the NEO aircraft that we're seeing in 2019, 2020. And we've given sort of CapEx guide, which is directional with a minimum of 6 aircraft. So as we continue to work with Airbus as we progress through '19, you'll get a sense of that. But it should in some way peak in '23, '24 as we go forward.\nJoseph DeNardi: Steve, is the expectation that the business is going to be -- the business environment and the just performance of JetBlue is going to be -- have to be good enough to generate enough cash to support that CapEx or are you willing to use the balance sheet to finance that order book?\nStephen Priest: As I've mentioned in a previous question that sort of came today, I think it was from Helane about the foundation of the balance sheet for JetBlue is incredibly important. And we're absolutely focused on that. We laid out a very compelling plan through to 2020, and I would encourage you to look at macro associated with that. I was even talking about a fuel environment with 233 jet in it. So we're confident about the path. We'll obviously continue to keep a close eye on the macro environment. The other thing, I would say, we have a significant level of flexibility in our order book. So we'll continue to look at that. And then finally, the key thing that JetBlue is going to drive is margin. And so we will make the right CapEx investments and the right fleet investments to make sure that we're driving both relative and absolute margins going forward. So that plays into the decisions that we'll navigate as we progress through the next few years.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Joe Caiado with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJose Caiado: First question I have is a follow-up on something Kevin was asking about earlier. At Investor Day, you said you're working on new revenue management tools to help with merchandising, but also to enable some of these new product offerings, the Fare Options, basic economy. And you're also investing in a new distribution capability. Marty, I recognize you've got nothing new to announce right now, but should we think about the timing of the launch of basic economy in Q4 as tied to the successful development and implementation of those new tools?\nMartin George: Joe, thanks for the question. I would not tie those things together explicitly. I would say, we're already doing some dynamic work with some of the modeling that we're doing. So there's not going to be a big bang launch of everything. I would call this an evolution rather than revolution, but we're very optimistic about the opportunities we see out there. And again, I think, I'd go back to the opportunity that we have as primarily direct business, primarily leisure business. We don't really necessarily have to follow some of the same orthodoxy that our competitors do. So we think there is a great opportunity for us here.\nJose Caiado: Got it, thanks. And then my second question is a big picture kind of long-term also focused on a potential expansion into the transatlantic. So you've got the A220s coming beginning next year, and that's obviously going to replace the E190 fleet. Your comments around potential transatlantic expansion all focused on the A321LR platform, if you decide to go ahead and pull the trigger, I know you're not ready to announce anything. But I was just wondering, given the recent ETOP certification for the A220 and its ability to fly transatlantic, could you consider deploying that platform into the transatlantic market? Do you consider that kind of fleet flexibility as you evaluate the potential for European service or am I just way off here?\nRobin Hayes: No. Thanks for the question. So, Robin, I'll take that. As we said the primary role of the A220 is to replace the 190. And so that is the focus. Most of our thinking around a potential European expansion from our focus cities of Boston and JFK have really been around the 321LR platform. I think in the -- beyond that there may be lots of different opportunities that emerge, but that's so far into the future that at this time we're spending a lot of active time considering.\nDavid Fintzen: And that concludes our fourth quarter 2018 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: And that concludes our fourth quarter 2018 conference call.

My name is James. I would like to welcome everyone to JetBlue Airways Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would now like to turn the call over to JetBlue's Director of Investors Relations, David Fintzen. Please go ahead.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, James. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning we issued our earnings release, our investor update and a presentation that we'll reference during this call. All of those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and have been filed with the SEC. Joining me here in New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Marty St. George, EVP, Commercial and Planning; Steve Priest, our EVP and CFO; and Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer. This morning's call includes forward-looking statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors, and therefore investors should not place undue reliance on these statements. For additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ from the forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release, 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC. Also during the course of our call, we may discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Good morning everyone, good morning Dave, and thanks for joining us today. This morning we reported our results for the third quarter of 2018. Before we start and then, as usual, I'd like to thank you our 22,000 crew members across our network for their hard work delivering the JetBlue experience every day to our customers. Starting on Slide 4 of our presentation; our third quarter adjusted operating income was one $195 billion, our adjusted pretax margin was 9%, and our adjusted earnings per share was $0.43. This quarter our financial performance was impacted by higher fuel prices which increased approximately 37% year-over-year. At our Investor Day in early October, we showed our plan to help us improve our margins and achieve our 2020 EPS target of between $2.50 and $3 per share. A higher oil environment pressures margins at least temporarily but we have built a plan to improve our earnings by focusing on the areas we can control. Executing that plan we believe we'll expand margins in 2019 and again in 2020. We have been taking actions to recapture higher fuel cost price [ph] both with fare increases over recent months and through ancillary revenue initiatives. During 2019, we expect to see further earnings benefit from our network reallocations, as well as from ancillary revenue initiatives. We are already seeing the benefits of building relevance in our primary focused cities as RASM continues to show strength during the second half of the year. At Investor Day we talked about our expectation to add 1 to 1.5 points of RASM benefit for calendar year 2019 from both our network and product building blocks. As we look to 2019, we plan to balance near fuel term pressure with the RASM benefit that comes from greater relevance in our focused cities. We continue to expect capacity growth of between 5% and 7%. Turning to our fleet and cost building blocks; we are making investments in margin accretive aircraft and finding ways to reduce our controllable cost to support earnings growth. I'm particularly pleased with the progress we are making on the structural cost program in securing over $173 million in 2020 cost savings. We are on-track to hit our 2018 CASM ex-fuel guidance despite pulling capacity in the second half for the year to respond to higher fuel prices. We are taking measurable actions as it relates to our long-term strategy through environmental, social and governments or ESG initiatives. We are lining our efforts to mitigate the impact of changes in the fuel market by flying more efficient aircraft and optimizing our fleet -- fuel consumption. We assigned a renewable jet fuel purchase agreement for a total of 330 million gallons or about 4% of our network consumption. We recently took delivery of an A321 aircraft that was powered with renewable jet fuel blend; this has given us hands-on exposure and experience with infrastructure for renewable jet fuel in the eastern U.S. where we are the leading low cost carrier. We've also announced our plans to retrofit our entire Airbus fleet with vortex generators to reduce noise in the communities where our customers and crew members live and work. We estimate that this will help us address pending local regulation. Before I pass the call over to Marty, I'm pleased with the progress we are making on our building blocks we laid out at Investor Day. Since 2014, we have a track record of executing our plan and through revenue initiatives and improving cost control we have a part to increase our margins. Although it is hard to predict the exact price of oil, I'm optimistic we will see an improvement in our absolute margins in 2019. I feel strongly that achieving this margin expansion in 2019 is essential on our part to achieve the EPS goals we laid out in 2020. We have the culture, the brand and the geography we need to be successful. We believe that realizing the opportunities through our revenue performance and cost initiatives will sustain higher earnings growth and improve our returns for years to come. Marty, over to you.\nMarty St. George: Thank you, Robin. Let me start with our capacity outlook on Slide 6. We continue to grow our capacity on the lower and our mid-to-high single-digit range. During the third quarter, our flown ASMs grew by 8.7%, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range of 7.5% to 9.5%. Our scheduled capacity growth for fourth quarter is approximate 6%. We expect flown capacity growth a 7.5% to 9.5% in the fourth quarter 2018 as we lap the 2.9 points of storm impact in the fourth quarter 2017. Our capacity in the fourth quarter includes a previously announced 2 point ASM growth reduction to mitigate the impact of higher oil, and follows as a 0.5 point reduction we made for the third quarter. Turning to our network; we continue to up-gauge both our New York and Boston markets with our margin accretive A321 all-core aircraft. And Fort Lauderdale, RASM outperformed a system average for the sixth consecutive quarter as it's growing relevant to translating into revenue strength. Our Transcon franchise including both, Mint and non-Mint markets remained strong. We rather performed beating our expectations in the quarter. Moving on the network; in the Caribbean and Latin region, we made tactical adjustments to address RASM trends and we are seeing improvement in the fourth quarter revenue trends. With Mexico, we announced a series of important changes that relate to our network reallocation building block as discussed at our Investor Day. We are reallocating underperforming routes to our three primary focuses and expect revenue benefits of $100 million to $120 million by 2020. We have a list of opportunities to support RASM and managing growth in our primary focused cities. As we recently announced, we will be closing three blue cities; Washington Dulles, St.Croix and Daytona Beach. We're trying to convert a fourth blue city, Portland Maine to seasonal service, and we are reducing frequencies to Mexico City from both, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. These network changes follow our recent redeployments from Long Beach to Trans-Atlantic [ph] markets which mean [indiscernible] and take effect throughout the fourth quarter. We do not take these changes lightly as we know these reallocations impact a number of our crew members. Turning to Slide 7 in the revenue outlook; third quarter RASM grew 1.7% which is above the midpoint of our updated guidance of 1% to 3% on excluding the 0.4 point impact from severe weather during September. We are pleased that our quarter RASM which was in-line with the 2.2% achieved during the first half of the year, despite a 4.0 point of employee headwinds that we called out during our last earnings call. During the quarter we saw close-in demand trends improve across the network; to manage, July and August was strong, we were encouraged to see stronger off-peak demand than we saw in the first half of the year. September started and ended extremely well, although bookings to weather impacted destinations did slow temporarily as storms pass-through. By market, RASM was driven by strength in New York and Fort Lauderdale, as well as in Transcon. We continue to see RASM pressure in Boston-leisure markets and some pressure in Orlando. We're encouraged that Boston-leisure trends continue to improve sequentially. Orlando is a highly price elastic market with strong leisure demand, and it has a history of absorbing initial capacities very well. Our margin in Orlando remained near system average even with high competitor capacity growth. For the fourth quarter, we expect RASM growth between 1% and 4% year-over-year which will represent sequential accelerating of RASM growth in the fourth quarter, even with a 1 point tougher comparison. The temperature trends have carried into October and bookings for Thanksgiving are strong, but we only have about one-third of December booked, trends so far are very encouraging. In the fourth quarter, we also expect to see initial revenue benefits from our network in ancillary revenue changes launched in the third quarter. Our West Coast network reallocation is performing according to expectations; the ancillary changes are ramping and are expected to attribute approximately $8 million in revenue during the fourth quarter. Before I turn it over to Steve, I would like to add my thanks to our crew members for the hard work. We are confident in our plan and in the investments we are making in the network to make JetBlue more relevant to our customers and more profitable for our owners. Steve, over to you?\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Marty. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'll start on Slide 9 with some highlights from the third quarter. Revenue was $2 billion, up 10.5% year-over-year. Adjusted pre-tax margin was 9%, down 7.3 percentage points from the third quarter of last year, mainly due to higher fuel prices. Adjusted EPS was $0.43 per diluted share. Our adjusted effective tax rate this quarter was 26%, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26% for the fourth quarter of 2018. We reported a $0.16 GAAP EPS, including one-time costs related to the E190 fleet transition on the pilot contract. We are successfully managing near-term margin pressure from higher fuel through pricing, capacity and network adjustments we ramped up through the fourth quarter. At our Investor Day earlier this month, we laid out our five building blocks to underpin our long-term plan to improve our margins and returns with a target of $2.50 to $3 in EPS for 2020. Moving to Slide 10; during the third quarter CASM ex-fuel increased 3.2% year-over-year on the lower end of our updated guidance of 3% to 5%. The third quarter unit costs included 2 point headwind from the recently signed pilot contract. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect CASM ex-fuel growth to range between minus 3.5% to minus 1.5% including 3 points of pressure related to pilot deal. We see a positive impact on cost from our investors through investments in the operations. Our on-time performance initiatives and efforts to mitigate ATC challenges in the northeast have improved a 8-14 gap versus our peers, and are helping us to achieve our CASM targets. In our two largest focused cities; New York and Boston, a 8-14 gap versus our peers has increased approximately 5 points compared to 2017. Back in January, we laid out our 2018 cost guidance including a second half inflection point in our underlying CASM ex-fuel growth trend. I'm delighted to say that we are on-track since our plan despite the added pressure from reducing our capacity in the second half. I want to thank the teams within JetBlue that have put so much effort into signing added cost savings needed whilst at lower capacity. We will continue to find opportunities to mitigate these pressures in addition to the savings and the structured cost program that build each quarter. We continue to see sequential improvement in our underlying non-fuel costs and have made great progress during the second half of this year as we execute on our structural cost program. We're confident we can deliver on our 2019 commitments made at Investor Day and are on-track to achieve our zero CASM ex-fuel CAGR through 2020. Turning to Slide 11; we are thrilled that last week we closed our 250 aircraft delivery. We anticipated ending 2018 with 253 aircraft. [Indiscernible] we have included our anticipated order book in the appendix section. We believe our fleet is critical to improving returns. Starting with the A320s, we expect to have 11 restyled aircrafts by the year end and anticipate to see the benefit of at least 60 additional restyled aircraft in 2019. Next year, we expect to take our first A320 need to help us up-gauge our primary focused cities. These aircraft have the latest technology and fuel efficiency on our new core product. The majority our CapEx is used to grow our fleet and enable our mid-to-high single-digit growth to build relevance to our focused cities. CapEx also helps us invest in our engines, transition as E190 fleets, and executes on our A320 restyling. Our CapEx guidance for 2018 ranges between $1 billion and $1.2 billion, comprised of upto $895 million to $1.1 billion in aircraft and the remainder for non-aircraft spend. Turning to Slide 12; the strength of our balance sheet allows us to invest in the business and return excess capital to our owners. We've executed $375 million worth of share repurchases from the $750 million authorization. This quarter we paid $54 million in debt and raised nearly $261 million in secured aircraft debt. We closed the quarter with an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of 32.7% and our cash on investments for 12.6% of trailing 12 months revenue. Lastly, we plan to continue our policy of opportunistic hedging to help protect our margins given the current oil price environment. This quarter we executed hedges for 7.7% of our expected fuel consumption for the rest of 2018 and 7.5% for the first half of 2019, in-line with prior hedging positions. We're excited about the opportunities in front of us to improve both margins and returns. As we build relevance in our focused cities, it is critical that we execute in our plan to improve cost control so to better convert growth and RASM strength into margins and EPS. I would like to thank all of our crew members for helping us carry our momentum into the next couple of years with our five building blocks, and for working every day to create value for all of our stakeholders. We will now take your questions.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, everyone. James, we're ready now for the Question-and-Answer Session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Robin, I'm not sure if you're prepared to discuss this but I'd be curious to know kind of what the early discussions have been like with the board with the new addition to Ben and Sara [ph]. The questions really are, are they still sort of an information gathering mode or they kind of coming in already sort of challenging some of the existing status quo?\nRobin Hayes: No, I would say they were both were engaged in the first board meetings. Lots of questions -- I mean, I think you know Ben as well as I do, he is not a shrinking violet [ph]. And, you know, it's great to have them on the board. I mean, I think we have a strong board, we have a board that is very focused on delivering this plan; and I think having Ben and Sara join our board makes it even stronger.\nHunter Keay: Steve, a little bit more of a follow-up from the Analyst Day; when you talked about renegotiating some of these maintenance agreements, you mentioned OEMs but do these negotiations also involve some of your aftermarket providers? I'm kind of curious to know who exactly are you negotiating with and what are you looking to get other than just cost savings? Thanks.\nSteve Priest: Yes, just to give full transparency; as I've mentioned, when we look across our fleet we have some newer aircraft to newer engines coming into the fleet, and obviously we've got existing E190s and existing fleet of basically of around 190 aircraft. When it comes to looking at both, the airframe and the engine maintenance as we go forward, we have been engaging both, in the market -- we've been engaging both the OEMs and the MRS. In terms of what we are looking at, it's a balanced approach, it's not just about cost but it's about absolute quality because if these assets that we go forward with have a life of around 25 years, we have to make sure that the engineering remains in some of the airframes in the engines, a top notch, make sure that we get the right turnaround times with such partners because obviously the more the aircraft are flying, the more they are driving returns and margins for JetBlue. And so, they are the heart of a lot of what we're doing and some of interiors we showed at the Investor Day, we have seen significant CASM ex-inflation pertaining some mountains past since 2010 and so that is a critical and core part of the discussions and the negotiations that we're having.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Just -- I guess to Marty, with respect to the network realignment, I guess another phase is kicking in in January of '19 or the March quarter of '19. Is that what's already been announced what you -- the big press release that had a lot of the changes or is there another phase subsequent to that that we should anticipate?\nMarty St. George: What's kicking in in the first half of 2019 are the things we've already announced. So it's obviously depending on seasonality, certain things make during certain times but when we laid out that run rate of $100 million to $120 million, that was inclusive of everything that we had laid out at Investor Day.\nMichael Linenberg: Robin, I think you basically said that you were optimistic with respect to margin expansion in '19 and I thought I heard you qualify it by saying ex-fuel margin expansion. How are you thinking about just overall margin expansion; are you cautious, do you think it's a reach or am I reading too much into that?\nRobin Hayes: Just to clarify, I wasn't saying ex-fuel, I was just sort of -- I made a comment that probably being in this industry for 30 years you never know where our fuel is going to go, there may be some from extreme state. But I'm very pleased, I mean we've seen an uptick in fuel in the second half of the year, I think JetBlue has been very proactive on capacity reductions, I think we've been very proactive on fare increase, I think we've been very proactive on ancillary revenue changes to driving weekend and mitigate the cost of higher fuel, you know we don't want to use that as an excuse. And margin expansion 2019; even in a higher fuel environment I'm very very optimistic about because we have a pathway to get there to layout the 2020 EPS goal -- the five building blocks that we laid out; many of those start to kick-in in the early part of 2019. We have the network building blocks that you just asked Marty about, we have the structural cost program that continues to have added by as we go through, just like we said it would. And so -- yes, we are very confident that we will see absolute margin expansion in 2019 even if fuel was to rise from here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.\nUnidentified Analyst: I was hoping you could talk about the competitiveness at high level in the largest three focused cities; JFK and Boston, Fort Lauderdale. It seems like there is a decent amount of growth from some competitors in those markets. And then, as aside, you know, could that potentially impact some of the commercial initiatives that were recently announced?\nMarty St. George: So let's talk about the three focused cities independently. New York, obviously being a smart-controlled market, the real action we see in New York in gauge-related and we've been partaking in that pretty aggressively with the introduction of the out-core A321, highly margin accretive and it's been very helpful for us to continue to capture the normal day-to-day growth of \u2013 I'm not sure, about 18 million people without it being able to grow departures because of small constraints. I'll talk about Lauderdale and Boston separately. First of all, Lauderdale; obviously it's been a very competitive market for many many years. We have been competing against the U.S. LLC [ph] for quite a while pretty aggressively. I'd say, more recently we've seen growth coming from another LCC. I think if you look at the data that we put out in both, the 2016 and the 2018 Investor Day desks, you can see that from a RASM performance, and you can back-in the margin performance to that, we compete extremely well against those carriers. And certainly, I'd say not just on RASM but also on margin, if you [indiscernible]. So we feel very confident about our short-term and long-term prospects in Fort Lauderdale. I think if you look at the change that we announced, we have added a couple of more destinations from Fort Lauderdale through the network reallocation, and the biggest constraint we have at Fort Lauderdale is date availability, but we're very very interested in more growth at Fort Lauderdale. I'll take Boston next. Boston, we've been working for many many years with Massport [ph] to make sure that we can secure the gates we need to get to the 200-flight a day level in Boston that we think the market requires, and courtesy of Massport, we actually now have secured gate space and we can get there. We are very very confident in our position in Boston right now. I did call out that we have -- had some RASM challenges in Boston, mostly on Boston-leisure tied to growth from a legacy airline. And frankly, if you look at our RASM results, we see some nice RASM acceleration in those markets over the last probably two quarters. And then I think if you get in the first quarter 2019 the competitive capacity trend -- actually it turns to be nicely for us. So we're optimistic that we have the formula to be successful in Boston. Given the geographic location, the market is absolutely positively made for an airline that specializes in point-to-point -- as a business model, that specializes in point-to-point; combining that with the product advantage that we have, whether it's free Wi-Fi, Live TV, on mainline aircraft, you name it, we're very upbeat in Boston.\nUnidentified Analyst: As a quick follow-up; we talk a lot tech-ops being the largest portion of the structural cost initiatives but -- and there is the second largest component -- kind of the corporate proportion also has a lot of work of them, maybe the most work remaining. Could you give a quick update on that? And then maybe potential timing?\nSteve Priest: We continue to make progress on all four of the pillars of the structural cost program. Following the update we gave back at Investor Day and 2Q earnings, we have -- continue to make some progress. So the corporate pillar itself, that's obviously the support center -- to support our frontline crew members who supply our customers. And as you're probably aware, we want through a recent reorganization in our support senses that impacted around 10% of our crew members, these initiatives are never easy and it's a challenge as we go through those because it impacts some of our leaders and crew members but we've gone through that. In addition, a big part of the corporate initiative is associated with sourcing. So we have gone through suit-to-nice [ph] approach with regards to RFPs and looking at all of the $1.5 billion of third-party business partners spend that we have across JetBlue. And we're going back to both sides at contract-by-contract to make sure that we go through that and drive same as JetBlue. The final item really pertains to some of our IT infrastructure, the way we have that data, the way we support the overall business and initiatives that we take in there. So they are the primary three key blocks within the corporate pillar; and again, I'm pleased with the progress we're making, not only in the core initiatives but also while the problem as a whole. And as we talked about today, we're up $273 million of the $250 million to $300 million by 2020; so well on-track and happy with the progress we've made.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: First, for Steve on the pilots; now that we're driving, you've got -- I guess about three or four months of operations, I guess three months of operation under your belt. Are there any inherent efficiencies that you're realizing or that you would expect to realize going forward relative to the -- sort of pre-contract construct? Also any commentary on pilot hiring challenges? Thanks in advance.\nJoanna Geraghty: In terms of efficiencies, you know, the contract was just signed this past summer; so we're in the process of implementing a number of the IT changes to support the work role changes that we have ahead of us. So we're very early in terms of that part of the process. In terms of the pilot hiring, no, I mean we're confident with our pilot hiring plan, we are not seeing any challenges around the pipeline for pilots, we actually just announced late last this week that we're hiring, so if anybody is interested on the phone -- I'm only kidding, but yes, I know we're not seeing any challenges on the pilot pipeline either.\nJamie Baker: Follow-up probably for Robin; the topic of lifting the LaGuardia perimeter rule hasn't come up in a while, I know at one point JetBlue was somewhat against the idea but your fleet plan has changed somewhat since then. Any change in your personal view; I would think that particularly given the strength of meeting the Transcon that -- LaGuardia Transcons could be potentially lucrative?\nRobin Hayes: No, my view hasn't changed. I mean, just for those who don't know the permits of role that Jamie is referring to; it's a port role, so it's different from the way -- the way the permits work in PCI, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. I think we've been very vocal about that the airports in New York work in a comparative balance [ph], and if you were to lift the perimeter wall at LaGuardia, there would be a significantly more interest in LaGuardia to serve other markets and so the airlines like JetBlue have a very small slot portfolio, and we would be concerned that would put us at disadvantage. So we are open to conversation or not but we do think that any lifting the perimeter rule have to come with some kind of divestiture or slots to make sure LaGuardia pays with more competitive idol [ph] such that with all the construction going on on both, LaGuardia and JFK; LaGuardia at the moment and JFK is planned, now is really not the time to be making that change.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Steve, I wonder if you could help us think about the unit cost progression in 2019? Just entering kind of the first half phase, you know, more pilot cost pressure; and I think it gets better as you get into the second half. But any thoughts there and how we should think about that?\nSteve Priest: I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made during '18 and how we're finishing the year as we go into '19. I'm particularly pleased with the inflection that we saw at the back end of '18 as we go through quarter four because if you think about the capacity pulls that we took, both in Q3 and Q4, and you look at the original plan that we laid out back in January, we're absolutely executing to that. And the reason I say that is that we're coming out of '18 in a strong position as we enter into '19 where the structural cost program that continues to run as we go forward. If you think about the headwinds that we have from the upper contracts, the upper contracts gives us a 3 point headwind in the first half of next year but you can sort of see the guide that we gave at Investor Day in terms of [indiscernible] to 2019 CASM which absorbs that. And as we set a cycle through 2019, the structural cost program continues to ramp, will continue to have more P&L benefits associated with structural cost program but will continue to offset the cost headwind that we have with the upper contract. In addition, as I mentioned in my prepared comments; we will close 2018 with 11 restart aircraft and we'll be restarting it to 60 and 60 next year. So again, not from a tailwind perspective, we'll continue to help us with our CASM progression. So both as well being talked about in terms of the building blocks again drive margins up in 2019, the CASM contribution -- the CASM ex contribution to that will remain critical, and we're very pleased with the execution that we've seen so far at this structural cost program.\nSavi Syth: On the fuel side; how should we think about fuel efficiency, it seems like fuel efficiency is pretty flat here in 2018-2019. I know there has been some, and maybe last minute -- the capacity or instruments that makes that a little tougher as well and storm. How should we think about\u2026\nRobin Hayes: I think your comments are right, it's been sort of pretty flat in terms of how it's been going forward. The good news though is, you do see further fuel efficiency as we bring more A321s into the fleet, we're going to see something more near aircraft coming during 2019 as we start to take deliveries of those, and also with the restart of A320 fleet as that starts to ramp. On another same basis, you're going to see more fuel efficiency going forward. So I think the story has been sort of pretty flat but we're confident that we'll continue to see more efficiency as we migrate and go forward through to 2019.\nSavi Syth: Should we assume that 2020 should see a bigger improvement than 2019 or is 2019 a big year?\nRobin Hayes: I think you will continue to see the ramp because as we mentioned, we will have the full impact of the restarting completed; as we go into 2020 you will have the full year impact of the additional shelves that we're restarting in 2019. We'll have a great proportion of NEOs [ph] in the fleet at that point from the deliveries we're taking next year, a greater proportion of 321s overall. So you will see sequential improvement in terms of benefits, in terms of fuel consumption by per RASM on an average basis as you migrate through the back of '18 through '19 onto '20.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Most of my questions have been asked but I wanted to go back to one of the charts you showed at Investor Day showing the margin outperformance of the high density A321s. Margin improvement of Mint, as well as high density; what did you intend to communicate with that slide? And are you in any way sort of deemphasizing premium, deemphasizing Mint going forward? Thanks for taking the question.\nJoanna Geraghty: At Investor Day we wanted to just illustrate how critical the A321 aircraft has been to our fleet; it's a fantastic aircraft, both in the mid-configuration, and also in the high density configuration, we have announced and deployed the first and second phase of our mint cities and may have done remarkably well from a margin perspective, and now as we look to the best and highest view to that asset, we're looking at the higher density version and actually the margin on that in terms of where we are deploying it largely be of our markets and single-day flight leisure markets. The margin is actually exceeding that on our Mint route; so it's really -- just a great news story all around, both in the mid-configuration but also in the all density configuration.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So we shouldn't have interpreted that you're going to be pulling down mint aircraft, replacing them with high density, it's just a different objective?\nJoanna Geraghty: Yes, just a different objective and we are just trying to ensure that we put these planes and use them in the best and highest possible way out there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey of Citi.\nKevin Crissey: On the 320 restyling, given the limited number of aircraft currently restyled, are you able to sell them as 162 seats yet or not?\nMarty St. George: Yes, we do have among close rotations and we take them -- we basically schedule them as they come out of the factory and we are [indiscernible].\nKevin Crissey: And maybe a question for Joanna; now that you've been in your expanded role for a bit, can you talk about the changes you've been leading and how far along they are or maybe how you see things changing -- big picture discussion of what you see maybe different in the future than maybe the way things operated in the past? Thanks.\nJoanna Geraghty: I mean, from my perspective there has been a few key areas that we are really drilling down on; first is cost. Obviously, we are absolutely aware of -- our investors use on cost also as we compare ourselves to other carriers, we need to start resetting our cost base for the future. We've done I think a really good job on revenue historically, and really growing RASM, also growing capacity; and at the end of the day we need to continue to do that. So as you see sort of both, top line and bottom line growth, we want to expand those margins. Part of the network changes has been sort of under my leadership along with rolling out and announcing the evolution of our fair options. So primary focus is cost, also looking at how do we continue to drive new revenue initiatives, and then the third point is operational performance. We are very mindful of the air space we operate into and ensuring that we continue to make investments to tactically improve our operational performance in our key focused cities.\nKevin Crissey: JetBlue vacations for Q4; is there anything of note in terms of pluses and minuses for RASM in Q4 as it relates to vacations?\nRobin Hayes: We're still working on closing out some of the operations -- some of the technical issues with our platform. We're a little bit behind in fourth quarter but we have other parts of the revenue mix that are over performing and that's what's created the guide that we laid out. The most important thing for us to make sure that we're ready for the first week of January because that is by far the biggest booking week of the year, and everything we're seeing right now makes us very confident that we're in a good spot. I think the other thing I'd add to that Kevin, if I may, because I think Marty made a great point about the challenges we've had with the cutover but I feel very confident about having everything in place for a strong 2019. As Marty says, we've got our leadership team in place now, and we're working through some of those cutover issues and so I expect 2019 to be a very strong year for vacations.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie of Buckingham Research.\nDaniel McKenzie: I'm wondering if you can just give us some insight into what the revenue contribution is from even more in mint-to-overall results today. So $7.7 billion in total revenue for this year, you know what percent of that comes from the premium cabin? And then I appreciate the shift to the denser aircraft but it doesn't -- it's not like the premium cabin growth is helping here; so I'm just wondering if you can just help us understand how you're thinking about the growth in the premium cabin space next year? So contribution today and growth next year is really what I'm trying to get at here.\nMarty St. George: We don't actually break out the Mint specifically, we definitely breakout even more and even more has been a fantastic contributor for us, it's well over $300 million right now. I think if you look at what's happened in the most recent quarter, our mid revenues -- and again, we don't want the growth this year, and then -- so I think it's important to make it clear I'm looking at the same-store sales because we can't take credit for all the new Mint routes. But for routes that has been open at least a year, Mint revenue was up 14%, and actually during that same period even more revenue was up 16%. So that actually has been very nicely accretive to our results. And I think back to the point that Joanna made earlier; what we laid out in Investor Day about the challenge of picking between high density 321 and the mid-configured 321 is the definition of a high-class problem, and we have two really good use to the airplane and our job is best and highest use, that's the most important thing for us. I'll also mention that specifically with Mint, we're very happy with the acceptance on the new route that we've added in, certainly the secondary cities from Boston and New York, and I think that really ties to the corporate account strength that we've been able to get from having such a high quality product. Certainly, we been to very very good corporate conference in Boston and a significantly improved corporate conference in New York from corporate customers who are travelers, sort of really desperately angling to get on the mint product.\nDaniel McKenzie: And then, Marty the growth in premium cabinet where this motion met even more together, growth rate next year versus this year?\nMarty St. George: Actually, I don't want you guide that because we haven't even given the overall guidance but I will say we're very optimistic about what we're seeing right now as both of those -- I think it ties to more the scenes we've heard in earning season in general which is overall strength of the corporate market, and certainly mint and even more other areas where we're heavily exposed in a good way to that growth.\nDaniel McKenzie: Second question here, this is really an IT question so I don't know if Esha [ph] is there or not but I'm just -- the question really is just about challenges in implementing the IT infrastructure necessary to troll out fair families 2.0. So I guess, I know it's probably year-off before you can execute on that but I'm just wondering what some of the factors might be that could accelerate or potentially delay that rollout?\nJoanna Geraghty: We have been scoping the implementation requirements for -- involving corruption 2.0, perhaps we have several IT platforms involved; Datalex provides the shopping platform, Faber [ph] provides the reservation and booking platform behind it; those two systems need to speak in order for this to work. So we've been working with both business partners in earnest for the last several months trying to make sure that all the requirements are fully outlined, consistent with how we want to roll, and how we want to roll this out. So, yes, IT is a big list here, it's a long pole in the tent but we are confident that we're well on the path to ensuring that we can implement these changes in 2019.\nDaniel McKenzie: And how many IT systems are involved Joanna?\nJoanna Geraghty: I'm not the IT expert, so I'd say there is still at least Datalex and Faber [ph], I'm sure there's a few other systems that support those systems behind the scenes but those are the primary -- I think IBM as well, those are the primary systems that are involved in making this change.\nRobin Hayes: Dan, I think the only other thing I would add to that are those not directly linked to the 2.0. We are also going through a RFP for new PSS or CFS as we call it because we never used the word passenger in JetBlue, we say customer but it's the same system. Hitch [ph] and his team have done a great job over the last several years moving our dependency of that core system away from the original holes that we have Datalex now for retailing, we have the IBM we do a lot of our self-service kiosks, we build our web services live on top of that. So all of those things mean that if we do make a decision to change CFS provider, it is nothing as -- I don't want to underplay that it would be significant but it will not be as significant as what we had to go back in the 2010 cover. So we're also navigating map at the same time as this to make sure that the timeline at the fair options is not jeopardized by any potential change in the CFS.\nDaniel McKenzie: What's the timeframe for that decision possibly in rollout if you do make a change?\nRobin Hayes: I'd say we haven't -- these things kind of -- you want to move -- you want to get the decisions quickly as you can but these are complex negotiations, there's lots of -- as we still with our E20 decision, there was a lot of value in letting it take as long as it took and to a certain extent I feel the same about this. So we're -- the teams are working through it, I would say we're definitely near the end of the process than the start, but I don't want to put an exact timeline on it because there are still lots of conversations ahead of us with the various parties that we're talking to.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen.\nHelane Becker: I think Robin last year or maybe Joanne, you had just talked about operational issues and the improvement that you've seen in; I know last year you had cited ATC issues in New York as one of the third quarter issue. So I was wondering if you could -- I don't know maybe quantify the improvement on your basis that you saw from either revenue terms or cost terms?\nJoanna Geraghty: We made a number of strategic investments going into the summer, we tried to alleviate some of the operational concerns we had in the summer of 2017, those included very tactical off-conscious [ph] investments, so don't think about it as kind of spreading the creamy peanut butter over everything; it was adding some time on West Coast red eyes, we added some additional time for technicians to have access to the aircraft perform overnight maintenance, and we identified certain flights that had challenges with broken crew pairings; those are just some examples of what we did going to the summer. And if you look at the summer, we've also been working proactively with the FAA to try to get ahead of any ATC challenges that are actually present, I will point out that. August actually was a worst traffic control month than what we saw in August of 2017, and I think given some of the investments that we made, we did see some progress in terms of how JetBlue performed overall. We've seen an improvement of about 5 points compared to where we were last year on A14, and we've also held our completion factors. So I think all things trending in the right direction but the reality is that, JetBlue flies into the most congested airspace in the United States, and we need to be very mindful of the types of investments that we do make because just adding block does not solve ATC challenges. Robin and I were actually with the administrator last week, and I think we continue to focus on infrastructure investments, nextgen investments, focusing on the northeast corridor and how we can make improvements there because obviously, JetBlue benefits significantly from that. So, a multi-pronged approach but we are seeing improvements and have seen improvements this summer.\nHelane Becker: And then just on the fuel comment that was made earlier, I think 4% of fuel was -- I guess alternative, is that the right word to use. And I'm just kind of wondering, is that a scalable number? Can you get to something that is meaningful in terms of cost prediction using an alternative fuel blend?\nRobin Hayes: I think with sustainable fuel, there are two sort of issues that you have to work through. First of all, to make sure that source of the fuel is truly sustainable, and something that can go overtime. And secondly, that the cost of getting that by fuel blend is equivalent or better to what you would get to sort of normal jet purchase. And we kind of took our time getting into this; Sophia Mendelsohn, who is our Director of Sustainability, she really understands this space very well. We've ended up with a business partner and a plan that we think overtime can scalp but we want to do it in a series of thoughtful steps to make sure we don't either A) jeopardize supply or B) Crave a cost to the airplane that's greater than what we would otherwise expect.\nHelane Becker: So just to follow-up briefly; is that like a 10-year thing or 5-year thing, how should we -- I mean, it's so small right now that obviously has the potential to really be meaningful to your costs.\nRobin Hayes: No, I mean it will -- we haven't sort of shared sort of our internal forecast of how we think that will ramp up but it's definitely a priority for us to increase overtime. Also working with the worst fuel farms and infrastructure in different airports to make sure that we can supply into there as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi of Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Marty, just wondering if you could talk about demand for a second; it would seem like the incremental revenue you're expecting from the ancillary changes would suggest that consumer behavior hasn't changed a whole lot. So I'm wondering if you could just -- kind of talk to what that says about demand and should we look at that as effectively a fare increase which would kind of mitigate further pressure on fares or do you think that that's incremental to what you guys can do? Thank you.\nMarty St. George: I mean, honestly, I think if you look at the revenue environment we see right now I think the entire industry is trying to react to what we're seeing as far as a run-up in fuel prices. I don't really look at the bag fee as being a sign of lack of pricing strength. I think with what we're seeing in demand right now, especially in peak periods, we're definitely seeing prices rise. In the third quarter we led several fare increases that were successful in addition to change the inflary [ph] world. I don't -- my view is, in the environment that the industry is in right now we do need to recapture the impact of the fuel run-up; and I think if you look at the progression that we're showing right now between third quarter, you can back into the fourth quarter which -- based on the guidance we gave, the fuel price and RASM is sort of like 40% recapture. I think we're optimistic of good trajectory right now; so no, I don't look at it as a substitute at all.\nJoseph DeNardi: I guess what I was asking was, it would seem like the incremental revenue you're expecting from that would suggest that demand can absorb that additional fare; is that what you're -- or that additional increase fare if you want to look at it that way, is that what you're saying?\nMarty St. George: No, I definitely agree with that, I think you're absolutely right and I think it's what we're seeing in the demand environment overall. And I think if you look at what we -- how we describe the more recent demand versus what we said earlier is that, during the peak -- the true peak period we're seeing acceleration and I think what they could be more interested in is that -- even in the trunk period we're starting to see demands [ph]. So I think you're absolutely right on that.\nJoseph DeNardi: And then, Steve, just on the CapEx profile; I think there are some concern about what that looks like maybe beyond 2020 as the 2020 start to ramp up. So can you just talk about maybe your flexibility whether it be from a deferral standpoint or just aircraft/non-aircraft about your ability to kind of manage that down if the economic environment changes? Thank you.\nSteve Priest: We always look to build flexibility into the future order book. You'll recall, we have [indiscernible] a little bit over the last sort of 15 to 18 months. We deferred 13 aircrafts, nearly parts of last year, we then migrated through the 190 decision and we looked at the replacement aircraft as we went forward. So it's critical for me that we maintain a flexibility for every eventuality, and we work very closely with the OEMs when we put these contracts together. We have obviously outlined our CapEx guide, we would be very transparent with the order book, you can see that in the appendix of the materials we shared this morning. But we will and continue to maintain flexibility in terms of the delivery schedules and have a very post-symbiotic relationship with the OEMs that we deal with.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Susan [ph] Macquarie Capital.\nUnidentified Analyst: All my questions were answered. Thank you.\nRobin Hayes: And that concludes our third quarter 2018 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: And again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."}, {"symbol": "JBLU", "quarter": 2, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-07-24 17:19:12", "content": "Executives: David Fintzen - Director, Investors Relation Robin Hayes - Chief Executive Officer Joanna Geraghty - President and COO Marty St. George - EVP, Commercial and Planning Steve Priest - Executive Vice President and CFO\nAnalysts: Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley Savi Syth - Raymond James Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Jamie Baker - JPMorgan Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research Jack Atkins - Stephens Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Andrew Didora - Bank of America Helane Becker - Cowen Joseph DeNardi - Stifel\nOperator: Good morning. My name is Jay. I would like to welcome everyone to JetBlue Airways Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would like to turn the call over to JetBlue\u2019s Director, Investors Relation, David Fintzen. Please go ahead.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, Jay. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning we issued our earnings release, our investor update and a presentation that we\u2019ll reference during this call. All those documents are available on our website at investor.jetblue.com and has been filed with the SEC. Joining me here in New York to discuss our results are Robin Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer; Joanna Geraghty, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Marty St. George, EVP, Commercial and Planning; and Steve Priest, EVP, CFO. This morning\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors, and therefore investors should not place undue reliance on these statements. For additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ from the forward-looking statements, please refer to our press release, 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC. Also during the course of our call, we may discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue\u2019s President -- JetBlue\u2019s CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Hi, there everyone. Good morning and thank you for joining us. This morning we reported our results for the second quarter of 2018. I\u2019ll start with the thank you to our 22,000 crew members for everything you do to deliver an outstanding JetBlue experience to our customers. I\u2019d also like to welcome Joanna Geraghty to her first earnings call since her promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. Joanna has been leading over 15,000 crewmembers from the customer experience team of JetBlue for the past four years and has been with us since 2005. She will now be leading the full operation and also oversee the commercial team led by Marty. The recent changes in our leadership team are aimed at further improving our day-to-day operations and advancing on our journey to superior margins. I\u2019d like to start on slide four of the presentation. This morning we reported adjusted second quarter operating income of $175 million, adjusted pretax margin of 8.2% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.38. Our financial performance was impacted by the holiday calendar, but more importantly, by fuel prices that increased over 40% percent year-over-year. I was particularly happy to see our CASM ex-fuel growth come in below end of our guidance range. Controlling our costs is even more critical amongst increasing oil prices. The team is focused on mitigating impacts of higher fuel in order to stabilize and improve our margins. We believe even modest slowing in our third quarter RASM growth is not accessible in a rising fuel environment. We are planning a series of adjustments to both capacity and our ancillary revenues to take effect over the coming months. We\u2019ve steadily slowed capacity growth over the past two years as oil prices have moved higher and we are further slowing capacity growth for the fourth quarter by 2 points. Excluding the impact of hurricanes last year, underlying growth is roughly 5.7% year-over-year at the lower end of our mid-to-high single-digit range we\u2019ve targeted over the medium-term. We are currently factoring higher fuel prices into our preliminary capacity planning for 2019. Long-term success for JetBlue requires not only adjusting to changing conditions, those are executing on the many things we control. At our Investor Day in early October, we plan to talk about the building blocks we have under way to improve our relative margins. The industry backdrop will fluctuate as it always has, but we believe executing on our building blocks should put us on the path to higher absolute margins and returns for years to come. We talked about superior margins but our efforts should translate into improving returns. Fleet is an example where we can improve margins and returns in tandem. We\u2019re delighted with the outcome of the E190 fleet review and our selection of the Airbus A220-300. We believe it will be returned an EPS accretive in the next decade, as it replaces a portion of our invested capital with more productive assets. We\u2019re confident in the up gauging economics for the new aircraft and in our ability to drive higher earnings from the A220s early in the next decade. This adds momentum to the margin benefits we expect from restarting our A320s and growing our Airbus A321 fleet. Beyond fleet we have several initiatives aimed at improving how we operate today, either strengthening our revenue or lowering our costs. One of the building blocks we planned to talk about in October includes changes in our network and how we can evolve and mature our focus cities. For example, we believe that our recent reallocation of intra-west flying to Transcon markets will ultimately add about -- will ultimately add between $30 million to $40 million in incremental run rate earnings. We\u2019ll have also have planned to talk about the opportunities we see to further grow our ancillary revenue. We have a series of initiatives underway, encompassing co-brand and loyalty, the next phase of fair options and segmentation, and longer-term travel products. We have been pleased to see improvements in our operation, as a result of our on-time performance initiatives and the investments we made to mitigate ATC challenges in the Northeast. We\u2019ve seen a nearly 10 point improvement in DOT A14 from May to present compared to last year for the same period. These efforts have yielded visible benefits in our operation, which have improved RASM and reduced CASM. We\u2019re making good progress in our Structural Cost program, and Steve, this quarter will provide a detailed update. We\u2019re looking for to the inflection in our unit cost that begins in the second half of this year. We signed two important tech op maintenance deals with the existing fleet which support a safe and reliable operation in a more cost effective way. Our size and our balance sheet are enabling us to reshape our cost structure, resulting in multi-year run rate savings across organization. Last year, we completed an organizational review of our support centers, I\u2019m sorry, last week, we completed an organizational review of our support centers that will take effect through the summer. We have an ambitious vision and we are setting up a structure to help us accomplish our plan and meet our commitment to controlling our costs. These things are never easy but they are all important and vital to protect the future of JetBlue. Before I pass the call to Marty, I\u2019d like to again thank our crew members in both the operation and support centers for their hard work during the quarter. Marty, over to you.\nMarty St. George: Thank you, Robin. I\u2019ll start with the capacity outlook on slide six. We continue to adjust our capacity to target a mid-to-high single-digit growth rate. As Robin said, we have moved towards the lower end of the range and are taking a number of actions to adjust to higher oil prices. We are updating our 2018 capacity guidance including a 2-point reduction to our fourth quarter growth that will run through our schedules over the upcoming days. We anticipate that those reductions will be in the off-peak flying throughout the network. In addition to addressing higher fuel prices, we are constantly reviewing underperforming fine in our network. Effective this fall, we will play to our strength in coast-to-coast travel with redeployments from our L.A. based and Focus Cities through transcontinental markets. Our team has a mandate to close poorly performing routes, adjust frequencies and off-peak flying, and look for areas where we can shift low margin flying to better opportunities. We closed the second quarter of 2018 with our flown capacity at 6.3%, slightly above the midpoint of our range. This was driven by higher than expected completion factor from an improved operation and helped by favorable weather in the Northeast. With about half the summer behind us, we are starting to see the benefits of our investments to mitigate the ATC challenges of last year. As we move into the second half of 2018, we recognize there\u2019s a lot of noise from the impact of hurricanes last year. Our scheduled to scheduled capacity helps inform our growth rationale in light of higher fuel prices. For the third quarter, we expect scheduled to scheduled growth of approximately 5.5%. This translates to flown capacity guidance of between 7.5% and 9.5% considering the loss ASMs due to hurricanes last year. For clarity, we have included a table summarizing the financial impact from hurricanes in the appendix of our presentation. To provide some context by region, our Latin and Caribbean franchise continues to show strength going by both VFR and leisure markets. Haiti which accounts for approximately 1% of our capacity is a small headwind to RASM in July. Bookings to the island were down 67% year-over-year during the first two weeks following the outbreak of civil unrest. We see bookings rebinding already and we expect that they will recover and the negative impact is expected to be less than a 0.25 point to the quarter. But a lot of that RASM, again, outperform the network this quarter by approximately 3 points. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of outperformance as we grow frequencies and destinations. Our Mint service at Fort Lauderdale is performing extremely well. We believe that our value proposition, which caters to a broad range of customers, allows us to differentiate ourselves from both our low-cost and legacy competitors. Lastly, our Transcon franchise is also performing well in book Mint and non-Mint markets. As Robin mentioned, we estimate that our network reallocations out of intra-west flying will drive between $30 million and $40 million of earnings improvement with meaningful benefits starting in the first quarter of 2019. Every aircraft and every market must earn its way into the network. We expect to continue optimizing how we deploy capacity across the network to support our margin commitments especially as fuel prices continue to increase. One advantage we have is a relatively underdeveloped network in two primary focused cities. Our market here in Boston and Fort Lauderdale is approximately 30% and 25%, respectively. Clearly, we believe we have a lot of room to keep growing our relevance for our leisure and business customers, promoting RASM growth and margins. Turn to slide seven and the revenue outlook. Second quarter came in slightly better than expected at negative 1.2%. We had a solid close to June. As a reminder, second quarter RASM included 2.5 points of negative impact from holiday travel that\u2019s shifted from the second quarter to the first. Last quarter, we also left a 1.25 point benefit that occurred in the second quarter of \u201817 from completion factor in co-brand incentive payments. Our RASM during the first half of 2018, which was equal to 2.2% year-over-year, demonstrates our ability to increase unit revenues as we grow. Looking into the third quarter, we expect year-over-year RASM growth to be between flat and plus 3%. RASM continues to be driven by close-end bookings and we\u2019ve seen strength throughout July. Our ticketing revenue trends are carrying over from the second quarter and to the third quarter. We continue to see strength in New York to Florida markets, as well as in Transcon and the Caribbean and Latin regions. At a focus level, on balance, we\u2019re not seeing any significant changes in trend from the first half to the third quarter. We have seen modest softening in San Juan coming into the summer and we have already made capacity adjustments to address the recent trend. The deceleration in RASM we are seeing in the third quarter is a result of slowing in-flight for customer trends. The transition to a new vacation platform has been more challenging than anticipated and has cascaded into other initiatives. This is approximately a 1 point headwind to the third quarter. To mitigate the impact, we are moving forward with a series of ancillary adjustments that are independent of the platform change. At our Investor Day in early October, we will provide an update on our long-term ancillary plan and other projects we have under way, as well as details around our capacity planning for 2019. Before I turn it over to Steve, I would like to add my thanks to all of our crew members for their hard work. We\u2019re excited about our value proposition and the investments we\u2019re making in our product and in our network. I believe that our take on a low cost model will create long-term value for our customers and our owners. Steve, over to you.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Marty. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll start on slide nine with some highlights from the second quarter. Revenue is $1.9 billion, a 5% year-over-year. Adjusted pre-tax margin was 8.2%, down 9.5 percentage points from the second quarter of last year due to higher fuel prices and the effect of holiday calendar placements shifted revenues from the second quarter into the first quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.38 per diluted share. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 26%. We expect our effective tax rate to range between 25% and 26% to the full year of 2018. We reported a $0.38 GAAP EPS loss, including a $319 million non-cash impairment charge on the E190 fleet. As a result of the impairments and transition plan to the A320, we will have a very manageable $1.4 million per year of accelerated depreciation expense for the E190 and is now our cost guidance. As Robin mentioned, we are focused on executing our long-term plan as we adjust to higher oil prices. Our aim is to stabilize and ultimately improve our margins. The actions we are taking include ancillary, as well as capacity adjustments. There is an impact on CASM from slowing our growth. Our rule of thumb is roughly 50% of CASM ex-fuel is fixed and the rest is variable. The team is working to mitigate the 2018 CASM ex-fuel pressure and we are on track for an inflection in our unit cost trends in the second half and on track to achieve our original 2018 cost guidance of negative 1 to 1%. We are fully committed as a leadership team to our zero to 1 CASM/CAGR goal through 2020. Moving to slide 10, CASM ex-fuel increased 1.9% year-over-year in the second quarter beating our guidance. The main drivers for the timing of expenses from the second to the third quarter and better than expected completion factor resulting an improved operational performance and reduced ATC delays. Looking into third quarter of 2018, we expect that CASM ex-fuel growth to range between 1% and 3%. The progression in our CASM ex-fuel trends is impacted by the shift of expenses from the second quarter and previous reductions to capacity growth, which carried some but not all of the operation improvement from the second quarter into our third quarter guidance. Turning to slide 11, we\u2019ve been pleased with our cost performance thus far in 2018 and is on track to our original guidance of minus 1 to plus 1% even with slower capacity growth. CASM ex-fuel growth for the first half of 2018 was 2.5%, near the lower end of our guidance. We continue to expect CASM ex-fuel growth to reflect during second half of this year with the benefit of structure cost initiatives, put in place over the six -- plus 16 months ramp up. Second half year-over-year comparisons are impacted by hurricanes and ATC challenges of last year, and the one-time bonus we paid to our crewmembers at the yearend of results of Tax Reform. A simple way to see how inflection in our cost trends is to look the year over two-year growth. The left-hand side on slide 12 shows the improving cost trend that we expect in the third quarter, and again, in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the second half, we now expect CASM ex-fuel to decline in the range of negative 3.5 to negative 1.5, slightly higher than the prior guide. The main drivers being slower capacity growth in the second half, as well as timing of expenses from the first half to the second half, particularly into the third quarter. We anticipate the underlying CASM ex-fuel growth for 2018 to slow to a range of between flat and 2% for the second half of this year. Our full-year CASM ex-fuel guide remains unchanged of minus 1% to plus 1%. Moving to slide 12 and our progress report on Structural Cost program. We have now achieved $154 million in run rate savings by 2020, up from $90 million we called out two quarters ago. Our continued progress in restructuring our costs is pivotal to hitting our CASM ex-fuel commitments in the second half of 2018 and through 2020. We continue to expect our three-year efforts will result in run rate savings between $250 million and $300 million. Our work is progressing on every front. Starting with our corporate pillar. The past year we drove significant cost savings, by identifying opportunities and our business partners spend across the organization, we move across sourcing efforts. Last week, we also completed the support center review that will streamline how support teams work and improve their effectiveness, allowing us to better deliver on our strategic plans. In our airports pillar, we are restructuring critical business partner operations across our airports. We conducted a comprehensive review of our footprint through the network and are making further changes that will reduce costs, while maintaining outstanding customer service. We are also on track to complete 24 self-service lobbies by the year end, reinforcing the benefits of updating aircraft as we grow the number of customers in our airports. In the distribution pillar, we have several projects underway to ensure our customers can self-serve using our website and app, as well as to transform our customer support centers. We\u2019re making progress in shifting customers to lowest cost, the most appropriate distribution and support channel. We\u2019ve partnered with Gladly to help us transform our customer support centers through new technology. We try to be an investor in Gladly through our JetBlue Tech Venture subsidiary. We\u2019ve recently implemented a new tool to consolidate all the way to customers\u2019 reaches into one channel, allowing technology to reduce costs and make our customer communications more efficient. We also have made progress on our RFP through our PSS system, in order to incorporate the latest generation technology, scalability and functionality to fit our needs as a larger and more complex airline. Finally, in our Tech Ops pillar, we signed a long term 10-year contract for heavy maintenance of our A320s and continue working to select the business partner for the maintenance of our v2500 engines. We believe that this contract is similar to our recent deal with Pratt &Whitney to help us achieve significant savings into the next decade, we -- as we reset the maintenance costs for our largest fleet. With our fleet review completed, we also signed an enhanced LLP engine coverage agreement to drive additional savings in E190 fleet. Turning to slide 13, we continue to reshape our fleet. We constituted the majority of our asset base and critical to improving returns. Two weeks ago, we announced the outcome of our E190 fleet review and transition plan, including a signed MOU for the purchase of 60 A220 aircraft starting in 2020 through 2025. We\u2019ve made further progress with our A320 cabin restarting program and expect to see the benefit of our unit cost growth as a number of restart aircraft increases through 2020. This quarter, we also purchased two additional all core A321 with cash for total fleet of 247 aircrafts. We now have 23 all core and 34 Mint A321 aircrafts, which are great margin builders for JetBlue. Our CapEx guidance for 2018 is between $900 million and $1.1 billion, composed of up to $850 million to $1 billion in aircraft and the remainder unchanged for non-aircraft spend. The recent A220 order added incremental aircraft CapEx included added PDP. We believe that the additional CapEx is very manageable and will support out network strategy, how we set our cost base and further improve our margins. Turning to slide 14, our strong balance sheet and investment grade metrics allow us to invest in value-accretive projects and continue to be opportunistic with share repurchase returning excess capital to our owners. Earlier this quarter, we executed an additional $125 million in share repurchase with $500 million remaining from the total amount authorized by the Board. Our priorities remain to invest in margin and return-accretive projects. We believe our E190 fleet transition plan and the A320 restarting program are among our best and highest uses of capital. This quarter we repaid $66 million in debt and raised nearly $280 million in secured aircraft debt. We closed the quarter with an adjusted debt to cap ratio of 31.3%. And our cash in investments were approximately 12.6% of trailing 12 months revenue. Lastly, we continued our policy of opportunistic hedging to help protect our margins given the current environment. This quarter, we executed hedges of approximately 7.5% of our expected fuel consumption over the second half of 2018, in line with prior hedging positions. I\u2019ll close with one last thank you to all of our crew members for their hard work and continued support to make JetBlue stronger and more profitable. We\u2019re adjusting to higher oil and see great momentum from our revenue and cost initiatives across the organization. We are confident that our efforts will create value for our stakeholders over the next few years. We will now take your questions.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, everyone. Jay, we\u2019re ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRajeev Lalwani: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.\nRobin Hayes: Good morning.\nRajeev Lalwani: Just a question on the capacity side, Marty, I think, you were talking about making adjustments, because of higher oil going forward a bit and you\u2019re also reaffirming the mid to high-single digits growth. So, can you just reconcile how you\u2019re thinking about that going forward? It seems like you might revisit that mid to high-single digits coming into next year?\nMarty St. George: Hi. Thanks for the question. I think let\u2019s talk strategically and tactically. We\u2019ve said for the last several years that mid to high-single digits is the right range for us, taking into account our current size, cost structure, et cetera. I think, if you go back to -- actually go back to 2015 when oil hit its bottom. Since 2015, we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive at continuing to reduce our growth rate as oil prices have gone up. With the data that we\u2019ve given you for the rest of 2018, in effect, we\u2019re saying is we\u2019re pretty close to the bottom end of that range and I think you should look at that that mid to high single-digits as a sort of bracketing where we expect our growth to be.\nRajeev Lalwani: Very helpful. And then in terms of, Marty, the accelerating RASM environments that you\u2019ve been highlighting. What do you attribute that? To you, is it fuel tax or do you see demand accelerating, is it particular markets? Just some thoughts there would be great.\nMarty St. George: Well, with respect to what we\u2019re seeing on the revenue front, I mean, we are absolutely seeing closing strength, pretty well for close in bookings. I think if you -- there\u2019s been some discussion as far as how much of this may have been impacted by easy comps last hear for ULCC, the fare environment we have last summer. But, frankly, we\u2019re seeing in both ULCC and in non-ULCC markets.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good morning, guys. I\u2019m just wondering if you can -- I appreciate all the detail on the CASM ex that you have. I wonder if you could help me walk through it a little bit. I\u2019m just looking at the sequential trends from 3Q to 4Q. And I know there\u2019s like one point of items that shifted from the first half that probably doesn\u2019t show up in 4Q, and 4Q, I know has got a couple of points of these. They account from the tax bonuses. The remaining swings from kind of the 3Q to 4Q, is that you\u2019re expecting there. Could you explain like what really is helping to shore that up because that seems like a pretty big swing and is it all kind of a structural program or am I missing something in that swing?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Savi. It\u2019s Steve here. Very nice to speak to you. I\u2019ll say I\u2019m pleased with the underlying CASM ex performance, not only as we think going forward, but in terms of what we delivered in Q2 and half one. Just to give you some flavor, your question on to Q3 CASM, as a reminder, we have 0.5 point of sales and marketing spend shifted from Q2 to Q3 and we called out back in Q1 a 0.5 point of maintenance cost and that transferred from Q1 to Q3. Another thing you\u2019ve got to keep in mind is that we\u2019re maintaining our full year CASM guide, even that we polled 1.4 points of capacity from Q3 and we\u2019ve just announced the subsequent 2.2 capacity reduction in Q4. The continual evolution of the Structural Cost program and the ramp for the $154 million for 2020 that we announced this morning is seeing the inflection points as we drive towards the second half of the year. So, you\u2019re right, as we called out in the prepared remarks, there\u2019s an underlying comps, but I\u2019m very, very pleased not only with the progress we\u2019ve made in the early part of the year, but the continued declines you\u2019re going to see in CASM as you might grow to the second half of the year.\nSavi Syth: Hey, Steve. Sorry. Just to clarify, I was kind -- I was considering the swing from 3Q to 4Q. That seems like a quite a good improvement and I know there\u2019s about three of those that I can point to. Is the rest are coming from the structural program, just showing up in 4Q more so?\nSteve Priest: That\u2019s correct.\nSavi Syth: Okay.\nSteve Priest: We -- as you saw that increase some of the Structural Cost initiatives that we\u2019ve been driving for. That\u2019s really helping with that inflection point.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Great. And if I can follow-up on that the ancillary platform conversion, I may not have been aware of it. Could you just elaborate a little bit on that and maybe if you can, the ancillary changes in the coming weeks?\nMarty St. George: Hi. Thanks, Savi. It\u2019s Marty. I\u2019ll take that one. Yeah. I think if you go back to the announcement we made earlier in the year of setting up JetBlue Travel Products as a subsidiary. I think it was the sign of the excitement we have about travel products as being highly accretive product line for us. One of the things we identified very early on was that our historical White Label platform was not going to let us do everything we wanted to do with respect to effectively selling and merchandising all these products. In addition, we were not satisfied with our ability to cross-sell on jetblue.com itself, products like rental cars, hotels, et cetera. So, in the middle of the second quarter, we went to a new platform that\u2019s more fully integrated with jetblue.com. We did forecast some teething pains. I\u2019d say, they went longer than we expected it to. We have a long punch list of issues and fixes and I think we\u2019re well along the way where we wanted to be. But our expectations are very high and we think that this is going to be a very important source of accretion for us going forward and we will have more to talk about at our Investor Day about some of the paths for that.\nSavi Syth: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg: Yeah. Two questions here, actually, just the $30 million to $40 million of profit improvement moving out of the intra-west to the Transcon. Is -- so presumably that, obviously, well, not obviously, does that include the foregone losses that are tied to the intra-west flying, number one and sort of, that\u2019s 1A. 1B would be then the new stuff that you\u2019re doing if you didn\u2019t include the losses, what would be the underlying profitability driver of that?\nMarty St. George: Okay. I\u2019m not sure I understand the second question. Let me take the first one. Yes, that is a net number.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay.\nMarty St. George: So it\u2019s the benefit from loss avoidance for the intra-west and I think it\u2019s not the news both from us and the industry that the intra-west market is unusually soft. But the net benefit includes the upside of putting those aircraft into the destination market where they\u2019re going to and again that being said, that really kicks in in the first quarter as far as the net benefit most because the new flying ends up and ramp a little bit. We make the change in September and going forward.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Yeah. Marty, that does answer kind of the second piece. Sorry for the confusing way that I asked. And then just to Steve on your CapEx, the guide for the year, it\u2019s still a gap of about $200 million. And I know as we\u2019re moving through the year, what\u2019s the difference between the bid ask there. I know the timing is probably part of that, but it\u2019s still a pretty wide gap. It\u2019s 20% of the base. What are you -- it\u2019s going to take more planes a little bit sooner or is it timing of pre-delivery deposits. I would figure that gap would have narrowed by now.\nSteve Priest: So, Mike, again I\u2019ll try and sort of answer the question. We increased our CapEx guide by $100 million in the midpoint when we announced the fleet orders. So we have PDP associated with the 60, 80, 20s that we ordered. The other aspect is our non- aircraft CapEx. Obviously, the vast majority of our CapEx guide associated with the fleet but obviously, we also have additional non-aircraft CapEx, but we have not changed the guide associated with that. And then, obviously the underlying guide was just applicable to our existing order book, which for this year is pretty much back-ended. So I\u2019m not clear if that fully answers your question, but as a macro level guide increase by $100 million, it\u2019s CapEx for fleet and non-fleet and it\u2019s sort back-ended because of delivery schedule.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. And maybe I was getting at the fact that I know it because of the delays with aircraft deliveries from the OEMs. I guess it\u2019s been harder for people to kind of nail down what their CapEx is actually going to be for the year and hence the wide range. Maybe that\u2019s what -- what\u2019s going on.\nSteve Priest: No. And to be very candid, we\u2019ve had good timing and delivery schedule for our OEMs and we haven\u2019t seen any sort of delays to aircraft deliveries this year. So the range is pretty much where it was other than the A320. So nothing really to see from our perspective for the CapEx guide this year.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Okay. Thanks, Steve. Appreciate it.\nSteve Priest: Thanks. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey. Good morning, everybody.\nRobin Hayes: Good morning, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: Robin, on the relative margin emphasis, that was the backbone of one of United\u2019s turnaround efforts at one point and it frankly didn\u2019t work out particularly well for them. They\u2019ve backed away from it since that time. Personally, I found it somewhat refreshing that Delta, just a few weeks ago, started putting greater emphasis on expanding margins from current levels. And most of the investor feedback that I\u2019ve received on that has been favorable. I get that the relative margin story is a fairly easy one to convey particularly with employees I suppose. But it\u2019s not clear to me that it\u2019s actually the best message for your investors. Have you given any recent thought to this?\nRobin Hayes: Yeah. Thanks, Jamie. And I think that if I just go back a couple of years and when we were talking about sort of our margin performance. Our first priority really was to get to about average industry margins and that\u2019s what we had in the last couple of years focusing on. It is very disappointing to me and the team here as a result of latest quarter and the fact that we\u2019ve actually fallen below that, because that is an absolute focus, and I don\u2019t think that we should be using higher oil prices there as an excuse. So our commitment to execute to our goal of superior margins, which is still a relative measure then that is where we are. Right now, we are very focused on that. That is about a number of the new catalysts, some of which you\u2019ll see over the coming months and some of which we\u2019ll show when we get to the Investor Day. It\u2019s about investing on our -- it\u2019s about continuing to execute on our Structural Cost program. And we have very -- we are looking at how airlines are guiding and setting up targets. It\u2019s obviously we\u2019ve noticed some have moved to an EPS guide and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll come back to. Because at the end of the day, we want to drive great absolute margins and we want to make sure when we compare relative to others that we are delivering superior margins because that\u2019s how we make ourselves both an investable business and an investable company within that sector.\nJamie Baker: I wanted to follow up to that, Robin, and thank you by the way. On a high level, what\u2019s the point of growth in the first place? I mean, if I look at pre-tax income over the last three years, it\u2019s down by about a third. The stock is down about the same thing. Capacity is up 20%. I mean, it seems like the more you grow, the less you earn. And I would totally understand it if you were still in the start-up phase. But can you just explain again how you justify continued growth of any level and have you ever even contemplated annual growth outcome or is it simply too ingrained in your DNA at this point? Thanks.\nRobin Hayes: No. Thanks, Jamie. No. I mean, I think, what I say, that growth has been very, very focused and we\u2019ve been prepared to adjust where we need payback to pass it down. In the first half of this year, we grew less the industry and we\u2019ve taken 2 points out of quarter four, and we haven\u2019t hesitated to do that. So we\u2019ve not wedded capacity for the sake of capacity. What I point out though and you understand the network business extremely well, our two projects for growth over the last two years has been Boston and Fort Lauderdale. They\u2019ve actually been a source of random strength for us and they are markets where we are relatively underweighted in terms of our share and so we have not got to that point on the S curve yet where we\u2019re growing them and we\u2019re getting diminished returns. And so, that\u2019s --we view our growth as very focus, very accretive. I think we would say and I\u2019ll just say that we have actually done well in terms of the unit revenue performance over the years with our growth rate, but we\u2019ve under-delivered on costs and that\u2019s what we are focus to our Structural Cost program, because I couldn\u2019t agree with that comment, I just made myself more.\nJamie Baker: All right. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Thanks. You may not be in a position to guide to \u201819 CASM specifically, but I\u2019m wondering if you could just remind us the quantification of the tailwinds that you expect. One, from fleet refresh, and two, from the Structural Cost progress, which you\u2019ve cited, if we add those up, could that be a couple of points of tailwind or offset next year?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Duane. It\u2019s Steve here. Hope you\u2019re well. I suppose when we think about 2019, we are approaching 2019 with a cautious beyond capacity. And as Robin alluded to, we\u2019ve shown that this year and we\u2019ll continue to adjust as required. We do expect to give further color at our Investor Day in October on how 2019 and 2020 will fit into our CASM commitments. But I think you\u2019re right, the two biggest tailwinds that we have. Number one is to stretch across program, which we are making significant progress with and making good strides with that as we\u2019ve talked about this morning. The second one is the fleet restarting on the A320 fleet. As a reminder, we have 130 A320s. We\u2019re going through the restarting effort. We\u2019re happy with the progress we\u2019re making so far both from an economic standpoint and from a customer MPS standpoint. The results have been very good and we\u2019re getting to the point where we\u2019re ready to ramp up the mob line. So, we remain confident that program will continue to ramp and complete by the end of 2020 and that will also be another great tailwind for us along with the Structural Cost program.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thanks. And then, with respect to the PSS system or a few that you mentioned, can you just expand on what you hope to accomplish with that? What functionality do you lack today? What\u2019s the economic opportunity there? Thanks for taking the questions.\nSteve Priest: No. It\u2019s all right, Duane. I think the RFP is ready to cover a number of license. Number one, as we\u2019ve gone through the Structure Cost program, we are very, very keen to test the market, go through an RFP process to make sure that we\u2019re getting best-in-class economics as the supply Structural Cost program. Secondly, as we think about customer self-service and customer flow, again to drive efficiencies and customer satisfaction, we need to again think about what\u2019s the best-in-class systems to support that. And then, thirdly, thinking about the right systems to support our revenue and service opportunities and also with regards to making the lives of our crew members easier when they\u2019re supporting our customers going forward. So it\u2019s a holistic approach to make sure that the end of this process, we have best-in-class economics, best-in-class systems and the flexibility with these platforms to grow expeditiously and efficiently as the changing economic and external environment changes so we can drive it forward. So, we\u2019re very excited to be going through this process and as we reach the latter stage of that, we\u2019ll obviously give you guys further updates as we go forward.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So, Steve, I just wanted to reconcile that zero to 1% CAGR you have on the CASM outlook through 2020. If I\u2019m not mistaken, I think, that it excludes the cost of the A220 transition that you guys highlighted I think a week or two ago? And I think it also excludes an impact from a new pilot deal, right, as well as accelerated depreciation in the E190s. So, I don\u2019t mean this to be a point of question, but I guess, when we look back two years from now, are we going to be looking at a 2020 CAGR and CASM that\u2019s above that range because of these itemswe just never really see costs come out of the network.\nSteve Priest: So, great question, Brandon. Let me just give some real clarity on this. The zero to 1 CAGR covers the 2018 to 2020 period with a 2017 base. That excludes the fleet deal but includes on ALPA deal. So when we talked earlier about tailwinds and headwinds, we obviously got the tailwind associated with Structural Cost Program, we got the restyling of the A320s, but we\u2019ve got headwinds of the ALPA deal. That is all included in the zero to 1 CAGR. The fleets deal, the E190 as we\u2019ve been talking about for the last 18 months, we\u2019ve explicitly excluded from zero to 1. Now, in terms of what the impact is of that are, number one, we -- as we reported in our earnings today, took an impairment on the E190s and so the accelerated depreciation associated with the E190 is pretty de minimis and we are not changing the guide in anyway associated with that. The cash transition costs associated with bringing the A320s into the fleet, we talked about on our fleets update call two weeks ago which was close to about 25 basis points. So when you look at all of the economics and you look at our commitments, the only thing that is explicitly excluded from the zero to 1 guide is the 25 basis points associated with the cash cost for the A320 transition. Hopefully, Brandon that gives you some clarity with regards to your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: It definitely does. And then on the maintenance side because you called out the existing fleet the A320 engine contract as being pretty sizeable headwind in the last couple of years. And when we benchmark, your maintenance cost consulting carriers that appears to be such, but it does also seem to be taking time to get a new contract in place. Can you just speak to because, I mean, is it more difficult to get the savings you initially expected or should we still be thinking that\u2019s probably the largest driver of cost savings the next few years?\nSteve Priest: I think I want to make sure that the whole investment community understands is that we are resetting the cost structure for JetBlue and the margin assumptions for JetBlue in the medium to long-term. These are significant negotiations and significant deals that we are doing with business partners. So if you think about the work we have done over the last six months with regards to looking at the NEO engine deals for that 85 NEO aircraft, we thought very long and hard about the E190 replacement and thought how that implication played into that. We\u2019ve also looked to the LLP cost associated with the existing E190 fleet and making sure that we play that into the mix as well to make sure that we got the very best deals for JetBlue and also make the best deals for our owners. The v2500 engine deal is just another pillar of the tech ops initiatives that we\u2019re working through. And again, I can\u2019t reiterate just how strategic this is and how much work is going into this. So we are being very, very measured and very thoughtful about how we work through these initiatives and how they are linked and how they impact each other. And so, we will absolutely not rush one individual deal to the detriment of the overall Structural Cost program or the long-term cost savings trajectory for JetBlue. So, hopefully, that gives you some context about how we\u2019re thinking about sequencing and how disciplined we are about the negotiations in the approach to these very important items.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Hey. Thank you, guys. Good morning.\nRobin Hayes: Good morning, Hunter.\nHunter Keay: Hey. So the capacity cuts you guys announced for this year, were these reductions to stuff that was in the prior year schedule or are they just contemplated as that you\u2019re scrapping -- I\u2019m asking that in the context of your fuel gallon consumption for 2018 actually going up from a few months ago despite the lower capacity. I\u2019m trying to reconcile all this stuff. Thank you.\nMarty St. George: Hey, Hunter. It\u2019s Marty. Thanks for the question. It was especially where the cuts are going to be. It\u2019s going to be very biased towards off-peak flying on either multi-frequency markets. It\u2019s -- I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s any sort of pattern as far as whether it\u2019s new routes or old routes. I would call this normal course of business as we go through capacity adjustment.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And as it relates to the gallon consumption, was that just sort of like a miss forecast or something or is there -- I mean more idling? I mean like how are you -- how does that factor in?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Hunter. All good with you [ph]. It\u2019s Steve here. Just to give you some perspective, we start overlapping the ATC and the hurricanes of last year. And specifically with regards to the economics around the fuel burn, I\u2019ll get Dave to follow you with some specific details but you should think about the fact that we\u2019re lapping those two specific items from last year.\nRobin Hayes: Hey, Hunter.\nHunter Keay: Okay.\nRobin Hayes: Can I dive in for a second, Hunter?\nHunter Keay: Yeah. Sure.\nRobin Hayes: If your question is, are we cutting capacities that\u2019s already loaded? Is that what you meant?\nHunter Keay: Yeah.\nRobin Hayes: I\u2019m listening, okay.\nHunter Keay: Yeah.\nRobin Hayes: Okay. Everything we are cutting is -- what we\u2019re cutting is already loaded, yeah. So I\u2019ve\u2026\nHunter Keay: Got it.\nRobin Hayes: So, I don\u2019t think you fully understood. But yeah I want to clarify that.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Yeah. I\u2019m sorry. I can be long-winded. That\u2019s perfect. Thanks. And then, Robin, how you think about M&A either through the lens of a sale or an acquisition and how does the long-term CASM/CAGR target factor into your view on any deal making? Thanks.\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Hunter. I appreciate the question. I mean, we are 100% focused on our organic plan. As Steve said, we are about not just re-setting the cost structure of JetBlue over the next three years but setting it for the next decade. The fleet deal is an extremely important part of that. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re setting up and running this company. We believe that that drives a part to superior margin and shareholder returns that will be very, very rewarding and so we are focused on that and we\u2019re not distracted by anything else.\nHunter Keay: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the Jack Atkins from Stephens. Your line is open.\nJack Atkins: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. So, Marty, just going back to an earlier question on some of the ancillary revenue initiatives that you guys plan to rollout over the next few months. Could you just expand on that for a moment because I didn\u2019t sort of get a clear picture on what exactly you all plan to sort of move forward with on the ancillary side that maybe we\u2019re not currently aware of today. Just some more color on that particular part of the revenue story would be helpful.\nMarty St. George: Hi, Jack. Thanks for the question. Obviously, anything with respect to changes in pricing over the future is really not something I can get into detail about. I want to sort of bring it back to the higher level which is to the extent that we saw a shortage and ancillary tied to the vacation platform cutover. That\u2019s obviously something we want to find a way to make up in other places, but I really can\u2019t get any more detail about what we should see going forward until we announce.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Okay. And then, I guess, Marty, this goes for you as well. When you think about the average fuel cost per gallon in the second quarter and look at that on a two-year stack basis, I believe it\u2019s up 59% versus 2016 levels. How much of that rise in fuel prices you guys have been able to recover so far through higher fares? And just sort of a follow up to that, what do you think is really holding the industry back from really raising fares in a more rapid pace to really offset these fuel prices that we\u2019ve been seeing moving up in the last couple of years?\nMarty St. George: Hi. Well, two good questions. I mean, first of all, with respect to the recapture of the current fuel increase, actually don\u2019t have it over two years. I would say over the last this most recent one where we\u2019re well under 50% as far as our recapture. And frankly, that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking some of the actions we talked about on this call with respect to ancillary changes and capacity cuts. To ladder up to your bigger question, which is about the industry and how the industry will get there, that\u2019s much bigger than mine. All I can control is what JetBlue does. And we\u2019ve -- as I\u2019ve said on these calls many times, we do our own thing. The right thing for us to do was to make these adjustments including the capacity cuts in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s the path we\u2019re following going forward. We take our commitments on margin very, very seriously and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken the actions that we talked about today.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nKevin Crissey: Good morning, everybody.\nRobin Hayes: Good morning, Crissey.\nKevin Crissey: Thanks. On 2019, can you talk about what capacity growth would come solely from the cabin restyling assuming you kept on the current pace obviously, you have some flexibility there, but just trying to understand what your base growth rate would be just simply from the additional seats?\nSteve Priest: Hi, Kevin. It\u2019s Steve here. I just said to the earlier question, we expect to give further color sort of Investor Day in October. If you look back our Investor Day in 2016, we talked about the ramp of the restarting program. So in the interim, I\u2019d refer you to those materials, but we will be giving more color as we get into the Investor Day about some of those component parts and how the ramp increases.\nKevin Crissey: Okay. Thanks. And I don\u2019t really want to do this -- seeing as there\u2019s been pressure on the call. But going back to CASM ex, what I\u2019m struggling with and I think a lot of investors are looking at JetBlue and thing, if they had to put better a CASM story, they\u2019re really good at RASM, this would be quite easy for the long side. They have concerns on the CASM ex. When I look at it, I say, some of it has to do in my view on kind of back loading some of the maintenance expense and some of the aircraft. What I struggle with though is that I don\u2019t understand why there weren\u2019t better CASM ex years in the early days. So maybe you could provide broad or maybe it\u2019s Rob who could provide long-term view on CASM ex and why it wasn\u2019t really good early. I get why there\u2019s been pressure on the maintenance particularly the tech ops lines in recent years. We want to get a sense for what other areas does JetBlue have CASM ex challenges?\nRobin Hayes: Thanks, Kevin. I\u2019ll jump on that one and maybe you have your own thoughts as well having worked here in the past. But we are very focused -- we\u2019re very focused on the future. We are doing a number of things. I mean the support review we did last week had an impact on a significant number of people who\u2019d been over here a long time. These things are never easy, but I think it shows our absolute commitment to changing the way that we think about costs, changing the way that our owners think about costs. We want to be an airline that becomes very reliable and very consistent in delivering year-after-year strong unit cost performance and we know we have done that in the past and we are going about fixing it. Now as you will notice now when you benchmark us, the maintenance cost is an area where we significantly underperformed, not that there are other areas of opportunity and Steve highlighted some of those and what we\u2019re doing about it. But maintenance is an area where we have had some big gaps. These are long-term complex contracts that you have to work through. We\u2019ve been knocking them over one at a time. Steve talked about the update to the E190 fleet tax in the call earlier. We talked about the NEO engine there which really kicks in for the most part post-2020. But again it\u2019s going to be a good guide we look beyond 2020. Now, we are focused on the v2500 and we continue to do that and I think also taking advantage as we grow of our increased leverage and taking advantage of our balance sheet strength as we grow, things that we didn\u2019t necessarily had in the earlier years.\nKevin Crissey: Okay. That\u2019s fair. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Marty, just one question here. Just trying to understand your 3Q revenue guide a little bit more, I guess, if I take out the one point impact from the travel platform in 3Q, your core is still up around 2.5% at the midpoint which is basically unchanged from your core 2Q performance. So if CASM is getting better, your schedule capacity is not that different to 2Q to 3Q, why is core RASM not better? Does it have to do with maybe some Jewish holiday shift in September, or is it really just conservatism at this point in time? Thanks.\nMarty St. George: Hi. Hey. Thanks, Andrew. And yeah, we did -- I did call up a couple of other pieces. Start with, we\u2019re lapping hurricane from last year which was two-tenths of a point, good guidance. We also -- we talked about Haiti. Yom Kippur, that\u2019s at least a tenths of a point guide for us so there\u2019s not a half point in there right off the bat. So, I do see sequential improvement when you strip on all those things. Obviously, we\u2019d like to be better, and frankly, that\u2019s why we\u2019re coming for the initiatives that we just talked about earlier in the call.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks, Operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you so much for squishing me in here. Just a couple of questions. One, can you say the improvement you\u2019ve seen in your Net Promoter Score, I think Steve or Marty referred to it earlier in the presentation, I\u2019m just wondering if you can just mentioned the improvement. Two, you talked about air traffic control delays last year and we\u2019re just coming up on that, now this summer. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve seen improvement there and if you\u2019re talked to the FAA and getting ready heading into August. And then, finally, I think you guys invested in ClimaCell technologies and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s going to help you with respect to weather and how that adjust your cost structure, if at all. Okay. That\u2019s it. Thank you.\nJoanna Geraghty: Great. Hi. Thanks, Helane. This is Joanna. I\u2019ll take that one. So, first, in terms of the Net Promoter Score increase, I think you\u2019re referring to the impact of the A320 restyling and what that\u2019s having on our Net Promoter Score numbers. We\u2019re seeing in excess of 5-point improvement in NPS with regard to the customer experience and the restyle cabins. So, that\u2019s all positive news and trending in the right direction. With regard to ATC delays and operational performance, obviously, where we fly our network footprint is the most probably challenged one in the industry, given the congestion and delays in the New York and Boston air space. Our focus is on what we can control and I think we\u2019re pleased with the performance that we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the summer. Obviously, we\u2019re focused on running an efficient operation and continuing to make improvements. We have made a number of tactical and focused investments to improve our performance, being mindful of our cost commitments and keeping an eye on margin. I think Robin mentioned nearly 10-point improvement in A14. So, trending in the right direction but we still have half a summer ahead of us and if you are living in New York this week, you will see the volatility weather outside for the next few days. And with regard to your last question, ClimaCell, yes, we are an investor in ClimaCell. We are very excited about the kind of real-time weather data that ClimaCell can bring to the table and we are currently working with them on a number of prototypes. But it\u2019s a little too early to tell where this could all go.\nHelane Becker: Great. Thanks, Joanna.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in, Dave. Marty, correct me if I missed this, but the 1 point RASM headwind in third quarter, should we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter or do some of these initiatives that you\u2019re rolling out offset that?\nMarty St. George: Hey, Joe. Thanks for asking. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we\u2019re not guiding fourth quarter yet but I will say that all the initiatives that we talked about whether it\u2019s capacity cuts, ancillary changes, I think it\u2019s all part of the full tapestry of what we want to do to make sure we make our marketing commitment. So we\u2019ll have more to say about fourth quarter as we get closer in, but I\u2019ll just sort of ladder up and say, at a high level, we take the commitment very seriously o margin and this is all part of making sure we accomplish that.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay.\nMarty St. George: I will say, just to be clear on vacation. I would say, in the last week or two weeks, we are seeing recovery as our team in IT and our business partner have address a lot of the issues. So it\u2019s absolutely on the right path.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Okay. And then Marty I think you mentioned the -- I think you described the intracal market as unnecessarily or unusually soft. Can you just provide your perspective on why that is?\nMarty St. George: I could speak for JetBlue, and frankly, we had great aspirations for what we wanted to do in Long Beach. It did include international expansion. And from our perspective, the rejection of FIS facility at the airport was really the -- a deciding factor for our decision in Long Beach. We had put capacity into the intra-west market and it is a very tough yield environment. And frankly, sort of the number five player just was not really a place for us. I wish things had worked out with the airport for what we have originally laid out. We thought it was great for the citizens of the Basin to get lower fares into Mexico but unfortunately it didn\u2019t work out. So we just to move on.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nDavid Fintzen: That concludes our second quarter 2018 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: And again that will conclude today\u2019s conference.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Robin Hayes, JetBlue's President and CEO.\nRobin Hayes: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we reported our results for the first quarter of 2018. I'll start with our thank you to our nearly 22,000 crew members who continue to take care of our customers and produce solid financial results for our owners. You have once again done an exceptional job safely managing through the many most storms that hit in the Northeast during the first quarter and into early April. We've all been keeping the family and friends of Jennifer Riordan in our thoughts and prayers. And our hearts go out to our colleagues and friends at Southwest Airlines. Southwest is a great airline. And like ours, their amazing team wakes up every day committed to the safety of their customers and of each other. As an industry, U.S. airlines have made immense strides in safety over the last decades, and this will continue to be our primary focus. Now starting on Slide 4 of our presentation. This morning, we reported first quarter operating income of $128 million, a pretax margin of 6.3% and earnings per share of $0.27. We are making good progress on our many building blocks. These are commercial and cost initiatives that we believe will take us from about \u2013 from above average industry margins today to our goal of superior goal of superior margins and drive value for our owners. One of the highlights of the first quarter was our strong RASM performance, driven by the combination of revenue management initiatives, ongoing ancillary growth and strong demand in our network. We have cost benefited from an earlier holiday shift this year and that benefit were reversed in the second quarter. Looking at our first quarter performance together with our second quarter RASM guidance. We believe the first half of 2017 demonstrates our ability to increase unit revenue as we grow. Our unit cost performance was impacted by a very eventful winter season, which resulted in more weather-related cancels and plans. Despite losing approximately 1% of our capacity due to lower completion factor, we managed our cost with discipline and ended the quarter at the midpoint of our guidance. We continue to make good progress in our \u2013 growing our relevance. Our New York franchise remains exceptional strong, and we're committed to capitalize on our leadership position in Boston and Fort Lauderdale. We also keep building our margin accretive transcon market, and we will play on our strength as a preferred airline for coast-to-coast travel with new to transcon flying from the LA Basin to be announced soon. Our Latin and Caribbean region exceeded our expectations driven by both leisure and visiting friends and relatives of \u2013 customers. In Puerto Rico, we continue to see demand recovering as expected, and we anticipate our capacity, measured by the number of departures, to reach pre-hurricane levels starting this summer. Our response in Puerto Rico also speaks to our governance of environmental and social risk and business continuity. This is an important part of our strategy to managed external pressures such as natural disasters. Yesterday, we released our second environmental and social governance report, which introduces our climate scenario planning. We remain focused on growing ancillary revenue both through existing and new capital wise efforts. We\u2019re executing a companywide digital transformation strategy to support ancillary growth opportunities and lower distribution costs. In 2018, we expect to keep enhancing our digital platform as well as providing new tools for our customers contact centers. In recent months, we've added web and mobile service capabilities in addition to airport lobby investments that are designed to improve the experience for our customers. We anticipate rolling our further changes to our website throughout the year that will better merchandise our current Travel Products. We believe our investments in self-service tools and innovative technology will help us improve our customer service, empower our crew members and reduce costs. We are very excited to announce that we have appointed Andres Barry the President of our new subsidiary, JetBlue Travel Products, which includes our vacation business. This is an important long-term, capital-light effort to expand the JetBlue brand more broadly into the travel and hospitality sector. We expect Andres to play a critical role in driving innovation and capitalizing the unpacked potential of this non-air ancillary and Travel Products business. Innovation is in our DNA. And as we build our platform for future growth, we are embracing hospitality as part of the travel experience for our customers. For example, we are pioneered in trialing advanced biometrics technology, which we biometrics technology, which we believe will improve the airport experience and is in part of an industry effort to enhance security. In addition, as this technology space evolve around us, we are investing in the future by our JetBlue tech ventures subsidiary. We continue to make progress in our structural cost program in the first quarter as part of our journey to superior margins. We are delighted to sign a multiengine agreement with Pratt & Whitney for the purchase of maintenance of Neo engines for our existing aircraft order book. Over time, this agreement will bring the latest engine technology to a sizable portion of our future fleet, contribute to our ongoing structural cost efforts beyond 2020 and lower our fuel consumption. This milestone is yet another example of the collaboration and maturity of the teams to JetBlue working together to achieve our common goals. Steve will provide added details in a moment. I'd like to thank again our crew members for bringing our mission to life, empowering a successful first quarter despite the weather challenges. We will keep working to innovate as we put in place of the building blocks that we believe will increase profitability and create long-term shareholder value. Marty, over to you.\nMarty St. George : Thank you Robin. I'll start with our capacity outlook on Slide 6. We continue to target mid- to high single-digit capacity growth over the next few years and expect to be within that range again in 2018. Our plan schedule growth for the year remains between 6% and 6.5%. From a modeling point of view, we expect 2018 flown ASM growth to be higher, between 6.5% and 8.5%. Recall that as we move through 2018, we will lapse the lower completion factor that resulted from ATC challenges and the hurricane in the second half of 2017. In the first quarter, winter storms reduced loan capacity growth by just over one point versus our prior guidance and resulted in capacity growth below the low end of our initial guidance. For the second quarter, we expect to grow capacity between 5% and 7% year-over-year. New markets, all those less than one year's old are just 2% available seat miles. Our growth remains targeted at Boston and Fort Lauderdale and skew is towards adding frequencies on existing routes. We believe our ongoing network investments in these focus cities continue to build our relevance for our leisure and business customers, underpinning solid RASM growth and supporting our margin commitments . Our summer capacity plan is driven by up gauging markets through the addition of 200-seat all core A321s. The 200-seat aircraft has allowed us to expand margins and keep fares low in New York leisure markets. And we expect to do the same in Boston. New A321 deliveries have allowed us to build margins in both the Mint and all-core configuration. Beyond our upgauging in Boston, we continue to build towards our goal of 200 flights a day. The city has proven to be a perfect fit for our low cost point-to-point model. In early May, we'll add Minneapolis service as we aim to further grow our relevance and utility for our business customers. In Fort Lauderdale, we have added new destination in frequencies to existing markets as we work towards our goal of 140 flights a day. First quarter RASM outperformed the system by over six points, the fourth consecutive quarter of RASM outperformance. We continue to see the maturation of past growth and the benefits of increasing network relevance in the South Florida market. Calendar placement of holiday clearly helped, but based on forward bookings, we expect this trend of RASM outperformance to continue. Mint markets in Fort Lauderdale are also performing extremely well and an example of how we have bought a differentiated low cost model to South Florida. Our ability to grow our relevance in Boston and Fort Lauderdale depends on having the infrastructure in place to support this growth. To that end, we recently executed an agreement with Massport that will bring our total number of gates uploading to 30 by 2021. JetBlue supports Massport plans to modernize Logan Airport, to improve customer experience and add needed capacity in a cost-effective way. In the first quarter, we also executed an agreement with the Broad County aviation department that will add five gates in Fort Lauderdale. This is the first in a series of anticipated gate additions that will enable us to approach 145 flights a day. We are excited to continue working with the airport authority on our plans to construct additional gates. In addition to the renovations in Terminal 3 to improve the customer experience. Our transcon franchise continues to perform well both in Mint and non-Mint markets. Our most mature Mint routes again saw RASM outperformance system in the first quarter. Newly converted Mint markets such as New York to Seattle are ramping up as expected. We anticipate our Mint aircraft to contribute 20% of our total ASM to the second quarter and 20% for the year. Finally, our Latin and Caribbean region, which includes Puerto Rico, was the brightest spot in our network during the first quarter. As Robin mentioned, this region have the highest year-over-year RASM growth across our network during the quarter, and Puerto Rico is recovering as expected. We are pleased that the Department of Transportation recently awarded JetBlue additional Havana flying, which we can service from Boston and added frequencies to Fort Lauderdale. These routes add to our strong and growing franchise in Cuba and Caribbean.  Turning to Slide 7 and the revenue outlook. First quarter RASM growth exceeded our expectations at 6.1%, above our guidance range from early March. This result included a net two point benefit from calendar replacement and a one point positive impact from weather-related lower completion factor, as most name don\u2019t occurred during off-peak days of the week. Since the end of 2017, demand has strengthened across our network, and we saw further closing strength to end the quarter. Closing pricing has been particularly strong in peak travel period particularly in spring break weeks. Demand and pricing in off-peak weeks are solid, although not showing the same strength as the peak periods. Looking into the second quarter of 2018, we expect year-over-year RASM to range between minus 3% and flat. This includes 2.5 points of negative impact from holiday travel shifting into the first quarter as well as lapping a 1.25 point benefit that occurred in second quarter 2017 from completion factor and co-brand incentive payments. We expect demand and closing pricing to remain strong. However, the second quarter this year will have more of a trough period particularly in May. We're optimistic that as we approach June and the early summer peak, pricing strength will again exceed expectation similar to what we saw during the recent spring break weeks. We think that looking at first half RASM is more helpful in understanding current demand trends. Slide 8 shows our RASM growth by half with first half 2018 trends continuing to show strength on a half-by-half basis. We are pleased with our RASM evolution since 2016. Our RASM performance over the past couple of years has been driven by our focus on maximizing margin, successfully implementing revenue initiatives and actively addressing capacity to manage change in demand trends and fluctuating oil prices. The improving trends demonstrate we are executing and delivering on our revenue strategies that we laid out in our 2014 Investor Day. We introduced Mint in our transcon markets and further booked our relevance to corporate customers by adding key destinations from Boston. We are thrilled that Mint was awarded the Best Business Class in North America by TripAdvisor, which speaks highly of our products and hospitality service in key transcon rates. We moved our co-brand credit card from American Express to Barclays, and our portfolio of customers using our co-branded cards more than doubled in size less than two years, exceeding our initial expectations. More recently, in 2017, we refined our fare options, driving extraordinary growth at our ancillary revenues per customer. As Robin mentioned, we are currently enhancing our website to optimize our digital distribution platform. We expect the growth rate of employees per customer to be more typical this year as we got lapping some initiatives implemented last year. We remain excited about the network and the ancillary revenue opportunities ahead. Before I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to thank our crew members for their hard work. I believe that as we grow, our culture continues to power our strategy and allow us to deliver outstanding hospitality to our customers, while also increasing our margins. Steve, over to you.\nSteve Priest: Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'll start on Slide 10 with some highlights from the first quarter. Revenue was $1.8 billion, up 9.6% year-over-year. Pretax margin was 6.3%, down 1.3 percentage points from the first quarter of last year, essentially due to higher fuel prices. EPS is $0.27 to diluted share. This quarter, our solid revenue performance and cost management efforts were partially offset by increasing fuel prices. Despite our fuel driven margin compression, a lower tax rate and our balance approach to capital allocation contributed to EPS growth. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 20%, lower than expected due to the refinement of the estimates related to last year's tax reform. We continue to expect that our effective tax rate to range between 24% and 26%. Moving to Slide 11 in unit costs. Our first quarter CASM Ex-Fuel increased 3.1% year-over-year, and despite the operational pressures from the eventful winter season, we were in line with the midpoint of our quarter's guidance. We continue to focus on managing our costs and delivered against our initial commitments. For the second quarter of 2018, we expect that CASM Ex-Fuel to range between 2% and 4%, driven by timing of maintenance expenses and previously expected inflationary pressures from business partners. Given our ongoing cost reduction efforts from progress in our structural cost initiatives, we continue to track towards our negative 1% to positive 1% CASM Ex-Fuel guidance for the full year. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to expect CASM Ex-Fuel growth to reflect down during the second half of the year as you make further progress in our structural cost program. This is the result of maintenance, sourcing, airports and distribution initiatives put in place over the last 16 months. Our CASM Ex-Fuel growth in the first half is expected to be between 2% and 4%, above our prior guidance due to lower completion factor in the first quarter. For the second half, we expect CASM Ex-Fuel to decline in the range of negative 4% to negative 2%. As a reminder, the 2017 comparison includes higher unit costs due to hurricanes and the one-time bonus we paid to our crew members at the year-end as a result of tax reform. Thus, we anticipate the underlying CASM Ex-Fuel growth for 2018 to flow to a range between minus 0.5% and 1.5% for the second half of this year. Our progress in structural cost gives us confidence that we will achieve our CASM Ex-Fuel commitments in the second half coming and from 2018 through 2020. We expect this year's inflection and our cost trends to put us on a path to unit cost declines in the years to come. Moving to Slide 13 on an update on our structural cost program. We're delighted that at the end of March, we closed a 15-year deal with our business partner, Pratt & Whitney, for the purchase of maintenance of NEO engines. The deal covers engines and spares for the 45 aircraft on order, which didn't have a prior selection. It also advises contractual terms and engines for the 40 aircraft already under contract. Our negotiations include the full cost of engines, parts and ongoing maintenance. This achievement is the result of hard work across JetBlue teams for many, many months. A minor portion of the expected savings from this agreement is included in our three-year program. Most of the savings will extend well beyond 2020 as we take delivery of our first 30 NEO aircraft in 2019 and an additional 13 during 2020. This deal is, of course, just one part of the broader efforts in tech ops, and our work from the V2500 engine RFP continues. We are currently reviewing responses and making progress towards selecting the right business partner. Our efforts pillar is another area where we made steady progress this quarter. We finished deploying self-service technologies in four additional lobbies and are on track to have 24 completed by the year-end. These investments will further improve crew member productivity and allow us to focus on hospitality. We will provide our regular half-year update on the stretch of cost program in July. We continue to expect that this three-year effort will result in run rate savings of between $250 million and $300 million by 2020. Turning to fleet on Slide 14. This quarter, we purchased two additional A321 through cash for a total fleet of 245 aircraft. We expect to increase our total fleet to 253 by the year-end. Our A320 cabin restarting program is an important milestone in April with a certification and return to service for the first aircraft, and the second one is scheduled to enter modifications shortly. The restart program is a key contributor to our unit cost goals, and we anticipate that it will allow us to grow our capacity and the capital efficient in customer-focused manner. We've also made good progress of our fleet review, including evaluation of options for existing E190 fleet and the A321 LR. We have no news to share today, but we remain focused on achieving the best outcome for our crew members, customers and owners. Our CapEx guidance for 2018 remains between $900 million and $1.1 billion composed of up to $900 million on aircraft and the remainder in non-aircraft spent. Turning to Slide 15. One of the guiding principles for our capital allocation is to maintain our strong balance sheet, targeting investment grade financial metrics and appropriate liquidity. We believe that strong balance sheets allows us to be flexible to the cycle, allocate capital to best and highest use and underpin long-term value creation. Over the last year, we targeted our capital deployment growing our fleet, reinvesting in high incremental return projects such as Cabin Restyling as well as returning cash to our owners. We ended the first quarter with adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of 28% and cash and investments of approximately 11% for trailing 12 months of revenue. During the first quarter, we repaid $59 million in debt and bought out one additional lease aircraft. In 2018, we expect to raise debt to maintain an optimal liquidity and capital structure. We also anticipate that we will continue to return excess capital to our owners opportunistically. This quarter, we executed $125 million in share repurchases with $625 million remaining from the total amount authorized by the board. I'll close with one more thank you to all of our crew members for their hard work and their nonstop support to the operation during an eventful winter. We are one team and are making great progress in our commitment to our owners. We are firmly committed to delivering the JetBlue experience to our customers and ensuring that our commercial strategy, our cost reduction efforts and our long-term investments will result in superior margins. We will now take your questions.\nDavid Fintzen: Thanks, everyone. Karina, we're now ready for the question-and-answer session with the analysts. Please go ahead with the instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. I was wondering if I could ask a question on the fleet side. I know you've kind of taken a bit longer to do the E190 evaluation and understand that the C Series. But I was kind of wondering from a JetBlue model perspective, it this kind of a wholly-owned or third-party regional might be a solution that gives you a flexibility to kind of address those business markets and then kind of switch kind of main operations to kind of a single fleet size? I was wondering if there is JetBlue model that might not work.\nSteve Priest: Savi, I'll pick up of the initial view just in terms of giving you some initial comments on the fleet review, and then I'll pass it over to Robin for his perspective on the regional side of things. We are very pleased with the progress we're continuing to make on the fleet evaluation. As we said previously, we're not going to rush to any conclusion in this changing and evolving OEM landscape. We've completed a hell of a lot great work and we made great progress. And we'll obviously make any fleet decision with a view of continuing to maximize shareholder value and driving towards superior margins. The one thing I would add, and I know I've said this before, is the 100-fleet platform and particularly as it stands at this point in time that you're to place that role, really displays an important role in our Boston network strategy where our margins continue to be very close to the A320s. But that's an overall perspective about the fleet review. But I'll hand it over to Robin to see if he's got any perspective on the other side of the question.\nRobin Hayes: Good morning, Savi. It's Robin, and thank you for the question. Look, as we think about this and we're thinking about this very much in terms of JetBlue, I think the announcement we made yesterday with JetSuite, for example, JetSuiteX in terms of our kind of Codesharing and building our region to sort of some of the higher margin into West, into California market, I think shows that we look at the space very differently. And we look for ways to access it in a way maybe to how other airlines do it. But in terms of airplanes like the 190 and the 190 replacement, those very much would be JetBlue airplane.\nSavi Syth: And if I may follow-up, Robin, thanks for bringing the JetSuite, just kind of curious how big the opportunity that is. It seems somewhat small right now but maybe might long taking a longer-term JetBlue plan?\nRobin Hayes: Yes, thanks. We're very excited about the opportunity. You're right, it's small now, so is JetBlue and we started nearly 20 years ago. And we, obviously, with our partners, Qatar Airways, a significant amount of investment in that business to allow it to grow. And again, when we think about how we can compete and how we can compete profitably, then how do we kind of access that sort of semiprivate highly value market. How do we take advantage of new opportunities? And so we very much see JetSuite in that light, and it's more today, but we believe it's a great product. It's a great operation. It will grow and that will benefit both our customers and, ultimately, our shareholders.\nSavi Syth: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hi, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. Steve, can you remind us what the long-term CASM goal as we get out of 2019 and 2020 and whether or not you guys factored in the pilot deal for that goal.\nSteve Priest: Good morning, Brandon and thanks for the question. We've talked about in terms of the strategy going forward. It's a zero to one CASM CAGR over the 2018 to 2020 period. So 2018, 2019, 2020. And it does indeed include a pilot deal.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. And just a point of clarification, the back half of this year, though, you're not assuming any new labor contracts, right?\nSteve Priest: We haven't made any specific comments or predictions around the specific pilot deal. The guide that we've given excludes any alpha deal, and we continue to negotiate good safety to alpha at the table, and I'm looking forward to moving forward with those contracts in due course.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, appreciate that. And then just lastly. So as you look at that cost outlook in the back half of the year and into 2019, what was \u2013 is the V2500 engine contract the biggest driver of optimism that cost can be down? Or is it a combination of the A320 densification project as well? Can you just give us some idea of magnitude in this?\nSteve Priest: Yes, Brandon, there's no silver bullet here. I think what I'm most pleased about is the fact that we've got engaged across all four pillars of the structural cost program. As a reminder, the back end of 2016, when we did in the Investor Day, we talked about four pillars: tech ops, corporate, airports and distribution. We are making good progress across all of those four pillars. The largest pillar of the four is in the tech ops space. We have, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, executed the near deal, which I'm extremely happy about. We, obviously, have the V25 RFP we're working through. We are also currently working through the RFP on the heavy maintenance of our airframes as well, in addition to the other pillars. So all of those different initiatives are contributing to the structural cost program. In addition to your point, which is the importance of the restarting program, again, very pleased the first aircraft has gone into the shop, come out ahead of schedule, actually, and in terms of the timing and back into service. So both the structural cost program in alignment with the restyling effort that puts an extra 8% of seats on each and every one of our 130 A320 aircrafts will help us achieve and contribute to our 0 to 1 CASM commitment through 2020.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: You next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: It\u2019s Helane Becker. Sorry, I didn\u2019t changed my name. Thank you for the time guys. A quick question on the maintenance cost. So as we think about the fleet changing this year and when we think about rent, depreciation and maintenance, first quarter rent and maintenance came down. Is that a trend that's going to continue going forward for the rest of this year as we think about that? Should we expect that?\nRobin Hayes: Thanks again, Helane, for the question. I will reflect on the two horse of that. So on the rent side of things, we have been so opportunistic about looking at the best deployments of capital as I have talked about with the balanced capital allocation strategy. And we, obviously, have a number of leased aircraft in the JetBlue fleet. And thinking through the lens of the shareholder returns, we are continuing to take the opportunity to buy some of those leases out. So when you look at the sort of depreciation line versus the aircraft rental line, you'll see sort of a move between those two lines, but that as we've gone forward continue to reduce of the rent side of things. In terms of maintenance cost, there's a whole host, as I mentioned, of initiatives that we're working through with Jeff, Martin, Tony and the rest of the leadership in tech ops, making some great progress as we go forward with that. Again there is no one such as silver bullet. And there \u2013 with regards to Brandon\u2019s question, I have covered off some of the most significant changes, specifically pertaining to quarter two because I am sure this question will come and I want to address it now, is that we did have a movement of some maintenance costs between Q1 and Q2. So about half a point of costs pertaining to maintenance shifted from Q1 to Q2. So that\u2019s why we amended our CASM guidance for Q2 on the call today. But I think of the first half is exactly right way we set it would be three months ago. So that really hopefully gives you an overview about where we are with maintenance and how that pertains the guide that we put out this morning.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s great. That\u2019s very helpful. And then I think you guys had a \u2013 as my follow up question, I think you had an announcement earlier today or maybe late yesterday on the first pilot group coming out of the Orlando base. I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re training facility is. Could you just update us on how that\u2019s going and your expectations for that?\nMarty St. George: Yeah, I will take that, Helane. Thank you for the question and good morning. Now, I mean this is a very innovative program. It\u2019s called our gateway select program. And as we think about the pilot supply challenges into the future, which we believe are real, then we got to make sure that we, like other airlines, can secure that supply. And so this program was put in place really to allow pilots who didn't have an experience to learn to fly at a lower cost than they would before. The first six have got to the point now where they are about to embark on their 1500 hours of flight experience as flight instructors, which is mandated by the FAA on one task completed. We think that it will be about two years. They will be back and ready to resume their career in the wide fleet of JetBlue airplane and we are very, very excited about that and we continue to hire pilots very successfully through this program.\nHelane Becker: Great, thank you. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning everybody. Can you hear me?\nRobin Hayes: Hi, Jamie. How are your phone issues?\nJamie Baker: Just getting better by the day apparently. Hey, Marty, let me start off with you and in nonstop markets where you compete directly against an airline that offers basic economy, are RASM trends behaving any differently than in other markets? I mean, I think the impact of basic economy is fairly evident on the bottom line of the airlines that offer it, which not clear to me is what impact it's having on guys like JetBlue that don\u2019t offer it? Any difference in RASM trends?\nMarty St. George: Yeah, hi, Jamie. Thanks for the question. That\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s something we\u2019re watching very, very closely. And I think it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re really not seeing any significant difference in RASM trends and basic economy market versus non-basic economy markets. I think it\u2019s important to note that we have been competing with ULCCs probably more aggressive than anybody. And we are watching the market extremely closely and obviously this is the place where we\u2019re paying a lot of attention, but we\u2019re really not seeing the trend that you\u2019re asking about.\nJamie Baker: Yeah, okay. I appreciate it. And Rob, I am sensitive to your aversion to your negotiate in public, but I do have a question about the pilot. If you look at recent contracts in an effort to assess where the market is, are there any work rules or efficiencies that you don\u2019t already enjoy for example I think you\u2019re already using a preferential bidding system. So that doesn\u2019t represent an incremental opportunity. I am basically just trying to assess whether the pilot contract is simply a wage exercise or if there is potentially some of sort of flexibility or efficiency that the airline might pick up along the way?\nRobin Hayes: Well, Jamie, first of all, I'm happy you've got your phones back, secondly I am a little bit sad that we don\u2019t get a chance to issue a happy birthday on the call this year. But thirdly, you answered a question that I am not going to negotiate in public. We had the last mediation session in April. You know I think that went well. We made progress. We have another one coming up in May. I think both negotiating teams are working very hard to get this done. It is our first contract. So it does include everything from pay and benefits and workloads and that\u2019s probably as much as I should say on that right now, but thanks for the question.\nJamie Baker: Let me sneak in a third then. You have mentioned LA Basin is the basis for some new routes. Does that imply new routes from existing airports in the Basin or did you use the word basin to imply potentially new airports such as, I don't know, John Wayne?\nRobin Hayes: Well, Jamie, you were listening. I'm very, very impressed. Look, I'm not going to say too much now. I'm actually heading out there tomorrow with a team. I think that it\u2019s important as we think about drive to superior margins that the network is an important part of ours and it\u2019s important that we focus on our strengths and adjusting the hardworking. And so you will be hearing more in that very, very soon.\nJamie Baker: Excellent, and thanks for the kind words. I appreciate it, Robin. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, just a couple here. Hey just a follow up on you know your Codeshare with JetSuiteX. I did see, it looks like that you\u2019re invested some more money into that business. I am curious where that percentage is? How much you have invested? And at this point is it being marked on the balance sheet as an investment or you know accounting for it under the equity method? And is that \u2013 are we going to see that run through your P&L? Anything like color that would be great. Thanks.\nRobin Hayes: I am going to just let the CFO answer that, Michael.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay.\nSteve Priest: Hi, Michael. Good morning. It's covered in non-equity side of things, as you questioned. And we have approximately 10% of shareholding in the business. So they are the two perspectives in terms of the question you asked. \nMichael Linenberg: Oh, Steve, what was the percentage? Did you say 10%?\nSteve Priest: Yes.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, so you\u2019re at 10%. And then back to Robin on JetSuiteX, you have talked about Codesharing with this business and I think that they publicly said that they\u2019re goal is to get to 100 airplanes by 2022. Should we presume that you\u2019re going to be Codesharing with a regional operator with a 100 airplanes by 2022? Or is it you\u2019re going to pick and choose which markets you want to tie up with them?\nRobin Hayes: Yeah, I think a lot of that is sort of in our future and that we\u2019re working through. I think we look at \u2013 we always look at opportunities and when we think about the semiprivate market, the ability to fly between two FBOs and a great product to the competitive fair, we think that that is a market that is \u2013 have a lot of growth potential, and we clearly want to be part of that. And by \u2013 we are very kind of ambitious about where we think that can get to otherwise we would not had made the investment in JetSuite. And we'll just watch the space. I mean, I think we're make taking a measured approach to growth. As they grow, then the growth has to earn its way into the network just like it has to its way into our network. But when you look at the customer experience, when you look at the customer MPS data, when you look at the level of customer satisfaction and repeat purchase, I would say once someone has tried that experience, they really don't want to go back. And so it's exciting for us to be a partner with them.\nMichael Linenberg: Great Robin. If I could just ask a follow-up on the ancillary. You talked a lot about that in your opening remarks, and you just brought on Andres Barry to spearhead that effort. Can you give us a sense of what your ancillary is for passenger today because it's hard to discern from the public docs what that number is and where you want it to go next three years or so?\nRobin Hayes: Yes thanks Michael for the question. In terms of the number per customer, it's about $30.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay.\nRobin Hayes: And when we think about where it can go, I think we've got a track record on revenue initiatives, and so we need to \u2013 part of our journey on superior margins is continuing to find new level so that we can develop. And I think I've been pleased with our ancillary growth over the last several years. We've seen a good CAGR on that project, on that revenue stream of about 20%. But I think we can do better. I think we can do more. And so by creating a subsidiary, putting a leader in charge of it, creating focus around that, I mean, to give you one interesting staff is that we have all these customers flying JetBlue today for the most part. A relatively low percentage of those by a vacation or other product willing to JetBlue. And so \u2013 but one, when they do, they then have a 38% CAGR sort of growth to then come back and by the same location from us. And we've seen that over a sustainable five- or six-year period. So once they purchase, their ability to repurchase is double in terms of that non-air revenue. So we see it is a very long term \u2013 we see it as a way to, if you like, accelerate ancillary revenue growth over time. And potentially also, you're using our brand, leveraging our strong brand into a new ancillary revenue streams that we don't do it today but do it in a very capital-light way. Just to make it clear, we're not buying hotels. We're not doing any sort of capital-intensive work. This is very capital-light investment. \nMichael Linenberg: Great. Thanks Robin. \nOperator: Your next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Hey thank you everybody. Good morning. \nRobin Hayes: Hello, Hunter. \nHunter Keay: How are you doing Robin?\nRobin Hayes: Good, I\u2019m delighted.\nHunter Keay: Good. Hey, so outside of just the seasonality issues, what are some of the similarities and maybe some of the subtle differences that you guys see with transcontinental and transatlantic service?\nMarty St. George: Hey Hunter it\u2019s Marty. Thanks for the question. I mean you certainly mentioned two of them. I think the third one that\u2019s very important is that for some very important transcontinental markets, premium products is extremely important to the revenue stream. Certainly, I think if we did not have the success that we've had with our Mint product, it would be a much more difficult conversation for us to talk about the concepts of transatlantic. There are certainly many months of the year where our high quality premium product is extremely important for success. The second thing I will say is the \u2013 with respect to the difference between the markets, certainly, we're respectful of the fact that there are different competitive environment, but what we like about the transatlantic is something that, I think, the founders of JetBlue liked 20 years ago, which is its market with high spirits and not great service. It's certainly in the premium cabin especially and we think that could be a great opportunity for us, much like it was in the transcontinental markets four years ago.\nHunter Keay: Thanks Marty. And then probably one for your Robin, I know you guys are disappointed with the FAA decision to unionize. But I think curious to know why you think that happened. I mean, your pay was competitive. It seems like your forums will be heard, but 66% yes vote is a decent maturity. I'm kind of curious to know what your opinions as to this sort of what went wrong? Where was the disconnect? Is it a cultural issue? And just why you think they decided that they needed to be organized?\nRobin Hayes: No. Thanks for the question, Hunter. I could have given you the very long version and I and I probably want to do justice to a shortened version. But I did spend quite a bit of time out without in flight crew members with Johanna. So definitely, definitely heard a lot of the concerns that they had. I think, first one, in terms of everything that we agree on whether you voted for union representation or didn\u2019t is that everyone loves this company and believes in our culture and believes in our value of caring. And I think that a lot of it came down to just individual crew members preferring to have a certainty of a contract in terms of what\u2019s in it versus the traditional model which has been sort of an intuitive one over the many years where we\u2019ve adjusted today and we changed workloads. And I think that was just some nervousness about not having that documented, not having something that you can rely on. But I did meet a single in flight crew member on the campaign trail who wasn\u2019t amazingly committed to this company didn\u2019t share in the importance of our culture as one of our main competitive levers.\nHunter Keay: Thanks, Robin.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kevin Crissey with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nKevin Crissey: Forgive me if I missed it. Have you announced a replacement on the board for Dave Checketts yet?\nRobin Hayes: Hi, Kevin, no, you haven\u2019t missed it. It\u2019s Robin, by the way. Good morning. How are you?\nKevin Crissey: Good morning.\nRobin Hayes: No, super appreciative for everything Dave has done over the years. I mean, I personally benefited from a lot of counsel from him, and we continue to look at the composition of the board with the eye of good governance and also driving long-term shareholder value.\nKevin Crissey: Okay. And maybe you could \u2013 maybe this is for Marty. Marty, if we think about Boston and the competition there and maybe you could talk about the difference that you\u2019re seeing in the leisure market versus the business market. I know you had great deal of success growing the business markets there. But if maybe you could talk about recent trends or maybe you can\u2019t.\nMarty St. George: Hi, Kevin. Thank you. No, we certainly can. We\u2019re very confident with the position in Boston. We\u2019re the largest airline up there. Again, as we\u2019ve said multiple times, we have a business model that is built for a low-cost point-to-point services versus the overwhelming majority of our competitors really in the country who have really fundamentally built on hub and spoke. We have that most in our sub-destination. We absolutely have the best product and brand than any airlines. We actually provide our own services versus one of other competitors, actually most of our competitors who have a good amount of outsourced regional flying. With respect to our results that we\u2019re doing business in leisure, our business strength is really, really strong up there. We have seen a lot of capacity come under leisure. I think if there\u2019s any where we\u2019ve seen RASM go down it\u2019s been a leisure. But we\u2019ve been competing in the leisure market from the very first day as JetBlue. This is not very new to us, and we\u2019re very confident of our success of there.\nKevin Crissey: Terrific. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. Good morning. I may have missed it, but did you give an update on your plan and when you need to make that fleet decision if you made that fleet decision.\nSteve Priest: Hello, Duane Steve here. How you are? You didn\u2019t miss anything, Duane. We didn\u2019t give a specific update in the prepared comments. We haven\u2019t made any announcements in terms of our requirements if we choose to convert an existing A321 Neo to an A321 Neo-LR. We have to give Airbus approximately two years notice of doing that. One of the way it\u2019s the conversion not incremental aircraft. And I also want to reiterate to the Dallas community that the reason we would do this is aligned to the Boston and New York strategy where we see Mint to be phenomenally successful. Marty commented earlier about higher fares, lower service, and we see an opportunity there. But it\u2019s really around making sure that we continue to penetrate the Boston and New York business markets where we\u2019ve done a nice job over the previous years of doing that. So that\u2019s where we are. And as soon as we have anything to announce, by the way, then we\u2019ll obviously let you guys know.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So there's sort of an unlimited views of that. It could be two years from now that you tell us or next week?\nSteve Priest: Yes, I mean, there is no sort of specific timing. It's just evolving three-year notice in terms of when we go and when we do that. So yes, it's not a specific point in time.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then on the fleet review and perhaps kicking tires on other fleet types in a smaller jet category, can you just talk generally about sort of the upper limit on CapEx for JetBlue or maybe the plans relative to the billion this year, how we should be thinking about that on the 2019 or 2020 basis? Thanks for taking the questions.\nSteve Priest: Not at all, not at all. So we laid out our overall CapEx guide as a $1.1 billion average from 2017 through 2020. That is the guide that we continue to go forward with. We haven't made any specific decisions with regards to the E190 whether we will continue to be taking the fleet or whether we replace it with something else. And so that $1.1 billion pertains to our existing order book and a continued investment in non-fleet CapEx to help us drive the structural cost program and capital-light opportunities to drive better experience for our customers, our crew members and ultimately our owners.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So sorry, just a follow-up there. If you do decide on a new aircraft type, that will be incremental to the existing CapEx guide to that you put forward?\nSteve Priest: Yes, indeed, it would be.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thanks, gentlemen. Thanks for the time. Marty, actually a few questions for you. Earlier, you talked about Puerto Rico as a market sort of coming back online followed by the middle of the year. Do you see that as having a positive or negative or neutral impact to the Caribbean and Florida overall? Said another way, is the absence of Puerto Rico maybe some other markets in Caribbean are contributing to the strength that you've seen in those markets? Or is it just something else?\nMarty St. George: Hi, Rajeev. Thanks for the question. As we said that the Latin and Caribbean region is the RASM superstar for us and what we've seen so far. Frankly, I don't really think there's a big connection between the strength we seen in the rest of the Caribbean and what the changes have been in Puerto Rico. Certainly, our Puerto Rico strength has come from an explosion in the visiting friends in relative market, as Robin alluded to in his prepared remarks. And I think it's back to what we said in the end of 2017 and I think in October conference call, customers will find the beach. The true, like truly leisure beach traffic in Puerto Rico was never that bigger percentage to what we carried and it certainly, has gone down since the hurricane. But overall, our lack of our strength has been very, very positive development for us.\nRajeev Lalwani: Okay. And then on basic economy, just coming back to your response to Jamie's question earlier. Do I take out to mean that there isn't much of an interest in implementing the product, I mean Alaska announced it yesterday and throughout some pretty meaningful numbers? Would love just to get your perspective on that.\nMarty St. George: I thank for asking. We're confident looking for ways to optimize our offering. If you go back to the fare option platform that we launched after our 2014 Investor Day, we've made multiple changes how we have packaged and sold our product to try to make sure we continue to outstanding RASM performance that we've had in last several years. I think it's fair to say looking at the answer I gave to Jamie, we don't see a boring platform of challenges to our revenue model on base economy. But I would also say, if we get to the point we decide that is a RASM of all thing for us to do, we have a great platform, we do it.\nRajeev Lalwani: Okay. And then if I can sneak in a last quick one. Marty, I think you've made some comments about assuming, and correct me, if I'm wrong, about assuming improving trends on the closing side, demand accelerating due to the quarter, et cetera. Can you just clarify what you meant there? I just want to make sure I understand whether or not you assuming demand trends just continued to improve throughout the quarter.\nMarty St. George: Yes. I mean, if you look at the demand environment, as we see it right now, we're very happy with what we're seeing. I think we've all seen some fare increases over the last few weeks. Certainly, the last two quarters, we saw both quarters, fourth quarter 2017 and the first quarter 2018 closed some really nice close-in strength. So we're really, from our model, we don't really see any reason for that to change. We're seeing competitive capacity picked on a little bit. Overall, we're very bullish for what we're seeing for the demand environment right now.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDarryl Genovesi: Thanks. Steve, just a clarifying question. When you were going through the second half CASM outlook, you gave a negative 0.5%, negative 2% number, which seems to dovetail with your full year guide. But then I thought you said a negative 1.5% to plus 1.5% number for something else in the second half. What was that?\nSteve Priest: No, the underlying \u2013 so we are guiding negative 2% to negative 4% for the second half of year. But then when you take into account cycling across the significant hurricanes and the bonus that we gave throughout the $1000 crew member bonus of that we gave as a result of tax reform, when you adjust that, it goes to a minus 0.5% to plus 1.5%. So that's the underlying H2 perspective.\nDarryl Genovesi: Understood. And then I guess I just wanted to ask you a little bit more on the fleet. JetBlue is about 18 years old. When I go back and I look historically relatively on growth-oriented airlines and their CASM trajectory, it will often start to \u2013 some of the CASM growth will start to flatten out around the time that the airline start retiring airplanes. And so I think the oldest aircraft in your fleet now about 18 years old. Are you thinking that you get 25 years out of them or are you going to start cutting them up at 20?\nSteve Priest: Great question. Yes, I mean, there's no reason. We're very, very happy with the fleet that makes in the vast majority of our fleet, the 245aircraft we have, 195 of those are in the Airbus network \u2013 the great work cost us. They are good for us and there's no reason to think as to why they wouldn't take us though like to 25 years. But on the fleet side, we got obviously continue to review that both from a margin standpoint, from a fuel efficiency standpoint, from CASM X in our maintenance. And that's why we're go through the overall fleet review at the moment that we do. Very happy with the existing Airbus fleet that we have today.\nRobin Hayes: I mean, I think Darryl, it\u2019s Robin. If I can add just an additional point on that, I think when you look at some of the heavier maintenance cost you see other older airplanes, a lot of that link to the engine costs, the kind of go to their later ship visit. I mean, that's what really drive some of the ongoing maintenance cost. I think a fair opportunity for us being out with the V2500 RFP at the moment because we're able to reset that cost into the future, and that also gives us confidence that we can cost-effectively fly their plans for the period of time that Steve talked about.\nDarryl Genovesi: Perfect. Thanks a lot gentlemen.\nSteve Priest: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Marty, I'm wondering if you could just talk about Mint in the context of how cyclical you're expecting it to be over the cycle. I think some of your LPC peers look at those type of products as things to have what \u2013 when the economy do it but not very good when the economy rolls over. So can you just provide your perspective on how you see that paving over cycle?\nMarty St. George: Hi Jo, thanks for the question. Great question and it's certainly something we spent a lot of time talking about. The one point I'll say is we're fully net. We haven't seen a down cycle yet. But I will say that Mint's been wildly above our expectation. And I think one of the big reasons for that has been our pricing strategy. We still have fair in the mid-three digits at the bottom end. And although we have had significant RASM improvement in Mint over the last three or four years, we think that we can play at all elements of the price spectrum. Certainly, if you look at who we're carrying on the airplanes, we have a very strong core of high-end leisure customers and even the recession, those tend to be customers are good. And I think when the traditional legacy way of pricing those markets, which is really higher fares or upgrades, that's a market that's much tougher for them to access than under our sort of everyday low pricing strategy.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it, okay. And then, Marty, another one for just on the credit card. You're one of the few airlines maybe the its only U.S. airline that switch partners recently. It seems like it blend seamlessly for you guys. I think some airlines are worried that they would lose customers during that transition. So I'm just wondering if you could speak to what your experience has been switching from AmEx to Barclays and maybe what that talking about looking at kind of the flexibility you have going forward.\nMarty St. George: Well, interesting question. I mean, first of all, we were very grateful to American Express for many years of service and they were very, very good partners during the transition. I think the relationship between AmEx and Barclays made this much easier then it could have been. The second thing I'll say is we're very lucky that winning bidder in our RFP, Barclays, also have a lot of experience in converting portfolios. So I'd say from our perspective, it was almost seamless transition. Barclays has been extremely effective in converting less of accounts, adding new accounts. They've been an outstanding partner. I will say the only downside so far has been those definitely accounting difference when you switch partners versus when you re-up your current partner. We talked about that a little bit I think two or three calls ago. But again, that's more of timing issue than an actual underlying revenue. We've already taken our guidance up once as far as the results from the credit card. We're not switching guidance right now. But I'll say the partnership has been fantastic and there's nothing but absolute, absolute satisfaction with Barclays.\nDavid Fintzen: All right. And that concludes our first quarter 2018 conference call. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."}]
