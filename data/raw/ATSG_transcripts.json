[{"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 3, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-11-07 16:39:09", "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q3 2023 Air Transport Services Group, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your first speaker today, Joe Payne, Chief Legal Officer. You can now go ahead.\nJoe Payne: Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website, atsginc.com. Let me begin by advising you that during the course of this call, we will make projections and other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we described here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call. Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to, unplanned changes in the market demand for our assets and services; our operating airline's ability to maintain on-time service and control costs; the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration; fluctuations in ATSG's traded share price and in interest rates, which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments; the number, timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers; our ability to remain in compliance with key agreements with customers, lenders and government agencies; the impact of current supply chain constraints, both within and outside the U.S., which may be more severe or persist longer than we currently expect; the impact of the current competitive labor market; changes in general economic and/or industry-specific conditions, including inflation; the impact of geographical events and other factors as contained from time-to-time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-Q we will file next week. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials. We advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Joe Hete, our CEO, for his opening comments.\nJoe Hete: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you all joining us. Before we discuss our third quarter results, I would like to address the leadership transition we announced yesterday. This change is the result of careful and thoughtful deliberation by the Board of Directors. On behalf of the Board, I want to express our sincere gratitude to Rich for his contributions to the company. We wish him all the best. I am honored and energized to be stepping back into the CEO role. Having served as ATSG's CEO from August 2003 to May 2020 and continuing as a Board member after that, I believe I bring a unique perspective and skill set to the position. That aside, we are operating in an incredibly dynamic and challenging market environment. There are certain issues that are within our control and others that are not. But we recognize that our recent financial results need to improve. There's more work to be done. And I'm committed to working collaboratively with the entire team to position our business for the future. Despite the challenging macroeconomic headwinds, ATSG is an incredibly resilient organization. With our differentiated business model, diverse customer base and unique competitive position, I believe we are poised to capitalize on the long-term opportunities ahead. I look forward to continuing to build on our strong foundation to deliver value for our shareholders. With that, I will now turn the call over to Quint Turner to discuss our financial results for the quarter. And I will return to close our prepared remarks. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Joe, and welcome to everyone joining us this morning. While July started out in line with our expectations, our results were impacted by macro and operational challenges later in the third quarter. The next slide, Slide 4 summarizes our financial results for the third quarter. Our revenues grew $6 million or 1% versus a year ago to $523 million. This was driven by higher revenue in the ACMI Services and partially offset by a decrease in revenue in the leasing segment. Our GAAP pretax earnings were down $41 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.24 versus $0.57 in the third quarter of 2022. On an adjusted basis, pretax earnings fell $36 million to $31 million and EPS was down $0.28 to $0.32. In our aircraft leasing segment, CAM, pretax earnings were down $14 million compared to a year ago at $23 million. 11 767-200 freighters have been returned as scheduled since September 2022, including 2 in the third quarter. Power-by-cycle engine revenue was also reduced due to fewer 767-200s in service as well as fewer cycles flown by those 200s still in service. Additionally, the lack of aircraft sales during the quarter versus two in the prior year period negatively impacted our year-over-year comparison. Taken together, the effect of these items, all related to our 767-200 fleet, reduced pretax earnings from the prior year quarter by $13 million. Interest expense was $4.7 million higher than the prior year quarter. Those items offset $7.3 million in additional lease revenue from 10 more freighters added to service. In our ACMI Services segment, pretax earnings were $12 million, down $13 million compared to the third quarter of 2022. This was driven by a mix with more military and less commercial flying, fewer hours over long-haul international routes for cargo customers, the effects of inflation and payroll costs and service challenges in our passenger operations. Earnings from cargo operations together were down $6 million and passenger operations pretax was down $7 million. Total airline block hours were down 1% versus the prior year quarter as increased passenger hours were unable to fully offset a drop in cargo hours. Cargo hours decreased 4% and passenger block hours, including combi flying for the military, were up 14%. Our 757 combi operations resumed services over a transpacific route last fall. Turning to the next slide. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $137 million, down 16% compared to the prior year period. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was down $39 million to $594 million. As you can see, even with the year-over-year decrease, CAM still makes up the bulk of our EBITDA, and we still consider this to be our core business. We project 16 freighter lease deployments in 2023, including 12 767-300s and our first 4 A321-200s. Since September 2022, our in-service fleet increased by 6 aircraft. The next slide details our capital spending. Total CapEx for the quarter was $168 million, comprising $120 million in growth CapEx and $48 million in sustaining CapEx. As you may recall, we lowered our capital expenditures outlook for the year last quarter. We continue to expect total capital spend of $785 million for 2023, $240 million of that will be sustaining CapEx and $545 million will be for growth. The next slide covers our updates to adjusted free cash flow as measured by our operating cash flow, net of our sustaining CapEx. Operating cash flows decreased $30 million to $118 million for the quarter and were $600 million for the trailing 12 months. Adjusted free cash flow was $400 million over the last 12 months. That equates to approximately $6 per share based on our outstanding shares as of September 30. On the next slide, you can see that available credit under our revolver facilities in the U.S. and abroad was $428 million at the end of the third quarter. This table reflects the recent convertible note refinancing transaction we completed as well as the subsequent share repurchases we made. Combined, we bought back 9.4 million shares over the past year with 5.4 million of those purchased in the third quarter alone. Our balance sheet remained strong with net leverage under 3x, putting us in a strong position to complete this year's investment plans. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Mike Berger, our President, who will summarize the issues that have developed since September and how they have affected our outlook for the rest of the year. Mike?\nMike Berger: Thanks, Quint. Most of you are aware that at our Investor Day event in September, we reaffirmed our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $610 million to $620 million. At the $615 million midpoint of that range, that implies $320 million in the second half on top of the $295 million we delivered in the first half. We reviewed the latest results from each of our businesses before the event. And while we told you then about the risk around CAM's second half lease deployments and second half outlook for our airlines, we thought our plan was still attainable. But since then, a great deal has changed in the macro environment for air cargo capacity as most of you are aware and are hearing on earnings calls and reading the trade press and the performance of our passenger airline, Omni Air. To illustrate how those changes have affected our outlook, I'm going to focus on adjusted EBITDA and show you why we are reducing our guidance by about $45 million to a range of $560 million to $580 million. This slide shows that our prior guidance for the second half on the left, the midpoint of our new guidance of $270 million on the right and some key factors behind the changes. The vast majority of that $45 million reduction, about $43 million, stems from 2 pieces of our business: freighter leasing at CAM and Omni's passenger flying. It's important to note that our cargo airlines, ABX Air and ATI, are on track to meet their adjusted EBITDA targets for the year. Quint told you about the service delays and related higher costs that affect Omni's results for the third quarter. Some of those higher costs are continuing. But the main reason for Omni's new fourth quarter outlook is the conflict in the Middle East, which began on October 7. Events in that part of the world have affected Omni's normal fourth quarter requirements for its government customers, which typically peak in October each year. Also, Omni's outlook for higher-margin commercial flying in the fourth quarter is lower than before. Omni's third quarter results include a good July and an August that was close to plan. Obviously, the disruptions in the Middle East were not part of our plan when we spoke to many of you in late September. We are closely monitoring Omni's progress and the global factors that drive its demand. Of the $45 million guidance reduction overall for the second half, more than 1/3 of it is attributable to Omni. Moving to CAM. Our new second half guidance reflects issues in three key areas: freighter and related engine leasing through the end of the year; planned changes in the 767-200 fleet, including sales of those aircraft types; and our current assessment of the new information we're receiving from some of our current 767-300 lease customers outside the U.S. CAM had a strong July for freight release deployments, although some were delayed from earlier in-service projections. We now expect to deliver 16 newly converted freighters by the end of the year, which is 3 fewer than we mentioned before. Leases of engines for 767-300s, which have been a significant contributor in the first half, have decreased. Quint mentioned in his remarks that CAM had intended to sell 767-200s in the second half at prices that would yield significant returns on those fully depreciated assets. We expect to sell a couple this quarter and others in 2024. Additionally, in mid-October, we were contacted by certain airline customers of CAM expressing that they were experiencing lower customer demand, which is negatively impacting their financial results and outlook. Our guidance reflects appropriate adjustments to address the potential effect of that new information. I think I speak for the entire management team in saying that we are probably even more unhappy to have to give you these dues as you are to receive it. The air cargo industry is undergoing rapid changes this fall as you are hearing everywhere else. Unfortunately, we are not immune to that. We still believe that our strategic direction to serve the airlines who will remain in the express package fulfillment business will eventually yield great results. Now I'll turn the call back to Joe Hete for some closing remarks.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Mike. To echo Mike and Quint's words, I want to add that the Board believes just as strongly in the long-term goals of the company to grow and achieved strong returns from leasing and operating mid-sized freighters and passenger aircraft. The growth capital we have spent over the last several years plus what we will spend in the next several years made sense to us even before the pandemic, when freighters were the hottest commodity in the aircraft business. I regard our foundational assets, mid-sized freighters, and the foundational customers we lease to and fly for, DHL, Amazon and the military, has a strong platform that will sustain the company through challenges and support continued long-term cash flow. I hope to bring back what I was probably best known for when I was CEO, leveraging my decades of experience in this industry to assess all of our options to deploy our capital for greater shareholder return and best-in-class customer service. One of Rich Corrado's many talents, which is a key part of why we chose him to run the company, was his insights about the markets we serve and where our range of capabilities fit best. That insight has served us well for several years, but those market conditions have changed. Our new reality is that growth will be more difficult to achieve than before. We faced similar periods before. And I'm confident we can maintain the resilience that has been a hallmark of the company and keep it moving ahead in any climate. The Board's view and mine is that we need to take a more conservative view of when and where we can best invest for the greatest shareholder return and sharply reduce our capital spending program in 2024 and beyond. We now plan to spend $505 million in 2024. That's down $100 million in capital spending compared to the 2024 plan provided at the end of September and down $280 million from this year's projected spend. That new 2024 outlook is driven by fewer conversions and only essential feedstock purchases. That includes purchases of Airbus A330 aircraft we will begin leasing next year. 2024 planned projected lease deployments of 14 converted freighters, including 6 767-300s, 5 A321s and 3 A330s. We are introducing no additional 767-300s for conversion beyond the 7 currently in process. As I've said in the past, we always have the flexibility to not convert some of the aircraft we own until market conditions improve. It's too early to estimate our 2024 adjusted EBITDA. But with these capital spending reductions and the items that Mike mentioned earlier, we plan to provide new adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024 during our fourth quarter earnings call in February. I can make one positive prediction about 2024, however, cutting our growth CapEx spending means our free cash generation will be higher than it would have been under the prior plan through 2024 and 2025. That concludes our prepared remarks. Quint and I, along with Mike Berger, our President; and Paul Chase, our Chief Commercial Officer, are ready to answer questions. May we have the first question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Frank Galanti with Stifel.\nFrank Galanti: So a pretty material change from just a couple of weeks ago, 6 weeks ago. And obviously, in the prepared remarks, you hit on a lot of it. But can you sort of talk about how you're thinking about demand for the 767-300 and 200 actually? So you mentioned 7 767s are in conversion, I think I got that number right. That seems like a change from just even earlier this year on expectations. Is that demand weighing all on the international side? Can you sort of talk through those dynamics, please?\nPaul Chase: Yes, Frank, it's Paul Chase here. Thanks for the question. We'll talk about this year first. I mean, we're filling the orders this year using our existing pipeline. But in the future, in 2024, that pipeline has slowed. So we're keeping an eye on that. And that's one of the reasons that the business has decided to pull back on the CapEx. So with most of the deliveries that we expected to go internationally, sure, we're seeing some weakness there. But we're keeping an eye on it.\nFrank Galanti: Okay. And then what about the 200s? What sort of changed there from a demand perspective expectations-wise?\nPaul Chase: Sure. I mean, the 200s, right, I mean, it's a fleet that we're working on sunsetting over time. And we're really just being opportunistic about upcoming maintenance events and what we have to invest in aircraft from a capital perspective. So it's really a case-by-case basis on those aircraft, and we're working them through.\nMike Berger: Yes. And as you heard in the remarks, we still plan to sell a couple of those 200s as well this year as well as to 2020 -- as well as to 2024, Frank.\nFrank Galanti: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the capital allocation front, Joe, you'd mentioned wanting to kick CapEx down. Can you sort of talk about what is locked in? Like what kind of wiggle room do you have in '23, '24 to bring CapEx down further? And then what do you think sort of peak leverage ratio is that you guys are comfortable getting to? And add a final question onto that, what do you think about share buybacks at these prices?\nJoe Hete: Well, Frank, like I said, we haven\u2019t had an opportunity to get my arms around all the details in terms of what\u2019s committed to and what isn\u2019t committed to. As I mentioned in my remarks, we always have the flexibility, once we own the feedstock, not to run it through the conversion process, which is where the lion\u2019s share of the dollars are spent, not on acquiring the actual feedstock itself. So as Paul mentioned, we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a softening on the 767 side. So feedstock that we\u2019ve committed to or already own, we\u2019ll just park it and take the things like the engines, we have the opportunity to lease the engines out to other operators to generate some income. We even have the flexibility if the demand is there to throw an aircraft or two to Omni for their use. And of course, if somebody needs a passenger aircraft, we can always leave that to a third party as well. So we\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility there. But at first blush, like I said, this is right now drinking from a fire hose, so to speak, we\u2019re able to identify a significant amount, as I mentioned, over $100 million worth of CapEx, just from what was presented back in September to the market. As far as capital allocation going forward, right now, we\u2019re below 3x from a leverage perspective, 3x has always been kind of a ceiling for us. We like to stay no more than that, although we may creep up just a tad here and there. But ultimately, as mentioned, we expect to generate free cash flow in 2024 and into 2025 as we pull back on the CapEx spend. And at that point, we\u2019ll make a determination whether the best return to shareholders is to pay down the debt. Obviously, interest rates are at very high-water mark these days than what they were about 3-plus years ago and whether that makes more sense or to return the capital to shareholders via share buybacks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joe Atkins with Stephens Inc.\nGrant Smith: This is Grant on for Jack. Just wanted to kind of ask around, I know it's kind of early in 2024, but if you could just maybe kind of frame up how firm some of those commitments are that you have for next year. And maybe can you just talk to kind of the range of outcomes that you're looking out as you think out towards 2024?\nMike Berger: So thanks for the question. So in 2024, as we said, we're fully expecting to deliver at this point, 14 freighters, newly converted freighters. The breakdown of those are 6 767s, 5 A321s and 3 330s. We've got the feedstock secured for those. And as you've heard us say, at this point, on the 767 side, all those aircraft are waiting conversions. So we're in good shape on 2024 in regards to the forecasting. Longer term, as Joe mentioned, we'll see where the market goes. We'll see where the demand goes. We'll see where the cost goes. But long-term forecast from the freighter standpoint, specifically from Boeing and Airbus, as we look out to the future is still robust as well as from a replacement standpoint. But as you could see and we've talked about, the flexibility in our model allows us to throttle back some and produce that free cash flow that we talked about for 2024 and 2025.\nGrant Smith: Okay, great. So just kind of to follow up on that, too, kind of this pressure you're seeing on the leasing demand side in the third and fourth quarter, it kind of sounds like you think maybe it's a little more confined to the challenges we're seeing in the market today. And as long as things don't deteriorate too much into next year, you think you can kind of hold the line on where you're at and get all these planes out the door.\nPaul Chase: Yes, this is Paul Chase here, Grant. Yes, I do believe that\u2019s the case.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Helane Becker with TD Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Just a couple of questions in here. Can you address the delays out of IAI? It's one of your biggest conversion firms, and yet many of their employees have been called to service. So how can you be confident that you're going to get aircraft out on time from there?\nMike Berger: That's a really good question. And let me start by saying the IAI folks have been incredible to work with since this event has happened in early October. We have really had consistent and daily, and I say multiple times a day, communication with our partners at IAI in Tel Aviv. And they're doing a heck of a job in terms of coming to work and getting the job done. And we see that on a consistent basis. So we're really confident, Helane, that the numbers that we have presented today in terms of the aircraft for 2023 and 2024, we're going to see. And we see them working and delivering aircraft as recently as last week and this week. So it's a fair question. But I can assure you that IAI has stepped up in this very, very difficult time and been extremely resilient to produce and go about their business.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that's great to hear. The other question I had was I think Mas returned three aircraft to you recently. Is that included in the numbers that you gave us for returned aircraft, a? And b, since some of your issues seem to be related to some of your newer international customers, do you have -- and I don't mean to be nasty about this. But do you really have the expertise to grow beyond your core business? Or do you need to bring in more talent to be able to assess risk so that you don't get a lot of aircraft back when market turns.\nMike Berger: Yes. So let me address the Mas situation, the Mas piece first. To be clear, they haven't to date returned any aircraft. And in fact, they were actually scheduled to take an additional aircraft as recently as a short time ago. So we fully expect them to honor their commitments to the leases. And that's been our communication to them. In regards to the international expansion, we've talked about that international growth for some time now. And then when we look out to the future growth of the industry and see where that growth is going to come from, clearly all the data suggests very strongly it's going to come very well from Southeast Asia, East Asia, Central Asia and across other parts of the world. And that's where we've been focused on. In regards to the talent piece of it, that's really an excellent question. We've had a lot of discussions internally about that. We're building up that component of our CAM business to ensure that we address that. You may have heard or remember that we opened up the Irish entity last year. And we really have a big focus now of hiring some folks within the next 6 months or so that will be based outside the U.S. to address some of those concerns that you just mentioned. But make no mistake about it, a big part of our future is international. And we are a global organization, and we're looking forward to that growth going forward.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that's very helpful. And then for my last question, to your point about Investor Day, which was September 27, being sure of what you were seeing in the business, I mean, how -- I don't mean to be stupid. But how can that be? How can you not know that you were missing the quarter that close to the end of the quarter? I mean, I know that you're going to close the books after September 30. But things couldn't have just fallen apart in 3 days. To your point, you were seeing the decline in the business, and you talked about it during Investor Day about being aware of what was going on. We saw -- we had heard from FedEx late August. We knew that UPS had issues. But how did you not like figure out that things were not that robust? And then when you did, how could you not have [indiscernible] Street prior to last night?\nQuint Turner: Well, Helane, this is Quint. I mean the -- in terms of the quarter, we started out ahead of plan in July. And August was a bit worse. But we were not materially away from plan at the end of August. And truly, in September, we had a -- as we mentioned in our press release, we had some service challenges with Omni. They had a very atypical quarter in terms of service delays. And that can and did lead to a lot of cost overrun in the travel area as well as the flight crew and over time. And that was -- in terms of the third quarter, I'm not talking about the second half guidance, but just the third quarter, that was a significant downturn in their September results. And that -- we did not have that visibility certainly at Investor Day. The other source of the third quarter miss was primarily CAM. And CAM, as we've said in prior quarters, one of the things they are working through is the disposition of some 767-200s that have come back. And they're selling some of those aircraft. And those sales were being worked and anticipated to be done by the end of the quarter, in fact, right up until the very last day. And in some cases, of course, you're relying on the buyer and the other party to carry through with the transaction. And they're still working towards those transactions. But the timing of getting those executed did not occur during the quarter. And that was a -- I know that was over a $5 million CAM item just in the third quarter. So we had truly a lot of the deterioration in the third quarter occurred late in the quarter. And we did not have that visibility at the time. And we, of course, mentioned in the earnings release, the Israeli conflict, assessment of some customer news that we received in October, all that occurred subsequent to the quarter, which impacted our second half guidance that was not known to us at the end of September. So I don't know if that -- I know it's quite a change, and I understand the question. But truly, there were a lot of developments subsequent to Investor Day, which impacts our guidance.\nJoe Hete: Helane, this is Joe. Obviously, that's a question that myself and the rest of the Board members have asked a number of times in terms of how could we go out at that point in time. And while there's reasons for all of it, we don't find it acceptable. And as Mike noted in his comments that it was more difficult for us to have to make that kind of news to the market as opposed to you hearing it. So rest assured that, that is at the top of the list of getting back in terms of where the numbers we put out are credible to the market and not something that you have to be -- to question going forward.\nHelane Becker : Well, yes, I mean, I think the other thing, Joe, you might want to think about is how everybody reports up to you so that you don't get surprised and the Board doesn't get surprised at the end of a quarter like this. Because your stock is down 25%. So you've got a lot of rebuilding to do just from a credibility perspective in the market going forward. It's not going to be easy to get that 25% back.\nJoe Hete: No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s one of those things, like I said, that\u2019s at the top of my list of things to focus on, Helane. That\u2019s point number one.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Christopher Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna Financial Group.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: So Joe, your comments around growth more difficult to achieve, mike's comments around what sounded as point to the challenges within air cargo, I'm just -- I'm still having difficulty sort of parsing out what's temporary and what's going to persist here. How much of -- I understand perhaps what happened with the second half, but essentially now we have a double guide-down with 2024 guidance at risk. So how much of this is kind of cyclical slowing here within air cargo? You talk about some international wings perhaps slowing. What's operational? Are we having issues here with pilot attrition? Is it something else? Is it weather, geopolitical, supply chain? You spoke to IAI. I just want to understand, of course -- and then within CAM, rising interest rates, depreciation, we all understand that. But just if you could help kind of put it into buckets here. Because there's a lot obvious here to digest. But the magnitude of this miss and what is being viewed as two guide-downs is significant, so if you could help just sort of frame the moving parts.\nJoe Hete: Yes. Before I turn it over to other members of the team, obviously, I think it kind of falls under the category of all of the above are the things you listed out there. I mean, it's no secret that the macroeconomic conditions around the globe are more challenging these days. And as we have said in the past, our customers are the Amazons and DHLs of the world. So as you see decreasing cargo volumes around the globe, that's going to have a trickle-down effect to some of our lease customers. But as I think Quint noted in his remarks or Mike, if you look at our core cargo business with the Amazons and DHLs of the world, that portion of it is pretty stable. So with that as a backdrop, you can see that if you've got the smaller operators around the globe to support them and conditions are not really good from a total macro perspective, then that's going to have that trickle-down effect. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mike and Quint and Paul to further comment.\nMike Berger: Yes. Let me try to unpack the market piece a little bit more, Chris, for you. So the overall market demand has certainly softened and slowed. There's no question about it. We had the flexibility within the -- in our order book, if I could put it that way that as the market faced challenges in 2023, we have the ability to bring 2024 leases and customer leases forward to 2023, okay? And that was due to the strength of our order book that you've heard us talk about now for some time. Given that, as we pull stuff forward, obviously, we then took the opportunity really -- and you've had heard this said earlier, it's to really demonstrate the flexibility in our model and throttle back down some of our growth in 2024, specifically around the 767, which will allow us to reduce our CapEx dramatically in 2024, which ultimately will lead to the free cash flow that was referred to earlier. As it relates to the A321 and the A330, we just inducted our first A330 into conversion a couple of weeks back. We still fully anticipate to deliver the 3 A330s in 2024 that we talked about. And from -- and in this year, we still will deliver 4 A321s and 5 next year. So the overall demand specifically, we just had the ability and flexibility in the model to shift things around, throttle down on the CapEx in terms of some of the conversion costs that will help us on a go-forward basis.\nPaul Chase: Yes. And Chris, it's Paul Chase here. I'd like to reiterate just a couple of things that Joe Hete said earlier. I mean, unfortunately, with some of this pullback in demand, it allows us the opportunity to look at the assets we have differently. So we are looking at aircraft that are sitting that aren't being converted to pull those engines off and deploy those assets. So it's allowing us to do that. But what I'd also like to say is in conversations with customers, there are plenty of customers who have noted the macroeconomic environment who intend to do business with us in the future [indiscernible] on their side, look better. So there's still this pent-up demand as well. So I feel pretty confident.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: On the labor piece, you spoke in prior quarters about elevated levels of pilot attrition, if you could talk to that and also plans around hiring for next year.\nJoe Hete: Yes. I mean, pilot attrition is a problem throughout the industry that we're not immune from it by any stretch of the imagination. We're still managing to bring people in the front door. The key is to keep people from going out the back door. But when you've got other airlines offering significant hiring bonuses, et cetera, that becomes a challenge. But airplanes are still moving every day. We do have some service failures occasionally because a pilot got waylaid someplace or took ill, but we're still managing to move the aircraft as according to their schedule. So that hasn't been an impediment to the business overall. Obviously, we've got an ongoing negotiation with ATI. As I said earlier, I'm still drinking from a fire hose, so I haven't had a chance to dig into it in great depth. The negotiations are under the auspices of the National Mediation Board. So there's no ability for pilots to walk out until you go through the whole mediation process. I've been down this road many times in 40-plus years, so got a lot of experience in terms of how you work through these issues. At the end of the day, you've got to have a contract that works for both sides. So if you've got on the union side asking for FedEx or UPS wages or industry-leading, and that's not in the cards from what we get from our customers, then that's just not something we can agree to. So the key, obviously, in the end is finding a happy middle ground between their demands and our needs to keep things on the rails.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And just a follow-up here. I know you're not ready to give guidance for next year here. But if we look at the exit rate for this year and we annualize, that gets us to around $540 million. If we compare that to, I think, the low end of the guide you gave a few weeks ago, that's kind of a high-teens growth. Quint, maybe if you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes as we think about -- as we hope to put on our models today, whether this is a wholesale revision or some fine-tuning, have 14 aircraft, if I understood correctly. We have elevated depreciation, interest rates. Lease rates positively are moving higher. But it sounds like there is some slowing within cargo. Just if you could help frame the puts and takes as we think about EBITDA for next year.\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Chris. Yes, the -- first, in terms of the guidance sort of revision, right, because you asked about that earlier, how much of that carries over, how you think about it. Around -- a little more than 40% of that, call it, $45 million guide-down since the end of September is related to Omni. And it's not due to any loss of customers or business. It's due to a couple of factors. First off, third quarter, and we mentioned they had an unusual service quarter, which drove a lot of costs in terms of delays. Because that drives that additional travel and crew costs that I mentioned earlier. That was a big piece of their miss for the quarter. The fourth quarter portion of the guide-down is related more to, and we mentioned in the release, the Israeli situation, we believe, will impact some passenger requirements. Omni has a -- typically a very busy October. And with the onset of the conflict occurring early in October and looking through the remainder of the quarter, we just feel like that may -- had the effect of deferring some of their business until later periods. And it's difficult to predict whether that will be by the end of the fourth quarter or spill into the first quarter. But it's not a -- like they lost some piece of business that will never occur or some customer. So I wouldn't say that the Omni piece of that $45 million is a systemic thing that you should think about necessarily for next year. Then the other pieces of that guide-down, of course, primarily our CAM. And the largest piece of CAM, and it's similar to Omni, I'd put it somewhere a little north of 40% of that. And the pieces of that are the 767-200 sales, which we had targeted for the second half. I mentioned -- we mentioned they didn't sell any in the third quarter. And they have some slated, as Mike indicated, for the fourth quarter. But as you might expect, we've tried to take a conservative view on that because the timing has proven to be difficult to pinpoint in terms of the other party tied up to sale. And then we've seen some reduced flying of the 767-200s that we provide engine power customers for. And so the combined effect of that is probably more than half of the CAM's piece of the guide-down is related to the 767-200 fleet. And then they had some later startups of new leases of 767-300s than we had anticipated. And some of that is related to that softness in the market, we believe, right? We've got the MasAirs and other customers that are feeling the pinch and aren't perhaps as in a quite the hurry to take the airplanes as it would be in a more robust macro environment. And so that's a piece of that as well, as well as our view again trying to be conservative on the realization of customer revenues from some of those folks through the fourth quarter. And we've tried to take a reasonable estimate of that in terms of our revised guidance. Those were the biggest pieces of the $45 million guide-down. Now as far as the '24 outlook, Joe and Mike spoke about the CapEx reduction, which, of course, is much easier for us to revise at this point because we know what -- as Mike said, we're not going to refill the conversion lines once the airplanes are produced at IAI. So that will reduce our '24 CapEx. And we know what feedstock commits we had. So we've looked at that and said we're going to bring our CapEx down $100 million. Now that doesn't mean that's where we necessarily stop. We're continuing to scrub that. And we're going to look for more opportunities to lower the expenditures there as we move forward. I'm sure, Joe, in particular, will be looking at every flow. In terms of the adjusted EBITDA to revise the guidance we gave at the end of September for '24, because of the situation in Israel, the customer and macro market softness that we've mentioned, we want to let that play out further and update that guidance in February. But that said, we are confident that the adjusted EBITDA that we put forward for '24 will be higher than our '23 that we've guided to. And we look forward to, in February, once we've had some of these events continue to evolve and updating the market further, that we have enough, we believe, visibility to '24 certainly to say it will improve upon '23's result.\nMike Berger: I just want to highlight the one thing that Quint mentioned specifically around Omni is that troop rotations will take place. We just, from a timing standpoint, I can't predict that piece of it.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Right. Okay. So if I hear you, the sort of base case risk-adjusted view, if you will, of EBITDA for next year is higher than, let's say, the midpoint of -- for today's revised guide?\nQuint Turner: Correct.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And last one on the power-by-cycle contracts, Quint, how many of those sort of pandemic-era contracts are rolling off of this year?\nQuint Turner: Well, the -- what I was speaking of was related to the 767-200 GE-powered 80A engines. And we maintained a pool. You may remember when our previous arrangement for power-by-cycle ended with a supplier, we instead went to a pooling concept, where we would make that power available to lessees for 767-200s. So we have -- we provide that availability and customers pay us by the cycle on that. And we maintain that pool of engines, which you can expect, as that 767-200 fleet comes down, our CapEx spend to do that will likewise come down. But what we have seen is, as we're paid by the cycle, we've noted this year that sequentially each quarter, we've seen those airplanes that are still out there with customers flying fewer cycles. And I think that is an indicator that there perhaps some softening market because there aren't -- there isn't as many flights taking place, not as much perhaps for those customers' volumes a reason to fly the airplane. And so that has impacted, as I mentioned, the EBITDA from the 200 fleet that [CAM] gave us, but -- and I'm not sure, Chris, if you were asking about our own power-by-cycle arrangements that we have with suppliers to maintain other engine types or you were just focusing on the comments around 767-200 PBC.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Not the 200s, overall, I'm guessing that you did -- there were some contracts that were put together early mid-days of the pandemic. And I was curious how many of those are rolling off at year-end.\nQuint Turner: Well, I mean, the other engine types, the other aircraft types and the engines that power them, we don\u2019t maintain a pool of engines. Under the lease, the customer is typically responsible for the maintenance of those engines throughout the life of the lease. Now we ourselves have a power-by-cycle arrangement with an outside vendor to take care of our engines for the 767-300 GE-powered fleet. And I believe we\u2019ve entered into one with IAI for the PW4000s, right, the Pratt engines. But that\u2019s different than us offering a product to a customer. That\u2019s us buying from a supplier. So I\u2019m not sure which side of the PBC you\u2019re getting at there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Howard Rosencrans with Value Advisory.\nHoward Rosencrans : So the second half looks like -- so the midpoint of your guidance is $270 million. I'm just trying, based on -- so the Omni part is largely the Middle East. Is that the big change there?\nQuint Turner: That's -- in the fourth quarter, Howard, for Omni, that would be -- of the second half, obviously that happened in October, so that's -- in the fourth quarter, yes, that's the biggest impact on Omni.\nHoward Rosencrans : Okay. And the rest of the stuff is lower demand or the absence of the engine sales, just to summarize, right?\nQuint Turner: Yes, I mean, we went through some of the puts there a minute ago, puts and takes.\nHoward Rosencrans : Right, okay. Just I'm having a little trouble processing. In my 40 years in the business, I never saw this happen. So the $270 million, the midpoint of the guide, should be the absolute, absolute -- you already communicated you'll expect that the guide you'll introduce or that -- ostensibly, 2024 will be higher than 2023. So -- but just to take the bare -- just to take $270 million as a second half number, you have some anomalies. You have some -- you have all of these factors. So sort of a worst-case scenario is that, that suggests that your $540 million, $550 million is the absolute bare bones, just so we can understand what sort of a bare bones number there is out there?\nQuint Turner: Well, I think when we said it would be better, we were talking about for our full year '23. So the full year '23 guide is higher than $540 million, right? So we're talking about our guidance for the full year '23.\nHoward Rosencrans : Okay, I thought you were talking about '24 when you made some comments about '24. Okay, maybe I'm just...\nQuint Turner: We are -- we're saying '24 will improve upon '23's full year adjusted EBITDA.\nHoward Rosencrans : Yes, okay. That was the point I was making. I was just trying to understand what the -- obviously, there seems to be a lack of filter of information that\u2019s going on at the company, so\u2026\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities.\nMichael Ciarmoli: I guess, can we just maybe elaborate a little bit on how Israel is directly impacting Omni? I mean, at Investor Day, I know the focus was on a potential government shutdown. It sounded like all flight activity was booked and locked in for the end of the year. Obviously, the U.S. doesn't have any direct exposure. But I would think regardless troop rotation, movement would be good for Omni. So what's exactly happening with Israel?\nQuint Turner: Well, and I'll take a stab at it and let others join in. Michael, this is Quint. Again -- and we refer to them as passenger requirements. Obviously, we're not going to go into a lot of detail on what Omni may be hearing directly from their customer. But just in general, I think the Israeli conflict caused an atypical interruption to what would normally be their busiest period, that being October. And as we remarked earlier, we do not believe that over a longer stretch of time, it will be a negative impact to Omni. Because those passenger operations will occur. It's just difficult to say whether they will fall inside the fourth quarter or they will extend beyond that. And you're correct that, in many cases, world events have resulted in additional revenue opportunities for Omni. But it's not the norm. And you only have to look back at the Afghanistan withdrawal, the NATO situation near the Ukraine to find some examples. So Omni remains, I believe, kind of a linchpin, if not the linchpin carrier for commercial passenger moves for the DoD. And we fully expect that to continue. Omni has demonstrated that while there's more volatility, they can also do very well in those situations. So we're not saying that's changed. The possibilities are lower now. We're not saying...\nJoe Hete: Yes, you've got to understand, military is going to do their contingency planning. And of course, like I said, anything that they do in that regard is not something that's divulged to the public. But eventually, as Quint noted, troops have to move. Normally, October is a busy month because rotating troops in and out before the holiday season. But when you've got a crisis boiling like we have in the Middle East, it's one of those things where everything kind of has to take on -- be put on hold until you can better assess the situation and what the potential ramifications are.\nMichael Ciarmoli : Got it. And then just on the -- I mean, I get it on cutting CapEx and it's going to improve cash flow. But this is now multiple cuts to CapEx. And I guess, what's sort of the direct formula you can give us? Because as we look out now, I mean, the '25 EBITDA guide has obviously moved. But how much does the lack of growth CapEx spending impact the EBITDA generation that we were originally going to see?\nQuint Turner: Well, Michael, I mean, again, there -- of course, in addition to the CAM segment, which is where the EBITDA drive is from CapEx spend, there's the ACMI Services. And we've spoken a lot about some of the things, with the Israeli situation. And that is the reason we're deferring '24's CapEx guide to next year. But I think that next year, the aircraft that come out will -- as Mike said, 14 or 15 aircraft will still drive significant EBITDA. There will still be some headwind from 767-200s being removed from service at the same time. And he talked about 14 or 15 aircraft, I think 8 of those are Airbus aircraft that come out next year. And I think -- so we're still going to have significant EBITDA contribution from newly converted aircraft that go on lease. But we're going to hold off on the total EBITDA guide until we've had a chance to see how some of these other factors play out. But we are confident that it will exceed '23's actual.\nJoe Hete: Yes. Just keep in mind, the EBITDA contribution of an asset is basically only a fraction of what the CapEx spend is for that similar asset. So it takes years to get that cash back in terms of leasing the aircraft out. So near term, it will have a minor impact on the EBITDA but a significant impact on the CapEx spend.\nMichael Ciarmoli : Okay. And Joe, last one for me, and I hate to go here, but back to Helane's line of questioning. I mean, we can literally monitor in real-time flight operations. I just -- I mean, what were you guys not seeing? I mean, I would think you could see your power by the cycle on a daily basis, your flight operations on a daily basis, the block hours on a daily basis. I mean, it just seems like there was a failure of internal controls here. And I mean, if you're seeing all these trends in real time, and we've been hearing and talking about a macro slowdown for months, I just -- it just doesn't really square to me. I don't know if you guys -- if you just weren't monitoring that data or weren't looking at it. But it just -- yes, just seemingly, there seems like there was something that should have been jumping out and flashing red, especially on September 27.\nJoe Hete: Yes. And in part, you\u2019re correct in that regard in terms of \u2013 but it\u2019s not an internal control, it\u2019s more of understanding what the ramifications are of a delay. For example, when Omni had an aircraft that was down for 3 days, an airplane is down for 3 days. But the part that wasn\u2019t connected was the fact that you had to put up 200 or 300 passengers in the middle of nowhere. I think it was in Guam was where the aircraft got waylaid. And it nailed there for 3 days. So it\u2019s the downstream ramifications of it. Everybody knew the airplane mechanical, for example. As far as power-by-the-cycle thing goes, the users of the 200s turn in their hours at the end of the month. We don\u2019t get a daily recap from them that, \u201cI flew 2 hours yesterday and 5 hours the day before.\u201d At the end of the month, you total up what their utilization was. So you really wouldn\u2019t have visibility into the PBC portion of it until the end of the month. All you\u2019re doing is forecasting what you saw previously.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: I'll keep this quick. Just, Quint, if you could walk us through cash total liquidity, including your revolver debt security? And also just remind us of the pilot open contracts, whether those were embedded in the out-year guidance.\nQuint Turner: Sure, Chris. In terms of the last question first, I guess, the pilot open contracts, of course, we're not giving guidance -- we're not refreshing our '24 guidance. But if you're asking if we had it included at the end of September, yes, we did when we talked to the market. But today, we're not refreshing out your guidance on the expense side. But when we do, it will be in those status of the pilot agreements. As far as the liquidity section -- and of course, there's a slide in here, Slide 8, which kind of lays it out. But we have a revolver that it's, I believe, a $1.1 billion capacity revolver that we've got undrawn, unused capacity of over $400 million on. Our current leverage ratio after including the unsecured portion of our debt, which is a new convertible, $400 million convertible due in 2029 as well as the remains of a convert we did in 2017 that's $54 million that matures next year, and an unsecured bond that matures in February of 2028 of $580 million. Taking that into consideration and looking at the leverage ratio, we're currently levered at, I believe, it's like 2.88x, our trailing. And so still conservatively levered with some reduction in EBITDA, we will be around 3x levered. We might even slightly go above it, depending upon how that comes out. But with the reductions in CapEx that we spoke about, there's not a -- there will be the ability -- if we choose to allocate capital to delever, there'll be an ability to do that as we look to the next couple of years. I mean, as we said in our remarks, the cash flow the business produces from the base of leases we have, you think about 75% or more of our revenue is through Amazon, DHL and the Department of Defense, that stable cash flow will continue and generate a lot of capital that can be allocated to deleverage, should we choose to.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: And you think -- you said in your Investor Day, you had more than $1.5 billion of available unencumbered aircraft collateral. There's been some movement in [indiscernible], which would be a positive, given your 767 exposure on values. Is that number, give or take, around $1.5 billion of unencumbered collateral still the right way to think about it?\nQuint Turner: Yes.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Joe Hete for closing remarks.\nJoe Hete: Thank you, Sean. To our stakeholders, we get it, receiving the news we reported yesterday after an upbeat outlook in September is hard to accept. We need to restore your trust by making all the commitments we know we can keep. Many of you on today's call know me and the fundamental cash-generating power of the business that the ATSG team and I built over many years by investing for growth and shareholder return. I agreed to return as CEO to guide the company through the next phase of its development, which will require us to focus on maximizing returns on the aircraft assets we have today while taking a more measured approach to investing for new ones. And I've already told our employees that I welcome all their ideas to make us stronger and advised our customers that our commitment to best-in-class service remains the basis for everything that we do. Thank you, and have a quality day.\nOperator: This concludes our conference for today.

Welcome to the Air Transport Services Group's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that, today's conference may be recorded. I will now hand the conference over to your speaker host today Mr. Joe Payne, Chief Legal Officer. Sir, you may begin. \nJoe Payne: Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website atsginc.com. Let me begin by advising you that, during the course of this call, we will make projections and other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information plans and estimates as of the date of this call. Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions factors new information or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to unplanned changes in the market demand for our assets and services; our operating airline's ability to maintain on-time service and control costs; the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration; fluctuations in ATSG's traded share price and in interest rates which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments; the number timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers; our ability to remain in compliance with key agreements with customers lenders and government agencies; the impact of current supply chain constraints both within and outside the US which may be more severe or persist longer than we currently expect; the impact of the current competitive labor market; changes in general economic and/or industry-specific conditions including inflation; and other factors as contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC including the Form 10-Q we will file next week. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pre-tax earnings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials. We advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures which are included in our earnings release and on our website. And now, I'll turn the call over to Rich Corrado, our President and CEO for his opening comments.\nRich Corrado: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results highlight a sequential rebound in our passenger airline operations and continued top line growth across our principal businesses. Additional military and commercial flying, as well as operating efficiencies, led our ACMI Services segment to report a 10% year-over-year gain to $24 million in pre-tax earnings for the second quarter. That was a $26 million improvement from the first quarter. CAM our aircraft leasing business grew revenues 2% versus the prior year, but pre-tax earnings were down. It has leased more Boeing 767-300 freighters, and accepted scheduled returns of several 767-200s over the prior 12 months. We expect a record pace of new freighter lease deployments in the second half, including six already delivered this quarter. Accordingly, we're maintaining our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance and have raised our adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.10 from the targets we set in May. At the same time, we're lowering our CapEx guidance for this year by $65 million to reflect fewer aircraft purchases for 2024 conversion and fewer-than-planned overhauls for our engines for 767-200 freighters. These reductions will have a positive impact on this year's cash flows. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Quint Turner to review our financial results for the second quarter. Quint? \nQuint Turner: Thank you, Rich and welcome to everyone on the call this morning. As Rich just mentioned, our second quarter results reflect sharp improvement from the first quarter in our ACMI Services segment, stemming from both improved revenues and cost efficiencies. In our leasing segment, we benefited from five more leases of 767-300s from a year ago offset in part by higher interest expense and the effects of 10, 767-200 lease returns over the last 12 months. The next slide summarizes our financial results for the quarter. Our revenues grew $20 million or 4% versus a year ago to $529 million for the second quarter. Both of our principal segments as well as our other businesses in total contributed to that increase. Our GAAP pre-tax earnings were down $20 million and basic earnings per share were $0.54 versus $0.73 in the second quarter of 2022. On an adjusted basis, pre-tax earnings fell $9 million to $58 million and EPS was down $0.02 to $0.57. In our aircraft leasing segment CAM, pre-tax earnings were down $9 million compared to a year ago at $31 million. That was primarily due to the scheduled return of 10, 767-200 freighters since June 2022 including seven during the second quarter. CAM's allocated interest expense rose $5 million and depreciation rose $2 million. CAM leased five more 767-300s externally over that same period. In our ACMI Services segment, pre-tax earnings were $24 million up $2 million. The increase in earnings at ACMI Services was primarily attributable to significantly improved performance in our passenger airline operations driven by both military and commercial charter flying as well as greater operating efficiencies. Airline block hours were up 1% versus the prior year quarter as increased cargo hours more than offset a slight drop in passenger hours. Cargo hours increased 1% for the quarter primarily on more hours flown for our customers' express networks. Passenger block hours were down 2% for the quarter versus a year ago. That included more block hours for our 757 combi operations, which resumed services over a trans-Pacific route last fall. Turning to the next slide. Our second quarter EBITDA was $157 million flat compared to the prior year period. On a trailing 12-month basis adjusted EBITDA was down $2 million to $621 million. On this slide, you can see CAM's adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months, which we are breaking out for the first time. CAM's share of total adjusted EBITDA has remained at approximately two-thirds over the period shown. CAM is the foundation of our company and we project its adjusted EBITDA to grow as global demand for its leased midsized freighters continues. On the next slide you'll see that capital spending reflects strong freighter market demand for our leased freighter fleet. Sustaining CapEx mainly for airframe and engine maintenance, technology and other equipment is higher this year due to the timing of aircraft engine overhauls, but will decline significantly next year as the number of projected engine overhauls decreases. Total CapEx was $413 million for the first six months of the year, including $303 million for growth. That's more than halfway to our projected $785 million total spend in 2023 of which $545 million is for growth. That spending will primarily fund purchases of feedstock aircraft and freighter conversions. The next slide updates our adjusted free cash flow as measured by our operating cash flow net of our sustaining CapEx. Operating cash flows increased $68 million to $192 million and $631 million for the trailing 12 months. Adjusted free cash flow was $423 million over the last 12 months. That equates to nearly $6 per share based on our outstanding shares as of June 30 and demonstrates the cash-generating power of our company. On the next slide, you can see that available credit under our revolver facilities in the US and abroad was $419 million at the end of the second quarter. Operating cash inflows are expected to largely fund our spending through 2024 and we expect our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to remain under 3x. Our balanced capital allocation strategy continues to include share repurchases. We bought back 950,000 shares in the second quarter following one million shares in the first quarter. Since the restart of share repurchases in October 2022, we have repurchased four million shares demonstrating our conviction to share with investors the returns ATSG's investments and business performance generate. With that summary of our financial and operating results, I'll turn it back to Rich for some comments on our operations and outlook. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint. Let me begin with a few key drivers of our second quarter results, which support our confidence about our continued progress for the rest of the year. The best news for the quarter was the strong rebound in our ACMI Services segment. As already noted, our airlines posted a 10% pre-tax earnings gain to $24 million versus a year ago, which is a $26 million sequential improvement from the first quarter. Passenger flying was the biggest change factor. Omni's operation for its military and other government customers picked up significantly and it won new business with commercial customers compared with first quarter levels. Our cargo airlines flew more hours than a year ago due primarily to the eight more customers signed 767 freighters in their CMI fleet versus a year ago. CAM continues to navigate a year of record lease deployments. Three of our projected 19 freighter leases for 2023 were completed in the first half. Of the 16 remaining, the first six have been leased in just the last 30 days, including our first two A321s. Seven 767-200 freighters returned to CAM as planned during the second quarter. Most of those returning 200s were part of the 12 CAM began leasing to Amazon in 2016 to jump-start its Air express network. We expect to operate seven for Amazon at least through peak season. We continue to regard the 767-200 freighter as a key player in air express networks around the world, operating over shorter routes but with more capacity than narrow-body freighters. Our decisions about the future of 200 airframes that come off lease are case by case and based on cycle life and maintenance requirements. We are actively engaged in discussions to re-lease or sell most of those returning 767-200s. We project that the new owner of any 767-200 airframe we sell will need to contract with CAM for engine power. If you look at the next slide, you may recall that in May, we mentioned our flexibility to modify our CapEx plans. That spend for 2023 is now expected to be approximately $785 million, $65 million lower than prior guidance. That reduction reflects fewer planned engine overhauls and the removal of two A321 feedstock purchases from our plan when the counterparty decided not to move forward with a sale leaseback transaction. Investments in A330 freighter conversions will continue as planned including our first three feedstock purchases this year for lease to customers in 2024. We're eager to launch this next phase of our fleet development plan with our first 330 conversion induction in October and the second to enter conversion by year-end. While we remain confident in global e-commerce growth driving strong demand for our midsized freighters, we intend to time our feedstock investments when possible to more closely tie purchases to induction dates. We are focusing on generating strong returns on capital and making sure we see the demand to support the investments in the conversions. We currently expect to spend less for both growth and sustaining CapEx in 2024 than this year. The reduction in our fleet investment outlook gives us even more flexibility to return capital to shareholders should our shares remain undervalued. Our next slide covers our outlook for the rest of the year. With the positive trends we see in passenger airlines and a strong pipeline of freighter deliveries in the second half, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2023 of $610 million to $620 million, but raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $1.65 to $1.80 per share. That increase reflects our projections for second half leased freighter deployments and improved ACMI Services performance. Our balance sheet remains strong. We have a leadership position in the midsized freighter leasing market and a blue-chip roster of large express and e-commerce customers. Those factors are why we remain attractive to credit investors who support our credit facility and debt securities. Our employees stand ready to deliver our 2023 goals and generate long-term superior returns for our shareholders. Along those lines, I'd like to thank the teams at all of our businesses for their continued efforts to deliver unparalleled services to our customers and especially those who maintained solid on-time performance during Amazon's Prime Days event last month. That concludes our prepared remarks. Quint and I along with Mike Berger, our Chief Strategy Officer and Paul Chase, our Chief Commercial Officer are ready to answer your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Frank Galanti with Stifel. Your line is open.\nFrank Galanti: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the ACMI segment. It's really good to see the margin improvement there. But can you talk about expectations for that segment for the remainder of the year? How does that generally look from a seasonality perspective? And then from a visibility perspective from what you've seen on contract refreshes and the passenger demand?\nRich Corrado: Hi, Frank, thank you for the question. So on the passenger side, we are -- we've evaluated the outlook in terms of the -- we had a nice improvement in the second quarter and we see a strong third quarter from the passenger side. And then the fourth quarter is generally a seasonal quarter for the passenger side and we look to that to be flat as compared to last year. So we're confident that the gains that the passenger segment gained in Q2 will continue in Q3 and be flat for the fourth quarter, which is generally what they see. On the cargo side, we've been encouraged by the block hours that we're going to be doing in the fourth quarter. It's really going to be flat over last year, but when you compare that to what's going on in the general cargo market, which has been fairly weak we look to be holding our own. Remember our ACMI operations on the cargo side are generally or -- are targeted at specific network flying that's geared towards e-commerce and integrated packages and that has reacted differently to the downturn than general air cargo.\nMike Berger: If I could just answer the seasonality piece, and it's Mike Berger. As Amazon announced, they had record Prime Days earlier a few weeks back. And that normally translates to a very strong seasonality season as we get into peak season as well.\nFrank Galanti: Okay. That's helpful. And then switching over to CAM. It looks like the growth CapEx has come down, but that looked like it was mostly from engines and engine maintenance and then the two A321s. Have there been any changes this year for the 767s or the A330s? And what are you seeing for demand for those planes?\nRich Corrado: So on the demand for both the 767s and the 330s we're on plan for the year. We'll deliver 14 767-300s this year and five A321s and we'll be putting our first two A330s into conversion. So all -- the customer demand remains strong in all of those aircraft that we have in our plan going forward. You'll recall we guided to 20 last quarter. We dropped that to 19 and that's really related to one aircraft that is -- will be out of conversion but will be awaiting a service bulletin and kit from Airbus. And we've tried several different avenues to try to improve the timing on that, but it looks like it's going to push to next year in the first quarter.\nFrank Galanti: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nRich Corrado: Thanks Frank.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Jack Atkins with Stephens Inc. Your line is open.\nJack Atkins: Okay great. Good morning, guys. Congratulations, on a nice rebound quarter here.\nA \u2013 Rich Corrado: Good morning, Jack\nQuint Turner: Good morning, Jack\nJack Atkins: So, I guess Quint, if I could maybe start I just would love to make sure expectations are calibrated correctly for the third quarter. I mean, how are you thinking about -- within the context of EBITDA guidance, how are you thinking about results sequentially? Would you expect them to be fairly consistent, maybe a little bit of improvement? Just want to make sure we're all kind of thinking about that, within the context of your outlook.\nQuint Turner: Yes, appreciate the question, Jack. I think that third quarter of course, as we mentioned on the CAM side, we had some returns that came back, so you get sort of the full quarter effect as some of those came back during the second quarter there. But on the ACMI Services side, we're expecting a very similar strong performance there. So I think overall, third quarter as a whole ATSG will look similar to second quarter in terms of the production. And I think the sequential progress that will be more evident in the fourth quarter, because there you'll have all the deployments that Mike's mentioned, contributing. And we do expect a sequential improvement in fourth quarter, right now, in the second half. And of course, we've given you our guidance range on EBITDA, so you know kind of what the whole second half is projected at. So, hopefully, that helps a little bit.\nJack Atkins: Yes. No, that's great. That's perfect, and I appreciate that context. So, I guess maybe shifting gears to the passenger operations and just maybe expanding on that a bit. It looks like you made some changes from a leadership perspective there, during the quarter. Could you maybe talk about just the progress that you've made in terms of recouping, some of the inflationary costs that you've been seeing? I mean, do you feel like you've made the progress that you wanted, or is there additional sort of opportunity left to go to kind of get that business back operating like you want? \nA \u2013 Rich Corrado: Yes. So, thanks for the question, Jack. In terms of Omni's passenger operations, they were already on their way to operating efficiencies in the first quarter and we're able to leverage that into -- during the second quarter, for improvement. They reduced their headcount is one thing, just for attrition. We didn't furlough anybody. And they were able to -- many times they fly into markets where they may make one stop or they may go through there for a full quarter. And so they're able to negotiate, for ground handling for catering, and some other things to get better cost efficiencies out of those operations. They've also looked at real estate. They've really done a nice job, with kind of looking at any cost in their operation and trimming that out. So, they've done a good job in getting additional revenue. They sold three ACMI opportunities, commercial opportunities outside the government business that were multi-month, opportunities that they'll leverage probably some of them through October, and somewhere in the third quarter. So, we're able to do both improve both on the revenue side, and both -- and on the cost side. The government did help. Their block hours picked up in the second quarter. Again, Omni's got a seasonal tone to it and generally, the second and third quarter, are their strong seasons. \nJack Atkins: Okay. No, that's great to hear. And glad that business is seeing some improvements there. I guess maybe for my last question, shifting gears here to CapEx. You guys definitely sort of heard the voice of the shareholders I think just in terms of the CapEx plans. And I think it's encouraging to see you kind of trim it, for this year. As you're thinking about next year in 2024, you talked about 2024 CapEx being below 2023. I know you're still forming your plan, but is there kind of a way to think about order of magnitude? To what degree can 2024 CapEx be below 2023? I know that you still have probably quite -- you have more room to work that than you do 2023, so I just would be curious to kind of get your take on that. \nA \u2013 Rich Corrado: Yes. We've been looking at the 2024 CapEx, since the beginning of the year, as you know. And you're, right, we heard the shareholders loud and clear. But we still have great growth opportunities in front of us. But there are some efficiencies, we looked from a cash-to-cash cycle. In other words, when we buy an airplane, how long does it take us to put it through conversion? Historically, due to the feedstock environment on the 767 in particular and our -- when you normally like to buy multiple aircraft from an operator we were buying lots of airplanes and weren't necessarily able to have as much control, if you will over the deliveries of those. Going forward, we're looking to minimize that. So take delivery of an airplane in the year in which we're going to do the conversion rather than have them parked. So, we'll be -- in looking at that and looking at some of the programs and deals that were going on for the feedstock for 2024, we feel we'll be able to reduce the CapEx without really impacting the delivery profile that we've got lined out for that. So if I were to -- we haven't done exact calculations yet. We've put order of magnitude maybe $100 million lower than 2023. But again, we're not guiding to that number. We're just looking at where we can be for given the demand that we have and what we can set up for the future. \nJack Atkins: Okay. Well, I promise I'll hold you to that number. But no I think that's great that you guys are able to find efficiencies that way and lower CapEx, while still maintaining the opportunity for growth. So that's great to hear. Congratulations again and I'll pass it on. \nA \u2013 Rich Corrado: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist. Your line is open.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking questions.\nPaul Chase : Good morning.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Nice results. Quint maybe just mechanical here on sort of the second half, I'm assuming some of the debt pay-down retired some of the convertible. The share count went down. And then the second half adjusted earnings looks to be lower than the first half EBITDA up. Is there something -- is it just interest expense, or what's that kind of disconnect with EBITDA being up first half but adjusted earnings being down first half? \nQuint Turner: Well, there's -- in terms of the of course the guidance change it was centered a lot on interest and depreciation, Michael because we've had -- for one thing as we talked about in the remarks earlier we had airplanes that I think we were expecting to get six airplanes deployed during the second quarter and I think we got one, right? But then in the last 30 days, we deployed six new leased airplanes, which is pretty remarkable. So since the quarter ended we've deployed, but what that -- so we've had some sliding of CapEx spend, which of course has a positive impact on interest expense. And also we don't start depreciating until assets go into revenue service. So that had a positive impact on that as well. And then the CapEx reductions making our CapEx spend more efficient, as Rich just described, some engine overhauls that we were able to reduce our CapEx projection by, all that combined has had a favorable impact on both those line items depreciation and interest. \nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then just can you give us an update on status of negotiations with the pilots union? I mean, I guess, it sounds like still status quo and you don't kind of think anything's imminent here either resolution or one way or another but just maybe a general update on what's happening there. \nRich Corrado : Yes. Thanks Michael. It's Rich. Yes so we're in mediation with both of our pilot unions at Omni and at ATI. And as we said before, we've always been able to come to agreement with our unions. And our goal always is to get the right contract where we can attract and retain the pilots that we have, and then also have the cost structure that we're able -- from which we're able to compete for business and that's our goal. And we've maintained that. We don't expect that either CBA will be settled prior to 2024. So it's pretty much similar to what we talked about last quarter. \nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. Okay. Perfect. Thanks guys. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue.\nRich Corrado : Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Thomas Fitzgerald with Cowen. Your line is open.\nThomas Fitzgerald : Hi. Thanks very much for the time everyone. The last couple of quarters, you've mentioned the theme about how many less freighters were retired during the pandemic than in a normal period. And I was just wondering if you could remind or just walk investors through how. Are you already seeing that in the lease rates for your freighters and the longer-term opportunity in that freighter market as demand seems like it's really going to inflect higher in the middle part of the decade? It just seems like an exciting theme and you're probably the best way to play it longer term. Thanks very much.\nRich Corrado: Yes. So where we're seeing, it playing out -- and you're right, just to recall during a normal year pre-pandemic about 70 freighters were retired and then that's skinny-ed down to about 15 during each year during the pandemic those three years. And so there was a pent-up demand for retiring assets. And so what we're seeing is a lot of the -- not in our segment but the 734s that were being retired and replaced by 738s or A321s, which is good for our segment because we're -- as you know, we're getting into that aircraft. And so it's one of those things that we're keeping a close eye on. There's a lot of larger airplanes coming out that have been announced MD-11s out of UPS and FedEx as an example. Those are being replaced by -- predominantly by 767s by those operators. So there is some definite movement in terms of retirements and replacement freighters.\nMike Berger: Yes. And in the forecast, I appreciate you mentioning it. The forecast from Boeing and Airbus over the next 20 years is to see new freighters in excess of 2500 and 2800, and if we skinny that down to what we're really focused on from a medium wide-body standpoint, that's anywhere from just under 900 to just over 1200. So, demand for freighters over the next couple of decades is going to continue to be strong. The Boeing and Airbus forecast was just raised another 5% recently. So real strong validation of what we're doing.\nThomas Fitzgerald: Thanks very much. That's really helpful. And then just kind of curious another big theme that's been coming up on the calls is the opportunity in e-commerce and emerging markets. I'm just curious if you have anything new or anything interesting to share with investors on what's going on in that space. Thanks very much.\nPaul Chase: Sure. Paul Chase, here. So as we've stated before right the assets that we deploy are targeted to these global e-commerce and integrated networks. And in many reports you're seeing that these networks are projecting double-digit growth outside the United States. And you're seeing continued cross-border barriers to e-commerce. They are facilitating more movements of door-to-door goods between these countries. So when you look at our freighter deployments, roughly 80% of those aircraft are going outside the United States. So we're confident in the long-term outlook.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Christopher Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Rich or Quint, what was utilization for the fleet in 2Q I guess in block hours per segment or however you typically measure that? And then, if you could break it out on the passenger side, what it was for the US DoD versus commercial?\nQuint Turner: Chris, this is Quint. We had the total block hours in the second quarter were about 46,800 roughly. I'll round it to the nearest hundred 46,800 block hours. And in terms of the DoD, the DoD made up -- and again, there's -- they have -- you're talking about our combi flying. We do the 757 combi flying and we also do passenger flying for the DoD. And that was about 7,500 of those hours.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: And then on a per day basis, I just want to see if you were -- if you got back to where you typically are where you need to be.\nQuint Turner: Well, I mean certainly sequentially that was a nice increase as we talked about. Last quarter, you recall that was part of the explanation on the results last quarter was some lower hours there. So, nice increases sequentially. When you're comparing to the prior year, keep in mind we had the things going on in Europe that were taking longer segments. We were flying back and forth to Europe.. And so the hours were actually higher in second quarter if you're talking about -- still talking about the DoD. Those hours were higher. And we also were not operating a long route for the combi. We've talked about that, right? There's what we call the Deep Pacific route which with those 757 combis that was added last fall. So it wasn't in the second quarter a year ago. So we were flying like 8,000 hours for the -- a little over 8,000 hours in the second quarter a year ago, but those were longer routes. And so you had that going on. But in terms of rate per hour, I think, Omni realized some benefit from a better revenue or rate per hour this year than they had in the prior year. And again that is part of the -- that's one of the drivers of the success that we spoke of with our passenger results for Q2 passenger operations. \nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And on the 200s could you just remind us the age of that aircraft in years or cycle times? And then how does the efficiency I guess fuel compare to the 300? Just trying to get a sense of what the appetite might be for those 200s versus the 300s, which have more flyable years. \nQuint Turner: Yes, Rich will jump in here. But just remember the 200s what we talk about is our useful life post conversion because remember the cargo conversion for an aircraft is really substantial, right? And we've talked about that the heavier structures that are put in the upgrades to the cockpit it kind of comes out as a newly built airplane. And we generally expect to get kind of 20 years post conversion. A lot of the 767-200s that we're talking about went into service in the late '90s, right? \nRich Corrado: Well, for the first conversion. \nQuint Turner: Yes, coming out of conversion, right? So they've sort of achieved that kind of lifespan that I just described. The 767-300 fleet in comparison is relative -- is quite young in terms of age since it came out of conversion. I mean I don't have -- I haven't calculated the average lately, but it was like five years four, five years out of conversion. Because remember we put in significant numbers of those as our -- as e-commerce has picked up and as we have -- as CAM has begun producing double-digit numbers of 767-300s. So our 763 fleet is pretty young in that respect. In terms of cycle life and you're right to focus on that because that is more relevant in determining when an airplane might be getting near a point where it makes some economic sense to perhaps retire. And for the 200s what we've talked about is kind of 50,000 cycles on the airframe as a benchmark. And the reason for that is -- isn't that you have to take it out of service at that level or anything, but there are some additional maintenance inspection requirements that come into play when the airplane comes in for its C-check. And that probably drives some additional cost because you have to open up more areas and look at them to comply with those requirements. And there is -- I think there's an aft pressure bulkhead AD. It's not particularly onerous. I think, I don't know cost of $1.5 million to $2 million to take care of it. But those are things that come into play. So as Rich mentioned we evaluate the 200s on a case by case but many of our 200 fleet is still pretty young in cycle life. I mean, we have some out there flying routes that are in the 20,000s right in terms of their cycle time. So far away from the 50,000. \nRich Corrado: If you look at the efficiency of the aircraft, which is -- it's still and even when you compare to the 767-300 or any other comparable aircraft an A300-600 Airbus as an example, the 767-200 if you're only handling between 85,000 and 100,000 pounds in a lane is the most efficient solution today despite the age of the aircraft. So it's still an efficient aircraft for the missions that it's pointed at. The 767-300 is a larger airplane handles about 20% 25% more volume and weight. So it really provides a different mission, but the 767-200 is still a good opportunity in the e-commerce market. \nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. If I could squeeze in one more. On the CAM breakout so now that we have a sense of size as it relates to EBITDA last time I checked I think CAM was somewhere in the 25 or top 25 or top 25 to 30 in terms of lessors. Is there a plan to get to top 20, top 15? And if so, would that imply further diversification with aircraft type? I realize your business is very different from someone like, an AerCap. But with the relative size here even I'm curious how we should think about that business let's say through mid-decade and beyond top 15, top 20 player. Thank you.\nRich Corrado: Yeah. Thank you for the question. We really don't -- that's really not in our view. We don't look to be ranked in a certain place. We don't think that really lowers our cost or raises our profitability. We're focused on investment returns and capital allocation in the best interest of our shareholders.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rich Corrado, for any final comments.\nRich Corrado: Thank you, Operator. As we talked, we've made some significant changes and got some operating efficiencies out of our ACMI operations over the past quarter. We're focused on returns -- our capital returns for our shareholders. And we're looking forward to completing the year in great fashion. In our business the number of freighter lease deployments, military charter flights and maintenance checks can be -- can vary materially from one quarter to the next. But the long-term trend is consistent, predictable and resilient. The freighters, we lease the aircraft we fly and the support services we provide are essential to the fast and efficient delivery of military personnel, e-commerce goods and other cargo within the many regional networks now forming and expanding around the world. We intend to remain at the center of that process with the right mix of medium aircraft, talented people and customer-focused businesses and well-considered capital allocation strategies that will continue to generate superior returns for our investors over the long run. Thank you for listening to our call today. And as always, please stay safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 1, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-05-05 17:20:21", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Air Transport Services Group First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, There will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] A reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Joe Payne, Chief Legal Officer. Please go ahead.\nJoe Payne: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website, atsginc.com. Let me begin by advising you that during the course of this call, we will make projections and other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans, and estimates as of the date of this call. Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information, or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to unplanned changes in the market demand for our assets and services, our operating airline's ability to maintain on-time service and control costs. The cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration; fluctuations in ATSG's traded share price and in interest rates, which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments; the number, timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers; our ability to remain in compliance with key agreements with customers, lenders and government agencies; the impact of current supply chain constraints, both within and outside the US, which may be more severe or persists longer than we currently expect. The impact of the current competitive labor market, changes in general economic and/or industry-specific conditions, including inflation, the impact of geographical events or health epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other factors as contained from time-to-time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-Q we will file next week. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pre-tax earnings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials. We advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Rich Corrado, our President and CEO, for his opening remarks.\nRich Corrado: Thanks Joe and good morning everyone. On our last call, we talked about the headwinds facing us in 2023 and in our operating businesses, but mostly at our airlines. Unfortunately, the results we issued yesterday and our guidance change for the year as a whole, show that reduced revenues at our passenger airline omni and inflation-driven cost at all of our airlines are having a bigger effect than we expected. We are not alone in this regard. Inflation and a softening macro economy are squeezing profitability in many sectors and especially in transport. We have limited exposure to fuel costs, but our personnel costs are rising, including the line maintenance workers and travel for flight crews shuttling between assignments. That said, we are fortunate that demand for our leased cargo aircraft remains strong. Our guidance changes were not related to CAM which deployed two of the record 20 phrases we will lease this year at rates that meet our return requirements. I'll be back to share more of that perspective after Quint reviews our financial results for the first quarter. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks Rich and welcome to everyone on the call this morning. As he just said, our first quarter results show that inflation remains a key concern and its specific impacts on our businesses were greater than they were when we talked to you in February. Inflation is affecting all businesses, but the principal impact is in our ACMI Services segment. The next slide in our deck summarizes the results that Rich mentioned. Our revenues grew $15 million or 3% versus a year ago to a record $501 million for the first quarter. Both of our principal segments as well as our other businesses in total contributed to that increase. In fact, among all of our operating businesses, only Omni Air, our passenger airline, did not grow its revenues versus a very strong first quarter last year. Our GAAP pre-tax earnings were down $39 million and basic earnings per share were $0.28 versus $0.67 in the first quarter of 2022. On an adjusted basis, pre-tax earnings fell $26 million to $38 million, and earnings per share was down $0.20 to $0.36. Our aircraft leasing segment, CAM, delivered all of our segment earnings for the quarter. Its pre-tax earnings were roughly flat with a year ago at $34 million, mostly due to higher interest expense and freighter deployment delays. Our ACMI Services segment, which includes all three of our operating airlines, had a $2 million pre-tax loss on $334 million in revenues for the quarter. That loss at ACMI Services is mostly attributable to Omni Air or passenger airline, which experienced sharply higher cost and $26 million fewer revenues than it did a year ago. Airline block hours were roughly flat versus the prior year quarter even with more aircraft in service as scheduled flight segments were shorter this year than before. Passenger block hours were down 25%, cargo block hours were up 4% for the quarter. Block hours for our 757 combi operations for the military were up sharply as a Transpacific route was reinstated last fall. On the next slide, you can see that versus the 12 months ended in December 2022, our adjusted EBITDA was down to $621 million for the 12 months ended in March. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $138 million. Federal pandemic relief grants under the Payroll Support Programs have had no effect on our results since 2021. On the next slide, you'll see that our capital spending continues to increase effectively from growth investments in our leased freighter fleet. Sustaining CapEx, mainly for airframe and engine maintenance, technology and other equipment grew at a slower pace and includes capitalized engine maintenance services for our 767-200 lease customers. Total CapEx was $219 million for the first quarter. Growth CapEx was $165 million, up $93 million from the prior year, both to convert existing aircraft of freighters and to buy more feedstock. We deployed two newly converted 767-300 freighters during the first quarter. The next slide updates our adjusted free cash flow as measured by our operating cash flow, net of our sustaining CapEx. Operating cash increased $91 million to $216 million in the first quarter or $563 million for the trailing 12 months, net of sustaining CapEx of $205 million over 12 months. Adjusted free cash flow is up $73 million to $358 million on a 12-month basis. The cash flow gain reflects reimbursement of fuel cost from Omni's federal government customers, which had been slower when we talked to you in February. On the next slide, you can see that available credit under our revolver facilities in the US and abroad was $388 million at the end of the first quarter with an option for additional capacity subject to bank approvals. That includes a $100 million credit facility in Ireland we established in March. Our capital allocation strategy continues to include share repurchases. We bought back approximately $1 million of our common shares in the first quarter after $2 million in repurchases during the fourth quarter. With that summary of our financial and operating results, I'll turn it back to Rich for some comments on our operations and outlook. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks Quint. Please turn to the next slide. As I said earlier, we had hoped to begin 2023 on a path to deliver better results as measured by adjusted EBITDA than the $640 million we delivered last year, but that's clearly not where we stand today. We have reduced our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance by approximately $40 million and our adjusted EPS guidance by about $0.30 to levels more consistent with the results that we believe our businesses can achieve in the current environment. As Quint said, inflation is driving up costs throughout the company. Our peers are reporting the same pressures on their own margins. In our case, the most dramatic effects are on the operating cost of our airlines, and higher interest expense. For airlines, line maintenance is the cost of keeping aircraft in shape during normal operating cycles. The cost of those services has been growing at double-digit rates over the past two years and above what we had budgeted at the start of the year. We also pay passenger airlines to move our crews to the next assignments. For example, on these costs for flight crude transport reflecting fare increases that the traveling public is also facing are up more than 35% per cycle in the first quarter versus a year ago. Throughout the company, our businesses are engaged in efforts to address inflation and cut costs, line maintenance, travel, and other procurement costs, as well as rightsizing personnel requirements to business volumes are areas of focus. Within our ACMI Services segment, Omni's first quarter results were down, including lower revenues for both commercial and government customers. Those results were affected by the appetite of other passenger airlines to participate more fully in the Defense Department's craft program this year. Many clinicians in the first quarter that Omni had flown in earlier periods. Even if Omni's total DoD block hours do not increase significantly this year, it expects to benefit from better pricing under its DoD contracts starting in October. Omni's flying also consists of charter awards from other government and commercial customers that it bids based on real-time costs. We anticipate that those assignments will cover any shortfall in craft lying. Our cargo airlines fly under long-term CMI agreements, which include annual price adjustments, some of which will occur this quarter. Controlling costs between CMI escalations has always been a focus of our airlines. Ongoing inflationary trends have only magnified their imperative. That, along with their ability to win peak season and other limited term contracts throughout the year are essential to our margins in that business. Please go to the next slide. We told you last time that our fleet investments will increase over the next two years based on strong demand for our freighters. Many airline customers, mainly overseas, have made commitments to lease our cargo aircraft as they complete conversion. We expect to deliver 14 767s and six A321s to customers this year. The main constraint on our ability to do so are extended conversion turnaround times at our vendors and certification of our Airbus A321 freighters. Resolving the international regulatory issues for the A321 have taken longer than expected. The US FAA has already certified the A321 based on our design. We are working directly on final remaining issues with regulators elsewhere. Pending a resolution of this issue, we intend to take a measured approach to our A321 freighter program, which could reduce our 2024 CapEx, that's a situation we will monitor throughout the year and make adjustments as appropriate if circumstances change. We have heard from some investors who questioned whether the stepped up capital spending we will need to convert and deploy the number of freighters our customers want is the most prudent use of capital. We agree that our 2023 capital budget of $850 million, including $590 million for fleet growth is substantially more than we have spent before. Despite the economic environment, we fully expect to earn double-digit returns on the growth capital we invest, which has long been our benchmark commitment. If freighter demand does not support our expected returns, we have the flexibility to significantly reduce our planned growth investments in 2024 and beyond and reallocate that capital in favor of debt reduction more share repurchases or other alternatives. It's clear to us as well as many of you that under our current stock price multiple, we can create additional value through share repurchases. Our decisions about capital allocation will always be driven by what creates the most value for shareholders. Please go to the next slide. Our new guidance for 2023 projects adjusted EBITDA of a range between $610 million to $620 million in 2023 and adjusted EPS of $1.55 to $1.70. While we face challenges in 2023, we expect our earnings and cash flow growth to resume in 2024 and beyond from fleet investments and higher lease rates. We will continue to have a strong balance sheet, a leadership position in the midsized freighter leasing market with large express and e-commerce customers and the strong backing of investors in our credit facility and debt securities. Our employees are prepared to execute against all of our 2023 plans with a goal to generate long-term superior returns for our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Quint and I, along with Mike Berger, our Chief Strategy Officer, are ready to answer questions. May we have the first question, operator?\nOperator: Certainly. And our first question comes from the line Jack Atkins from Stephens. Your question please.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Great. Good morning guys and thanks for taking my questions. So, I guess if we could maybe start, Quint, just to make sure everybody is kind of positioned correctly, thinking about the cadence. Within the framework of your guidance, I mean, how are you thinking about improvement in earnings or EBITDA sequentially? And how do you break down the EBITDA guide between sort of maybe first half, second half. Can you maybe give us some framework to think about that?\nQuint Turner: Sure Jack. Thanks. It is second half weighted, is the way -- the way we're projecting right now. And in terms of thinking about the segments, the second half improvement, a lot of that is driven in the ACMI Services segment. CAM is more of a sort of a steady -- fairly steady EBITDA contribution with growth as we move through the year. But ACMI Services, I believe the second quarter will be some modest improvement but more of the improvement is in the second half. If you think about Omni, Omni, its busiest time sort of June through October, typically and that drives some of that. And of course, the cargo carriers as they head into peak season and as additional aircraft are added, we've got some customer aircraft coming on for example, in the ATI fleet, that's the drivers in that balance. So, EBITDA-wise, we're looking at some improvement certainly in the second quarter and then in the third and fourth more of that as we finish off the year.\nJack Atkins: Got it. But I mean, if you did say, $138 million in the first quarter in EBITDA, the guide at the midpoint $615 million. As you sort of -- you said second have improvement, just kind of roughly speaking, like what percentage of the EBITDA -- full year EBITDA would you expect in the second half of the year just so we can kind of think about that.\nQuint Turner: I would say -- we'll run that for you here quickly.\nJack Atkins: Okay. I can move on and then we can come back to that, if that's if that's okay.\nQuint Turner: Sure.\nJack Atkins: So, I guess Rich or Mike, as you sort of think about the pipeline of demand for the core part of the business here, which is midsized freighter releasing, whether it's the 767, 300, A330. Have you seen any sort of change in customer demand in the last few months with everything that's been going on in the economy? Anything that would make you think that folks are getting a little bit less confident in their forward expectations around demand?\nMike Berger: Jack, we haven't seen any erosion to the order book at all in 2023, inclusive of 2024. And if you look out at our 330s that we've talked about now for several quarters, we still have over 20 commitments with deposits on those and we start inducting those later this year. Our first couple will go into induction. So when we look at the 2024, 2025, and 2026 specifically, with those new aircraft coming in, we still see a very, very solid and bullish market. And when we look at the industry forecast as a whole, the big Boeing forecast and the cargo FX forecast, when you look at even further in a much broader view, 10, 20 years or so, those continue to be very, very strong in regards to the medium wide-body needs for the industry, close to 900 over the next 20 years or so. So, short-term, to answer your question specifically, still very solid, no erosion. And from an industry broader view, still very, very bullish.\nRich Corrado: Jack, this is Rich. Just a couple of other points to add on to Mike. Interesting data from serum involving freighters that during the pandemic -- during a normal course of a normal year, there's about 70 freighters that are retired each year. During the pandemic, that was only about 15. And so you're looking at 165 airplanes over that three-year period that may or would have been retired of different sizes, right? And so there's been a pent-up demand for rightsizing aircraft and for replacing older airframes with new airframes going forward on top of the fact that e-commerce growth is better outside this country than certainly it's growing inside this country. If you look at the order book, just quickly on the 767 side that as an example, for 2023, 11 of the 14 aircraft that will deliver this year, they're to existing customers that already lease airplanes from us. So, we've got a we've got ongoing regular dialogue with these folks, and we're really confident in the order book for 2023.\nQuint Turner: Jack, just circling back on your question on the cadence of EBITDA. The second half is about 54% of the total. So sort of a 46-54 split between the two halves.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Okay. I appreciate that, Quint. And I appreciate the sort of the thoughts on the outlook. So, I guess when you put it all together, I mean, the stock is down about 40%, 45% so far this year. And if you go back kind of benchmark the reduction in EBITDA, the bottom end of your guidance versus word at the Street was before for 2023, I think it's about a 13% reduction. So pretty aggressive move down your -- the stock is -- it's not about of confidence, I guess, in the CapEx plan as you sort of think about both this year and next year. So I guess Rich, you don't want to make a knee-jerk reaction to sort of how the stock is trading, but you've got a $1.1 billion market cap and you're spending $600 million or so on growth CapEx. I mean at what point do you think about sort of other alternatives for your capital to sort of better align your cash flows with supporting the stock here, we haven't seen it this cheap since 2016.\nRich Corrado: Yes. Well, first off, we -- prior to this quarter, we thought just for the guidance that there was an overreaction to the stock. And that it should have been higher before we got to this quarter's results. And look, we do have flexibility going forward. We -- in terms of dialing back on CapEx for 2024, we've got different scenarios and everything. We do have customer commitments for just about all the freighters that are coming out in 2024 as well. And so in backing off on any of that, it would be a significant decision. We believe that if you look at the book of freighters that we're going to put on in 2023, they will deliver a little over $70 million in revenue in 2024, and we have a high conversion of adjusted EBITDA to revenue on the leasing business. So, we feel that this is a good use of capital. The lease rates are something that we're focused on right now, particularly for 2024 to make sure that we have the right returns for those airplanes. And we think we're staying the course at this point in time. But again, we do have flexibility should we need to adjust.\nJack Atkins: Okay.\nQuint Turner: And Jack, the adjustment in the guide is strictly related to ACMI services. I mean the CAM investments are generating returns that we expect. And if that doesn't -- somehow that were to change. As Rich said, we do have some flexibility to reduce our CapEx spending. And at the same time, we understand how attractive our own stock is as an investment at these prices and so that isn't lost on us. So, the capital allocation is always going to be done with an eye towards what generates the best value. And we think there's value creation through directing capital to both share repurchase and growth. The headwinds we've faced this quarter have been strictly limited to the ACMI Services segment, and at least on the revenue side this quarter, it's more related to our passenger flying, which we referenced in the release. We do think that, that is going to improve as we move through the year. We also mentioned the inflation, which continues to be an issue for us. But there are adjustments in the contract that our airlines have that should help that as well as the cost control measures that all of our subsidiaries are undertaking right now.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Maybe one other final quick question, and I'll hand it over. I don't want to hog all the questions. But I guess as you sort of think about the valuation of the company today on an enterprise value basis, relative to your asset value and the value of the cash flow of the company. At what point does it make sense to maybe think about private market valuations and what an infrastructure fund or somebody like that would be willing to value ATSG yet, if the public equity holders won't value the company appropriately?\nQuint Turner: Well, Jack, this is Quint. We certainly understand the question. And we have looked at our valuation, our public valuation. And when you look at what the company produces in terms of the cash flows, the adjusted EBITDA, kind of the way -- we believe that somebody from the outside to look at it is when you think about our leasing EBITDA, which is the majority of the company's EBITDA, it's over $400 million to $500 million of EBITDA and you put a multiple on that as PE firms often do. Now, leasing multiples tend to be higher, 8 plus. But if you put something even lower than that on there, which to be very conservative and do the same with our ACMI Services EBITDA which last year was, I think, over $200 million. This year, obviously, is going to be down. And ACMI Service has been -- airline multiples tend to be lower. And so again, put a conservative multiple on that as well as the other businesses, the MRO and logistics businesses. And then, of course, reduce the debt. But I think what gets lost is we have 500-plus million of assets in process. The assets we have in conversion. Those 27 aircraft that, as Rich described, have customer contracts waiting on them. And if you just simply assume that at cost at what our invested dollars are, again, take out the debt, take out something for Amazon warrants that's kind of how we think of it. And when we look at that, we spread it over a per share value, we get a valuation that's conservatively closer to 30 than it is 20, and certainly, we're even below that as we speak here. So, to us, it appears, your point is well taken that the public valuation doesn't seem to be getting credit for the assets that are in process, those 27 aircraft. And even at a conservative multiple on our EBITDA which for our leasing entity, we've got a lot of long-term leases and cash flows that we can look at as well as contracts for the assets in process. It seems to be a very attractive valuation at release at our current public valuation. And we have looked at it in that fashion.\nJack Atkins: Okay. All right. Well, thank you for going through that Quint. I appreciate it. Thanks guys.\nQuint Turner: Thanks Jack.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Your question please.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much. Hi guys. So, just a question on the ATI pilots. That contract is open. And they've been very aggressive and very vocal about wanting more money. They've talked about service issues and attrition rates. And I'm wondering if you could just give us an update on what's happening with that and how you're thinking about covering the cost of a potential increase?\nRich Corrado: Sure. Helane it's Rich. Thanks for the question. It's not unusual for labor unions to put out press releases in regard, particularly around benchmark earnings calls and play out labor relations in the media. We don't think that's fruitful on our part. I can comment on the service quality of ATI, which is outstanding. And as an example, we get paid a bonus for making service with our customers, and they made the bonus two months out of this year so far. So we're in pretty good shape. We're in really good shape in May so far as far as service goes. There has been crew attrition. We've talked about crew attrition on other earnings calls. It's prevalent in the industry. It's common between our 3 airlines. It's a situation that we're managing. We're still able to attract crews with a good amount of experience and a good amount of flying hours, well over the minimum and train them and get them into the network to be productive. So we're in good shape as it relates to moving forward with crews. But it has raised our cost and it's one of the inflationary cost pressures that we have. When you have -- when you're training pilots to replace pilots that are [indiscernible], you've got an unproductive resource while you're going through that training period, which is anywhere from 70 to 90 days. So it has impacted our cost situation. As far as the union agreement goes and the cost going forward, the kind of negotiation is now in mediation and the mediation. Both parties agreed they have taken it in terms of Alpha in terms of ATI and taking the negotiation as far as they could take it by themselves, and it's now in mediation. So, they'll be going through and iterating contract issues, et cetera. As it relates to the cost side of that, we have always maintained for -- in the past when we've negotiated union agreements and for this union agreement as well that we need pricing, our contract rates and benefits that allow us to attract the best pilots we possibly can while also focusing on the fact that we need to be competitive. And we need to be able to compete for business in the ACMI segment of flying. Those two parameters still guide our decision processes in this fashion. I can't really comment on the amount of increase or that going forward. But like I said, it will play out a course of probably at least the rest of this year given that the contract is in mediation.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Is there -- are there any accruals in the guidance for any increases? I don't remember how you guys normally do that?\nQuint Turner: Yes. We don't -- I mean the contract or the amendment resolution are ways off Helane, and it's -- that's nothing we ever comment on or -- but typically, we're not expecting a compact resolution for a while, you just based on past industry, it usually takes longer to work through a mediated process. And so as we get closer and we see what's going -- how things are shaking out, we'll appropriately record whatever we need to. But--\nHelane Becker: No, I mean, Quint, that's pretty standard. Some airlines will not accrue until they have a better sense of what the contract is going to look like and some accrue a little amount. So, I just didn't remember how you guys did it. I wanted to ask about the 12 767s that were due to come up for renewal this year. I know four were re-leased. Three were not going to be because you were going to use those aircraft because there's time on the engine, so you could use them for other customers. What's the status of the other five? Do we know that? Did I miss something there?\nQuint Turner: Yes, I mean what we said previously, I think still goes, Helane, we would look to re-lease or sell the other five.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Has anything happened with those yet?\nQuint Turner: Well, right now, there's still--\nRich Corrado: Right now, they're still in operation, but we've got commitments to sell four the returns as we progress through the end of the year.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Is the proceeds or the timing -- the proceeds included in the guidance? And is the timing -- do you -- I mean you must know the timing.\nQuint Turner: It would be in the second half, right would be in the -- what we were the third and fourth quarter sort of split between those quarters, and it is in the guidance.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Frank Galanti from Stifel. Your question please.\nFrank Galanti: Yes, great. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on thinking about the business as two separate entities. right? You've got CAM, the leasing long-term contracts, much more stable, right, your public peers, although not in the cargo, right, are trading at nine, 10 times Air Lease, air cap. And even if you look at the Atlas Air takeout, doing that kind of split, you had about eight, eight and a half times on the leasing side. And then the question really gets down to two parts. One, is it reasonable to think about the company as two entities like that, right? It seems to me that they're inherently intertwined as -- the main reason the leasing business is so large is the value-added services through the ACMI business. And then a second part of that is long-term ACMI margins. And so we saw in the pandemic, those margins jumped 4%, 5%, 6%. But if you look through the history, those were just breaking even and negative for a couple of years. Can you sort of talk about those two components? What -- is it reasonable to think about the businesses separate and then ACMI margins on a long-term basis, what gives you confidence that those shouldn't go back to zero, but they should stay at the 4%, 5%, 6%? Or where do you envision that in the medium term?\nQuint Turner: Thanks Frank. I'll start here, and I think Rich will join in here. But historically, on the ACMI Services segment -- and first of all, we do bifurcate that's why we report them separately as segments, right? So, we think of the businesses, the leasing business separate from the airline ACMI piece. And the ACMI services piece tends to be more asset-light. Obviously, the CapEx side of our business is the leasing business. buying feedstock, converting the aircraft, et cetera. The margins that we had historically looked to achieve on the ACMI services piece as a whole, it varies between the sort of the passenger on Omnicare is a little different than the other -- but generally speaking, it has been in that 5% to 10% range. And you're right that during the pandemic, there were some opportunities certainly that you were available due to shortage in capacity or in the case of Omni, sometimes world events, right, that drove some of the demand that allowed for improvement over those traditional margins. But we do think that, that asset-light business over the long term can produce attractive contributions to our overall cash flows and margins, it doesn't drive a lot of CapEx. And you're right that our -- some of our large leasing customers, Amazon and DHL, also, we on the experience and the capabilities of our cargo airlines, and that does make our business model unique. But I don't -- when you say intertwined, I think regardless, customers who need the midsized freighter to handle the e-commerce growth and express growth, they're going to need that converted midsize freighter capacity, and that would be required anyway, having the capability of those to also use our operating services and our MRO services, we think is a value add for them and it's a value add to our cash flows. Now, there is more volatility with the ACMI Services segment. And I think the Omni piece is probably more -- less visible what the future demand is sometimes. For obvious reasons, their large customers are the largest customer is the government and the DoD, and that can be difficult sometimes to project. Now, that has been worked in -- worked well for us for several years, really since we bought them. In this quarter, we did see some reduction in that flying. And you're right that cost pressures, inflation pressures can affect ACMI services more. But over time, we expect to see inflation worked into our revenue streams through our contracts. And we do have long-term contracts, the Omni contract structure has escalation points built into it. But in the short run, there can be dislocation. When costs rise rapidly and you don't get adjustments until contract anniversaries and things like that, your margins suffer in that interim period. But over the long haul, -- we expect those to adjust, and we should be able to achieve targeted margins on our ACMI Services segment over the long run, and it will contribute to our overall ATSG cash flows on top of those leasing streams.\nRich Corrado: Yes, I think the only thing I'd add to that, Frank, is that it is -- we're the largest dry lessor to Amazon, we're the largest dry lessor to DHL. We also fly a lot of the airplanes that we lease -- all the airplanes we leased to Amazon and most of the airplanes that we leased to DHL. It's a unique strategic advantage that we have to be able to pair the flying with the leasing and augment the returns on top of the lease with the flying piece of it. And so that strategy has played out well for us over the -- in the past. Now, what we've done in the last couple of years is really focused on the dry leasing business and a global growth plan. And so a lot of what's coming in 2023 and 2024 are leases of aircraft that are going outside the country where we won't have necessarily an operating role in those airplanes. And so it's like a diversification, if you will, of the strategy so that we're leasing these aircraft to other operators. Now, a lot of these operators happen to fly for DHL, UPS or FedEx or Amazon, in other parts of the world. So they're still augmented and supported by strong customers that are paying for the airplane. So we think it's a good strategy, and it's allowed us to diversify into a situation. At the same token, I will also say a big growth spurt for us during the pandemic was flying just in the CMI asset-light only basis, for airplanes that our customers have given to us. And I think the count is up over 15, now I think it's 17 between our two large network providers in the US. So, that's an area where, obviously, we wouldn't be flying those airplanes if we weren't confident in our ability to be profitable with those -- with that business. And so we look at these -- the cost pressures that are going on right now is something that we will cycle through and address.\nFrank Galanti: That's super helpful. I really appreciate that. I wanted to dig in to the second question on maintenance costs. So, I think some of the negative reaction in the stock and the investors I talk to is around the large jump in sustaining cash flows. I know it's sort of not the focus of this call, was the last call. But I wanted to think through that from a -- like, when I look at the -- I don't know, just sustaining CapEx on a trailing 12 basis relative to assets, it's -- and I know we've only had this for a year, so it's kind of hard to look back historically. But it's been about 8% in 2022 and on the $2.60 number on a go-forward basis, that's 10%. Is that -- like is this an outsized year -- is the way to think about sustaining CapEx is basically all CapEx minus growth in CapEx, the sustaining CapEx. And so that it's sort of -- it's going to be lumpy. But if you looked at it, you'd say, 9% of assets is really the normalized number. Yes, we're going to have bigger maintenance events because of engine right? We didn't do engine overhauls last year, but we're going to do engine overall this year. And then next year, there's going to be sort of a little bit of a brief is sort of 9% of assets, the normalized number, right? Because there's a difference between sustaining CapEx the way you report it and a normalized maintenance CapEx number. Can you sort of talk about those -- that difference and what that number would be on a go-forward basis?\nQuint Turner: Yes, Frank, I'll take shot here. The spike in 2023 sustained CapEx is associated with the timing of some engine overhauls for the EADA engines that are part of the pool that we offer to lessors. And those came out of a power by cycle agreement with Delta a while back, and we established this pool. But there was a sort of a larger number of engines that were going to require overhaul and this is that timing. So, I do not anticipate the $260 million to be the norm. We've talked about more like $200 million. And you can see over the longer -- you can see looking back, it's been under $200 million on a 12-month look back. What really drives our sustaining CapEx to increase would be if we had more aircraft that we were responsible for the maintenance on. And in our business model, the growth is going to be leased to external lessees and they're responsible for that maintenance. So, as CAM grows its fleet, we do not anticipate significant growth in sustained CapEx. The airlines do themselves have some spare capability for aircraft that they have for their CMI agreements, and they are responsible for the maintenance for those aircraft, but that doesn't increase significantly as does our lease -- externally leased fleet that we have no maintenance responsibility for. And so we don't expect a sustained CapEx to really grow much over time. There may be some growth due to inflation, et cetera. But there's nothing really driving it fundamentally. And the growth CapEx that we report is strictly feedstock plus conversion cost. So, you are right that everything else we're putting in that sustaining line. And that does include some smaller items that our subsidiaries, may have to do repairs and maintenance that they have to do large items, hanger, things like that, but that may fall into that category and some smaller pieces of equipment. But generally speaking, we don't expect that to go up significantly over time as we grow.\nFrank Galanti: Perfect. Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna Financial. Your question please.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Hey good morning everyone. Quint, I just want to understand here exactly what's included in this revised EBITDA guide for this year and trying to get a handle on what potential downside risk there could be to this guide. So, if you could kind of -- if you can walk us through how we should think about ACMI block hours through the balance of the year and particularly Omni? And then remind us with Amazon, how much visibility do you have into their flight schedules? Is it sort of month by month? Or do you already know what you're going to be flying in the second half and by extension peak. Two, what's the assumption in terms of CAM placements and renewals. Three, it sounds like there's some provision for there in asset sales and then it doesn't sound like there's anything in there for pilot accruals. So I just want to understand sort of the building blocks as we think about this revised EBITDA guide for this year?\nQuint Turner: Thanks Chris. Yes, obviously, there's a lot of detail in our projections. But just sort of in terms of a little bit like Jack asking question to start off in terms of sort of the cadence of what we anticipate the hours in the ACMI Services segment, more of the variability is associated probably with Omni in those just because they have more of a seasonal pattern with flying, with things like true rotations and so forth. A lot of those taking place starting in the summer months and then extending into the fall. And so for their hours, we have assumed some growth through that period. And then their fourth quarter after sort of the latter part of the fourth quarter, it drops off again. And then on the cargo carriers, typically, they're hours are going to grow as we progress through the year based upon the normal sort of peak seasons that you have for shipping and the various customer days that the customers have. But the number of aircraft that they're going to be operating, it's pretty stable year-over-year. We're going to get some customer aircraft, but there may be a few aircraft that come out. We talked about some of the retirements and so forth. So that part is pretty stable. As far as the CAM segment. We expect, I believe, eight. We put two aircraft -- we leased two aircraft in the first quarter. I think we expect six in the second quarter.\nRich Corrado: Two of those are already leased.\nQuint Turner: We had two of those we did in April. And then we have the other 12 aircraft that we project to lease external customers in the second half, a fairly evenly split. I think third quarter might have a little bit more than four. And so that's some of the some of the cadence, I guess, in terms of how we're looking at the drivers as we move through the year.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: I'm sorry, with Helane's question on the 767s, the older 200s with Amazon, is there -- that's included in the guidance, whether those are renewed or sold?\nQuint Turner: Yes, I mean that's -- it's not -- I mean, that's in the second half. I mean, the aircraft will either be sold or re-leased those five as they come out, but it will be pretty late in the year. And the aircraft, it's not a huge number either way. It's not like it's a significant driver. And then Amazon added three aircraft that we believe that they will okay, Mike, go ahead.\nMike Berger: Yes. We've talked about the extensions. We talked about what we're going to do with the 200s as a whole on the retirements and the sales piece of it. And as Quintin and Rich mentioned, those are in the forecast already.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. So, my follow-up, in the prepared remarks, which you talked about growing earnings and free cash flow next year. I just want to understand the assumptions there because we have uncertainty around the approval of these new Airbus aircraft, growing a recession. We have two open pilot contracts. We have elevated attrition levels. Maybe if the way to think about it, if we have -- you've given us a lot of detail on your order book through mid-decade. And so if anyone wants to think about building out an EBITDA bridge or discounted cash flow, is the way to think about this really just taking your pandemic peak EBITDA per aircraft discounting rate accordingly to where we see lease rates are and then adjusting at the margin for contracts and inflation. I just want to better understand the assumptions in this kind of what sounds like growth for next year given all the pressures you're seeing in the business and macro uncertainty. Thank you.\nQuint Turner: Well, the biggest driver is what we talked about with the lease order book through 2024. Again, Chris, we don't want to get into the -- trying to go through the -- in great detail of the model on this call, but that is going to drive, as it always does with CAM being the biggest part of our EBITDA, that's going to drive the overall growth in EBITDA. We do believe on the ACMI Services front, as we said, that we will see some rate increases that will help offset some of the cost inflation that we've seen. And there's other steps that we're taking at each of our subsidiaries, our airline subsidiaries, in particular, to adjust for cost. But there's always uncertainties in every business. We have been through a period here where we've had more inflation, higher interest rates as a factor. We haven't talked about that, but certainly, that's been something that has escalated in the last 18 months pretty significantly, right? So, those are things you always have to take into account.\nRich Corrado: And just for clarity on the 321 side, just so we're all clear and aligned. The 321s that we have for delivery this year, are not facing any regulatory issues, they all be leased to customers that follow the FAA certification. So that's no issue for 2023. And in fact, the ones that we have scheduled in 2024 are also aligned to the same. So we don't have any regulatory issues on the 321s that we had planned for delivery right now in 2023 and 2024.\nQuint Turner: And Chris, as we said in our release, just the annualized revenue from the 20 aircraft that we'll put on this year. Next year, it will generate in excess of $70 million. The EBITDA margin is quite high. It's probably 90-plus percent.\nRich Corrado: And the confidence level on that is really strong. I mean we see -- we've seen a lot of stability in our conversion houses. You've heard us talk about increasing the conversion sites with our Boeing locations as well. So, the throughput in order to deliver on those 20 aircraft is very solid, not only from a conversion standpoint, but as we've mentioned, from a customer standpoint as well.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. If I could just squeeze in 1 more. Just remind us of the orders that you have out there through mid-decade. How many of those are spoken for? And do you have also the feedstock that you need because what we're hearing is airlines are holding on to older aircraft than longer than they typically would production issues with the OEMs. So, curious how much of your book is spoken for through mid-decade? And do you have all the feedstock that you need to have to execute on the plans you have in place through that point? Thank you.\nQuint Turner: Yes, I think if we break this down by each aircraft type, so if you look at the 767-300, we -- Quint had mentioned earlier, the 27 airplanes that we've got as work in process. That includes A321s as well. We buy feedstock. The 767 was a feedstock airplane that was scarce and remains scarce. And look, when you're looking for feedstock airplanes and you find a good airplane at the right price. We've been acquiring those because if you let that go, you don't know if you're going to get an airplane closer to when you're going to deduct it. We always try to match as close as we can, the same year of induction to when we acquired the airframe were acquired through -- for most converters to have an MSN number, a serial number for an aircraft six months prior to induction. So there's a lag there. So out of those 767, I look out right now, 34 slots through the end of 2024. And we've got customers for all but three of those slots right now. And then if I look at the A321, keep in mind, we own -- we're involved in a joint venture for the STC, but we also own a main conversion house for that, our PEMCO conversions, which is part of AMS and Tampa. And so we've got 11 aircraft in queue right now, and we own the slots. And as we spoke earlier, we'll look to make decision about expanding or retracting further on the A321 depending on how these regulatory issues get worked out. What the issue is there is the EASA approval. And so there's a lot of aviation authorities that follow EASA and there's a lot to follow the FAA. When Mike says that we're okay with the ones we've got, it's because of going into regulatory environments where the FAA is the common benchmark that they follow. EASA, we're down to one issue, and it's an issue that in working with EASA, they've given us a pathway to get it approved. It's just about doing the work. And then what the unknown is how long it takes them to evaluate and approve that. So we'll wait to see how that goes before we articulate any more future slots and aircraft. On the A330s, out through 2028, we've got 30 slots in the first 20, all of customer assignments. We've identified some feedstock. I think we're in the process of acquiring the first one, which is going to go into conversion in the fourth quarter. So, again, real strong demand for that, going out quite a ways in terms of the order book. I hope I answered your question.\nRich Corrado: Yes, just maybe a drop more on the 330 since it's going to be a huge part of our future. starting next year from a delivery standpoint. Based on the 30 slots on the timing that we have with them over the next few years, we estimate that we're going to have about 65% of all the A330s that are converted from a market standpoint will be our conversion slots I talked about just the breadth and depth of the industry as it looks out over the next several years in terms of the freighter demand. So, if you think about that as the natural replacement in the future of the 767 and controlling that majority of the conversions loss, you could see that our order book is already filling up 20 plus. So, the future in terms of the expansion into 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 where these slots start producing converted freighters is the reason why we're so bullish and optimistic about the future in the coming years.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And the EASA approval is what I was referring to, but it sounds like that at this point, there's a good portion of that book through mid-decade that's spoken for has pretty solid plans.\nQuint Turner: Just for clarity, the EASA only relates to the A321, it has nothing to do with the 330. That has already had also EASA approval for clarity.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay, got it. All right. Thanks for the time.\nQuint Turner: Thinks Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from Truist. Your question please.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'm still just trying to figure out here, a lot of these headwinds, rising maintenance costs, inflation, interest rates, I mean these aren't new. So the pressure on ACMI, I mean, you gave the guidance in late February. I think you were talking about Omni being down less than 5% for the year in terms of hours. I think you called out down 25% in the first quarter. I guess what changed so rapidly to drive that erosion in profit that wasn't already known?\nQuint Turner: Yes. The -- I think in the first quarter, Michael, the bigger impact was on Omni block hours reductions, although the cost pressures have been more than what we had projected in terms of what we're seeing we've seen some of the costs like return maintenance on a per cycle basis, over 20% travel to position flight crews, flight attendants, et cetera, increased significantly. But for the guidance change, a big piece of it is on the revenue side and particularly Omni. We knew and we said on the last call that we expected some of the other government flyers to fly more of their eligible entitlement than what we had seen previously because the macro environment wasn't presenting as attractive opportunities for them to take their pilots and fly them, for example, for cargo or commercial customers. And we've actually seen more of that even than we had anticipated, and that effects Omni quite significantly. Omni is sort of the has been sort of the go-to carrier and flown a lot of the excess -- in excess of their entitlement additionally, taking some of the missions that others pass them. So, that is a very large driver of this. But the cost side is -- and the cost pressures are also I would say that they're higher than what we had projected.\nRich Corrado: There's a couple of other things, Michael, that were prevalent in the first quarter. for Omni. First one is the type of flying that they were -- that they got resulted in a drop in their hour-to-cycle ratio by about an hour. So, to put that in other terms, they're -- versus their plan, their cycles were up 200, but their block hours were down. So, what that means is they've got 200 more stops involves maintenance and catering and all the things that go along with that -- when you have a cycle, it drives your maintenance costs. And so it was just an unusual situation that the Omni believes that going forward, that the hour cycle will return back to a normal thing. They did handle a type of flying that is not going to be prevalent moving forward. The other thing is, as a passenger charter ACMI airline, the way Omni had staffed, keep in mind, they had a very good year in 2022, and they were never at full staff. Well, they achieved full staffing at the end of 2022, where they had the right amount of pilots and the right amount of flight attendants for their fleet. And then when the flying dropped in the first quarter, and you're at full staff, it's where you see that erosion. Now, part of their go-forward plan is to fix that. And they've already gotten pretty far along in doing that in terms of rightsizing the staff across the operating side to the type of flying that they're going to be doing and projecting going forward. So, that's one of the cost benefits we think we'll begin to see in the second quarter.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. Okay. And then just the capital spending plans for the remainder of the year. You've got $89 million in cash on the balance sheet. I mean -- are you planning on exhausting the revolver by year-end? Or how should we think about the -- maybe the cap structure exiting this year?\nQuint Turner: So, we -- we're -- we have about, I think, on the current revolver, we have excess to about $390 million or so. And that and of itself, I think, would get us this year, which would take care of this us needs, but we also have access to additional should we need it through an accordion feature, et cetera. And so our leverage ratio is still expected to remain under three times as we finish the year. So, we're not highly levered. And so that isn't -- access to liquidity isn't a problem for us.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Okay. Okay. And then just Quint, can you remind us how much of the debt is floating, presumably the revolver? And I'm assuming drawing down or drawing on that line.\nQuint Turner: Yes, it's about 40% of it, Michael, 60% of the space.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Okay, perfect. All right. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Rich Corrado for any further remarks.\nRich Corrado: Thanks Jonathan. For more than a decade, fair leasing has been the foundation of our strategy. All of our other businesses serve to extend our core leasing relationships with services that add value and supplement our overall returns. That strategy has been successful and will remain our strategy for the future. It's paid off over time and significant returns of this Boeing 767 freighters that remain the core of our fleet. Because our airlines operate on an ACMI or CMI basis, their returns do not depend on ticket sales or stable fuel prices, but they are vulnerable to inflation in the short term and the customer decisions about how and when and how far they fly. Sometimes, as is happening in our passenger airline business, both factors converge in a way that affects our results. Our leasing returns are both stable and growing. -- the 20 aircraft that we are scheduled to deliver in 2023 will contribute over $70 million in increased revenue next year with a high adjusted EBITDA conversion. Our customers indicate that volumes will improve in the second half. We look forward to finishing the year strong, while continuing to keep our freighter investments consistent with the shareholders -- with the returns our shareholders have come to expect from their investment in ATSG. Thank you for your participation in today's call, and stay safe.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 4, "year": 2022, "date": "2023-02-24 13:47:06", "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Air Transport Services Group Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Joe Payne, Chief Legal Officer. Please go ahead.\nJoe Payne: Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website, atsginc.com. Let me begin by advising you that during the course of this call, we will make projections and other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call. Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to, unplanned changes in the market demand for our assets and services, our operating airline's ability to maintain on-time service and control costs; the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration; fluctuations in ATSG's traded share price and in interest rates, which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments; the number, timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers; our ability to remain in compliance with key agreements with customers, lenders and government agencies; the impact of current supply chain constraints, both within and outside the U.S., which may be more severe or persist longer than we currently expect; the impact of the current competitive labor market; changes in general economic and/or industry-specific conditions; factors relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, including that the pandemic may continue for a longer period or its effect on commercial and military passenger flying may be more substantial than we currently expect; disruptions in our workforce and staffing capability; disruptions in our ability to access airports and maintenance facilities or adversely impact our customers' creditworthiness and the continuing ability of our vendors and third-party service providers to maintain customary service levels; and other factors as contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-K we will file next week. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted cash flow. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials. We advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Rich Corrado, our President and CEO, for his opening comments.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. 2022 was an exceptional year for ATSG. Even with rapid inflation and delays at our 767 freighter conversion vendor, your company still exceeded its 2022 financial goals of $640 million in adjusted EBITDA and $2 in adjusted EPS. We also began to invest in new freighter platforms from the Airbus family while maintaining our leadership in Boeing 767 freighter leasing. I am very proud of the excellent planning and execution throughout the company that drove our considerable success. Many of those efforts are playing into our outlook for 2023. Despite some headwinds, we expect more adjusted EBITDA growth and accelerated growth in 2024 and later years. I'll be back to share more of that perspective after Quint reviews our financial results for 2022. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Rich, and welcome to everyone on the call this morning. The next slide in our deck summarizes the strong 2022 results that Rich highlighted. Our consolidated revenues for 2022 grew $311 million to $2 billion, another all-time high for revenues at ATSG. Our adjusted EPS increased by more than 40% to $2.28 compared with $1.61 in 2021. That was well above the $2 target we set a year ago. Adjusted pretax earnings increased 51% and adjusted EBITDA rose 18%. Earnings from our airline businesses, along with the momentum of our leasing returns from CAM, produced most of the EPS gain above our target. We are projecting lower EPS for 2023, as Rich will discuss in his remarks, mainly because of increased interest expense on our current fleet additions and inflation effects, particularly in our ACMI Services segment. On the next slide, you can see that versus the 12 months ended in December 2021, our adjusted EBITDA grew a record $100 million or 18% in 2022. That improvement includes a full year of cash flows from the 15 newly converted 767 freighters we deployed in 2021 and more than doubling our earnings from ACMI Services. For adjusted EBITDA, we exclude, among other items, the changes in values of our financial instruments and the benefits of federal pandemic release assistance for our passenger operations under the payroll support programs for the 2021 period. On the next slide, you'll see that our capital spending finished the year at just under $600 million, $25 million less than we projected last quarter. We separate what we call sustaining CapEx, mainly for airframe and engine maintenance, technology and other equipment from the spending we allocate to fleet expansion. Sustaining CapEx was $187 million for the year, up $4 million. Growth CapEx was $412 million, up $90 million from the prior year, both to convert existing aircraft to freighters and to buy more feedstock passenger aircraft. In 2022, those purchases included 8 Boeing 767s and 6 Airbus A321s. We deployed and leased 6 newly converted 767 freighters last year. Turnaround times at many passenger-to-freighter aircraft conversion houses remain well above pre-pandemic levels despite their efforts to increase throughput. We expect those bottlenecks to lessen this year. The next slide updates our adjusted free cash flow as measured by our operating cash flow, net of our sustaining CapEx. Adjusted free cash flow of $285 million last year was down $115 million from the year-earlier period and down $88 million for the 12 months ended last September. Cash flows from federal grants in 2021 were $83 million. All of that cash was received in the first half. Our full year 2022 results reflect the impact of the temporary fourth quarter increase in working capital related to reimbursement of fuel costs from Omni's federal government customers. We project our growth capital investments to exceed adjusted free cash flows until 2025 when we expect that trend to reverse. Through 2024, we expect our debt leverage ratio to remain under 3 times and begin to decline in 2025. You may have already seen the 2023 guidance we provided in the earnings release we issued yesterday. Rich will cover some of the factors that will affect our earnings and cash flow in his remarks. I wanted to provide some color around the significant increase in our CapEx budget of $850 million this year and the strategic decisions and steps that prepare the way for our growth investments in 2023 and 2024. The bulk of our CapEx this year and in 2024 will continue to fund the expansion of our leased 767 fleet. The other major driver of our stepped-up growth in spending over the next several years is our decision to begin offering our lease customers to other freighter types, the Airbus A321, a narrow-body midsize trader designed to replace retiring Boeing 757s, and the A330, a wide-body midsize freighter that will complement our still expanding fleet of 767s. We started this freighter platform expansion from a strong financial position. Through 2022, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio as calculated under our bank agreement was below 2 times and well below our average over the last several years. We also acted in 2020 and 2021 to lock in favorable fixed rates by issuing 7-year unsecured notes at a 4.75% coupon rate and amended our senior credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity, free of some collateral, and accommodate the resumption of our stock repurchase program. Available credit under our revolver was $365 million at the end of 2022, with an option for additional capacity subject to bank approvals. To coincide with our increased business with airlines in Europe and Asia, we intend to establish a similar $100 million credit facility in Ireland in the next few days. When our fleet development program is at its peak in 2024 and lease revenues from Airbus fleet additions are just beginning, we project that our leverage ratio will still remain less than 3 times. After that, we expect to begin delevering in 2025. I also want to note that even with higher CapEx spending, we have the liquidity and cash flow visibility to continue to accommodate opportunistic share repurchases under the $150 million facility the Board created last fall. As we noted in our release, we repurchased 2 million shares or about 3% of those outstanding during the fourth quarter after pandemic grant restrictions on our repurchases expired. With that summary of our financial and operating results, I'll turn it back to Rich for some comments on our operations and outlook. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint. The earnings release we issued yesterday listed some key 2022 operating accomplishments that contributed to the financial results that Quint just reviewed. Let me highlight them and share some additional color to give you more insight about how well we performed last year. Overall, we added 13767 freighters in 2022, 6 of which were CAM owned and leased to third-party customers. CAM also re-leased 1767-200 and extended leases on 4 other 200s. Two of the 6 newly converted 767-300 freighters leased last year are also being operated by ATSG's airlines under crew, maintenance and insurance agreements. We also added 7 other 767-300s to our fleet under asset-light CMI arrangements. Those were assigned to our airlines by customers who obtained them elsewhere but shows our airlines, ABX Air and ATI to fly them. They joined 6 others we were already operating on the same basis. We expect our customers to assign us 3 more in 2023. These decisions by our customers attest to their confidence in the airline services that we provide. Our original 2022 plan called for more freighter leases, but both vendor and regulatory issues prevented us from reaching our targets. Our principal 767 conversion vendor, IAI, continues to add conversion capacity but throughput times remain well behind pre-pandemic levels. Anticipating delays, we decided to book several conversion slots with Boeing in 2021 and added more in 2022. Boeing will convert 4 of the 767-300s we expect to deploy this year. We believe that a combination of additional slots and faster throughput will allow us to meet our 2023 fleet expansion goals. Another challenge is gaining approvals from the regulatory agencies to put our converted A321-200 freighters into service. Three of the 6 A321s that CAM intends to lease this year, including CAM's first 2 to ASL Aviation in Ireland, are ready to go with regulatory approval. We expect that to happen by midyear. To prepare for our step-up in fleet investments starting this year, CAM was active in the feedstock market in 2022. Through purchases and other commitments, CAM now controls all of the passenger aircraft it requires for our anticipated 20 freighter leases in 2023 and nearly all of those that were leased in 2024. Please go to the next slide. Quint noted that the scale of our fleet investments will be much larger over the next few years and then we have the financial backing to complete them. To those who might be concerned about whether customers will be ready to make long-term lease commitments for those aircraft as they complete conversion, it's important to understand that the surge in U.S. e-commerce activity that preceded and soared during the pandemic is only now beginning to surge in other parts of the world. The e-commerce portion for retail sales is still growing rapidly elsewhere, including Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America as air networks expand. Accordingly, more than 80% of CAM's leased freighter deployments over the next several years will be to airlines operating outside North America. And many of them will operate in networks established by DHL and other integrators who lease our freighters themselves but where rules limit where they can operate directly. Turning to our airlines. Some of the continuing growth in e-commerce fulfillment in the U.S. last year led to expansions of their fleets and more operating block hours. ABX Air and ATI added 9 767 freighters, including 7 assigned to them. Block hours of flying for all 3 airlines increased 8%, with a 9% increase in cargo operations and a 4% gain in passenger operations. Even with 1 fewer 767 in its fleet, Omni still completed a strong schedule of passenger airline missions for government customers. Also, the Department of Defense restored our full combi schedule, including our longest route in the fourth quarter. We are also proud to note that a year ago, DHL agreed, once again, to extend and expand the long-standing commercial relationship we've enjoyed with them since the inception of ATSG as an independent public company in 2003. The agreement extended our airline service in support of DHL's U.S. Express network for 6 years and included the lease of 3 more 767-300 freighters from CAM. Our deployment schedules include still more 767s plus some A330s for DHL's global network. Please go on to the next slide. Those were a few of the operating and commercial successes that helped us generate record revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in 2022 and will contribute to our results for several years to come. In 2023, ATSG expects to generate between $650 million and $660 million in adjusted EBITDA and between $1.85 and $2 in adjusted earnings per share. Those targets reflect a record pace of 20 freighter lease deployments I mentioned a moment ago and which we announced to the market on February 6. Four of the international companies we will lease freighters to in 2023 and 2024 are new customers, supporting Air Express networks in other regions. Several years ago, we began to expand our sales and marketing outreach to customers where e-commerce is just beginning to take hold, and those efforts are paying off in record demand for our freighters today. Later in the year, CAM will begin the passenger-to-freighter conversions of our first A330-300 for lease delivery in 2024. CAM expects to convert and lease 30 such aircraft by 2028, two-thirds of which are already backed by customer commitments. CAM will also begin conversion of a projected 16 767-300 freighters it expects to lease in 2024, most of which have customers awaiting them. ATSG's 2023 outlook also includes the return of 8 of the 12 767-200 freighters that ATSG leased to Amazon in 2016. The remaining 8 will be re-leased, sold or harvested, with their engine added to the power by cycle pool for 767-200 lease customers. ATSG also expects inflationary and schedule reduction impacts on our airlines in 2023, when we expect fewer hours of flying for our ACMI and CMI customers. We remain positive on ATSG's long-term growth opportunities with our major U.S. air network customers and expect to add 3 customer-provided aircraft this year. We expect that 2024 and 2025 will bring the resumption of strong earnings and cash flow growth from today's investments, with year-over-year growth of about 10% in adjusted EBITDA and even stronger growth in our leasing segment. Few companies have customers committed to long-term agreements that will generate the kind of cash flow visibility that ATSG enjoys. We have a strong balance sheet, a leadership position in the midsized freighter leasing market and the strong backing of investors in our credit facility and debt securities, who regard the feedstock aircraft we are acquiring as prime assets. Our employees are also prepared to execute all of our 2023 plans with a goal to turn exciting opportunities into long-term superior returns for shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Quint and I, along with Mike Berger, our Chief Strategy Officer, are ready to answer questions. May we have the first question, operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Your line is open.\nGrant Smith: This is Grant on for Jack. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the 2023 guidance really on the ACMI side and kind of how you're expecting that to play out maybe first half versus second half. And you mentioned in your fleet update that the first half would see a year-over-year decrease in block hours with your larger customers. And today, you talked about a full year block hour decrease year-over-year in cargo and passenger. Just maybe any color on how you're thinking about ACMI over the course of the full year would be great.\nQuint Turner: Yes. Thanks for the question. In terms of ACMI, the block hour decrease that we talked about, remember, we had the resumption for ATI of a combi route in the fourth quarter of '21, so we'll have that for the full year in -- or excuse me, fourth quarter '22, and we'll have it for the full year of '23. And we consider that as passenger, but of course, the other passenger hours being flown by Omni primarily for its governmental and the DoD and governmental customers. We expect passenger and cargo hours to be down. They'll be down less than 5%, we would anticipate, year-over-year for the full year. And I think really in terms of differentiating, it's -- we do expect perhaps in the second half to see, as we typically do, and you see a lot of the forecast, some recovery, particularly on the cargo side, where hours may pick up seasonally. But on the pack side, it's more of -- we expect sort of a steady environment. Those are sometimes a little tougher to forecast. As you know, some of those hours, you don't have as much notice on. We've had events happen in the world that can affect the demand particularly for Omni on the military side. We do anticipate, I believe, in the -- based on what we've seen in the first quarter, we may see some reduced hours in flying for Omni on the governmental side, if that helps. But basically, that part, the tax line, we're assuming pretty much steady state in the absence of having any specific information about the second half.\nGrant Smith: And if I could just follow up 1 more thing. So you mentioned the strength internationally in e-commerce and what you're hearing for your customers. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit on your U.S. customers. And maybe is there any more negative commentary you've heard from them? Any calls for concern as you maybe think about trying to re-lease those 767-200s as you mentioned?\nMike Berger: Yes. No, thanks, Grant, for the call. It's Mike Berger. From a U.S. perspective, as Rich mentioned, just to go back to Rich's remarks, our order book for the next couple of years, '23 and '24, has really been dominant, over 80% leased outside the U.S. from an international perspective. So our strategy to move forward further globally that we started several years ago now really is taking hold and will continue to. So we -- while we continue to look for opportunities within the U.S. and we'll continue to support our customers' growth where needed, our opportunities have really been greater outside the U.S. and we continue to push that way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helen Becker with Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Let's see, I have two questions. The 1 question, Quint, can you -- when you talk about aircraft that you have placed or that are going to customers or where you have customers signed up, can you talk about it in terms of committed revenue over that time frame? Like can you say we've already had committed revenue of X billions of dollars over the next X number of years? Are you able to say that?\nQuint Turner: Yes. I mean, it's a good question, Helane. We talk about the 20 aircraft, for example, that we're looking that we are targeting for deployment in '23. On an annualized basis, you're talking about around $70 million of revenue for those placements. And if you look at 2024, it's probably more like about $85 million to $90 million on an annualized on top of that. And we have, as Rich said, excellent visibility on that. On those placements, we've got customer commitments, I think, for all but 2 or 3 of those.\nHelane Becker: And then my follow-up question is, I think -- I don't know if it was you or Rich, you said in your prepared remarks that you have inflationary cost pressure in some of your ACMI businesses. Is that reimbursable by your customers, those cost pressures?\nQuint Turner: Well, certainly, there's escalators that are built into our customer contracts. We've all seen inflation in the recent years that has outpaced, I think, what most folks would have in their contracts. But having said that, I mean, I think it's important to say that when you look at ACMI Services, I mean, it's made tremendous progress throughout the pandemic for ATSG's airlines. And what we have projected in '23, for example, their contribution in terms of adjusted EBITDA is about 12% higher than it was in 2021 and in 2023. Now 2022 was an excellent year, right? They had -- there were some opportunities for -- where customers needed charter flights and things that were higher margin than we might see in '23 due to the macroeconomic environment. And then, of course, in '23, with perhaps less commercial opportunities, you may see some of the airlines who participate in the government flying, the craft program. They may fly their -- more of their entitlements. Some of those airlines may have been opting to fly commercial trips when the rates being offered for those types of trips were really high on the -- and now there may be less of those in a slower economy in '23. So we anticipate that Omni, while it's going to do well in '23, but it may not have as many opportunities to fly and clean up some of the entitlement not flown by some of the other carriers.\nRich Corrado: Helane, the things that -- there are reimbursables in those ACMI agreements, things like permits, like landing fees, those types of things. Fuel is a big reimbursement. But the things that have impacted us on an inflationary basis are things like travel costs because we have to position pilots all over the world, maintenance costs for maintenance technicians or maintenance contractors. Those costs have been rising over the past few years. And those are built into the rates. They do get escalated, as Quint said, in the general agreements year-to-year. But it's just a matter of whether that escalation keeps up with where the inflationary pressure may be in the different cost items.\nQuint Turner: And on the military and the DoD type flying, those contracts are more akin to cost-plus. And so rates are adjusted. There's a look-back, though. There's usually a lag, right? In the year the inflation is occurring, you may not get the reimbursement. But when rates are reset in subsequent years, those adjustments are made. So that's a risk mitigator but it creates a dislocation.\nHelane Becker: Can I squeeze in one more question? I think, Rich, you said that you were going to use Boeing to do more conversions than IAI. Why are they going to be faster to do conversions or turnarounds, given all the supply constraint issues they have?\nRich Corrado: Yes. I didn't say that we were going to use more Boeing, but we do have 8 slots from Boeing and we're still using a lot of IAI. We have 5 lines operating there pretty much at all times. The difference between IAI and Boeing really is that Boeing has a full production line still going of factory freighters and factory tankers. And so I think they've got a sturdier supply chain than some of the other converters and some of the other lines of business. Now we're under the A321, the A330. We've got multiple vendors on the A321 on the conversion side. And of course, we do our own. And then we've got the 2 on the 767. So we get a good view into what's going on in some of these supply chains, and I think we mentioned it in the prepared remarks that we saw some delays from IAI. And a lot of that was related to fabrication and parts vendors that they use in other countries. And I think Boeing just has a more captive supply chain just because they've got, I believe, because they've got that large production line and that supports their conversion line as well.\nMike Berger: And Helane, it's Mike. They tend to be a little bit more, like I put it this way, cookie-cutter. So the work scopes that go into the conversions upfront are well defined and just more cookie-cutter approach so the changes don't impact the actual delivery times.\nRich Corrado: Another way to say that is they're less flexible.\nHelane Becker: I got it. Okay, all right.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist. Your line is open.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Just I guess, Rich or Quint, just looking at the EBITDA guidance next year, the run rate, I mean, you have -- it's basically the second half '22 EBITDA run rate basically put you at the low end of that range. You're going to have more planes in service. Is all of this pressure just coming from ACMI? Or can you just elaborate a little bit? I was always operating under the impression of playing out there is maybe $4 million to $5 million of EBITDA. But just maybe can you provide some color as to the EBITDA, why the run rate just kind of holds from third quarter, fourth quarter all the way through?\nQuint Turner: Yes. I mean, Michael, it's Quint. You're correct that the -- in terms of the, I guess, the more of the headwind in '23 is ACMI Services. Even though, as I mentioned, ACMI Services in '23 is projected to be up versus, for example, '21 and certainly way up since the pre-pandemic period. I mean, ACMI Services has been a great contributor. But there is, as we've always said, a little bit more volatility, and our business model has a great deal of stability with the CAM piece. But there's always a little bit of volatility on the ACMI Services side. Now we like that because it's an asset-light business, and generally, it's been a great contributor in terms of overall cash flow. And as I said, it has made progress every year except comparing to '22 as we look at '23. It's going to be down but still up versus prior periods. So there's some volatility around the margins on ACMI Services. That has to do with what we said earlier about where the opportunities might lie for military flying and commercial flying. But on the CAM piece, we talked about in our pre-release, there will be some aircraft coming back, we believe. That will create a pause, I guess, in terms of revenue stream on those 767-200s that we put the earlier release out on. CAM, certainly, in terms of their earnings margins that are impacted by the rise in interest cost, which is certainly a factor. And of course, inflation also can affect the investments, what it takes to put an aircraft on the ramp at least. The lease rate has held up nicely, but similar to comment earlier, sometimes there's a little bit of a lag there when inflation moves really quickly because we have a lot of our growth already programmed in, just like we talked about our pipeline, in '23 and '24, with what, 40-some aircraft coming out and being leased. We have a lot of that pipeline locked in 18, 24 months prior to when the asset comes out. So sometimes that inflation can impact the end-of-service cost, and that's something CAM has to deal with. But it's -- we're hitting our return margins there. The businesses looks to be positioned, as Rich said, to be the engine that will drive again in '24 and '25, we believe, double-digit EBITDA growth year-over-year. But in '23, you have those -- you have some returns coming back and you have that higher interest costs so there's a little bit of a headwind there. I don't know, Mike, if there's anything...\nMike Berger: Yes, we view it as an investment year and the line of sight, as Quint mentioned, in terms of our order book in 2023 and '24 and quite honestly, into 2025 on the 767 side is fabulous. And as we look at the engine, the e-commerce engine and what drives that retail sales as a whole from now to 2026 are going to grow -- are scheduled to grow by $4.6 trillion, and $2.2 trillion of that is going to be in e-commerce. As Rich mentioned in his early remarks, we're still seeing very, very strong growth in the areas that -- around the world that we are seeing success in, Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East, for example, are areas that we're seeing great success with new customers as well as our existing customers in those areas. As we progress in '24 and '25, we'll be right in the midst of our deliveries on the A330, and that investment for the A330 is taking place now. So we're really keen on what the future specifically lies in our EBITDA growth and getting back to that 10-plus percent, as Quint talked about, in the upcoming years.\nRich Corrado: The other piece that I'll just talk about is from a strength standpoint is retirement. During the pandemic, about 15 freighters were being retired a year. On a normal year, it's about 70. What does that mean? That means that the demand for cargo freighters around the world is just going to continue to add strength. So we continue to be real positive.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Just on the capital intensity of business. I mean, that sustaining CapEx guidance is going to be up 40% to $260 million. I mean, is there anything unique happening this year? I mean, presumably, maintenance part, overall kind of shop are getting more expensive. But how should we think about this sustaining CapEx going forward?\nQuint Turner: Yes. Thanks, Michael. It's Quint. The -- we've kind of said, because maintenance CapEx can move based on the timing of scheduled maintenance from year-to-year, I think we've kind of said it's around a couple of hundred million dollars of our CapEx in any given year. But you're right, '23 is a little bit higher. Now '22 was, I think, what we say, $187 million. So you can see it came in a little lower. '23 is higher than that $200 million sort of trend -- long-term trend line mainly because of the timing of some engine overhauls. We maintain a pool of engines for some of the lessee's one of the engine types. And it's just based upon their shop -- their expected shop visit timing. We've got more of those this year. I mean, you are correct. Inflation, as we said, I don't think any of us can probably think of any cost that it doesn't affect, but it has more to do with the timing of scheduled maintenance as to why we're looking at a higher number for maintenance CapEx in '23.\nMichael Ciarmoli: And then just the last 1, if I may. Any update on your kind of contracts with your pilots, just kind of watching the news here seeing what's going on at FedEx? How are you kind of handicapping or thinking about that risk?\nRich Corrado: Yes. So we've got pilot contracts open or amendable, I should say, with both ATI on the cargo side and on -- in our passenger operator, Omni. And both those contracts are -- have been in negotiation and the -- both sides are meeting multiple times per month now and trading information and going forward. And so the -- things are progressing. Just based on where they are individually and they're both in different places, but we don't believe that we'll get to anything very quickly. We have always taken the position that we need a pilot contract that pays the pilots well enough that we can retain and attract pilots but also gives us the cost structure required that we compete for business. And we've always been able to make those 2 positions meet at some point, and we'll continue to pursue the contract negotiations with that perspective.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Frank Galanti with Stifel. Your line is open.\nFrank Galanti: I wanted to follow up on that last question on pilots. Can you sort of talk about availability of pilots. Have you -- considering the kind of new EBITDA guidance and expectations for low block hours, does that sort of alleviate some of the pressure from a pilot perspective? And can you talk about how variable that cost is with block hours?\nMike Berger: So a couple of things. One is that we've been able to attract pilots without a problem over the past year. And any attrition that we've had, we've been able to stay ahead of the curve in terms of getting the training done and getting them able to be able to fly and preserve all our schedules and et cetera, et cetera. So that's been a good thing. Our average hours are way over the minimum of the new pilots coming in. So we're in good shape as far as the pilot situation goes. But in terms of the variability of pilot cost as it relates to block hours, I mean, the pilot cost is really -- it's under contract. So it's -- the pilots will go through the -- increase their pay as they go through scales, it doesn't really change that much on an average cost basis per block hour. And the contracts that we have, there are escalations that address cost on an annual basis.\nQuint Turner: But Frank, as we look forward at the placements for aircraft, as Mike commented, most all of these are going internationally. So we don't anticipate operating those through the airline. So I think what, over 80% or something or international placements in '23, '24. And so that will, to your point, they won't drive a demand for additional pilots. It's more about keeping pace with that attrition that Rich mentioned.\nQuint Turner: And if you look at -- I mean, just the next 2 years are going to be 40 airplanes we're putting out. And you look at the diversification, we're getting away from some of our larger lessees, it's a great story because we've got stability, we've got visibility to cash flows, and we've got a differentiated business model going forward into different parts of the world.\nFrank Galanti: So I wanted to ask about the 767-200s. Can you kind of talk about, so in the press release, you had an expectation of at the end of '23 being down 8 planes. Can you sort of talk about the age and efficiency interest in that platform? And then kind of second part of that, last year, you took in-house, the engine services for that plane. You sort of talked about $45 million of EBITDA contribution from that. Where does that sort of stack relative to what you expected in '22 versus '23 with sort of the changes in that platform?\nQuint Turner: Yes. In terms of the last part of that question, I don't know if Mike might jump in the first part on the 200s, but your question about the engine piece. Yes, for '22, it was right around the $40 million that we talked about at the beginning of the year when we gave you guidance in terms of that EBITDA contribution. Remember, there was kind of a step-up there because we ended a long-time PVC agreement with a provider, and we went to the pooling structure that we have now, where we essentially -- we overhaul, we maintain that pool of engines and make it available to lessees who operate the aircraft. So on a '23 versus '22, there won't be much of a change. In other words, it's not a big driver of incremental EBITDA. That was sort of that -- changing that structure from '21 to -- late '21 to '22 that drove that $40 million increase in '22. So pretty much a stable contribution in '23 versus '22 from the engine piece.\nMike Berger: In regards to the first part of your question about the demand for the 767-200, we've seen still very, very good demand for the airframe. And as Rich has mentioned in his opening remarks, we certainly will have some opportunities to sell some of those airframes as well as re-lease them out to the marketplace. So as we view those opportunities and we'll kind of have our choice, if I could put it that way, to pick and choose what's best for us as we get those returns, couple that with the engine program, the pool of engines that Quint mentioned, that we still feel that the -- or still not only feel but see strong request and strong demand for that airframe.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Howard Rosencrans with VA. Your line is open.\nHoward Rosencrans: I guess I just want to understand the -- I mean, obviously, the market is having a different reaction to what you're seeing in terms of one of the prior speakers commented on \"great story\". So I just -- to simplify in terms of the growth CapEx, you've got $600 million in '23 and it sort of implies about $600 million in '24. Is that sort of related to -- again, just oversimplify without the breakdown between BA and the Airbus equipment. Ostensibly, we're talking about the $27 million, $30 million per\nRich Corrado: I'm sorry, Howard, you cut off there.\nHoward Rosencrans: Yes. No, no. I had completed the question. Ostensibly, are we talking about $27 million to $30 million per aircraft? That's again, whether it flows in as working capital or flows in as -- but basically in terms of the CapEx, is that what we're effectively talking about? And then I want to ask you the follow-on.\nQuint Turner: Well, we talked about that range in terms of the 767-300s to what investments look like to put them on the ramp in leasable shape.\nHoward Rosencrans: Right. Okay. And it's pretty much the same ballpark for the Airbus, right? Is that fair to say?\nMike Berger: Yes. In terms of -- it depends on the Airbus type. And as Rich just said in the past, think of the narrow-body 321 as about two-thirds the [Indiscernible] about two-thirds the -- and then the 330 is about 20% larger than the 767-300s. So it's going to be a\nHoward Rosencrans: So at the end of the day, it all washes out to about the same thing. So that leads me to my real question here. So the market is suggesting or the investment community, or however you want to look at it, is suggesting that now the returns that you're going to generate are not going to be the returns that you have generated historically. And I guess just to speculate, there's a lack of comfort with the customers vis-\u00e0-vis the customers like Amazon and DHL and FedEx and the ones that have been part of your fleet. So how do you give us the comfort level that the customers that you have on the horizon where you're going to do these placements are going to -- have the same fortitude, let's say, for the sake of conversation, the e-comm growth on an international basis is not as pronounced exactly, that's going to impact that we assume more your ACMI, which is the ACMI, which is more the volatility side of the business. But as long as we get the CAM placements there and as long as they're taking them, then we get the return on the CAM side, and let's face it, that's the lion's share of the cash flow. Since your debt is going up so much over the ensuing couple of years, to me, I just want to -- and I think for others, we just want to get a higher level of comfort that the varied buyers that we're now going to be doing business with are sharply accelerated will be able to comfortably perform in line with the way your Goliath, let's say, domestic or global players have performed.\nRich Corrado: Yes, Howard. No, it's a good question. I'm glad you asked it because we've made this -- we've handled a similar question in the past about some of the smaller lessees that we have. There's a couple of things. One is that several of the lessees that are prominently positioned to take, whether it's A321, 767s or A330s, also fly for Express companies or fly an Express network that multiple companies may participate in. For example, Cargojet up in Canada. We've also got some large companies in this portfolio that will be taking airplanes internationally. DHL is in line for both 767s and A330s from now through 2026. You've got a company, ASL, that's based in Ireland but has several AOCs all over Europe. They're the largest ACMI operator in Europe, and they fly for multiple Express companies, and they have very strong agreements. And so -- and then you've got a company like Raya in Malaysia, which is going to be taking A321s and they are currently a 767 customer. They fly for DHL. So when you look at these lessees, they're diversifying us globally. And although they may not be your household name of DHL, UPS or FedEx, they fly for those people. So the credits that they represent are very strong in relation to just the general airline that's out there. So we have a lot of confidence. We do a lot of vetting of airlines in terms of what they're going to do with the airplane. And so we have a general understanding. Another 1 I forgot to mention was as Maersk is taking -- will end up with 5 airplanes from us. They've already taken 3. There's 2 more to be delivered to them. And of course, Maersk is one of the largest, if not the largest ocean company in the world. And so those are the types of customers we've got. And so we're very confident in the cash flows that we'll be receiving from these customers.\nQuint Turner: I just -- just to bring a little bit more color to it, Howard. Our partner -- one of our partners in Africa, Astral Airways, was just named Cargo Airline of the Year for that region. Rich mentioned Raya. They were named E-commerce Airline of the Year in Southeast Asia. And just a little bit further detail on MireStar, they've been the provider of UPS in the European network for literally for over 30 years. So the vetting goes -- the vetting is very diligent and understanding their business plans and how they're going to succeed is also very important. But as Rich said as well, DHL specifically is in line to take several aircraft over the next few years on the 767 side as well as the 330.\nQuint Turner: And so Howard, you mentioned how the market views it in contrast with what we're saying. And of course, we don't -- we're not second-guessing anybody or the market, but it is a little frustrating. I mean, like when we look at somebody looking just at a quarter, for example, and even this quarter, I think we had a tax item, where we adjusted our state tax apportionment based on where the aircraft fly, which states they fly over because they have different tax rates. So you run that. So we had something that was probably $0.03 to $0.05 in the fourth quarter. Well, that's kind of the difference between the consensus and our $0.53. We hit our target that we set in February of last year for full year EBITDA. And of course, we've talked at length about the visibility we have to sustainable structural growth in our leasing business, which is, as you point out, the source of the majority of our cash flows and will be under long-term agreements for many, many years. And so we feel very fortunate to have that in front of us. As I mentioned, there's a little volatility around the edges with our asset-light ACMI flying, but even they have made tremendous progress since the pre-pandemic period and even since '21. CapEx-wise, the leasing business requires CapEx. There's -- that comes with that territory we get. But with the placements of 20 aircraft this year and more than that in '24, and the first of the 330s, we essentially have locked in growth for 3 years more because even if you pull your -- pull back on investments after '24, the placements you make in '24 are going to drive substantial EBITDA growth in '25. And so we feel very fortunate about that. And we hope that investors focus on that long term and recognize that we've now demonstrated that our model performs well under different economic cycles, having gone through the pandemic, coming out of it. And even the slower growth that we've guided to in '23, contrast that with other transportation companies, and you can see that there truly is a stable base here that we feel very fortunate to have as part of our business model.\nHoward Rosencrans: And I appreciate it. Thank you for all the incremental color. I think you need to dedicate more time to discussing the international customers in slides, et cetera, because clearly, there has been a significant transition that was underappreciated by the investment community, number one. And number two, clearly, things have changed just in terms of the Boeing fleet because 6 months ago, those were not your expectations that those were going to come off or that you were going to -- which was going to extensively lead to, as somebody else commented, a flat run rate of the base core EBITDA. So I think there's a greater understanding, and I can assure you that the market commentary is not based on whether or not you made or missed the fourth quarter by either here or there.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Howard.\nOperator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Rich Corrado for any closing remarks.\nRich Corrado: Thank you, Kevin. We've long discussed the resiliency of our business model, with freighter leasing as the foundation and value-added services that make us unique and differentiated from any other competitor in the world. We have no peers in what we do. Many air transport services companies have struggled through the pandemic trying to get back to a 2019 baseline. Since 2019, ATSG had delivered 38% revenue growth and 42% growth in adjusted EBITDA. And our guidance today continues on that growth trend, although slowed by the same economic headwinds impacting all companies. Still, the visibility we have the cash flows from our freighter investments, with waiting customers over the next 3 years gets us right back on to a 10% EBITDA growth trajectory in 2024 and 2025 just based on the leasing commitments alone. More fortunate market conditions could also lift our other services, delivering even higher returns. Once again, ATSG's resiliency is demonstrated through the most challenging of times. As we drive our results for 2023 and beyond, we remain a great investment for stability, growth and high visibility of future returns. Thank you, all, for your interest in ATSG, and please stay safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation.

Welcome to the Air Transport Services Group Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Joe Payne, Chief Legal Officer. Please go ahead.\nJoe Payne: Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It\u2019s on our website, atsginc.com. Let me begin by advising you that during the course of this call, we will make projections and other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call. Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to, the extent to which changes in market conditions impact the number, timing and scheduled routes of aircraft deployments to new and existing customers; the cost and timing with respect to which we were able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration, which may be impacted by global supply chain disruptions; our operating airline\u2019s ability to maintain on-time service and control costs; our ability to remain in compliance with key agreements with customers, lenders and government agencies; the effects of persistent elevated rates of inflation and changes in general economic and/or industry-specific conditions, such as higher labor costs, increases in interest rates, an economic recession and downturns in customer business cycles; the impact arising from COVID-19 outbreaks, including the emergence of COVID-19 variants; mark-to-market changes on certain financial instruments and other factors as contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-Q we will file next week. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG\u2019s financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials. We advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rich Corrado, our President and CEO, for his opening comments.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. The next slide shows that the third quarter was another successful one for ATSG. CAM, our core aircraft leasing business turned in a record third quarter with a 30% gain in pretax earnings. That gain stems from the 15 new leases of Boeing 767-300 freighters we completed last year and the five others we leased through September this year. Our two cargo airlines are flying more hours and more aircraft. Since last year, our principal customers have been turning to us to fly freighters, not only leased to them by CAM, but also aircraft they obtained from other sources. We had 10 customer-provided freighters in our fleet in September and are adding three more in the fourth quarter. Our revenues grew 11% and we delivered $0.60 in adjusted earnings per share for the quarter and $1.75 per share through nine months. We advised you in February that we expected to deliver $2 per adjusted share for the year, so we're well ahead of that pace. We are also on track to meet or exceed our $640 million of adjusted EBITDA target for 2022. Quint is ready to review the details of our third quarter results. I'll be back to share more about our very bright long-term outlook after that. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Rich, and welcome to everyone on the call this morning. The next slide fills in the details of the third quarter operating highlights that Rich just noted. Overall, our year-over-year results for the third quarter were strong. Our consolidated revenues grew 11% to $517 million. Each of our principal businesses freighter, leasing and airline operations, plus our other activities group delivered good revenue growth. Our adjusted pretax earnings also rose by 11% to $67 million. Adjusted EPS increased $0.03 to $0.60 per share, $0.01 more than the second quarter and our adjusted EBITDA of $163 million beat the prior year quarter by $10 million. As Rich noted, 2021 was a record year for our 767-300 freighter deployments, which means that the returns from all those deployments have stoked CAM's growth throughout 2022 and helped support a 30% increase in its pretax profits in the third quarter. Pretax earnings for our ACMI Services segment were $25 million in the third quarter. That was down from the prior year period, but up $3 million sequentially. Third quarter 2021 results for ACMI Services included $30 million in pandemic-related government grants for Omni Air and in support of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. As we said last quarter, inflation is driving up our airline costs. Travel costs to position our flight crews, increased premium pay and crew training costs and contracted line maintenance are still impacting our bottom-line. We expect those cost pressures to persist, into 2023. The next slide shows that our $10 million growth in third quarter adjusted EBITDA raised our trailing 12-month's pace to $633 million, very close to our 2022 full year goal. We will achieve that goal of at least $640 million through a solid fourth quarter from our airlines, more contributions from combi operations and additional customer-provided cargo aircraft, plus three more newly converted 767 freighter leases. On the next slide, you'll see that we're still on a strong pace for passenger aircraft purchases and conversions. This year's capex plan still at $625 million includes $430 million in growth capex most of which will be paid for from our adjusted free cash flow. Our 21 total aircraft awaiting or in conversion at September 30 includes all we expect to deliver this year and most of those for delivery next year. Rich will update you on our order book and 2023 deployment outlook shortly. The next slide updates you on our adjusted free cash flow, the metric we began providing last year. Represented by the bottom portion of each bar, is our operating cash flow net of our sustaining capex shown on the top. Our adjusted free cash flow is $373 million on a trailing 12-months basis, driven by strong operating cash flow of $552 million. The next slide reflects the self-funding power of our business model to generate significant recurring cash flow to fund a market-driven fleet growth program. Returns from deploying newly converted freighters under long-term external leases, provides us with a substantial portion of the cash we need to meet all of the demand our conversion line capacity allows us to fulfill. Our overall debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio as measured under our senior secured credit agreement remains at about two times. Speaking of our senior secured credit agreement, we recently amended and extended it through October of 2027. The changes also included an increase in our revolver credit capacity from $800 million to $1 billion with no change in our rate structure, plus more flexible terms for share repurchases. A hard limit of $100 million per year in repurchases was replaced with a new variable limit tied to our leverage ratios. The new limit is a full percentage point above our current ratio. We also noted on our August conference call, that restrictions on our ability to buy back shares under the CARES Act would expire in September, and that we would resume repurchases as part of our capital allocation strategy. Accordingly, we resumed repurchases in October under existing Board authority. During that month ATSG repurchased nearly 1.6 million shares or just over 2% of those issued and outstanding through a combination of open market and private transactions. We anticipate continuing to buy back shares along with funding the expansion of our fleet to return value to shareholders. With that summary of the quarter's operating and financial developments, I'll turn it back to Rich, for some comments on our business drivers and outlook. Rich? \nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint. Let me begin by expressing my thanks to everyone at ATSG, who contributed to our solid third quarter performance. We met our key objectives by focusing on delivering the superior service quality our customers expect from us. We also work with our suppliers to overcome challenges and global supply chain impacts. On the next slide, you can see that the tremendous achievements we recorded in 2021 including a record 15 external leases of 767-300 freighters are paying off in 2022. I noted at the beginning that CAM's continuing ability to meet that demand was the principal source of our strong results. CAM's pretax earnings are up 54% year-to-date. This year CAM's focus has shifted from the domestic market for our 767 freighters to demand from abroad. The majority of the 767 freighters released this year will go to non-US customers. Like our customers in the United States, customers in Asia, Europe and Canada are pushing ahead with their own express and cargo networks. The next slide shows that we are already acquiring Airbus passenger aircraft to convert and deploy in addition to Boeing 767s that remain the mainstay of our fleet. We owned seven narrow-body Airbus A321-200 aircraft at the end of Septembe,r and we'll acquire more in the fourth quarter. We'll purchase our first wide-body A330 aircraft in the fourth quarter. It's the first of 29 we expect to acquire, convert and lease starting in 2024. You have likely read recently about Amazon's plans to add A330 converted freighters to their network. Their decision validates what we have known for several years that twin-engine medium wide-body freighters will remain the ideal solution for time-definite, regional express networks and that the Boeing 767 and Airbus A330 will remain the leading candidates to fulfill those roles, which leaves us well positioned to continue our leadership position in this segment. As I said last time, you won't find any evidence of uncertainty among the names in our leased freighter order book. We already hold deposits or commitments from existing customers for more than 20 freighters we expect to deploy in 2023 including at least 14 767-300s and six A321s. At the start of the year, CAM held more than 80 passenger-to-freighter conversion slots for induction in 2022 through 2027. We have identified customers for more than 50 and no one has retracted an order. While demand remains strong, meeting that demand has challenges, we continue to work with all of our conversion suppliers at the highest levels on opportunities to improve conversion throughput. As the next slide shows, we expect 2022 to be another record-setting year for ATSG, with adjusted EPS of more than $2 per share and at least $640 million in adjusted EBITDA. We'll get there via unscheduled deployments of leased 767s, the October resumption of our full schedule of combi flying for the US military and a strong fourth quarter in both cargo and passenger flying. Quint mentioned that we resumed share repurchases in October for the first time since April 2018. It was a timing move as the stock market declined sharply creating opportunities to acquire shares at attractive prices. Our stock price remains a great value even at current prices. As I've said many times, our business model was built for resilience in the face of market uncertainty. Our long-term cash flows from aircraft leases and operating agreements with major organizations like Amazon, DHL and the Department of Defense will allow us to perform at superior levels even in challenging economic times. That concludes our prepared remarks. Quint and I along with Mike Berger, our Chief Commercial Officer are ready to answer questions. May we have the first question operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Frank Galanti from Stifel. Your line is open. \nFrank Galanti: Yes. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to ask about the Amazon A330 orders. I'm not sure what you can talk about, but to the extent that you can. Can you, sort of, talk about if ATSG was competing for those contracts? Is that -- was that, sort of, expected long time coming, or can you just, sort of, talk around that deal from ATSG's perspective? \nRich Corrado: Sure. Thanks, Frank. I'll start this answer and then I'll turn it over to Mike. First off, we've known about Amazon looking into the A330 for some time. It validates our decision to get into the 330 as well as the logical long-term medium wide-body airplane of choice. Obviously, the mainstay of our fleet is the 767 freighter, which we've got 42 on lease to Amazon right now. We're flying 49 of those for them by the end of the year. So, yes, we knew about it for some time. Historically, the way they did their network, they tend to select carriers that already have the aircraft on certificate which Hawaiian did already have the A330 on certificate. It takes an airline about 10 months to a year to put an aircraft on certificate and it also costs a lot of money somewhere between $6 million and $8 million to do that type of work. So that puts us at a disadvantage in bidding where we didn't have it on certificate. So that's kind of like in a nutshell what the view looks like. I'll turn it over to Mike, if he's got any comments. \nMike Berger: Yes, I'll just reiterate. That is consistent with what we've seen in the past. Amazon tends to -- has chosen a provider that has the aircraft on our certificate. But as we've seen that doesn't mean in the future, we may operate the aircraft as well. We see Amazon historically look for multiple providers of aircraft as they develop their network so we stand ready to support Amazon as our largest customer and shareholder in the future. Just to emphasize a little further that the Amazon decision really does validate what we've known for some time that the 330 is the next aircraft that we want to get ourselves into. 767 feedstock becomes more difficult, the 330 is certainly going to be the choice of the integrators and the folks that are flying in the integrators' regional networks. We've already seen that with DHL. They're already flying the aircraft and they're also in our order book for the 330. So as we look forward to the 330, the 20-plus orders from commitments and deposits that we've seen really align strategically with what we're trying to do globally. All those orders will be for customers outside the US as we stand right now. So we really think it reinforces the fact that we made a great decision to get into the A330 aircraft going forward. \nFrank Galanti: That's super helpful. And actually just a quick follow-up on that. You mentioned not having STC was an issue potentially. Does ATSG have plans to get that? And sort of what's the time line around that? \nRich Corrado: We're evaluating that right now in terms of we have three airlines which airline it would make sense to look at the 330. We've looked at it in the past obviously to see what the cost was and the time line to do it so it's still under review right now. The way we've architected our model we're a lease-first business so we look to lease the aircraft first, and flying for us is more like an asset-light value-added service that we offer to enhance the value of the lease that we offer to our customers. So if -- in looking at DHL or Amazon if they wanted to fly in the US as an example, that would certainly be a catalyst for us to move ahead more quickly with getting the aircraft on certificate. \nFrank Galanti: Okay, great. And then I wanted to ask about the share buybacks. It's great to see eligibility to do that and moving in size in October. I just wanted to ask around future expectations around that. Was that more of a one-time opportunistic purchase given the share price movements, or is that, I guess how should we frame in how much share buybacks should be occurring going forward?\nQuint Turner: Hi, Frank it's Quint. As we've said in prior quarters, once CARES expires, we were looking forward to having share buyback as an ongoing tool to add value to the value that's coming through our growth investments for shareholders. And so I wouldn't view the October activity as a one-off. Again in terms of the volume of share buybacks, you may see some variance over time in that depending upon, because we want to be somewhat opportunistic about it. But it will consistently remain in our toolkit for providing value to shareholders. So we would anticipate maintaining that capability and utilizing it on a recurring basis.\nFrank Galanti: Great. Okay. I really appreciate the color. Thanks very much.\nQuint Turner: Thanks Frank.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Our next question will come from Christopher Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Good morning, everyone. Rich, Quint good morning.\nQuint Turner: Good morning Chris.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: So let's see here. There's been a lot of debate as you're aware here that the freighter capacity if you will that's been underwritten over the last two or three years on this was done under the framework here of this parabolic growth in rates here. So just want to help, because this is a question I get a lot as it relates to lessors and I'd say lessor-operators as well. The conversations that you're having with your customers today, could you help us understand the mix of; one, existing; two, those that are new to dedicated airlift; and three, growth?\nRich Corrado: Sure. Thanks for the question Chris. A couple of things. One is if you look at the growth in the network, keep in mind that our assets are focused on express networks, so that's DHL, Amazon. We fly for UPS during peak. And then most, if not all of our lessors, lessees, I should say around the world that we lease to also fly in networks. For example, Raya out of Malaysia, who was just named the Southeast Asia E-Commerce Carrier of the Year. Raya flies for DHL. And we lease to Star as an example into Europe. They fly for UPS. So a lot of our lessees are also flying in these networks. The express network is powered by e-commerce and that's the growth engine for that business. Now you saw a spike in e-commerce during the pandemic that was more related to folks leveraging the Internet to get goods and products that they didn't -- maybe didn't feel safe going outside the home for. That's a whole host of folks that never would have bought online before and they're continuing to buy now. If you look at the statistics globally about e-commerce growth in several of the areas, it's in the 20%, 30% growth still. When we talk to our customers in the United States, you've seen a slowdown in growth in those areas, but there's still growth. When we look at -- we had a conversation with DHL a few weeks ago in their business in the US, which by the way we're adding four planes, four additional aircraft into that they provided to us. The last one goes in the fourth quarter here. They're still looking at rightsizing their network as a good example of why additional freighters are needed. So we're still bullish and all the customers that we have waiting for assets would take them as fast as we could get them to them. And so this e-commerce process phenomenon if you will remains. Now it's adjusting that you went from 2019 to 2022 it's about a 28% increase in express volume. Prior to that, it was in the 5% to 6% range. And according to Boeing, it will settle in around the 5% or 6% range going forward. So we're in an adjustment year, but folks are still looking at getting aircraft. The lead times for airplanes if you recall are very different from reactions to express growth. And one of the great things about this network situation is these carriers have to service the geographies every day. They have time-definite and day-definite commitments. And so when you look at a network such as DHLs or Amazons those networks have to go to Boise Billings Butte Buffalo Boston and Baltimore every day whether the plane is full or whether it's not. So that's what's bolstering our growth and we're pretty bullish on it. I don't know Mike if you have more to add.\nMike Berger: I'll just add a couple of things. It's a really -- it's an important point I'm glad Rich emphasized it that the major integrators are out there selling time ethnic guaranteed products. He talked about it from a U.S. domestic perspective. But the other -- some other components of it that I'd like to speak to in regards to the global connectivity on why the freighter market along with the growth which I'll emphasize is still very much positive. And the engine of e-commerce is very much there is, is that these major integrators the DHL, specifically the UPSs and the FedExes of the world, they're huge, huge buyers of daily freight of wide-body aircraft and they connect globally through the major hubs. Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Schiphol, Heathrow for example. And when you think about the scheduling of wide-bodies, they have not come back to pre-pandemic levels. And the labor issues within these airports, the connectivities and the throughput is still an enormous, enormous issue which gets written about and talked about all the time. So that's a component that people tend not to think about which is not going to go away for any time so just really help support the growth and the stability in the future of the freighter market. So there's other aspects out there. And the e-commerce projections $5 trillion of goods, 80% of cross-border e-commerce sales are transported by air, right? 131 billion parcels are delivered every year from e-commerce. That's expected to double by 2026. So when I talk about the engine is still there, it's still there and it's going to fuel our market for some time.\nRich Corrado: Chris, let me add one -- this is Rich again. Let me add one more thing. There are new markets developing in addition to e-commerce. One of those we've been able to capture a trend on has been passenger carriers that were almost 100% passenger carrier prior to the pandemic looking at coming out of the pandemic needing main deck freighters to supplement what they do to never get into the situation again that they were in. Air Canada, we did two aircraft purchase. We purchased them the aircraft from Air Canada; we converted them and then we leased them back to Air Canada. We're in the process of doing a similar agreement with Vietnam Airlines that we're purchasing two A321 freighters from them converting them and leasing them back to them. So that's a new trend that we're seeing. Additionally, there's been a lot in the market about ocean container transporters that are getting into the air business. And there's speculation on why they're doing this to supplement their service. They've got the advantage of having a captive network of customers and they can speed up certain pieces of their supply chain and improve some of the bottlenecks that they have today. We have in our order book four airplanes going to Maersk. They've got -- rebranded their Star Air out of Denmark that flies for UPS and they'll be flying airplanes in -- for Maersk reasons supplementing their solutions as they go forward to try to help with some of the supply chain issues going on around the globe.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you. And then Rich, if you could give us an update on the pilot contract with ATI, so ALPA put out a press release, I think it was last week. It looks like a proposal was submitted to the union that wasn't accepted. Where are we? What are the next steps here? And then if you could talk about your hiring plans for pilots next year and any \u2013 are you seeing anything outside with respect to turnover for attrition? Thank you.\nRich Corrado: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Chris, giving us the opportunity to clarify that. So the ATI is in its second year of Section 6 bargaining with ALPA to advance a new contract. We \u2013 through the first two years we got a proposal from the union \u2013 I should say ATI got a proposal from the union probably a few weeks before we submitted ours. And we're far apart, but these negotiations tend to go on for several years. We're engaged with the union a couple of times a month at least for several days, and talks that they made a lot of progress on non-economic areas. And so we're continuing to work with the union and work through the negotiation to try to get to a solution. As it relates to hiring plans we're not immune to what's going on in all of the aviation industry, which is shortage of pilots and pilot attrition as other airlines get innovative in the way that they approach hiring and some of the things that, they're doing. And we have done some innovative things in terms of trying to attract pilots. So our attrition is up at all three of our airlines this year. But we planned for it, and we've adjusted to it, and we've adjusted our hiring and training classes. And, we've been able to stay ahead of it, and continue to lead the pack in terms of the service that we offer to our customers. We're in a service business and we realize that. And when we are servicing express business with those time-definite and day-definite commitments we spoke about earlier on-time service is critical, and our airlines have done a fantastic job throughout this year. So we're staying ahead of it. It's something that we're dealing with. It is raising cost, as we noted in the press release in terms of training and in terms of bonus pay, we may have to pay in terms of getting crews to substitute in for training pilots. But it's something we're managing just like every other airline is managing. And going forward, we'll continue to make sure that we've got enough crews to make sure that we meet our commitments to our customers.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. If I could just squeeze in one more. Quint, it's been a while since I've looked at your network in any level of detail here. But your competitor Atlas yesterday, it looks like volumes were significantly impacted in the third quarter due to COVID-19 sick-outs. And I didn't see any of that in your release. Any impact from sick-outs in the quarter or and again, I haven't looked at your network for some time so I don't know how much flying is doing down there in Florida? Thank you.\nRich Corrado: Yeah. This is Rich, Chris. So, a couple of things. One is we don't compete with Atlas in the vast majority of what we do. And the places that they're flying and some of the concerns that they're having are not areas that we fly into. So we're \u2013 most of our flying is domestic US, Omni flies almost all international passenger and ATI of course flies for combis for the military that are international, but most of the flying is domestic. We've had \u2013 as I said before, we've had some pilot attrition. We've had some pilot sick calls, but nothing that's unusual. And we've been able to manage it. And like I said, we're pretty proud of the service that we've been able to offer. We got \u2013 Amazon had that accelerated PEAS program that kind of was like a second Prime Week in October, and they gave us a very solid feedback on how well we adapted and were able to service them. So like I said, we haven't had the same level of concerns and we're managing through the pilot situation. And we're able to maintain service quality that's required by our customers.\nQuint Turner: And Chris, just to sort of tag on to that, again, we talked about differences between our business model and Atlas in the past. And I think again, where we came out this quarter is another good illustration of it. But you've heard us talk about the order pipeline for our midsized freighters and the fact that we haven't had really any issues with customers pulling back from that strong pipeline that extends out, really, a couple of years. And it's why we think that -- and you saw this quarter, our revenue up 11%, the consistently strong performance that we've had throughout. Our business model is, and should be, right, less volatile and I think it's proving that again this quarter. It's why we think that combined with the strong demand that's out there for our -- what we specialize in these midsized freighters and the services we tag on to them, is why we think our stock is a great investment. And that's why you've seen us come out aggressively for share repurchase and anticipate continuing to use that. Obviously, you evaluate that against a capital allocation strategy that may include other alternatives, right, from time to time. So you can modulate that, depending upon your opportunity set. But we think, we're fortunate in this environment and really, it differentiates us from so much of what you're hearing right now about the economy. I know, everybody's tuning in wanting to hear about, is there going to be this big falloff in demand and so forth? And we just -- we really haven't been able to talk about it, because we have not seen it in our case.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And our next question will come from Thomas Fitzgerald from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.\nThomas Fitzgerald: Hi. Thanks so much for the time and congrats on the great quarter. Just a quick one for me. I was wondering if you would mind providing a little more color on the strength in your engine leasing business in CAM. I know, there's a lot of supply chain issues in the -- within aircraft engine so I'd just appreciate your color there and your outlook. Thanks very much.\nRich Corrado: Yes, I'll take that, Tom. Thanks for the question. Yes, so we're unique in what we do from a customer service standpoint. When we lease an airplane to a customer, they have the option to take a power-by-the-cycle program that we have with both our 767-200s and 767-300s. And so, in doing that, we also spare the lease fleet that we have, meaning we have spare engines. So at any one point in time we probably have anywhere from nine to 12 engines out on lease. And so, that's a way that we can add value to our customers, so that they know that they don't have to -- with a smaller fleet to some of the smaller airlines we lease to, they don't have to worry about going out and getting one or two spare engines that they have to make sure their fleet's maintained. And so, those -- through those agreements it's also a lot more stable paying power-by-the-cycle rather than having to accumulate reserves and have enough money when you have to do a $4 million to $6 million engine overhaul. So the leasing has been good, it's been a great value-added differentiator as a lessor and it's enabled us to also get more return on the investment from those engines that we have.\nOperator: Pardon me, Mr. Fitzgerald, please make sure your line is now on mute.\nThomas Fitzgerald: Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much. That\u2019s it for me.\nRich Corrado: Thanks. Tom.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Michael Ciarmoli from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Nice results here. I guess, maybe Rich, just the one follow-up here. You guys are a leasing company, but clearly you've got some of these airline operating risks. As we think about, sort of, this ALPA contract and think about labor costs and wages, they put out something last week, I guess, it was, citing their concerns about ATI. But, I guess, I'm just trying to think of, as you go through the contract process, as we look at pilot shortages, how should we think about overall costs across some of your airlines and as that relates to margins? I mean, is that something we should be contemplating for next year or even 2024? \nRich Corrado: It's tough to predict when the union negotiations will result in a new CBA. And so as we look at -- I think your question was about down line operating risk. We look at the current competitiveness of our compensation program as it relates to attracting and keeping pilots. And that as it sits today we've been able to manage through. I'm not saying -- as I said we're the same as -- we're in the same pot as every other airline. And so there is attrition. And we are managing it. And it is resulting in an increase in cost. And you can see that in our current operating results. But as we go forward, we're going to look to get the most competitive contract that we can, so that we can continue to attract the best professional pilots that are going to allow us to offer the services that we offer. But also, we need to make sure that we're competitive on the other side of the ledger to be able to win business. And so balancing those two is something that we've been able to do in the past. And we believe, that we'll be able to do it in the future, to fairly compensate our crews, have the type of program and work rules that will attract the key pilots going forward, and allow us to compete for business, and win business, and offer the best service that we can.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it got it. That's helpful. And then just back to the Amazon kind of dynamic here. I guess with their deal here with Hawaiian they want to eventually move away from 767s. How do you guys think about that with your current fleet of 767s? Do you have an opportunity to -- again, I think it was brought up earlier around whether or not you get an STC, but do you have an opportunity to provide A330s into them, or should we be thinking about 767s with Amazon's coming off lease? Is there a risk there? I guess just trying to figure out, how this kind of relationship with Hawaiian shakes out over time here.\nRich Corrado: Yeah. Well, first off, Amazon in our discussions is not moving away from 767s. In fact, \u2026\nMichael Ciarmoli: Okay.\nRich Corrado: \u2026we're already getting -- we've already been awarded another 767 from Amazon for 2023 \u2026\nMichael Ciarmoli: Okay.\nRich Corrado: \u2026and there are more coming available. So the issue Michael with the 767 is -- doesn't have anything to do with the competitiveness of the airframe. It has to do with, the fact that going forward in the future there's less feedstock available. And so if you're looking to plan your fleet in the future it makes sense to look to the next-generation airframe to augment your fleet. And I think that's what Amazon has done. So we're still very bullish on the 767. We've got, I believe, 30 slots plus options. We've got, 16 coming -- at least 16 coming next year -- I'm sorry 14 coming next year, and then, -- and more in the year after that. And so it's still a solid airframe. Now, all that said, the same reason we got into the A330, we believe they get into the A330 which is it's the logical high-end result. There's 1,500 of them passenger units out there for conversion. So where there's probably a couple of hundred left of 767-300s. So plenty left, but you also have to be in a market where the passenger carrier wants to re-lease that airplane. We've been very astute and very good at finding feedstock, because this is our business. We don't dabble. We don't go in and out of the feedstock market. We're in there constantly looking to get the best go-forward airplane that's going to make a good freighter. So we \u2013 both airframes are important to the ATSG future and I think Amazon has made a wise decision to augment their fleet with a different aircraft type.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it, got it. And just last one for me. Maybe Quint, you might not answer this but any early read on 2023 EBITDA or CapEx? \nQuint Turner: Thanks, Michael. Typically of course, we guide on that in the next earnings call but \u2013 and we're still of course working through more detail our own projections. But if you think about kind of where we're finishing out 2022, there's a lot of embedded growth and I'm now talking about EBITDA in the assets that have gone online in 2022 including some that are coming on in the fourth quarter. So if you think about sort of the exit run rate we're at here as we leave 2022 and you build you get a full year's contribution from the eight newly-converted freighters that we'll have placed in service this year. And as Rich said, you've got 14, 767s next year. It will sort of be spaced out through the year, right? And then you've got we'd say at least half a dozen 321s. That's a nice starting point to think about growth in EBITDA. And in terms of CapEx, we produced eight aircraft this year newly-converted freighters. Next year it's more like 20. So that piece of our CapEx naturally is going to be is higher because of the production schedule and just the timing of these assets as they move through. And we will be acquiring some feedstock for these new platforms, the A330 in particular, next year. So we'll be buying some passenger feedstock to fund the conversions that will begin producing A330s in 2024. And so we do expect CapEx to again be reflective of a company that's in a growth mode next year. I anticipate elevated CapEx compared to where we're coming out this year \u2013 next year in total because of that. But of course, we have orders and returns that we project on those investments are really strong and we have a balance sheet that's lightly levered. So we're in great position to continue to add value through our growth investments and as we talked through earlier supplementing that with share repurchase.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Got it. Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.\nQuint Turner: See you, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will come from Anthony Berni from Susquehanna Financial [ph] Group. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just had a quick question on 4Q EPS. You've noted your guidance from I believe February hasn't changed but your performance year-to-date is tracking significantly above that. And if I look historically, it seems like from 3Q to 4Q your EPS tends to increase pre-pandemic. But in the past two years it's kind of dipped a little bit. Any color you can give on the near-term in terms of earnings would be great. Thank you.\nQuint Turner: Thanks. Thanks for the question. I think that when you think about EPS, you're correct that this year we've tracked ahead of our initial guidance. We had talked about adjusted EPS at $2 and certainly, we're clearly on pace to beat that. I think next -- in terms of the fourth quarter, you've got higher interest expense will be a factor with what the Fed is doing. So you've got to figure that in as well. So, I believe directionally, you may see it slightly below where we wound up this quarter for the EPS. But I think very similar numbers obviously with our guidance to what we did from an adjusted EBITDA basis for the fourth quarter and again, very strong cash flows. But interest expense is a little bit of a headwind for us certainly in Q4 compared to third quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from Christopher Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Hey. Sorry to double up here. Just quick. So, a lot of moving pieces here with your order book with the deliveries, and I don't think you have any significant planned retirements here. But is there any reason why when we look out to mid-decade that you shouldn't have a fleet of around something between 160 to 170 aircraft?\nQuint Turner: Well, we talked about what 20 and you're talking about it in service. And of course, our customers are likely to give us aircraft to operate, as Rich alluded to earlier. So it depends on what you're talking about operating aircraft or owned CAM aircraft, I guess. But -- and the next couple of years are going to be continued to. And Mike, you can jump in here but...\nMike Berger: I mean just -- there's been a lot spoken about obviously, the balance of 2022 Rich and Quint have provided color around 2023 with at least 14 767s and six on the 321 side. As we move into 2024, on the 767 side we still anticipate double-digits in regards to minimally 767 deliveries in a double-digit range. We'll start delivering the A330s in 2024. At this point, we're anticipating somewhere in the four range as well as continuing on the A321 side. So, your numbers as you look forward to mid-century, you get to feel that we have no intention of not being the world's largest lessor of cargo freighters in the world as we move forward here.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And our next question will come from Scott Cavanagh from APG Asset Management. Your line is open.\nScott Cavanagh: Good morning, guys. Great quarter. Just given your commentary on the shareholder returns and the balance sheet being lowly levered and your commitment to grow with free cash flow, how are you thinking about targeted leverage at this point? And have you given any more thought about trying to push for the investment-grade rating?\nQuint Turner: Thanks for your question. Yes and we've answered, I think, on maybe some earlier quarters. On the investment-grade side, typically, you have to make some affirmations about staying below certain leverage ranges. And we haven't - - to-date we haven't felt that was the right -- necessarily the right place to be. We're just below that currently just below investment-grade, because we wanted the flexibility to invest and we felt like the opportunities were really strong for returns for the shareholders. And we've done that a few times with M&A and so forth. So that hasn't been necessarily a near-term goal to be investment grade for us. And I do think that because we've managed our company pretty conservatively in terms of our balance sheet and the cash flows that we produce has enabled us to keep a really -- a lot of liquidity there with low leverage, we are well positioned if we believe that the returns are there to invest either in share repurchase or the continued growth expansion that Mike has played out to add lift, because we believe that that's going to help shareholder returns and be a smart play. So, we would be comfortable operating at a higher leverage than we are now and that wouldn't be a problem. Certainly, the cost a bit has gone up some right? We're not thrilled about that, but that is the reality. And -- but even given that we believe that we've got dry powder to invest when returns are strong. \nScott Cavanagh : Thank you very much. Great quarter. \nQuint Turner : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Rich Corrado for any closing remarks. \nEnd of Q&A:\nRich Corrado : Thank you operator. Since I first shared the three principal sources of our adjusted EBITDA on our first quarter call in May, I've gotten a lot of positive feedback about how useful it is to explain why our business model is more resilient to economic cycles than others in our space. It's the idea that most of our annual EBITDA comes from three sources. In descending order, they are long-term dry leases; long-term CMI agreements with Amazon and DHL; and Omni's passenger flying for the Department of Defense and other federal agencies. Those pillars are solid today mainly because none of them depends directly on how much or how many items our customers ask us to carry and because fuel costs are covered by the customer either directly or via reimbursement. That's a value proposition few others can claim and it's the message we want to leave with you today. Predictable long-term cash flow really shines at times like this. We're generating it faster than ever this year and can point directly to our sources for it in the future. Thank you for your interest in ATSG. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-08-05 16:35:06", "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2022 Air Transport Services Group Conference Call.  Please be advised that today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Joe Payne, Chief Legal Officer. Please go ahead.\nJoe Payne: Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on our website, atsginc.com. Let me begin by advising you that during the course of this call, we will make projections and other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call. Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to: the extent to which changes in market conditions impact the number, timing and scheduled routes of aircraft deployments to new and existing customers; the cost and timing with respect to which we were able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration, which may be impacted by global supply chain disruptions; our operating airline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to maintain on-time service and control costs; our ability to remain in compliance with key agreements with customers, lenders and government agencies; persistent elevated rates of inflation and changes in general economic and/or industry-specific conditions, such as higher labor costs, increases in interest rates, an economic recession and downturns in customer business cycles; the impact arising from COVID-19 outbreaks, including the emergence of COVID-19 variants; mark-to-market changes on certain financial instruments and other factors as contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-Q we will file next week. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials. We advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website.  And now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn the call over to Rich Corrado, our President and CEO, for his opening comments.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased to tell you that ATSG remains solidly in growth mode. The second quarter was our fourth in a row of double-digit quarterly increases in revenue and adjusted EBITDA over the prior year. Our growth directly reflects that of the principal markets we serve, dedicated midsize freighter aircraft that we lease and fly for major transport integrators and e-commerce merchandisers. Our customers are eager to lease all of the cargo aircraft we can deliver. And the fleets of our cargo airlines are growing even faster than our lease portfolio as our 2 principal air cargo customers prefer that our airlines fly their own freighters and dedicated networks. Others are coming to us for the first time, seeking both wide- and narrow-body freighters for expanding express networks throughout the world. E-commerce remains the principal driver of our growth. Consumers still prefer buying online and not just for convenience. They are also looking for the lower prices they often find online to stretch their own budgets to cover inflation. We remain direct beneficiaries of the rapid delivery that online shopping requires, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep reinvesting the majority of our strong cash flow to meet this demand. At the same time, we benefited from increased passenger flying. We fully expect to meet our $640 million adjusted EBITDA target for 2022. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll deploy 10 lease freighters in 2022, including 4 767s and 2 Airbus A321s in the second half. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1 Boeing 767 fewer than our prior target, primarily due to the delays in our conversion vendor related to parts and supply chain challenges. Quint is ready to review the details of our second quarter results. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be back to share more about our very bright long outlook after that.\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Rich, and welcome to everyone on the call this morning. The next slide in our deck hits some of the second quarter operating highlights that Rich mentioned. Overall, our year-over-year growth in the second quarter was similar to the pace we were on in the first quarter. Our consolidated revenues for the second quarter grew $100 million to $510 million, totaling nearly $1 billion for the first half. As they did in the first quarter, each of our principal businesses, freighter leasing and airline operations, delivered strong revenue growth exceeding 20%. Our adjusted pretax earnings again rose sharply, up 80% from the prior period to $67 million. Our adjusted EPS increased $0.24 to $0.59, and our adjusted EBITDA of $158 million beat the prior year quarter by 23%. Our segment earnings grew even faster than revenues after adjusting for government grants in 2021 intended to protect jobs from pandemic effects in the passenger airline business. Our ACMI Services earnings in the second quarter rose to $22 million from $6 million minus $38 million in 2021 grants. CAM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretax earnings increased 76%. Inflation is impacting our airline costs, particularly in travel costs to transfer our passenger service crews to and from their assignments and in other employee-related expense. Travel, in particular, was up more than 50% in the second quarter versus the prior year period, and our salaries, wage and benefits line rose 15%. Most of the military passenger flights we operate involve longer overseas travel requiring augmented flight crews, which makes our costs more expensive compared to our shorter cargo flights, which are over mostly domestic 2-crew member routes. On the next slide, you can see that our $30 million growth in second quarter adjusted EBITDA raised our trailing 12-months pace to $623 million. Our plan currently calls for more adjusted EBITDA in the second half versus the first, with a third quarter that is similar to our second quarter and a stronger fourth quarter. That assumes lease deployments in line with our revised outlook and fourth quarter gains from ACMI Services that include expanded combi operations and 6 additional customer-provided cargo aircraft. On the next slide, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see that our capital spending for aircraft purchases and conversions in 2022 so far is $5 million ahead of our 2021 pace. Most of that spending is for conversion costs, which are growing at a rate consistent with the slower pace of deliveries from our conversion vendor. Our 19 total aircraft in line for conversion at June 30 includes all of the 6 we expect to deliver in the second half this year, plus more than half of the 18 on our delivery schedule for next year. We said last quarter that we would remain in the market for feedstock aircraft after acquiring several in the first half. We will purchase 2 more passenger aircraft and place more deposits on 2023 aircraft acquisitions than were in our original 2022 growth budget. We have increased our growth CapEx guidance for this year by $30 million to $420 million to cover those purchases and higher conversion costs. The next slide updates you on our adjusted free cash flow, the metric we began providing last year. Represented by the bottom portion of each bar, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our operating cash flow, net of our sustaining CapEx shown on the top. Once again, the trailing 12-month totals for GAAP operating cash flow shown above the bars include $83 million in cash we received in Federal pandemic relief grants last year. Our adjusted free cash flow year-to-date is $161 million, down from $207 million a year ago. Operating cash flow declined principally due to an increase in receivables. The trailing 12 months total of $355 million was also down from first quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $406 million. As I mentioned a moment ago, this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth CapEx plan is now at $420 million, most of which will come from our adjusted free cash flow. The next slide represents our value proposition over time. Our business model generates significant recurring cash flow, while at the same time, strong demand for our freighter aircraft provides us with very profitable ways to reinvest it. Our overall debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, as measured under our bank credit agreements, is below 2x. Our credit revolver balance increased to $515 million during the second quarter. In addition to draws for growth CapEx spending, we took advantage of an opportunity to repurchase $120 million in face value of the $700 million in 4.75% unsecured notes outstanding. Note repurchases were at an average discount of 5.5% and funded from our variable rate credit revolver now at 2.7%. The repurchases, which were funded from the revolver, reduced our outstanding debt by nearly $7 million, with an ongoing interest expense benefit based on the difference between the bond coupon and our revolver rate. In June, Moody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Investor Service recognized the quality of our balance sheet and growth prospects by upgrading our ratings on debt at the corporate level to Ba1, just below investment-grade. Moody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cited our reduced debt-to-EBITDA leverage and strong earnings and cash flow as reasons for the upgrade. With that summary of the quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating and financial developments, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn it back to Rich for some comments on our business drivers and outlook. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint. Before I begin sharing some comments on our 2022 performance and outlook, I want to commend, as I always do, the efforts of our employees across all of our businesses that create the results that I get to share with investors each quarter. I appreciate their resourcefulness in working towards goals that I know seems challenging at first, knowing they usually find ways to meet or exceed them. They make ATSG a great, diverse place to work and make me proud to be one of them. Last quarter, we reviewed some of last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accomplishments that are delivering benefits now. The 15 767 freighters we leased last year, 11 of which went to Amazon, are the largest source of our 2022 growth. Including 7 more freighters that Amazon has purchased or leased elsewhere but assigned to us to fly, our Amazon-dedicated fleet will soon total 49 767 freighters. We also noted that the map of our aircraft deployments is expanding rapidly. 8 of the 10 767 and Airbus A321 freighters we will place this year are going to non-U.S. customers in Asia, Europe and Canada. Those customers are pushing ahead with their own cargo networks designed to provide the same e-commerce fulfillment missions as the ones we support in the U.S. The majority of our 2023 lease deployments will be headed overseas as well. And finally, as the next slide shows, we are beginning to add new aircraft types from the Airbus family. Our joint venture designed a narrow-body Airbus A321-200 freighter as a conversion from passenger aircraft. CAM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first 2 of these smaller but highly efficient freighters will be leased later this year to its newest customer, ASL Aviation Holdings. Three other passenger A321s we own will be among at least 4 we convert and lease in 2023. ASL, based in Ireland and with operations throughout the world, has also ordered 2 of the larger wide-body Airbus A330 freighters we will start to lease in 2024. A330 freighters are somewhat larger than our Boeing 767-300s but serve essentially the same missions in express networks throughout the world. We hold options to buy feedstock passenger A330s along with more 767-300s and A321s that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll begin to exercise as part of our 2023 growth CapEx program. We hear, as you do, forecasted worldwide reductions in capital investment and slower economic growth in the months ahead, but you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find any evidence of that in our leased freighter order book. We already hold deposits for most of the 18 freighters we expect to deploy in 2023, including 14 767-300s and at least 4 A321s and commitments from long-standing customers for the others. We also stay in touch with those looking forward to some of the freighters we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll deploy after 2023. None has indicated anything but a strong interest in building their freighter networks with us. Of the more than 80 passenger-to-freighter conversion slots CAM holds for induction from 2022 through 2026, more than 50 are already spoken for by customers in our order book. This year, CAM has already delivered 4 of the 8 767-300 freighters it expects to lease this year. Supply chain constraints affecting passenger-to-freighter conversion businesses have limited our number of additional freighters we can lease. Moving forward, our conversion vendor expansion, along with reduction in those bottlenecks, will increase the conversion pace next year. One other thing that bears repeating from last quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call is the breakdown of our 3 principal sources of adjusted EBITDA: long-term dry leases of freighters; long-term airline operating agreements with Amazon and DHL; and thirdly, passenger flying, mainly for the Department of Defense. Those 3 sources are more than 90% of our total adjusted EBITDA. Looking at the duration of those contracts, the size of the customers and our strong relationships with each one of them, our adjusted EBITDA stream looks to be very resilient to disruption from recession or trade imbalances. We get lease revenue whether a freighter is fully or partially utilized. And the freighters we fly in the Amazon and DHL networks are scheduled generally every day, helping them meet time-definite overnight commitments to shoppers throughout the U.S. no matter how full an aircraft is on any particular day. For Omni, our flying depends on what the Department of Defense or other government agencies need, regardless of the economy. That includes moving people for military exercises, troop rotations, natural disasters, personnel moves and other things that project readiness and maintain a strong presence abroad. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know of any other company in the transport business with more built-in protection from the risk factors most of you are focused on today. As the next slide shows, we expect 2022 to be another record-setting year for ATSG with adjusted EPS of $2 per share and $640 million in adjusted EBITDA. All of you are reading or reporting this quarter about the impact of inflation on the passenger airlines and, in particular, about how it has pushed beyond their fuel costs and into their labor and other operating expenses. ATSG is largely insulated from higher fuel prices, which are passed on to our customers under our operating agreements. But like the other airlines, inflation is affecting our employee costs and, to a lesser extent, other categories, more than we expected when we set our 2022 guidance last February. When we talked in May, we were already somewhat ahead of our projected pace to $640 million in adjusted EBITDA. Today, we expect to achieve it via on-schedule lease deployments, resumption of our full schedule of combi flying for the U.S. military, cost controls and price recovery where we can achieve them and a strong fourth quarter in both cargo and passenger flying. Net-net, we expect our third quarter adjusted EBITDA to look a lot like our second, with significant improvement in the fourth quarter. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also focused beyond 2022 on investments we will make to drive our earnings and adjusted free cash flow higher in 2023 and beyond. We see forecasts that still indicate freighter conversion and new freighter production capacity will remain tight. Those supply limitations plus uncertain cargo space availability on passenger aircraft will keep freighters in strong demand for several years. Investing our capital into that trend makes great sense to us. Many of you have asked about our plans for cash returns to shareholders when restrictions expire at the end of September. The Board of Directors is very focused on this as well, and we look forward to having the ability to allocate cash between growth opportunities and share repurchases after the restrictions expire. As a reminder, the Board\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing authorization for ATSG share repurchases is still in effect, with significant repurchase authority remaining. In the meantime, the people of ATSG will continue to execute against the aggressive goals we have set out for 2022 while searching for new ways to expand our cash flow in the years ahead. That concludes our prepared remarks. Quint and I, along with Mike Berger, our Chief Commercial Officer, are ready to answer questions. May we have the first question, operator?\nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nJack Atkins: So I guess maybe if we could just start, Rich, going back to your comments on the outlook. I just wanted to kind of level set. If you go back to 3 months ago, the comment around running ahead of plan for EBITDA and for EPS for the full year through the first quarter. That language seems to have changed a bit. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just sort of curious, is that the inflationary cost pressures that have kind of crept up here over the last few months? Or are you still -- do you still believe that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running ahead of your initial outlook? Just kind of wanted to make sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the same page on that.\nRich Corrado: Yes, Jack, thanks for the question. Yes, we were very positive in our prior comments in regard to being ahead of plan. But as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen through this quarter, there has been more cost pressure. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a demand-related issue at all. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really related to some cost pressure. But we still believe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make our $640 million in adjusted EBITDA and -- but we did not feel comfortable expanding guidance at this time.\nJack Atkins: Okay, got it. And then I guess, as you sort of think about to your point on demand remaining very strong, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve certainly seen a little bit of a reset in terms of B2C activity when you look at sort of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been going on with the integrators and what we see out of Amazon and things like that in terms of their public comments. As you sort of think forward over the course of the next couple of years, are you seeing sort of any change in tone in terms of what your customers are telling you, bigger picture about their longer-term plans for capacity needs? Any sort of maybe reassessment of that? Or yes, just would love to kind of get your thoughts on that as well.\nRich Corrado: Yes. Just in the short term -- I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn this over to Mike in a minute. But in the short term, Jack, what I can tell you in regard to the U.S. networks, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re slated to put 4 more airplanes into the DHL network this year and 2 more airplanes into the Amazon network this year, that they are providing to us and the 4 DHL is providing to us. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing the demand for freighters as large as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been in the past. And then as it relates to the ongoing e-commerce demand around the globe, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn it over to Mike. He probably is the best person to comment on that.\nMike Berger: Yes. Thanks, Rich. Just to reiterate, we have not seen any weakness in demand really at all. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked at length about the order book not only for this year but the upcoming years. And we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen any indication from any of our existing customers that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re -- any hesitancy at all. In fact, all have communicated quite clearly that if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to take the new aircraft, new deliveries early, they certainly would. From a broader perspective, e-commerce is certainly still the engine and it remains very strong. And as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said many times, ATSG is really an enabler to e-commerce. But when you think about some of the industry folks, the consultants and IATA and Boeing and Airbus, et cetera, the freight fleet, the 20-year freighter fleet activity is going to increase, Jack, by 2.5%, 2.4% over the next 20 years out to 2041. And 2/3 of those freighters are operated by the integrators or on behalf of 5 companies, the 5 major integrators when you think of Amazon, DHL, UPS, FedEx and SF. So we feel real bullish and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about it at length. Either those folks are our direct customers or they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 customers, meaning that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re flying in these guys\u00e2\u0080\u0099 regional networks. So we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it at all. In fact, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re extremely bullish about it and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re certainly poised with feedstock to meet that demand.\nJack Atkins: Okay, all right. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really encouraging to hear. And I guess, for my last question before I turn it over, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to hit on the capital allocation question. Rich, you talked about buybacks and the ability to kind of get back into the market with buybacks here in a couple of months once the CARES Act restrictions expire. I guess kind of bigger picture, any additional insight you can share about how senior management and the Board are thinking about capital allocation as we kind of move forward? Obviously, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- as Mike was just outlining, a lot of demand for your assets so the growth capital is needed. There are opportunities to pay down debt and then also pursue buybacks. I mean, how do you balance that? And should we think about you being opportunistic with the buyback moving forward? Or maybe more consistently in the market? I guess, just kind of trying to balance all those things.\nRich Corrado: Sure. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start this off and then Quint may have some other comments. But in general, Jack, we believe that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to do both. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to allocate capital to the growth, which the demand, as Mike has talked about, is very high. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got, I think, 50 commitments out of the 80 slots we have through 2026 with agreements and/or cash down. So the demand is very strong. But if you look, one of the slides showed that although we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re increasing our fleet, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been delevering over the last 3 years. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lightly levered now under 2x. And we believe that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to deal with the growth that we have coming up out through 2026 and still be able to return capital to shareholders. Now we do -- we -- I believe October 1 is when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re free of the CARES Act restrictions as it relates to buying back shares. And from that point forward, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look to make smart decisions and be in the market opportunistic and potentially on a regular basis to buy back shares. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let Quint maybe fill you in on some of the details.\nQuint Turner: Yes. I mean, Rich covered it real well, Jack. Certainly, the balance sheet strength that we have and the sort of growing portfolio of laddered-out leases that CAM is so successfully marketing gives us a lot of visibility to future cash flows and gives us confidence as to where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re heading with our projections long term. We all know quarter-to-quarter, sometimes, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bump here or there. But long term, that gives us a lot of confidence and ability to use share repurchase to create additional value on top of our growth plan. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re levered under 2x and that also positions us well. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really excited about getting that tool back when CARES expires here in a couple of months to go along with our growth value that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been creating.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Absolutely. I know it will be good to have that arrow back in the quiver.\nOperator: Next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: I just wanted to follow up on Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question. Is there a goal for leverage? Under 2x is pretty impressive. And I know the one slide talks about being able to grow without really adding significant leverage. Are you thinking 2x is the upside or are you willing to get up to 2.5x or 3x? I mean, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been more levered than that in the past.\nQuint Turner: Yes. I think for -- it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Quint. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll lead off on this, I guess. But Helane, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really dependent on the opportunity that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out there and how we evaluate that. We certainly, as you point out, for acquisitions that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve levered up above 3x. While we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve managed the company pretty conservatively overall, we spent most of our -- the last 1.5 decades, probably more in the 2.5x range or less. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve certainly levered up when the opportunity set was attractive. And because of that visibility of the cash flow that I mentioned a minute ago, we would do that again if that was -- if that seemed to us to be the prudent and best accretive way to create value. But we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a specific target to answer your question. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not -- it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the things about where the rating agencies have us, which is right under investment-grade. I mean, we actually kind of like that because sometimes when you become investment-grade, which I believe this company could certainly do, if that were the wish to be investment-grade, it sometimes can hamper you a bit on taking on more leverage for opportunities. And I kind of like the sweet spot we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in, where we get good pricing in the credit markets, but we maintain the flexibility to move forward and create value for our shareholders when the opportunity is attractive.\nHelane Becker: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very helpful. You actually said something in your prepared remarks about the increase in receivables. Is that something we should worry about? I was sort of -- you rarely call things like that out when you talk, and so I was kind of surprised to hear that. So what are you not saying?\nQuint Turner: Well, we called it out just because I think for the last several quarters, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve kind of seen that adjusted free cash flow stat, that new non-GAAP stat, that points to that capital that the business throws off, that we have the ability to grow with or return to shareholders. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of the first time in many quarters that, that number actually went down a little. And the reason is real identifiable. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing of concern. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more timing related than anything else. You have receivables. As you know, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take on any significant fuel price risk but we do buy fuel for customers. And in this particular quarter-end, there was just -- I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big piece of those receivables. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the timing of settling the reimbursement of fuel with some of our CMI customers. So absolutely nothing to worry about in terms of collectability or anything like that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with SIG.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So Rich, I appreciate the color and the sort of perspective on sort of managing the business here through a potential cyclical slowdown. But we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really seen the model. I believe you reconfigured the business back in 2010 or so. So we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really seen the model battle-tested, if you will, during a recession. And I just -- if you could -- there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously a lot of concern here around what cargo and things like that might do into a cyclical slowdown. So just want to dig in to hear around next year, you have 18 freighters out there. The assets that you have, lease rates appear to be holding up. Could you help us get a little bit more sort of confident about your ability to grow EBITDA through a downturn? And also with the placements of the aircraft with overseas customers, should we assume then that, that would put sort of sustained upward pressure on items such as travel and insurance expense? And then the last part of that. Just remind us insofar as aircraft that have been locked in and then the aircraft with the LOIs, what are the sort of protection that you have in place? Or how do the sort of contracts work if a shipper, an airline today decides, \"Okay, we want this capacity next year or 2024.\" Things turn and they, at some point, reach out and say, \"You know what, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to be able to take that tail.\"\nRich Corrado: Okay, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot to unpack there, Chris. First off, as far as operating the company through a cyclical downturn, there have been, if you remember, 2013, 2014 was a pretty poor year for air cargo. And then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d start to cycle out of it in 2015 and 2016. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone through some pressure points in the past. But I think the discussion that in the prepared remarks that I put forth about the resiliency of our business model of the existing business, which is all the leases that we have and the dry leases that are -- need to be paid, whether the aircraft are fully utilized or not, the networks that we provide service for in DHL and UPS -- sorry, DHL and Amazon, that they need -- they provide daily committed time-definite services on those networks. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- it would be very unusual for them to cut back on those networks and not service Billings, Boise, Butte and Buffalo on any given day. And then the last part is the military. The military really -- or the Department of Defense and other government agencies that we fly for really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t -- their demand is not a function of the global economy or the business cycle. So the existing business is very resilient when it comes to economic downturns. Now you look forward to the growth portion of our business and the leases and -- from the conversions that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be doing over the next -- that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got scheduled over the next 3 to 4 years, those customers, the majority of them fly in networks around the globe. So they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re flying for similar customers that are performing e-commerce-type deliveries and those types of things. And so again, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a more resilient demand. Then you will see in like general cargo, general air cargo tends to have a much more alignment up and down with global trade and the global economy where the e-commerce business and the network business tends to be a little bit more resilient or a lot more resilient because of the network need that those assets provide. When we look at the demand that we have currently for the assets that we have scheduled in 2023, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got backup. In other words, if ABC company doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the airplane, we can turn around and lease it to another company that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s farther down or later on the list. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got that much demand out 2 to 3 years, in some cases, depending on the aircraft type. So we think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got robust enough demand that should there be any type of softness on any individual airline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part, then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve certainly got enough built-up demand that will be able to step in and take that. I will also say that the way we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve structured this model and the way that we deal with slots and conversion houses and deposits for slots and those types of things, at any point in time, if we believe that either the returns on a leasing basis or the demand of the market would change or shift, we can always put our foot on the brake and stop buying feedstock and stop converting airplanes, and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just be throwing off a lot of cash that we have -- that we could look to do other things with, return it to shareholders or invest in other things that may be in a more growth mode at that point in time. So again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a very flexible set of levers here to pull should the demand market change. But I want to be real clear on this. The market demand for leased freighters is as strong as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever been. And when I look at all 3 aircraft types that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re involved with now, the A321, the 767 and the A330, all 3 of them have very strong demand. And we -- and the ones that are out 2 years or 3 years, we check in with them regularly. A lot of them are the same ones that are taking airplanes next year or this year. And so -- and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all still -- if they could take more airplanes tomorrow, they would take them. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a really strong demand outlook.\nMike Berger: I would also just add that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve either -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got our commitments to source aircraft in the market today, Chris, is extremely tight, meaning feedstock availability is -- has never been harder around the 767 specifically. We have secured or have the ability to secure it through deposits, enough aircraft to take us through 2024 in regards to our 767s, for example. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fielding calls all the time from all those folks who are trying to purchase those aircraft from us. So it just goes to the strength of the market in terms of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- what we see across -- literally across the globe. And I think Rich made a great point. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just reiterate it. The DHLs, the FedExes, the UPSs of the world, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got global day and time commitments to make sure that their packages are being delivered. And to do that, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to fly confirmed schedules. And even if you look at their, meaning FedEx and UPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most recent results, you see strong double-digit growth, specifically in their international products, which means the cross-border aspect of e-commerce is still not only alive and well but growing really strong. I made comments about the strength of e-commerce as it relates to growth. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s optimism specifically, when you look at economies like Brazil, which only has 5% e-commerce sales compared to total sales; India, under 10%; Vietnam, 6.5%; Mexico, 11%. So e-commerce as it relates to overall retail sales is still very much in the early days. And when you look at the growth estimates out to 2025, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still 24%, 25% of total retail. So the engine is still great as we look out over the next few years. And again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got everything in place with diversification in terms of conversion houses as well as feedstock to meet that demand from customers.\nQuint Turner: Yes. Another metric comment, Chris, this is Quint. Just, for example, our cargo block hours that we -- our 2 primary airlines that serve the cargo customers, ABX and ATI flew -- were up about 13% for the first half compared to the first half last year, and for the quarter, up about 7%. And of course, the tax line and the combi flying, so we lump those together, Omni and ATI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flying for their combi 75s, those are up 22% year-over-year in the first half and up about 13% in the second quarter over the prior year quarter. So the big customers that fly these airplanes, you can see, are expanding. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of the differentiator between some of the long-haul routes where you may be more sensitive, right, to recession and demand. The e-commerce-driven networks are still -- need the asset and have to serve those geographies in their network.\nRich Corrado: The last couple of comments because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve kind of made a lot of comments on this section is you asked about travel cost. And these aircraft that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leasing outside the country, which is the majority of the, if not all, the Airbus products going forward that we have in the order book, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just dry leases so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not operating them. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just tendering to the operator and the operator is going to fly them in the network that they fly. The last comment I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make is there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2 sources of demand for freighters. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a growth demand and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a replacement demand, just like there are for all airplanes. And so when you look at the growth demand, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve kind of addressed that going forward. When you look at the replacement demand, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the key reasons we got involved with the A321 freighter. The A321 is a direct replacement for the 75. They stopped building 75s in, I think, 2005. And so there hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been 1 built in 17 years. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somewhere around a 15% to 20% fuel burn advantage in the A321 versus the 757. So when you look at all the ESG goals and all the ESG -- the carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions goals and -- that airlines are looking forward to in terms of reduction, that aircraft is going to play a great role in replacement and being a greener airplane for the segment of the business that it serves.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Rich, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll throw one more your way. So Airfinance Journal just put out their annual report. It looks like CAM made it into the top 25 in terms of number of aircraft under management. Are you comfortable growing the fleet 10, 15 tails per year and kind of steady grinding up the ladder there? Would you consider potentially accelerating this as you look to grow that fleet number for 200 units and beyond?\nRich Corrado: Yes. No, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great question. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re -- I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you what, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really proud of the fact here that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the largest lessor of freighter aircraft in the world and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only adding to that leadership position. Prior, it was all 767s. Going forward, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a blend of the 3 aircraft types. And if you look at our growth plan going forward, I mean, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going -- I think we did it in the mid-teens last year. We dropped down to 10 this year just in terms of the schedule of the conversions. Next year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got 18 on the schedule. The year after that, in 2024, we got 25 on the schedule. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ramping up as we get into and we start to get into the A330, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start putting aircraft in, in September of 2023, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got 29 slots going out through 2026. And then you look at the 767 slots we have and the A321s, of course, we do our own conversions with our own MRO, PEMCO down in Tampa. We will be ramping up, and we will be delivering more freighters to meet the goals of the customers that we serve. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the leader now and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud of that. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking forward to maintaining that leadership position and adding more value to our customers and more returns to our shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mr. Galanti with Stifel.\nFrank Galanti: I wanted to start off with pilot availability. And so you sort of called out a little bit just higher cost pressures in general. And given sort of headlines around a lack of pilots, more so on the passenger side, if you could talk about sort of any changes in pilot availability for ATSG? And if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of any concerns, given the desire to -- the growth mode that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re currently in, are there any concerns over having that being a limiting factor going forward?\nRich Corrado: No, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great question, Frank. Thank you. Yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not immune from the attrition that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on in the pilot force these days. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the things we refer to when we talk about cost pressures on the employee side. We planned on some attrition this year in the pilot ranks for all 3 airlines, so there was some in the plan. And so what that means is you plan on training people and bringing them in, and so the training cost is factored into your cost. We have seen it be a little higher than the plan. For example, ATI planned on training 5 pilots per month and I think last month, they trained 8. And so what that means is we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having to run larger training classes. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not having any problem attracting pilots. You read -- you probably read in some segments of the market, there is a problem attracting pilots. We haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen that yet. Based on where we are, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got midsized airlines. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good career to come to ATI, ABX or Omni and be able to grow and go from a first officer to a captain quicker than if you went to a major. And so you can fly your own very large jet and be making higher income as a captain. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a good opportunity for people. So it has raised our cost a little bit. We are keeping up with the training and putting the -- a good example, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re growing the aircraft we talked about at ATI for Amazon and in ABX for DHL. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have no problem getting the pilots in place for those growth assets that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see at the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. So it has affected us. We are keeping up with it, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re -- it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s factored into our cost and our guidance for the rest of the year.\nFrank Galanti: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful. And I sort of want to go back to the growth question, maybe from a little bit of a different angle. So looking sort of at the current growth that ATSG is experiencing, I guess, broader industry, the question is, is that -- what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re experiencing, is that through the kind of just industry increased demand for airfreight? Or is there a component of sort of taking share from other lessors? Or even within businesses, is there more of a desire to lease rather than own on the margins?\nRich Corrado: Yes. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good question. A couple of things. One is that the e-commerce growth engine started pre-pandemic. And so the pandemic did accelerate that growth over the 2.5-year period. And so -- and what it did is it brought a lot of new adopters to that buying platform that probably never would have gotten involved in that buying platform and juiced the demand up. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got people who buy online that never would have bought online. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that demand that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of been accelerated, but it was already in a much higher growth mode than your general air cargo mode. And then you look at the growth for freighters. Why has the growth of freighter picked up? And I talked about before. Both on the replacement side, if you look at what occurred through that kind of accelerated demand, anybody would have -- anybody that -- people were pulling freighters out of the desert, C checking them, getting them ready and putting them up to fly, right? They were taking passenger seats out of larger jets and loading them up with cargo to fly to make up for the dearth in freighters that was out there. So what you see now is part of the demand is kind of a rightsizing or a right allocation of what asset do I need on that lane. And is it a narrow-body? Is it a medium wide-body? Is it a larger aircraft? So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that level of demand that I think is kind of going on. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got your 733 and your 734s that are now being replaced by 738s and A321s as an example. So you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got those -- that type of demand profile picking up. But I think one of the other trends that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve actually been the beneficiary of is passenger carriers that are now getting -- that are becoming combination carriers, that are getting into the cargo business. We announced last year an opportunity with Air Canada, where we acquired 2 767s from Air Canada. We converted them and we leased them back to Air Canada. And then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing the same exact deal on the A321 basis with Vietnam Airways. We are acquiring 2 A321s from them. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re converting them to freighters and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leasing them back to them. So I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of an interesting opportunity where some of these passenger carriers have seen the situation when they faced the pandemic where they had to pull down a number of resources but they could have stayed engaged on the cargo side more efficiently if they had freighters. And so they want to now get into the freighter market. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been the beneficiary of that, and we hope to be -- continue to be the beneficiary of that kind of new demand segment that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in the market. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, Mike, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got any other comment.\nMike Berger: No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just add a couple of things. And those Vietnam aircraft will be 2023 deliveries for us or in our 2023 order book. I just -- part of your question was around taking market share. And I think the one thing that I would just reiterate is that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really prideful in the due diligence that we do, who are our customers, to ensure that our customer base, number one, is credible and most importantly, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re deploying $30-plus million assets, that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to -- we feel confident that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting -- our customers can afford these things to make sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to receive our receivables, which are in great shape. Our receivables have never been better from a CAM perspective. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really important to us. We get calls all the time, inquiries, so to speak, about leasing folks freighters. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very careful. If we get into younger airlines or start-up situations, we really flesh them out. We ask them to present us not only their financials but their business cases that they go to market. And when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a leadership position that we are and as Rich mentioned, the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest lessor of cargo freighters, we get a lot of inquiries from folks, and we want to make sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing business with the right folks around the world. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really important to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Kulisch with FreightWaves.\nEric Kulisch: First time on one of these calls. I had a couple of questions. You talked a little bit about e-commerce being very strong for you. But I think e-commerce sales have dipped globally and in the U.S. this year, naturally. Are you seeing any change in the mix of your freight for your e-commerce freight?\nRich Corrado: Yes. So we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t -- Eric, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get visibility to necessarily what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the boxes and the mix of the freight. The only thing I could tell you is during the pandemic, the packages got and the airplanes got a lot heavier because there was hand sanitizer and cleaners and everything else, fluids going on the airplanes in as much as iPhones and stuff, package and styrofoam. So we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get visibility really to the mix of freight that goes on there. But part of, I think, our discussion here has really been the distinction of demand for packages and the demand for freighters, right? So -- and one is derived certainly from the other. But there are other -- there are certainly other factors involved in the demand for freighters. One is replacement versus growth and the other one may be a rightsizing of the network. I mean, one of the questions Frank asked in regard to -- about leasing versus buying freighters, one of the things that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inherent in what we do is availability. So if you have the availability of a freighter when someone wants it or when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking out in their fleet plan for 2 or 3 years, they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a manufactured freighter from Boeing as an example. There are no available in that line. And then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always been proactive about getting slots for airplanes because for us, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lower-risk proposition and we exercise our acquisition of feedstock around demand. So from that standpoint, I think one of the things that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to do is have availability of assets ongoing.\nEric Kulisch: Let me ask you briefly. The Atlas Air yesterday, they had a big acquisition. They were taking -- going to be taken private and bought by investors. Wondering how you see that impacting any competition for you guys. And do you have any interest in expanding through any acquisitions?\nQuint Turner: Yes. I mean, we -- Eric, this is Quint. We typically don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t comment on things like that. I mean, obviously, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a public company and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to see where we trade and so forth. We saw the news on Atlas and understand their shareholders will consider the merits of that and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be looking at closing that deal. We have, on many calls, pointed out that there -- while there are some areas where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve competed with Atlas, the companies are quite different and there are differences in equipment type and where the focus is. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been, of course, heavily focused on the leasing angle, probably more -- a little more so than they have as a portion of our overall book of business. And they operate, of course, the long-haul big equipment, where we focus on the midsized freighters that serve the integrated network. So competition, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really -- while there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some overlap, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a lot.\nEric Kulisch: Got you. Okay, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good color. And then last question. Can you go into a little more detail on some of these supply chain issues that are impacting conversions? Is it labor shortages at either the suppliers or the assembly lines? Or is it products or actually materials and so forth that are being impacted? Or is it the shipping congestion?\nMike Berger: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a combination of really of everything. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a shortage of demand in terms of parts and kits, materials, precious metals, et cetera. A lot of these kits are from China. So as China has gone through some of the COVID lockdowns, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caused delay from that perspective, which obviously is labor-related, et cetera. But I will tell you that some of the things that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked on to mitigate that is, for example, to have additional conversion slots with Boeing, which will start soon later this year and well into the next few years. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re diversifying ourselves in terms of where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do our 767 conversions. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got multiple MROs where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing the 321 conversions as well, as well as the 330s will be done at multiple locations. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mitigating that by having multiple locations for the conversions in the upcoming year. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already seeing some easing in regards to parts, supplies, materials, et cetera, like conversions. And like I said, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said all along, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not demand that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driving that, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really just the timing of it.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn the call back to Rich Corrado for any final remarks.\nRich Corrado: Thank you, Carmen. Thank you again to all of our employees who work hard every day to take care of our customers. Their efforts make it possible for us to deliver excellent returns for our shareholders. I hope you have a better understanding of what makes ATSG a unique investment in the transport space. Midsized freighter aircraft will remain in strong demand over the next several years because e-commerce customers expect fulfillment that only a dedicated transport network can provide. Our leased aircraft assets order book and airlines will generate plenty of cash flow to fund our growth and share with our investors. Thank you all for your interest in ATSG.\nOperator: And with that, we conclude today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-05-06 15:23:12", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2022 Air Transport Services Group, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Richard, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Joe Payne, Chief Legal Officer of ATSG. Mr. Payne, you may begin.\nJoe Payne: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website, atsginc.com. Let me begin by advising you that during the course of this call, we will make projections and other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call. ATSG undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to the following, which relate to the current COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic may continue for a longer period or its effect on commercial and military passenger flying may be more substantial than we currently expect. It may also disrupt our workforce and staffing capability, our ability to access airports and maintenance facilities and the continuing ability of our vendors and third-party service providers to maintain customary service levels. Other factors could also cause our actual results to differ materially from those we describe here, including unplanned changes in the market demand for our assets and services; our operating airline's ability to maintain on-time service and control costs; the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration; fluctuations in ATSG's traded share price and in interest rates, which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments; the number, timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers; our ability to remain in compliance with key agreements with customers, lenders and government agencies. The impact of current supply chain constraints, both within and outside the U.S., which may be more severe or persists longer than we currently expect, changes in general economic and/or industry-specific conditions; and other factors as contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-Q we will file next week. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial position and results. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials. We advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Rich Corrado, our President and CEO, for his opening comments.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that ATSG had a great first quarter, with strong growth across both our business segments and more customers ready to lease all the cargo aircraft that we can deliver. Our airlines led the way as our revenues grew 29%. Omni Air, our passenger airline delivered the biggest percentage gain in flying time as measured by block hours, as operations return to pre-pandemic pace. A record 15 freighter lease deliveries in 2021 drove a 63% increase in that business, and we have already leased 2 of 11 more this year. Taken together, I'm pleased to say that these results have set us on a course to meet or exceed both our $640 million adjusted EBITDA and our $2 target for adjusted earnings per share in 2022. The free cash flow we are generating will fuel more aircraft investing in 2022, especially in the second half to serve our customers' cargo aircraft needs over the coming years. But we also look forward to the time later this year when our Board of Directors will have the opportunity to explore more options to maximize shareholder returns. Quint is ready to review the details of our outstanding progress to date. I'll be back to share more about our even brighter long-term outlook after that. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Rich, and welcome to everyone on the call this morning. The next slide in our deck hit some of the first quarter operating highlights that Rich was referring to. Our consolidated revenues for the first quarter grew $110 million to $486 million. As Rich noted, both of our principal businesses were strong contributors with revenue growth of 34% in our Airline segment and 28% for our leasing business, CAM. Our adjusted pretax earnings more than tripled to over $60 million, and our adjusted EPS nearly did the same. Adjusted EBITDA rose 49% to $158 million. Those strong segment revenue contributions also yielded higher segment earnings. CAM's pretax earnings increased 63%. As we have mentioned before, two of our airlines received brand awards from the federal government in 2020 and 2021 to maintain jobs as the pandemic reduced passenger volumes. That assistance added $28 million to our ACMI Services earnings in the first quarter last year. Without any such assistance this year, our first quarter ACMI Services earnings were still up 4% year-over-year. On the next slide, you can see that our $52 million growth in first quarter adjusted EBITDA raised our trailing 12 month pace to $593 million, which, as Rich noted, has us on a very good pace towards the $640 million target we announced in February. Assuming the scheduled pace of 767 lease deployments, along with steady improvement in our passenger flying, we're confident we can achieve 11% growth in adjusted EBITDA over the last 9 months of 2022 compared to the last 9 months of 2021. On the next slide, you'll see that our capital spending for the first quarter is ramping slowly, reflecting ongoing logistics and other challenges facing providers, passenger-to-freighter conversion services throughout the world. Our first quarter CapEx was $108 million, down from $125 million in the first quarter last year. With 13 aircraft in line for conversion at the end of 2021 and commitments to deliver only 11 this year, we have back loaded the majority of our 2022 airframe purchases, while remaining ready to buy when we find aircraft that meet our needs. As you can see, we're continuing to separate what we call sustaining CapEx, mainly for airframe and engine maintenance, technology and other equipment from the spending we allocate to fleet expansion. Sustaining CapEx was $36 million in the first quarter and growth CapEx was $72 million, both below our projected spending pace of $200 million sustaining and $390 million growth CapEx for 2022. As Rich will note shortly, we expect conversion services firms to increase their pace as the year progresses, although pandemic constraints remain in China and other sources of important conversion components. The next slide updates you on our adjusted free cash flow, the metric we began providing in our third quarter report last year, represented by the bottom portion of each bar, it's our operating cash flow, net of our sustaining CapEx shown on the top. Keep in mind that those trailing 12-month totals for GAAP operating cash flow shown above the bars do include $83 million in cash we received in federal pandemic relief grants in the first half of last year. For the first quarter, our adjusted free cash flow was $89 million, up $10 million from a year ago and raising our 12 months total to $406 million. As I mentioned a moment ago, this year's growth CapEx plan remains at $390 million. The next slide, vividly illustrates what we regard as the key to our value proposition. Our business model generates significant recurring cash flow, while at the same time, the strong demand for our freighter aircraft provides us with very profitable ways to reinvest that strong cash flow. Our overall debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, as measured under our bank credit agreements remains below two times and is trending lower. The debt restructuring we completed early last year means we have more than enough capacity to fund a more aggressive investment program. But in the meantime, we can use cash to reduce debt and examine other capital deployment options as they become available, such as returning cash to shareholders. On our February call, we discussed our new engine services for lessees of our 767-200 aircraft. It offers them access to a pool of engines that we maintain under new pay by cycle arrangements. We said that we expect this service offering to add $40 million to $45 million to our year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and add to our earnings this year, but it will also raise our sustaining capital expenditures, commensurate with our cost to maintain as many engines as our customers choose to put in the pool. At this point, we're on track with our projections as most of those who lease 767-200s from us have agreed to participate. I also wanted to call your attention once again to the adoption of new accounting rules pertaining to our convertible debt. The change raised our 2022 adjusted diluted share count by 8 million shares. As you can see in the adjusted earnings reconciliation table in our earnings release, we have revised our first quarter 2021 adjusted diluted share count to provide a like shares comparison with 2022. With that summary of our financial and operating results, I'll turn it back to Rich for some comments on our operations and outlook. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint. Before I begin sharing how our 2021 achievements are driving our 2022 performance on the next slide, I want to acknowledge our employees as the fundamental source of all the great financial results that we deliver and the basis of our forecast of even better results to come. Our people are out in the tarmac servicing aircraft in the cold, wind-driven snow and rain and following steps that keep them safe and healthy, but often make their tests a bit harder. But the people of ATSG are also smart and resourceful, and I'm grateful every day to join them in the overall mission of making our company a better, more diverse place to work and a better community citizen. I also credit them for the many 2021 operating accomplishments that we talked about on our call in February. Today, I'm pleased to report that those accomplishments are already delivering benefits in 2022. One of those 2021 items was the completion of our most recent freighter order for Amazon. We leased them 11 767s for a total of 42 lease 767s overall. Our flight crews operate all of them in the Amazon Air Network that we launched for them more than 6 years ago. But that's not all. Our pilots now fly 5 767s that Amazon owns itself or leases from others and more such owner assigned aircraft are joining our fleet this year. Starting with just two such customer signed 767s in March of 2021, we now fly a total of 7, including one Amazon added in the first quarter. By the end of 2022, we expect to have 13 including more from DHL on top of the three we are converting and leasing to them this year. The fact that those customers are choosing our cargo airlines to fly their aircraft is a great testament to the service we provide and the value we offer. It also signals their confidence in our ongoing ability to attract pilots and other operating personnel, train them well and support them as they achieve some of the best on-time performance metrics in the business. This year, our deployed aircraft footprint will shift dramatically. All but two of the nine 767-300s will lease will be operated in Asia, Europe and Canada. Two of them have already been delivered. These customers are responding to demand throughout the world for dedicated midsized freighters, which play the same role in meeting e-commerce demand for rapid delivery of goods elsewhere as they do in the U.S. Mike Berger has worked hard to promote the advantages of choosing CAM, the world's largest source of leased midsized freighters to airlines throughout the world. Those efforts are paying off big time this year, both in new leases of 767-300s as well as re-leases of returning 767-200s. Another 2021 accomplishment was the FAA's certification of our joint ventures design for converting Airbus A321-200 passenger aircraft into freighters. In the first quarter this year, CAM purchased 2 A321 feedstock aircraft for conversion at PEMCO's facilities in Tampa in addition to the one at Bog  last year. CAM will begin leasing those A321 freighters later this year, while purchasing 6 more feedstock airframes to meet demand from customers eager to lease them. The first CAM A321 deliveries will go to ASL Aviation Holdings in the second half of 2022 with a third ordered in 2023. ASL, a major operator of Cargo Lift with integrated global networks is an important new CAM customer and also plans to lease 2 A330s from CAM to be delivered in 2024. Speaking of A330s, last year, we committed to 29 conversion slots for this new aircraft type, which extends our midsized pre-leasing strategy with a platform that is somewhat larger than our Boeing 767-300s. We also began searching for feedstock aircraft to fill slots when they open next year and now hold options to buy several of them. To date, we have orders from customers for 20 of the 29 A330s we expect to convert and deliver by the end of 2027, and customer interest in the remaining 9 is significant. Together with the 767 and A321, CAM now holds rights to more than 80 passenger freighter conversions for induction through 2026. With 30 lease orders from customers covering all of our planned deliveries through next year, we already hold orders for more than 50 of those 80-plus freighters in our pipeline. To my knowledge, no other potential lessor in the midsized converted freighter market has or could easily acquire anything close to the number of aircraft in our 5-year lease and delivery schedule. Finally, we made a commitment last year to report our progress against ESG metrics. This will make us a better company, and we also understand the information is valuable for your investment decisions. Our progress is summarized in the new sustainability report that we issued in February and is available on our website. We have already received recognition as a quality employer and have reached better-than-expected fuel savings from investments in real-time flight management technology. As our progress continues, we will track our results in subsequent additions of this report. As the next slide shows, I'm confident about our outlook in 2022, but I'm also looking forward to the next 5 years. On the investments we are making today, we will be driving our earnings and adjusted free cash flow even higher. We believe that expansions of military logistics networks and theaters around the world will spur demand for our combi and passenger aircraft even higher. We are relatively well protected from economic risk. Our customers are responsible for their fuel cost, and we do not sell cargo space or promote charter services that could be vulnerable in a recession. We would not be well positioned today, of course, if we hadn't looked ahead and saw the greater opportunity in our own midsized freighter niche than in other benches we might have pursued. Our stock price suggests the market is beginning to acknowledge that we're on the right track. We execute the unique strategy well, and we deliver great service through exceptional people. I assure you that we will keep performing at levels that merit your continued confidence. That concludes our prepared remarks. Quint and I, along with Mike Berger, our Chief Commercial Officer, are ready to answer questions. May we have the first question, operator?\nOperator: Thank you.  And our first question line comes from Mr. Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So Quint or Rich, you know, with 1Q, your base of customers, healthy order book, I would have thought that perhaps the EBITDA guide for this year would have been raised. Is there just some conservatism here given the volatility with fuel, geopolitical risk and interest rates? And then also, any supply chain issues and kind of general labor tightness impacting the workflow at the conversion shops and/or perhaps interest levels from shippers and airlines to take on additional capacity or perhaps replace any existing capacity? Thanks.\nQuint Turner: Yeah, Chris, this is Quinn. I'll take a shot at the first part and kick it to Rich here for the last part of your question. Yeah, I mean it's certainly a good observation. The first quarter certainly came in very strong, and we're very encouraged by it. It's early. And I would say that we have taken sort of a conservative approach to guidance. We last talked to the market in February. But we certainly made the point and it's worth reiterating that the pace we're on certainly positions us to improve upon that guidance. We want to being the conservative how we are, we want to give ourselves a little more time and see things unfold. But we really like the trajectory that our business is on, and we look forward to hopefully updating that guidance when we next speak, but it's a very good start. Rich, I'll kick it to you for the...\nRich Corrado: Yeah. In regard, Chris, to your question about the economic impacts of inflation and labor and those types of things on the business. A couple of things. One is our logistics operations and our MRO have seen some pressure on the labor side. But really, we made adjustments towards the end of 2021 that are starting to improve the actual employee sourcing piece of that. And so we're looking for improved operations out of those groups. And so we're controlling it. Now on the conversion side, II  our main converter of 767s in Israel had a lot of supply chain disruptions again in the fourth quarter of 2021 and has been improving to date in 2022. But look, we have in our guidance right now, 9 767 deliveries, if you recall, we delivered more than that last year. So it had an impact, but that impact is already weighed into what we're doing. And they're improving. And so our guidance for 2023 in terms of the amount of aircraft that we're going to be delivering is solid. On the pilot side, because there's a lot of talk about sourcing pilots and attrition of pilots, we are very much in control of that situation. The great thing about all three of our airlines is they're growing. And so they're very appealing to prospective pilots coming out of the regional ranks and other places to grow. So we're in good shape as it relates to having enough pilots to fly all the routes and all the growth that we're going to see this year. So we're in good shape. So long story short, yes, there are impacts out there, but we're managing with it. We've got a great opportunity on the growth side as it relates to flying. And that's one of the things that's helping us attract and retain the folks that are doing a great job for us right now.\nMike Berger: Chris, the other thing I would just add in, its Mike Berger, is that in 2021, we went out and secured for the first time 4 Boeing slots to ensure that we had enough capability and diversity within that. We announced 4 additional Boeing slots recently with 4 options as well if we choose. And we're already seeing the benefit of that with customers who are specifically looking to have some conversions done with Boeing just to ensure that their capacity requirements are met. So we have taken steps to ensure that we meet our customer commitments, not only in '22, but '23 and '24, et cetera.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you. And Rich, I appreciate the color on the value proposition, if you will, for flying for ATSG. That was actually one of my questions. I think you have two CBAs open here, one with Alpha, one with IBT currently, yes.\nRich Corrado: Correct.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. So right now, most of the large U.S. airlines have pilot deals open. Robin at the CEO at JetBlue said he thinks that pay is going to gradually start to converge here. So are you concerned here that there could be a new floor for pilot pay going forward across the board. Certainly, I have my view on the mainline U.S. carriers, but curious your thoughts on the cargo and lesser side? Thank you.\nRich Corrado: Yeah. Well, no, thanks for the question, Chris. Recall, we just completed - we're about a year into the ABX Air CBA that was just negotiated effective in January of 2021. And that's a 6-year agreement and there's - as far as the CBA goes. As far as the Omni and the ATI agreements go, we're working through those agreements in terms of work rules and all the other things that we work through compensation is one of the - obviously, one of the things that you do once you've got a good understanding of what the overall contract profile looks like. We look at it in perspective of the value that we deliver to our customers, the pricing that we have with our customers and what's adaptable. And so from that perspective, we think we'll be able to negotiate as we do with AVX, a competitive agreement that allows us to do two critical things. One is attract and retain the most professional pilots that we can. And the second is to be able to competitively price our business so that we continue to grow all three airlines. And we're pretty confident we'll be able to do that within the balance of both the labor agreements and the customer agreements that we have.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. If I could just get in one more, and then I'll hand it off. Amazon said during our call last week, I think it was that the - there might be some redundancy in their network and that they're looking to save on transportation costs where they could. I think that might be on the last mile. So not sure how much that would affect the dedicated air fleet or airlift. But just if you could remind us of how the TSA with Amazon works, specifically volume commitments and what the termination clauses are? And then also, what's left with your order book? And how many aircraft do you expect to be operating for them by the end of this year and 2023? Thanks.\nRich Corrado: Yes. So at the end of 2022, we were operating 46 airplanes for Amazon, all 767s. And we - 42 of those released from CAM and the others were provided by Amazon. This year, we expect to - we've been notified that we're going to get three additional growth assets from Amazon. So we'll be up to 49 aircraft. As it relates to the contract and the flying that we do, it's kind of complex because it's a network. And so the aircraft they're put into a schedule and fly in this compensation associated to both fixed and variable cycles and hours and et cetera, et cetera. It's kind of complex along those lines. The termination clauses are really - there's the ATSA and then there's each individual lease for each new airplane, generally, they're not going to terminate any of the individual airplanes. But on the ATSA side, it's, Quint, I'm not sure exactly - of the parameters on that.\nQuint Turner: One of the things that I heard on the - because I listened to some of the Amazon call as well as they were asked about transportation, shipping costs, and I thought it was interesting, I think it was a CFO, basically said that the shipping rates they have are very competitive within their own network, and they're seeing savings versus what they would get using external carriers, external providers of the network. And I think they also pointed out that the last 2 years, of course, with the pandemic growth, along with the growth in e-commerce, it would have been impossible really for them to have handled all that growth or at least very difficult, had they not had their own internal network. And so as Rich points out, I mean, with the lease commitments being separate, I don't think we spend a lot of time worrying about cancellation of their network internal network, which they're saying is a more efficient one than they could get from external providers...\nRich Corrado: And don't recall that the reason Amazon got into this network back with us in 2015 was they had been disappointed due to the peak operation they were receiving from the integrators. At least that's the way the people at the time had explained it to us. That peak environment still exists today and will exist. So the assets that they fly today, whether they're flying them to Boise billings, Butte or Buffalo, they're going to continue to need to fly them there. And then when peaks, they're even going to need more lift or more capacity. And they still use integrators in addition to the captive Amazon network. And so there's that opportunity as well. This remains a cost-effective solution for them. And so going forward, as I said, we've got three growth assets this year, and we're looking forward to growing the business to more.\nQuint Turner: And of course, last year, we grew, what, 13 airport enter the network. And so I'm sure that as you would expect, they would look to wring out efficiencies in the network design because there was that rapid growth just as we look to get cost efficiencies from our cargo airlines that operate in those networks. And you saw the performance of the airline segment in the first quarter. So with a little bit slower growth this year compared to last year, I think there are opportunities to really improve cost efficiency and improve our ACMI Services bottom line, and we saw that in the first quarter.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. So there's nothing that you're currently seeing with respect to - I know you don't report this, but in terms of utilization with that fleet that would give you concern as perhaps Amazon looks to recalibrate, if you will, into what is, I guess, this kind of hyper inflationary environment?\nQuint Turner: Well, schedule changes are routine in the network environment. So there will always be schedule changes. But I think as we said in the earnings release, we saw a 19% increase year-over-year in terms of the utilization of our cargo aircraft in block hours. And of course, on the passenger side, it was even sharper with a 32% increase in passenger and combi flights. So not, as I say, not a lot that we're concerned with in that regard.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in line comes from Mr. Frank Galanti from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nFrank Galanti: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, the biggest question I get from investors on ATSG is sort of how robust current air freight demand is. And really, it's around how ATSG would perform should the market roll over, right? There's concerns over our sort of peak cycle here. But obviously, it's super encouraging at 50 out of the 80 conversion slots already signed up, right, through 2023. I know its A330s. But can you sort of talk about any current exposure to variability in cash flows? Sort of in that question, what level of the CMI customers are flying above current minimum floors? And is there any exposure to the charter market, sorry. And I guess sort of another aspect of that question is how many CMI contracts come up for renewal a year and sort of how are those discussions going lately and sort of on the older assets as opposed to the newer stuff?\nRich Corrado: Yeah. Thanks for the question. There's a lot there. Keep in mind, I mean, if you look at ATSG, the bulk of our EBITDA comes from three places. It comes from the long-term dry leases that we have. That's the majority of it are more than 50%. It comes from the long-term CMI agreements we have with Amazon and DHL. The DHL has just signed a 6-year agreement and we're well into another 6-year agreement with Amazon. And then the flying that Omni does for the Department of Defense and the government. Those three business segments are extremely resilient and to business cycle disruption and global trade disruption and those types of things. If you look at the leases, there's 7 to 10-year leases in general and whether the utilization on the airplane is up or down, they still have to pay the lease on those, and that's again, the majority of our EBITDA. When you look at the large CMI flying that we do, again, this is CMI flying because they're leasing the airplane separately from CAM, and then they have an agreement. We have an agreement to fly those airplanes separately. Again, those are network flying assets. And those customers, Amazon and DHL have to service their market every day, whether those planes are full or not. They have overnight commitments. They have time-definite commitments, and they have to service that so that they can't not service geographies as it relates to their customers' commitments that they make. And then lastly, on Omni, they're going to fly on what is either the Department of Defense Department of State needs, which don't flow generally with the commercial business cycle and global trade. They're going to fly military exercises, they're going to fly operations, they're going to fly expeditionary troop rotations, things that flying opportunities for us that are routine operational readiness fastest of the military. So when you look at that bulk of that's probably 90% to 95% of our EBITDA is in those three segments, and it's rock-solid resilient, especially in this time of inflation and other disruptions that you see around the globe.\nQuint Turner: Yeah. The - and Frank, one of the things that we talk about, this is Quint in the release, of course, and Mike will elaborate on some. But is this on top of those, that revenue visibility, those multiyear streams that Rich just described. On the growth side, the order book is extremely strong with I think between this year and next year, 30 new lease deployments. And as Rich said, that makes up, call it, two thirds or more of the total EBITDA, 30 more aircraft lease deployments by the end of '23, including 19 more next year. Now if you think about the 19 aircraft that we described that we have orders for 2023 deliveries, it's 1476 and 5 Airbus 321. The annualized EBITDA contribution just from those 19 aircraft, is easily somewhere around the mid-60s, call it, $65 million, which is more than 10% of our EBITDA guide this year, which was up 18% over what we actually did last year. Now that doesn't consider the Airbus 330, which come into play in '24 and beyond where we already have 29 conversion slots, we have customers that have stepped up wanting those airplanes. So I mean you've got really, we're very fortunate and particularly in an economic environment where a lot of investors are probably looking for some defensive protection because that's afforded by these revenue streams Rich just described. But beyond that, we have a lot of growth to look forward to and these are being deployed around the world. I'll let Mike elaborate on that.\nMike Berger: Yeah. I think that's the key. When you look at where our growth is coming from, we've really diversified that, and that's been a strategic direction that we've had it. So we got into the Airbus products. They are certainly an aircraft type that's been flying extremely well across Europe, Asia, Southeast Asia, et cetera. And when you look at where we're placing our new customer dry leases, you see that across the A321s and the future of the A330 deliveries across those geographic parts of the world. The engine for our industry has been e-commerce growth for several years, and people are now starting to think about the growth moderating, not going away, but moderating some and when we look at it from a statistical standpoint, we - there's still - the forecast all strongly suggest that incremental e-commerce growth over the next several years stays in the low teens and not until we get to 2025, does the growth rates just go slightly below 10% growth on a year-over-year basis. Maybe a little bit drilling down a little bit further when you look at the actual dollars from a retail standpoint, total dollars spent at the end of '21 was just under $5 trillion. And when you look out to 2025, it's about $7, $7.5 trillion. So while the actual growth levels have slowed down into low teens, excuse me, the dollar amounts really continue to grow in the 50% range over those - during that period. All through that, the overall percent of retail sales out to 2025 is still under 25%, about 23.5% of total retail sales will be e-commerce sales. So there's a long, long, strong path there in terms of our growth. Quint and Rich spoke about it. Our order book for 2022 has been filled for a long period of time, '23 is booked solid and ll24 looks fabulous. So we're poised to capture and capitalize on it. And the engine around it is still really, really going very well.\nFrank Galanti: Great. That's super helpful. I appreciate all the color. I guess switching gears a little bit. In the prepared remarks, you had alluded to returning capital to shareholders. Can you just talk through those dynamics given kind of substantial growth CapEx that ATSG is committed to? How much do you forecast having been able to return to shareholders? And can you remind us when the limitations on share buybacks and...\nQuint Turner: Sure, Frank. This is Quint. The CARES Act or the payroll support plan restrictions, I believe, expire in late September into September. And so call it, fourth quarter. In terms of the amount of capital or getting specific about that or what we would do, we don't want to be that specific at this point, certainly, but we can talk about the flexibility that the cash flows our business generates afford us to have a diversified capital allocation strategy. And you can see on the slides that we covered, our debt continues to decline even though as you point out, we have a robust growth plan and a robust CapEx plan to support these attractive opportunities we have in the place the aircraft Mike just described. But it will not constrain us from considering other ways to create value with our shareholders, including returning capital. And of course, what we have done historically is share repurchase. We had to, of course, put that on the sidelines due to the Cares restrictions. But that opportunity will be fully available to us, and we are not particularly constrained from a capital standpoint. With those decisions, and you always, of course, take into account not only your other opportunities for capital, but also, of course, where your stock sits and where it's trading, value-wise and how - what you believe the returns are that are available. But we certainly expect, and I think we've said this in past quarters, we believe our shares are not valued based upon where they should be. And so I would fully expect that when the restrictions are removed, we will look to utilize share repurchase as a way of creating value for the shareholders. We'll just have to see when we get closer to that date, where all those metrics are, and that will determine kind of relative size and how aggressive and over what time frame, et cetera, that we would implement that strategy, but there isn't any financial constraint that is significant to implementing it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question on line comes from Adam Ritzer \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call, Haven't been on the call for a while, but I listened to everyone, and I have to say you guys are doing a fantastic job.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Adam.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just getting back to the last question, I was going to ask that, but I put it in another way, how much leverage would you guys get to in terms of a buyback?\nRich Corrado: Well, you're kind of asking the same question, Adam. We want to understand where you're going, right. But to your point, I mean, our current leverage is around two times right or just a little \u2013 so you know, the company is leverage profile is more than comfortable certainly. And we have - with the visibility we have on our cash flows and revenue streams, and even in the past, as you know, we've levered over three times depending on the opportunity. So as our EBITDA continues to grow, one turn of leverage is getting to be a bigger and bigger number, right? So there's plenty of capacity to do a buyback, and that was kind of where we were headed with my last response there to Frank's question. So again, access capital not the constraint.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right. Even if you do $700 million next year, that $1.4 billion of debt you could carry. That's an additional $150 million of a buyback roughly. So you're going to have to go much above two times to do a decent sized buyback and keep doing it. Okay, I get it. My other question, just could you refresh my memory on the EBITDA returns on the capital spending. If you spend $300 million a year on new aircraft, are you still in the 10% to 12% EBITDA type returns even with the new aircraft you're converting?\nRich Corrado: That's roughly the range. And as you know, our model is to tack on some additional non-asset-intensive value-added services, whether it's the CMI or the maintenance piece. And so yeah, the returns we're getting are in the - certainly in the teens.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right. And now you have the pilot piece. That's not a new thing you guys have decided to go into. So that's additive as well.\nRich Corrado: Sure.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's it. I really appreciate you taking my call and continue to keep up the good work. Thanks a lot.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Adam.\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question on line comes from Mr. Jack Atkins from Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Okay, great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Sorry, I was late jumping in the queue. So I guess maybe just kind of going back to the capital allocation question for a minute and then I want to jump into other parts of the business. But if we think about the - cash flows from operations, right? I mean, you guys are seeing very strong performance there and you have for quite some time. When you think about your growth profile here in these 80 conversion slots, would you say the business itself should continue to be self-funding in terms of its growth over the course of the next few years as you execute on that?\nQuint Turner: Yeah, Jack, generally speaking, yes, we're going to have - next year will be a big year in terms of - we talked about nearly 20 lease deployments. And so associated with that, you'll have some increase in CapEx, right? But over - if you look at it over a multiyear period, yes, the business is funding its growth.\nJack Atkins: Okay. That makes sense. And I guess, theoretically, just from your perspective, given how stable the model is, and this goes back to the earlier comments around the stability of your customer demand and the way the contracts are structured, how do we see other leasing models that perhaps operate with a higher level of leverage with stable cash flows, I guess, why is two turns the right number? Why not maybe 3 or 3.5 turns of leverage, just given how unique your model is?\nQuint Turner: I think it's a great question, Jack. And I don't think we're at two turns necessarily by design, right? It's been a function of the cash flows the business has produced the fact that we have been hampered somewhat in our options for capital deployment, as we discussed a minute ago. It's not to say that it's - it doesn't allow us to move leverage higher and be quite comfortable with all the factors you described, the visibility, the long-term contracts, et cetera. Now we've always - in the past, we've been will, as you know, to operate I think we were roughly 3.5 times when we've done a couple of acquisitions in the past, and you saw the bottle quickly begin to delever again because of the cash flow production. So it's a powerful in terms of the cash flow it generates. And I think that you're correct that the leverage can easily move higher and the business perform, continue to perform extremely well.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Now that makes sense. I mean it's an exciting time for you guys because we've been laying a lot of these foundation stones now for years and beginning to really see it spool up in the earnings profile, the cash flows. And so I'm glad to see the market finally getting the picture here over the last few months. I guess maybe shifting gears a bit, A lot of discussion around sort of the core leasing business, but would love to get your take on Omni and military flying, sort of do you feel like that's sort of back to normal. And I guess given all the rising geopolitical sort of pressures out there, should we be expecting that Omni business to perhaps be seeing additional momentum here over the next few quarters?\nRich Corrado: Thanks for the question, Jack. Yeah, so Omnis, we're projecting for the year that Omni will be at or a little higher than their 2019 DoD business. Keep in mind, they also fly for government other government agencies like the Department of State. A lot of the military exercises that they do and the expeditionary repositioning of troops models or kind of back into what we had seen in the past. And so they - we saw a very strong first quarter. Remember, the first quarter of 2021 was probably the - as far as the DoD goes was the low point for Omni during the pandemic. And so they're back in the swing of things. And like I said, we're projecting them to be a little bit better than they were in 2019. As far as the geopolitical pieces of it, most of the flying Omni historically has done is not conflict related. They have run some humanitarian missions as has ATI, some humanitarian admissions related to Europe. But we're not, at this point, projecting that any of the instability in the political system is going to do anything more than the Omni is doing today. But we anticipate that the rest of the year will be a good year for Omni as well.\nJack Atkins: Okay. And...\nQuint Turner: Just to add that the commercial business on the Omni side also has come back quite nicely. It was obviously during the core of the pandemic, the non-military business, I put it that way, was impacted like others. But recently, we've seen a large increase in flying on the block hour side on the commercial side, and that pipeline in regards to supporting other flying for other airlines - around the world as that expansion comes back as well as colleges, universities, bowl games, et cetera, has bounced back quite nicely as well. It's a smaller portion, as you know, of the overall Omni military business, but it's great to see that component of the Omni business also responded back nicely.\nJack Atkins: Well, I wish my Albert Tigers  were going to go to a bull game issue, but I think that's unlikely. So...\nQuint Turner: We've got a great rate for...\nJack Atkins: Okay. Last thing, I guess, Quint, can you maybe help us think a little bit about the cadence of, I guess, let's just stick with EBITDA as we sort of move through the year. I mean - I guess, theoretically, what you earned in the first quarter is about a quarter of what you're expecting for the full year. But typically, there is some seasonality and you implied that perhaps there's conservatism to the guidance. I mean is there anything to kind of think about sequentially from an earnings cadence perspective that we should be kind of keeping in mind as we're maybe modeling this out?\nQuint Turner: Yeah, Jack, I think we said in February that this year, it was a little less in terms of the variation between, call it, first half and second half, a little less than what we've seen in some past years. So it's actually - while we expect certainly sequential improvement as we add leases, it's actually not real volatile from quarter-to-quarter is what we're modeling and what we expect. I mean certainly, some of the assumptions that will ultimately impact our performance, and we reiterated some of those in our earnings release. For example, we expect to continue to see improved passenger operations and Combi operations in particular. We've had a route or two impacted by an international route for the Combi's that's been impacted with the pandemic restrictions for the DoD. I think we had a location that was undergoing runway construction and so forth and things like that, that in the second half will help. But it's also just the timing of CAMs lease deployments, which will help drive sequential improvement. So I don't know that there's like this huge disparity between among the quarters that remain this year. It's just sort of a gradual...\nJack Atkins: But just to be clear, I mean, going back to what you're saying earlier, I mean, you do feel like that you've baked in conservatism to the guidance and that sort of as we move through the year, assuming that the bottom doesn't fall out just in terms of the macro, that there's an opportunity to maybe work both those outlooks higher?\nQuint Turner: I think so, Jack. I mean certainly, we considered doing it. It just seems - we've just spoken to the market in February, and we are - we do tend to be a little conservative. And there are some things we want to see happen, which Rich described. But we feel confident and very positive about this, how we got out of the gate here in the first quarter. And so hopefully, we'll be able to update our guidance when we next talk to you guys.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Well, that's great. I'll hand it back to you. But congratulations on a great quarter and its exciting about what's in front of you. Thanks, again.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Jack.\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Jack.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Rich Corrado for closing remarks.\nRich Corrado: Thank you all for joining us on the call today. The aircraft leasing and airline business are facing challenges, but our business model has kept us fairly immune to those peaks and valleys. Most of our EBITDA comes from aircraft leases are flying for the DoD and other government agencies and long-term CMI contracts, which are growing in network expansion and outsourcing is projected to continue. We hope you stay with us for that will be a great ride ahead. Thank you again for your interest in ATSG.\nOperator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 4, "year": 2021, "date": "2022-02-25 15:40:24", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Q4 2021 Air Transport Services Group, Inc. earnings conference call. My name is Vanessa. And I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. .  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Joe Payne, Chief Legal Officer of ATSG. Mr. Payne, you may begin.\nJoe Payne: Good morning. And welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website, atsginc.com. Let me begin by advising you that during the course of this call, we will make projections and other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we described here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call. Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to the following, which relate to the current COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic may continue for a longer period or its effect on commercial and military passenger flying may be more substantial than we currently expect. It may also disrupt our workforce and staffing capability; our ability to access airports and maintenance facilities; our customers' creditworthiness and the continuing ability of our vendors and third-party service providers to maintain customary service levels. Other factors could also cause our actual results to differ materially from those we describe here, including: unplanned changes in the market demand for our assets and services; our operating airline's ability to maintain on-time service and control costs; the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration; fluctuations in ATSG's traded share price and in interest rates, which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments; the number, timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers; our ability to remain in compliance with key agreements with customers, lenders and government agencies; the impact of current supply chain constraints, both within and outside the U.S., which may be more severe or persist longer than we currently expect; the impact of the current competitive labor market; changes in general economic and or industry-specific conditions; and other factors as contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-K we will file next week. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted cash flow. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials. We advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website.  And now I'll turn the call over to Rich Corrado, our President and CEO, for his opening comments.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. 2021 was a great year for ATSG and not only for the exceptional financial results we delivered, we also laid the groundwork to grow our fleet substantially faster over the next five years than the last five. And we committed to add two new converted freighter types to our leasing portfolio, the Airbus A330 and A321 to support e-commerce customers around the world. We generated $541 million in adjusted EBITDA last year, $6 million more than the target we shared with you last November. Capital spending of $505 million last year was well below our target and funded deliveries of a record 15 leased 767-300 freighters.  Our airlines again achieved double-digit growth in revenue block hours and improved their on-time performance over 2020. This is a testament to the resilience and skill of our workforce during another year of pandemic challenges. There are many other great elements to our story and our outlook for almost $100 million more in adjusted EBITDA for 2022. I'll be back to share more color after Quint reviews our financial results. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Rich, and welcome to everyone on the call this morning. The next slide in our deck summarizes the strong 2021 results that Rich was referring to. Our consolidated revenues for 2021 grew $164 million to $1.7 billion. That's an all-time high for ATSG. Our adjusted EPS increased to $1.66 per share, up from $1.60 in 2020. Adjusted pretax earnings increased 11% and adjusted EBITDA rose 9%. Our aircraft leasing company, CAM, and the three airlines that comprise our ACMI Services segment each delivered great results. CAM's pretax earnings increased 37% for the year and pretax earnings for our ACMI Services segment grew by 39%. On the next slide, you can see that on a rolling 12-month basis, our adjusted EBITDA continues to accelerate, aided by a 27% gain in the fourth quarter. That improvement reflects both a faster pace of 767 lease deployments during the year, along with steady improvement in our passenger flying for both the military and commercial customers.  Again, our adjusted EBITDA excludes, among other items, the changes in values of our financial instruments and the benefits of federal pandemic relief assistance for our passenger operations under the payroll support program for all periods shown. Our airlines realized $112 million in federal grant proceeds during 2021 versus $47 million in 2020. On the next slide, you'll see that our capital spending for the fourth quarter slowed somewhat to finish the year at $505 million. As you can see, we're continuing to separate what we call sustaining CapEx mainly for airframe and engine maintenance, technology and other equipment from the spending we allocate to fleet expansion. Sustaining CapEx was $183 million for the year and growth CapEx was $322 million. Both were lower than our prior projections. Our growth spending was down due in large part to supply chain disruptions and pandemic challenges at our conversion vendor. We deployed four 767 freighters in the fourth quarter for a total of 15 for the year. Freighter conversion businesses are running at peak capacity now as the pandemic has both accelerated e-commerce-driven volumes and reduced cargo space on commercial passenger flights. To meet this demand, 12 of our feedstock 767s and one A321 were awaiting or undergoing conversion at the end of last year. The next slide is an update on our new financial metric, adjusted free cash flow. Represented by the bottom portion of each bar is our operating cash flow, net of the sustaining CapEx shown on the top portion. Our GAAP operating cash flow also includes cash our passenger airlines received in federal pandemic relief grants. Our strong adjusted free cash flow of $400 million last year illustrates a key point about the power of our business model. It can generate more than enough cash flow to cover our growth.  As we acquire, convert and lease more freighter aircraft, we are well positioned to fund that rapid growth internally. That will further reduce our debt leverage and make capital available for other uses. The next slide illustrates our continuing progress toward growing our fleet from internally generated funds. Our overall debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, as measured under our bank credit agreements is now below 2 times. As short-term rates increase in 2022, the debt restructuring we completed early last year to replace variable rate with fixed rate debt will help to mitigate some of the effect of higher rates. We continue to project double-digit earnings growth from CAM's aircraft portfolio, most of which are under seven to 10-year leases. You may have noted the comments in our earnings release about the expiration last fall of CAM's power-by-cycle arrangement with Delta for maintenance of engines on the 767-200 aircraft we offer to lessees.  We decided to offer those lessees a new service that provides them access to a pool of engines that we are responsible for maintaining under new pay-by-cycle arrangements. CAM will play a more active role in making sure engines are available to its customers under a structure that is more efficient for lessees and improves CAM's margin opportunity. Maintenance costs for engines provided to the pool will be classified as sustaining capital expenditures and appreciated as the engines are operated. As a result, our sustaining capital outlays for engine maintenance will increase along with our adjusted EBITDA. For 2022, we expect the contribution to our year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA will be between $40 million and $45 million from this service offering and contribute positively to our adjusted EPS. Most of the nearly $100 million increase in adjusted EBITDA we are forecasting for 2022 will impact our bottom line. Strong growth in earnings from our airline businesses, in particular, along with the momentum of our leasing returns from CAM will yield approximately $2 in adjusted EPS for 2022, a 20% increase over last year.  This projection includes the adoption of new accounting rules pertaining to our convertible debt. The change effective this year, raises our 2022 adjusted diluted share count by 8 million shares and will reduce our pretax interest expense by approximately $8 million. With that summary of our financial and operating results, I'll turn it back to Rich for some comments on our operations and outlook. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint. Our earnings release lists a number of key 2021 operating accomplishments in what was a very good year for ATSG overall. Let me highlight and provide some additional color on a few of them now.  Our record 15 external leases and deployments of Boeing 767-300 freighters plus three re-leases of 767-200s was a true success story. You may recall that 11 of them were leased to Amazon, along with CMI assignments for our airlines to fly them. Those 11 deliveries completed an order of 12 767s that Amazon placed with CAM in June of 2020.  We now fly 46 767s for Amazon. That includes 4 they own or lease from others and prefer to place with our ATI Airline to fly. Later this year, Amazon may assign us to fly more of its freighters. We continue to be very proud to be the largest provider of leased cargo aircraft and flight services to Amazon. Earlier last year, the FAA certified our joint venture's design for passenger to freighter conversions of Airbus A321-200 aircraft. We followed that with the conversion and delivery of the first A321 freighter based on our design. CAM will convert and add two A321-200s to its leased freighter fleet later this year and at least one more in 2023. In August, we announced the commitment to acquire 20 conversion slots for Airbus A330-300s, a new aircraft type slightly larger than our Boeing 767-300s. Next year, our A330 conversion vendor will induct our first feedstock aircraft for conversion for delivery in 2024.  Already, we have deposits from customers for 14 of the 20 A330s that we have previously committed to convert. I'm confident by the end of this year, our order book will include customer commitments for all of the first 20 A330s we plan to deploy. In light of that strong customer interest for an aircraft still two years away from delivery, we have boosted our conversion slot commitment by nine to 29 A330s for delivery over the next five years. Those additional A330 conversion slots means that CAM now has slot commitments for more than 70 passenger to freighter conversions, including 35 767-300s, which remain the preferred aircraft for e-commerce-driven air networks. Our order pipeline includes customer commitments for all of the freighters we will deploy this year and more than half of those in our leasing plan for 2023. We already own and have scheduled for conversion all of the nine 767s and two A321s we expect to convert and lease this year. During the second half of 2021 and especially in the fourth quarter, our passenger air operations for the military and commercial customers rebounded significantly from 2020 levels. That included more scheduled air operations for the military, but also Omni Air's significant role in America's rescue of Afghanistan evacuees last summer and a stronger-than-anticipated recovery in commercial charter flying in the fourth quarter. For 2022, we expect Omni's performance to roughly match its 2019 pre-pandemic levels. And finally, our 2021 negotiations with DHL led to a set of agreements this month to extend and expand our 18-year commercial relationship. That included a six-year extension of our CMI operating agreement through April of 2028 and another six years added to leases for five of the 767s we fly for them. DHL was our principal customer when we became a public company in 2003, and our relationship with them continues to grow in line with their commitment to freighter leasing and the ability of ABX Air employees to provide great service within DHL's U.S. network. Those are a few of the operating and commercial successes that helped us generate record financial results this year and will continue to contribute to our results for several years to come. There are also a major reason we were able to set a new adjusted EBITDA target for 2022 of $640 million or about 18% more than we generated in 2021. The target assumes the nine 767 and two A321 lease deployments I mentioned earlier, strong growth in both our cargo and passenger airline earnings, a gradual easing of pandemic restrictions on our workforce and access to certain airports as the year progresses. We also expect capital spending of about $590 million, including $200 million in sustaining and $390 million in growth CapEx. Much of that 2022 CapEx growth budget will be for feedstock purchases and conversion costs for freight as we will deploy next year. In summary, I'm confident that 2022 will launch ATSG on a path to deliver strong continuing cash flows from our superior business model and concentration of the aircraft our growing customers need. That will allow us to self-fund most of the fleet expansion targets and still adopt a more diversified capital allocation strategy when cash return restrictions expire in September. That concludes our prepared remarks. Quint and I, along with Mike Berger, our Chief Commercial Officer, ready to answer questions. May we have the first question, operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  And we have our first question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nCameron Hoglund : Hey, great. Good morning. Congrats on the great quarter, guys. This is Cameron Hoglund on for Jack. Thanks for taking my question. So first one to Quint, would you mind walking us through the accounting changes here on maintenance expense of is recurring, but just wanted to confirm that. And also for the share count from convertible debt, what share count is that guidance assuming? Thank you.\nQuint Turner: Sure, Cameron. I guess in terms of the -- I'll do the last one first, I guess. The share count has to do with the accounting changes required for convertible debt. And the impact on our share count, and of course, that took effect right out of the gate in 2022, will be to add about 8 million shares to the denominator. It's essentially the if-converted method. You're assuming that you satisfy the debt with shares and so forth. And it will remove about approximately an $8 million annual non-cash expense that was going through interest expense also. So you've got those two effects. The net effect is a headwind for EPS because of the increase -- the 8 million share increase in the denominator.  As far as the -- and I think your -- the first part of your question was pertaining to the new engine service that we're putting forward for the 767-200 engines. Is that correct?\nCameron Hoglund : Yes, for capitalizing those expenses.\nQuint Turner: Right. For many, many years, we had those engines under a power-by-cycle arrangement with Delta TechOps. And that contract terminated kind of at the end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter of last year. And under that accounting treatment for power-by-cycle, the way we were essentially passing through to the lessees who wanted to take advantage of that, sort of piggybacking on that agreement and leveraging the scale of engines that we had in that contract. And then we had recognized some margin on that, sort of a markup on that pass-through power-by-cycle. That contract came to an end, and so we made a decision, when we looked at the options, we could have renewed it and extended it. But based upon what we saw an opportunity for if we actively manage those engines and move them to a pool that we can make accessible to lessees. It provides us an ability to better manage that more efficiently for them and also provides margin opportunity for us. And of course, the 767-200 over time, we may take some of those aircraft out of service and cannibalize the engine. So it also allows us the ability to make rational decisions about how we manage the engine modules to get the best life out of the engine. It will also extend the fleet life for the 767-200.  So we made that strategic decision. So we're no longer in a power-by-cycle arrangement. So going forward, we will be responsible to maintain that engine pool and the costs that we incur as engines go through the shop will be capitalized and depreciated. And what we've disclosed in the earnings release is given that now, we'll be depreciating those costs and no longer paying a power-by-cycle fee. It will have an impact on depreciation and our EBITDA because we'll add that back. It also is accretive to our earnings and, as I say, provides more margin opportunity. Although there's a little bit more risk, we'll have more CapEx to maintain those engines. Some of those engines were also installed on our 767-200s flown by our affiliates. And again, the positive part of that is we're no longer paying that cycle charge to Delta as those engines fly.  And so we believe, certainly that over the long pull, that's a cash flow accretive and a margin opportunity for us that we didn't have under the prior arrangement in the short run. And this year, we will have CapEx though because we'll -- like any new venture, sometimes there's an upfront investment. So we'll have a number of shop visits that will occur this year, so our CapEx will go up. And we've shown that as sustaining CapEx in our guidance here. And so it will be reflected in that adjusted free cash flow stat. It will be taken out of operating cash flows.  You could probably argue that, that's somewhat of a growth investment, too, because it is a new business line, but we looked at it more conservatively as sustaining CapEx. So we wanted to tell you because it is a change from -- and it happened late in the year. So year-over-year, it's a number of engines. It had a pretty big impact on EBITDA, given that it happened so late last year. You've got about 60 or so engines that suddenly moved to this other treatment in terms of how we're approaching, making them accessible to lessees.  And so of our growth in EBITDA, it's about $40 million to $45 million. It will depend upon, of course, how many cycles the lessees fly because they will pay CAM on a per cycle basis and so forth. But it's -- it gives them a lot of flexibility. They can draw on the pool. So we're excited about being able to offer that new service.\nMike Berger: Maybe I'll just add that we own the lion's share of these engines that exist out there. And as Quint mentioned, I'll just emphasize, it's a huge advantage for our customers to have this pool of resources as we continue to fly the 767-200, which is just remains to be a great airplane for us.\nCameron Hoglund : Thanks for the color there, guys. Really appreciate that. And if I may ask a quick follow-up. In the guidance you gave, you said the passenger flights would return to a pre-pandemic 2019 like level in the coming year. Where are things today versus that run-rate and what is driving that outlook? Thank you.\nRich Corrado: This is Rich. The DoD portion of Omni's business is pretty much back up to pre-pandemic levels now. There's a few places that they're flying a little bit differently, too. But in terms of the volume of business, that's come back.  As it relates to the commercial, we saw a really good comeback in the fourth quarter related to charters for cruises related to the commercial passenger opportunities, a lot of bold charters for football games, those types of things. So it was very encouraging to see that. They're also getting inquiries for bids for additional ACMI lanes for standard commercial airlines that may have fleet needs that don't line up with what their fleet currently looks like, maybe because of the way that they're managing their assets because of the pandemic.  So given the commercial activity that we're seeing with Omni, we think we're comfortable that they'll have a good year and certainly a growth year over 2021. And we're projecting that they'll have a year that's really similar to 2019.\nCameron Hoglund : All right. Appreciate the color there. I\u2019ll turn it over. Thanks again for the time, and congrats on a great quarter.\nRich Corrado : Thank you. \nQuint Turner : Thanks, Cameron. \nOperator: We have our next question from Frank Galanti with Stifel.\nFrank Galanti : Yeah, great. Thank you for taking questions. I want to start on the conversion slots. In the press release, it indicated that all of the '22 deliveries were, I guess set for customers and most into 2023. I just wanted to get an update on what -- how that's changed in the last couple of months. Have you been seeing progress on extending those deliveries past mid-2023? And then I guess a second part of that is, of those customers who are interested in using leasing aircraft from you guys, can you give a sense for -- from a high level, what type of customers those are from a geographic or end use perspective? Any color there would be helpful.\nMike Berger: Yeah, sure. So our -- the geographic concentration of our deliveries continues to be very broad-based. We will see new customers as well as existing customers from a geographic perspective. Some will be in the U.S. and North America. Other parts will sprawl out to Europe as well as into the Nordics for the first time for us. So we continue to see that expansion from a geographic standpoint, which is one of our initiatives to expand further globally. We've guided the fact that all of our deliveries for '22, nine 767s and two A321s, our book is complete. We have the lion's share of our 2023 order book completed as well, but we do anticipate to still deliver more air converted freighters in 2023.  The A330 will start delivering in 2024. And we see, as Rich mentioned in his comments, very, very strong demand for that. We've mentioned we've got 14 of those initial 20 not only under LOI but with deposits. And we firmly believe, as Rich says, that all 20 of our initial slots will be completed by the end of '23 -- excuse me, by the end of '22, and that's the reason why we went out and secured the additional slots. So we're very bullish on an airplane, and that will take us all the way out through 2026.\nFrank Galanti : Okay, that's really helpful. And then taking a look at CapEx. So you guys guided about $590 million in '22. And it sounds like feedstock has already been purchased for most of those conversions in '22-'23 that we just talked about. I guess just wanted to get a sense for timing and composition of that CapEx. And really with a view towards 2023 and beyond, how much CapEx of that $390 million growth and $200 million sustaining is sort of accounted for with those airplane purchases?  I guess another way of asking it, have those planes been paid for yet or will they be paid for in '22-'23? And then I guess, is that -- how do you think about growth for sustaining CapEx going out into the future past '22?\nQuint Turner: Sure, Frank, this is Quint. In terms of '22's guidance for the growth CapEx, that $390 million, that includes actually buying seven 767-300 feedstock aircraft. Remember, at the end of '21, we had a dozen that were in conversion. So we're putting, what, nine 767s online this year. So you can see that we've already got more than enough already in our possession to fulfill 2022's delivery commitments. We'll be buying airplanes though for '23. So we'll have -- we plan to buy seven more feedstock airplanes.  We also made our first or secured access to our first feedstock for the A330. We have deposit on the first five of the 20 aircraft. Now those aircraft won't be delivered and we won't finish paying for them until 2023, so they'll be part of 2023's CapEx budget. As Mike mentioned, the first conversion inductions on that line are midyear of next year, July next year, yeah. And so those are some of the pieces along with, of course, the ongoing conversion cost of aircraft that are going through the lines to complete their passenger freighter work make up the lion's share of that growth CapEx this year.  As far as sustaining CapEx and what that might look like going forward, you can see it's up a little this year. And of course, we mentioned a minute ago, talked about the investment we'll be making and the maintenance of some of the engines that we'll put in a pool for certain of the lessee access. So that took it up a little. We've been in the sort of the $180 million range last for a while, and that's -- we're saying $200 million in 2022.  I think that there still may be some engine shop visits related to that type that impact the first half of '23. But then it should -- that should fall off and abate. And in our business model, the sustaining CapEx really does not grow absent this engine change, was something that's a little unusual because it has been in place for years. But just leasing additional airplanes and growing CAM's leasing portfolio does not in and of itself, have much impact in growing our sustaining CapEx because the lessee is responsible to maintain the aircraft during the life of the lease.  And so I don't expect sustaining CapEx to really change much once you look out past '23. We'll, of course, add aircraft, at least 330s, 321s and more 767s. But under those contracts, we won't be responsible for the maintenance. The lessee returns it at the end of the lease in a like-for-like maintenance condition.\nFrank Galanti : Okay, that was really helpful. Thanks for the answers. And congrats on a great year.\nQuint Turner : Thanks, Frank. \nMike Berger : Thanks, Frank.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker : Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody. And thank you for the time. Just a couple of questions. On the 14 of the new aircraft that are committed, are any of those new customers that you could talk about?\nMike Berger: Half of them -- Helane, this is Mike, are new customers. We will shortly put out some press releases about who those customers are. I mentioned in a cargo fax late yesterday that where the geographic areas were across Asia, Southeast Asia and into Europe. But there are -- the makeup is about 50-50 right now in regards to new customers and existing customers.\nHelane Becker : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then the other question I have on, since you are not responsible for fuel, is there a lag time on your contracts between when fuel goes up and when you bill?\nQuint Turner: No. It's really small, Helane. This is Quint. The way our contracts are structured, there's not a lot of float that we're at risk for. And as you know, we don't take the actual fuel risk under our arrangements the customer pays for the fuel.\nMike Berger: And our customers pay us the fuel very quickly.\nHelane Becker : Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then the other question I have is on Omni and the level of business that you mentioned they're doing for the DoD. Do you have any thoughts about the article that appeared recently in Intercept and the accusations that people are mistreated?\nMike Berger: Yeah. So the article that was in there was some gross exaggerations as it related to the treatment of passengers. And these are flights that we do for government agency, for ICE.  And it's important to note that Omni's, I think they did three flights for ICE in 2021, it's less than 1% of their business and it's a tiny amount. And those flights, of course, we have -- we control the safety on the flight so we do have flight attendants on the flight. And obviously, we have flight crews on the flight. But the passengers are -- have oversight of government employees. They're there for the safety of the flight and of the passengers as well. But that article is a gross exaggeration of the treatment of the passengers.\nHelane Becker : Okay, all right. Fair enough. Thank you. \nMike Berger: Thanks, Helane. \nQuint Turner: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Stephanie Moore with Truist.\nStephanie Moore : Hi, good morning. \nQuint Turner: Good morning, Stephanie. \nStephanie Moore : I wanted to touch on maybe more of a high-level discussion or conversation. It looks like, obviously, the demand for your leasing services remains quite strong. You clearly have locked up the conversion capacity for the next several years. So kind of just layering all those factors together, what's the optionality our ability to see even a higher return or higher EBITDA contribution from maybe some of these new leases versus historical ranges? Maybe just if you could walk through some of those puts and takes, that would be helpful. Thanks. \nRich Corrado: Yes, it's a good question because when we're stepping into new aircraft types, we want to get the same return that we've gotten from the 767. And so we've done a lot of financial modeling around that and a lot of market discussions and analysis to see that we're able to get the same return for -- which is 10% unlevered minimum for those new assets and what can we get for the 767s that are either extended leases or new leases coming out. We have been trying to test the market and moving pricing up. And to some extent, it really just depends on who the customer is and how they evaluate the aircraft.  Most airlines, when they're evaluating the performance, the economic performance of an aircraft, they look at all the costs associated to running it, what their flight segments are going to be and then they look at the tonnage they're going to handle and break it down to what's the cost per kilo to run their network using these aircraft. And so you kind of run up against the competitive nature of a cost per kilo versus what market dynamics you can get from improving the lease rates you get on the airplane. So all that said, the way the market is flowing today is our re-leases and extensions are going at the same rate, which is unusual or higher in some cases. And the -- under normal circumstances, when the market is less hot, I guess, I should say, you usually take a small discount when you extend a lease because it's in the best interest of both parties to extend. We save a lot of downtime of the airplane and potentially some maintenance costs.  So we're looking to get a good rate of return that meets or exceeds our historic on the 767, and we feel pretty good about it right now.\nQuint Turner: Yeah, this is Quint. Stephanie, I'd just say that the demand environment that is helping us sell aircraft so far in advance with the pipeline visibility we have is naturally a plus for what you can get in terms of return in our lease rates. I mean, as Rich says, we've been -- we've seen airplanes that have come off-lease renew at or better than what we had -- what the prior lease had been. And certainly, there continues to be really strong demand for the midsized freighter. And that's a good thing for our lease rates.  We don't -- that said, we don't get into specifics because as you know, that's -- our discipline is 10% or better. But I think we all understand that current e-commerce growth is driving conditions that make it possible to get upward movement in terms of lease rates.\nStephanie Moore : Got it. No, that's really helpful. And then I wanted to follow up to the first question about the impact from the accounting changes that you've highlighted. Thank you for giving the, I guess, the impacts to the share count from an EPS standpoint. But maybe you could help us think about what -- how we should think about it from maybe just a valuation standpoint and if we are including those incremental 8 million shares or are those being hedged? Just if you could walk us through that, that'd be great. Thank you.\nQuint Turner: Yes. I mean, we have -- as you know, back when we did it, we did a bond hedge to make the impact of any share dilution even less likely. I think we bought up the thing to like a 70 -- it would have to be a 75% or so premium over what we were trading at, at the time, which if memory serves me right, we were at $21. So it's like before you could even possibly see any share dilution, it would have to be in the, I believe, the low-40s.  And then it's our choice, right, how we settle that. And it's a relatively small slice of our overall debt capital, $259 million out of about $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion. And it matures in October of '24. Actually, I think Truist was involved with that so you guys probably -- across the hall there, they know all about it. But likely next year, we'll take a look at that.  We could put that in our revolver without any trouble at all. And of course, our revolver, we're paying just a little over 1% for our variable debt, which is about the same as our coupon is on that convertible debt. So the likelihood we'll actually issue shares to satisfy it is very tiny and I would almost say non-existent.  But the accounting rules, nonetheless, that take effect require you to reflect the underlying shares in the denominator, sort of the most conservative way, I guess, to show its impact on EPS. And so that's the 8 million shares, which was the underlying share amount that backed up to $259 million in debt. So we put that in the denominator. There's somewhat of an offset and we no longer have to show an interest charge of about $8 million. And the net effect on the EPS, adjusted EPS is about $0.05 a quarter or so. So $0.20, call it, for the year.\nStephanie Moore : Got it. Well, thank you so much. \nQuint Turner: Thanks. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So Quint or Rich, in the $640 million guide for this year, what's contemplated in terms of fleet utilization? So you don't report your absolute block hours so we can't get to kind of like a weighted average utilization rate there. Just curious if you could help frame us how you're thinking about your overall fleet utilization. And then how much ad-hoc flying is also contemplated or included in that $640 million guide? Thanks. \nQuint Turner: Sure, Chris. I'll take a shot at it. First of all, the reason we don't highlight block hours is because we do a lot of network flying. The CMI flying, they're sort of medium range.  And so what drives our revenue and our results and, in fact, in our contracts, typically we're being paid more for the resources. The supplying the aircraft and the crew and the maintenance and so forth and spreading it over a -- while we do it, we do look at it that way. So sometimes spreading it over a block hour total is not as meaningful as it would be if these were long-haul freighters, trans-Pacific type schedules. These are flying shorter hops.  But we take the schedules that we -- that our customers are asking us to fly. And we, of course, bake those into the drivers in our revenue contracts when we do the budget. And so what's behind the $640 million is basically our CMI fleet, which, as you know, grew substantially in 2021. We put, I think what was it, Rich, 13 airplanes on for Amazon. And we put on three or four for DHL as well. So we're reflecting that. We're reflecting what we typically would expect to see maybe in peak. But the customer is -- has the flexibility to change schedules during the year. So it's not like those can't change based on customer wishes. So we're basing our projections on what we're currently flying. We anticipate getting some additional aircraft into the Amazon CMI this year. I think as many as three, and those are aircraft they would supply. It's not ones we'll be leasing to them so we bake that in as well. And to the extent ours drive our revenues, that's what we put in our plan.\nChris Stathoulopoulos : Okay. So if we back out this $40 million to $45 million from this new maintenance agreement that gets you to an implied EBITDA of around 10%, which I'm guessing your fleet is probably not perhaps close to but not at pre-pandemic utilization. And so that 10% actually within that light is pretty good. Is that -- with where you're order book is here and the move and the introduction of the A320s. Is 10% the right way to think about this now through the next stages of the recovery or through a cycle versus what you've done in the past has been sort of mid- to high single digit?\nRich Corrado: You mean, as you think about 2023 versus '22?\nChris Stathoulopoulos : Yeah. I mean, the 10% to 15%, I realize there's a lot of different things at play here, but you do have a very full order book and you have the A320s coming in. So is kind of 10% to 15% a fair sort of rate that you believe that you can sustain here through the cycle?\nQuint Turner: Yeah. Remember, you're on a bigger and bigger base every year. And when you think about the impact on EBITDA, if you're talking about growth on the EBITDA stat, remember, because of the timing of the termination of the prior engine contract, there's, year-over-year, sort of an outsized jump, right, related to that. So you'd be talking about -- I think 10% is maybe how you would think of it sort of as a more normal, but it will depend on the opportunities.  If the market stays hot like it is, we're adding new platforms, we're adding the Airbus platforms, the number of aircraft we could lease instead of being more like 10, it can be more like 20 in some of those years. It's the timing of delivery of some of those aircraft.  You talked about the 321s this year, the 2. They're coming late in the year. So it always depends upon timing of delivery when you're comparing one year over another. So there's a whole host of factors. But I will tell you that one of the drivers that I think maybe the folks may not have expected, I mean -- and as we've been saying it, is the momentum in leasing that we've had and also improvement in our ACMI Services segment year-over-year is driving a lot of our EBITDA growth. And I don't know if the market had appreciated that.  Certainly, the pandemic has sort of been harmful to the ACMI Services segment, particularly Omni. And so we are getting -- as Rich said, we're coming out of that, and we hope for further moderation in those effects for 2022. So that's been a big plus. The combi flying, we think there's some further improvement that we're projecting in the second half related to some of the destinations, the 757 combis fly into. That will be helpful for us, so that will help us in '23. If that happens, you'll get a year-over-year -- that will be helpful for that. So there's a whole host of factors. I mean, if you want to make some assumption, I would point you more towards the 10% than 15%. 15% is pretty hard when you're on a significant base. Now if the market is really hot and we increase the leasing, that can help push us closer to that.\nChris Stathoulopoulos : Okay. And the 130, the active fleet at the end of this year, the 130, I think back in November, you had suggested that you could do kind of a teens growth on that, which would imply around 145 to 2023. Is that still the right way to think about the active fleet for next year?\nMike Berger: Yeah, Chris, it's Mike. Yes, spot on. We think that's still very accurate.\nChris Stathoulopoulos : Okay. Thank you. \nMike Berger: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator:  And our next question is from John Kim with .\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. Thanks for your time. I appreciate all the granularity around guidance. As you alluded to in the last question, obviously you're layering in 11 new leases this year. Can you talk about -- you may provided the guidance for 2022. Can you talk about the exit run-rate of '22 from an EBITDA perspective?\nQuint Turner: That's a good question, John. It's -- it will be above what we've guided to for the full year. How's that for guidance? I don't know that I've given a whole lot of thought to the -- as I say, some of those good guys that we are looking for are in the second half. Although by enlarge, the EBITDA that we expect this year is more evenly spread between first half and second half than we saw in 2021. We do expect improvements sequentially in the second half. And what's driving that is, of course, the timing of the leases, lease deployments and also that combi flying that I mentioned a minute ago.  And so it's going to -- that will push the exit run-rate higher than $640 million. But I don't know that I can, or would want to, at this point, give you some specific. That will depend on some other factors. It may be a little premature. Maybe we talk about that later in the year at one of these calls when we've got even better visibility on everything.\nUnidentified Analyst: Fair enough and understood. You made some comments early in the call and highlighted your leverage position's pretty strong right now. And obviously, you've got a high degree of visibility into your growth for 2022. '23 and beyond and the ability to repurchase shares beginning in Q3. Have you guys begun to think about quantifying what a share repurchase might look like? I know you have to play a little poker here at the market, but would be interested in your general thoughts on that.\nRich Corrado: Yeah. We've been looking at a number of ways as far as capital allocation goes. And certainly, as I put in the remarks that we're looking forward to having the restrictions removed from us so that we'll have the opportunity to return capital to shareholders.  We haven't made any decisions yet, but we're looking to continue evaluating towards a balanced capital allocation strategy that would be -- certainly include returning capital to shareholders in the future.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: And we have our next question from Howard Rosencrans with Value Advisory.\nHoward Rosencrans : Hi, guys. Thank you very much. I joined the call a little bit late. I just want to get a quick clarity on the $45 million, then I have a -- or the $40 million to $45 million then I have a quick follow-up. So the $40 million to $45 million is sort of flowing in. It was previously -- now it's going to be hitting our EBITDA, whereas previously it was sort of swapped in prior?\nQuint Turner: Yeah. Howard, this is Quint. Of course, we went through that in some detail on an earlier question. I'm not sure I can be as eloquent again, but I'll take a whack at it.  Yeah, the previous contract that we had that covered the vast majority of our 767-200 engines was with Delta and it was a power-by-cycle arrangement. And we extended that to lessees, if they wanted it, not all of them used it. Some of them wanted to be responsible, take care of the engines during the lease themselves. But we extended that to our lessees, and we -- there was some markup on that CAM recognized. And so that qualifies as PBC. That came to an end right around the start of the fourth quarter, terminated. It had been in place for years. And we could have extended and renewed but we looked at our options. And we said, hey, there's an opportunity here to more efficiently manage this engine maintenance at the CAM level. And so we've transitioned it to providing lessees\u2019 access to a pool of engines that we are responsible to keep maintained and available. And as we do that, we'll capitalize those visits. We don't have an arrangement of power-by-cycle arrangement with any vendor to do the maintenance. We're doing it on a time and material basis. And so when those go through the shop, they'll be capitalized and they will depreciate over the engine's life.\nHoward Rosencrans : If I could just -- I appreciate the elucidation. Just from a more simplistic standpoint, though in essence, on a sort of free cash flow from what you would generate standpoint, we've really -- it seems to me, and if I'm wrong, I'll just take it with you offline. It seems to me that we've sort of just moved it from 1 bucket to the other. I mean, you would still be guiding to a great year of like $600 million. But the after -- but the free cash flow effect of it seems unchanged. So it seems like with the old accounting or not with the old accounting, but if you were doing it the same way, you'd really be at about $600 million. Again, if I'm wrong, I'll just take it offline.\nQuint Turner: Well, if you want to look at it, if nothing had changed, that's probably correct. I would say that we believe that there's cash flow positive opportunity and certainly margin opportunity from this change, and it's also beneficial to our lessees and it extends the life of that aircraft type to be more accurately managed.\nHoward Rosencrans : I get it. But I want to jump back to what you said about the CMI, which I think is great because I certainly beat you up enough about it offline. The -- what you -- because the CMI over the years has been, as I don't hesitate to tell you horribly inconsistent. But it seems to me you're really making -- please tell me if I'm misconstruing your sentiments here. It seems to me you're really making a very positive statement with a high degree of confidence that we're going to really see a sustained change in CMI and the EBITDA contribution. I don't care about what the revenue contribution is, the EBITDA contribution from that line.\nQuint Turner: Yeah. Well, certainly, there's -- last year, we added all these airplanes so you had a lot of start-up costs as you often do when you're bringing on crews and so forth, opening maintenance stations and just for growth like that.  This year, we said maybe up to three going into the Amazon agreement. So there's more stability, which I think allows for more efficiencies and also the scale that these operations have grown to. We renewed our DHL contract. We expect to see some growth opportunities with that in place and a six-year crew agreement that one of our airlines, ABX, executed at the beginning of last year. So there's a whole lot of good things going on in the CMI. And also the recovery from the pandemic in the PAX for Omni, which is all stacking up to make conditions right for year-over-year improvement in that segment.\nMike Berger: And Howard, we've -- I think we've talked on previous calls, we've, also outside of the scale that Quint has mentioned, we've done a lot of work with the airlines and with our MRO in terms of improving supply chain efficiencies so that we're taking advantage of the full buying power of the enterprise versus suboptimizing. And we've done a lot of other things with flight planning with some other predictive maintenance technology programs and some other things to actually improve both our efficiency and that will lead to improved profitability. And we are already seeing results of our investments prior investments in 2021. So we're looking forward to a more efficient aviation situation going on in the future.\nHoward Rosencrans : Okay. I think if this is really the inflection point on CMI, this is a long overdue game-changer for your multiple, as will the return of capital be. So thank you very much.\nMike Berger: Thanks, Howard.\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Howard. \nOperator: And we have a follow-up question from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos : Hey. Thanks for taking my follow-up. So Quint, I think on the last few calls, you've used the term self-funding model. And I feel that it's sort of underappreciated here. If we look at all the sort of the puts and takes here, eventually, the spread here between the market value, book value or the residual value on the 767s is going to go the other way. But you are attached to customers like DHL and Amazon, and you do have the A320s slowly working into the fleet. So when you talk about the self-funding model, which, again, I think you've used now in the last two or three calls, as we look at your free cash flow back through 2010, depending on where you are in the order book cycle, it's gone positive, negative. So should we kind of interpret that as you believe that you can sustain positive free cash flow through an order cycle or an economic cycle? And if so, outside of buybacks here, which it sounds like you have seven or so months to figure it out, how we should think about capital allocation beyond aircraft acquisitions? Thank you.\nQuint Turner: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. When we published the stat a couple of quarters ago, adjusted free cash flow and separated our CapEx into the sort of nondiscretionary or sustaining CapEx versus the growth or discretionary. We did it to further highlight that aspect of our business model. It does fund tremendous growth. I mean, when you look at the trailing 12-month basis, $400 million that is available to allocate. And of course, none of the allocations are mutually exclusive. You can allocate those towards growth, which we do have a bias when the market is there and the returns are good. And that's the environment we've been in.  But when you're -- when it is self-sustaining like that and funding the growth and your debt isn't going up or in the case of last year, even declining, you can see in one of our slide shows that the fleet growth and yet the debt is going down. So that's clear that this business funds growth. But that means that your cap -- your leverage ratio is going to decline, and it allows you to look at the use our balance sheet to create value in a number of ways. We've been constrained from doing that, certainly with the restrictions on the grants that we participated in. And that changes later this year.  I think Rich said a minute ago, he was asked about have you been looking at different ways to create value that might include return of capital. And certainly, we always have that as a part of a balanced strategy. It's just we haven't been able to. We think the valuation of the company hasn't -- doesn't reflect a lot of the improvements that we've had in terms of our leasing book and the cash flows that you can -- that we have visibility on that go out for years.  It's funny we get questions sometimes about M&A. Do you look at M&A? And I think we answered it like, well, we certainly want to know about what's out there, but it's rare that you find something that is either of value or strategically fits into your model. But if we were looking for something, it would look a lot like us because we're not -- we don't believe we trade at a multiple that really reflects the value of the business. And I think you can take that to mean we believe our shares are certainly a bargain at the price they're at. And so when we're able to, I think that will -- and hopefully, the market recognizes that value and we all hope for that, right, that we see share price more appropriately reflect the progress the business has made. And so we'll have to take a look at that, but we do believe returning cash to shareholders is smart as part of a balanced strategy to create value.\nChris Stathoulopoulos : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: And thank you. We have no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Rich Corrado for closing remarks.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, operator. I'd like to close by again recognizing the employees of ATSG for their outstanding commitment to safety through the pandemic challenges while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers. The most highly valued companies achieve the goals they set for themselves. Year-after-year, we hit or exceed our performance targets because the vast majority of our results come from expanding base of long-term leases and contracts. We belong among the highly valued companies whose value is not based on just what they say but on the ability to deliver superior performance year after year.  Thank you for your continued support of ATSG, and stay safe.\nOperator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. "}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 3, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-11-05 16:50:03", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2021 Air Transport Services Group, Incorporate Earnings Conference Call. My name is Darryl, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Joe Payne, Chief Legal Officer. Mr. Payne, you may begin.\nJoe Payne: Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website, atsginc.com. Let me begin by advising you that during the course of this call, we will make projections and other forward looking-statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we described here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans, and estimates as of the date of this call. Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following which relate to the current COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic may continue for a longer period or its effect on commercial and military passenger flying may be more substantial than we currently expect, cause disruptions to our workforce and staffing capability including through our compliance with federally mandated COVID-19 vaccination and testing requirements, health disruptions and our ability to access airports and maintenance facilities, and adversely impact our customers\u2019 credit worthiness or the ability of our vendors and third-party service providers to maintain customary service levels. Other factors that could cause ATSG\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, unplanned changes in the market demand for our assets and services including the loss of customers or a reduction in the level of services we perform for customers, our operating airline\u2019s ability to maintain on-time service and control costs. The cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration, fluctuations in ATSG\u2019s traded share price and in interest rates which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments, the number of timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers, our ability to remain in compliance with key agreements with customers, lenders, and government agencies. The impact of current supply chain constraints both within and outside the United States which may be more severe or persist longer than we currently expect, the impact of a competitive labor market which could restrict our ability to fill key positions, changes in general economic and/or industry-specific conditions, and other factors as contained from time-to-time in our filings with the SEC including the Form 10-Q we will file on Monday. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted free cash flow. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial condition and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials, and we advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures which are included in our earnings release and on our website. And now, I'll turn the call over to Rich Corrado, our President and CEO, for his opening comments.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. You just heard Joe mention that we're disclosing for the first time this quarter another non-GAAP metric in our financial reporting, adjusted free cash flow. It's part of a broader set of disclosures to help us highlight the power of our business model to our shareholders and to help many of you who tell the ATSG story to prospective investors on our behalf. The earnings release we issued yesterday includes a summary of our GAAP cash flow statement along with a breakout of the sustaining portion of our total capital expenditures. As Quint will discuss shortly supported by the slides accompanying our remarks, significant cash remains after funding those essential payments to maintain the assets we already operate. Our business model\u2019s highly visible future cash flows afford us many attractive capital allocation options including further growth investments and direct shareholder returns. For the third quarter, we generated a record $153 million in quarterly adjusted EBITDA, our traditional non-GAAP measure, and put nearly all of it back into the business to keep it humming and stoked our growth engine midsize freighter leasing. We have placed 13 Boeing 767s into external customer leases since September 2020. Our airlines again achieved double-digit growth in revenue block hours versus the prior year and were strongly profitable with improved margins. Omni Air was a notable contributor to those gains due in part to its supporting role in Operation Allies Refuge, the U.S. component of the evacuation of Americans and at-risk civilians from Afghanistan. Omni has completed 79 missions and transported over 20,000 passengers in this effort. I know I speak for everyone at ATSG in expressing our gratitude to the Omni team for their courage and dedication in completing these vital missions. There are many other great elements to our third quarter story and are, now a stronger outlook for adjusted EBITDA through the end of the year. I'll be back to share them after Quint reviews our results in more detail. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thank you, Rich, and welcome to everyone on the call this morning. Our consolidated revenues grew a substantial 15% for the quarter to a record $466 million. Both our aircraft leasing and airline businesses delivered outstanding results with gains of 22% and 10%, respectively. Revenue growth reflects the impact of 13 more freighter aircraft leases and a related increase in CMI flying by our airlines from freighters we are leasing to and flying for Amazon. Our Defense Department revenues were also strong due in large part to the Afghanistan evacuation missions we flew through September. Block hours flown from the Department of Defense increased by 581 or 7% compared to the third quarter of 2020. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $153 million was up 22% from a year ago and up 20% from the record $128 million we generated in the second quarter. Again, these gains reflect our additional 767 leases and flight operations for Amazon and also leases of our 767-300s and 200s to Raya, SkyTaxi, MasAir, and Astral, diversifying our customer base and enlarging our global footprint in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and Africa. On Slide 4, for the trailing 12 months ended September 30 of this year, our adjusted EBITDA increased to $508 million from $481 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021. We project for the full year 2021 we will produce adjusted EBITDA of at least $535 million. In the year ago period, reflected on Slide 4, adjusted EBITDA benefited from additional passenger charters to recover Americans during the pandemic. As a reminder, our adjusted EBITDA excludes the benefits of federal pandemic relief assistance under the Payroll Support Program for all period shown. On Slide 5, our capital spending for the third quarter has roughly plateaued at an annualized rate of about $545 million, but remains above our prior run rate. The lower section of each bar shows the portion of our capital spending that we have allocated to growth, which consists mainly of feedstock aircraft purchases and freighter modification costs. The upper portion of the bars shows spending for, what we call sustaining CapEx which primarily includes scheduled aircraft maintenance and engine overhauls, technology improvements and other non-aircraft spending. As shown on the slide. Approximately two-thirds of our total capital spend is for growth, and one-third for sustaining our operating assets. For the full year 2021, we project total capital spending of $530 million, $335 million for growth and $195 million of sustaining capital. The next slide, Slide 6 shows adjusted free cash flow, which is our operating cash flow net of the sustaining CapEx I mentioned a minute ago. Unlike our adjustment EBITDA measure, our GAAP operating cash flow includes cash received under federal pandemic relief programs for passenger airlines. We did not receive any such cash in the third quarter, but did receive payments of $83 million in the first half. That difference, along with other variances in our working capital, reduced our accelerating cash flow trend for the trailing 12 months ended in September. The bottom portion of each bar shows the significant adjusted free cash flow our business produces. For each trailing 12-month period shown, adjusted free cash flow has exceeded $330 million, which is capital potentially available for growth investment, debt repayment and other uses. Spending for fleet-related growth has roughly equaled our adjusted free cash flow for the period shown as we believe that investments tied to fleet expansion represent optimal use of that adjusted free cash flow in today's hot market for midsized freighters. In future periods, we expect our adjusted free cash flow to increase as we execute additional long-term leases and expand customer operating agreements. Slide 7 illustrates how the significant cash flows our businesses generate have enabled us to expand the size of our own aircraft fleet while reducing our debt to EBITDA leverage. In other words, our business self-funds significant growth. Our current debt to EBITDA ratio as defined under our senior secured credit agreement stands at 2.2 times, down from 2.9 times at the end of September of 2020. The 122 aircraft CAM owned at the end of September, including aircraft stating for release and awaiting freighter mod speak to the strong overall returns we are earning, while at the same time delevering on an owned fleet now twice the size that it was five years ago. With that summary of our financial and operating results for the quarter, I'll turn it back to Rich for some comments on our operations and outlook. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint. We couldn't have picked a better time to put the cash-generating power of our business strategy on full display in our reporting as our businesses are performing as well as the pandemic-constrained economy will allow. Record revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and year-to-date are the rewards of substantial fleet and other growth investments that Quint just outlined and the dedication and skillful execution by our people. And we can make a stronger case than nearly anyone in the transport sector that the future cash flows from our long-term relationships and business agreements with blue chip customers are undervalued in today's market despite being highly visible. All of that aside, we still face challenges related to the pandemic, particularly in our passenger operations. The good news is that we anticipate on these passenger charter operations to continue to make progress but expect fourth quarter passenger operations including ATI's military combi to yield results similar to last year's fourth quarter. Like others, we are immune to supply chain challenges. We had planned to put 16 or more converted 767s on lease this year. It has recently become clear that supply chain constraints impacting our freighter conversion lines will keep us one aircraft short of that mark in 2021 with that aircraft sliding into 2022. Even with this delay, deploying 15 converted 767-300 freighter aircraft and releasing four 767-200s will be a yearly record and represents a remarkable achievement for the teams that made it happen. We're taking steps to expand our freighter conversion capacity in multiple ways including our commitment to convert and lease 20 Airbus A330 aircraft starting with the first lease deployment in 2024. We're also adding Boeing as an additional conversion source for at least four 767s with the first induction scheduled for August of next year. Additionally, we will continue to convert Boeing 767 aircraft with our long-time conversion vendor, IAI. Altogether, we have secured access to 70 conversion slots for Boeing 767-300 as well as Airbus A321 and A330 aircraft over the next five years. We are continuing to find willing customers for all of our midsize freighters that we can deliver. Our order book for Boeing 767-300 freighters is full until late 2023. We already have significant customer interest in both the A321 and A330 platforms. Ken has already purchased the first A321 it intends to convert at PEMCO's facilities in Tampa and deliver it to the lease customers in 2022. We also have other operating accomplishments worth celebrating. ATI\u2019s customers are benefiting from a series of upgrades at its flight control center that are reducing fuel consumption. The 17% increase in revenue block hours at all of our airlines is great news, but it's important to note that those gains would not have been possible without our airline's ability to attract and select new flight crew personnel from an outstanding pool of talent and get more than 100 of them trained, certified, and ready to fly those assignments when our customers needed them. Our logistic services business has worked hard to be a reliable partner for Amazon for the ground and fuel service it needs to match the rapid buildup of its fulfillment network. That includes the opening of a new gateway facility in September in Nashville and continued support of Amazon's Gateway facilities in Charlotte, Tampa, and here in Wilmington, Ohio. Earlier this year, our AMES aircraft maintenance business, announced a new multi-year agreement with United Airlines for heavy maintenance work on its Airbus A321s and several of its Boeing aircraft types. That work will be completed in the Ames hangar facilities in Wilmington and Tampa. And finally, AMES Pemco Division completed delivery of its second Boeing 737 700 FlexCombi and received an order for another. Pemco also inducted the first of what we anticipate will be many Airbus A321s for conversion to freighters. Those are a few of the operating and commercial successes that helped us generate record financial results this year and will contribute to the results for several years to come. They are part of the reason why we are able to announce an increase in our financial guidance for 2021. Our adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be at least $535 million this year, ahead of the $525 million target we set last February. I expect ATSG's business to post strong, positive free cash flows net of our sustaining CapEx spend for years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. Quint and I, along with Mike Berger, our Chief Commercial Officer, are ready to answer your questions. May we have the first question, operator?\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question is from Jack Atkins from Stephens.\nJack Atkins: So, I guess maybe first, if we could talk about the guidance for a moment and the increased outlook for 2021. Quint, I don't know if you want to take this, but maybe if you wouldn't mind kind of walking us through some of the puts and takes behind the raise? I would imagine, there was a little bit of an additional benefit from Omni related to the Afghanistan withdrawal in the third quarter? But it sounds like that, that - you know, maybe the ramp in expected underlying military - you know maybe a little bit below expectations? I guess if you could kind of help us kind of walk through all the different puts and takes there from a high level, that'd be helpful.\nQuint Turner: Sure, Jack. It's certainly true that the Afghanistan evacuation added some revenue opportunity in Omni during the third quarter, and that is a part of it. However, you know, the expenses necessary to satisfy those opportunities, were also probably higher than that folks might expect. We had to pay some premium pay, certainly to the flight crews and the flight attendants who worked those flights.\nJack Atkins: True.\nQuint Turner: So, from an EBITDA perspective, it wasn't as big a driver as some might suspect. I think that - you know, we've seen and we saw it last quarter, the second quarter, we saw it in the third quarter and expect it to continue in the fourth. We've seen improvement in our airline ACMI operations. We're getting larger, certainly, in our support for our network cargo customers. And as you would expect, you look for efficiencies as you grow in size in those networks. We're also seeing some improvements, certainly, with Omni in terms of the commercial passenger business, it\u2019s still constrained with the pandemic effects. But as you guys you\u2019ve been watching college football and things know, things are a little bit more normal. We're seeing some signs of life there and that's helped. And of course, CAM and the deployments that - we talked about the - on the 40-plus percent earnings increase in CAM over the prior-year quarter. CAM is doing an outstanding job of delivering on its lease commitments for customers with a record number of leases put in place. And again, these are long-term agreements. So, that is all helping to come together to allow us to bump our guidance.\nRich Corrado: Jack, I would - I'd also add to that, I think it's important to note that we have put in - if you recall, we talked about a lot of technology improvements and operational improvements that we were working on, and those are starting to bear fruit now. We put a continuous improvement program in about a year and a half ago and did a large supply chain optimization program across the enterprise to leverage the full-scale buying power of ATSG for all the individual entities. And that's bearing fruit. We've implemented new flight scheduling planning and following, as well as crew optimization scheduling software at the two cargo airlines. And so, that is starting to allow us to be more efficient with our crews. And so, when you look at the better performance by the airlines, it wasn't - all volume related. There was a lot of hard work by a lot of people leveraging technologies and projects that are helping us become more efficient and productive.\nJack Atkins: Okay. No, that's really helpful. Thank you for kind of walking us through all that. I guess maybe for my next question here, the 70 conversion slots that you guys have secured over the course of the next, I believe you said five years, Rich, I guess two questions there. One, could you maybe provide us some visibility into how many of those you think are kind of already spoken for? You feel like you've got visibility into sort of demand for those? And then - secondly, kind of within that broadly, could you talk about the types of customers that are - you think those incremental 70 planes will be going to over the next - the next five years? Are these going to be large sort of enterprise level customer contracts like we've seen over the past five years or do you think they're going to be smaller type contracts with - in kind of one-off customers? I was just kind of curious could, you may be break that down a bit for us?\nMike Berger: Yes Jack, it's Mike I'll take that one. We really see it as a continued combination in regards to the type of customers that we project these aircraft to go to. Certainly you've heard us over the last several quarters, talk about the expansion globally, and the push into other regions of the world, and we'll continue to build upon those customers. And they certainly are part of our order book today. So the Astrals, the Rayas, SkyTaxis of the world, they will become bigger customers for us no question in the future. But we were also excited about the opportunities that we have new opportunities and new customers in those parts of the world as well. In regards to the enterprise-type customers, yes, we certainly believe that the e-commerce growth is going to continue to drive the market for our big enterprise customers. So we continue to see a large - you'll see a combination of those and the engine continues to be - the e-commerce and then commerce that are driving the integrators as well as the regional players. So - in regards to how much visibility we have in regards to it, 2022, we have previously said that our order book, from a conversion standpoint, will be at least 10 767s. As we look out further into 2023 at this point, we've got visibility on probably close to somewhere between in the high-teens to - help somewhere in the high-teens for 2023 deliveries, based on that. And as Rich mentioned earlier, our A330 conversion slots start in July of 2023 and run through December of 2025. So, our first A330 deliveries will be very early in January, starting in January 2024. So \u2026\nJack Atkins: Okay. Very helpful.\nRich Corrado: And also I say Jack, that as far as customers for those airplanes, we're pretty much booked through the middle of 2023 and the 767 side, all three 2021 A321s have customers that we're working with right now. So, as far as - it's not just the slots, and I should say, we also have feedstock for the 767 through the third quarter of 2023. So, we've got feedstock, we have slots and we have customers. So, 2022 is looking closed out and 2023 is - we're finalizing things for that.\nMike Berger: Yes and just one final thing, I mentioned the slots in terms of A330, but the customer interest in regards to - getting customers actually assigned to the A330s has been very, very strong. We\u2019ve been at industry conferences over the last month or two, we\u2019ll go to another one here, Rich and I, in Austin  a couple of weeks. So, the conversation and discussions around the future aircraft, specifically the A330, are even stronger than we thought. So, we're extremely excited about the future of that aircraft.\nJack Atkins: Okay. No, that's very, very helpful. I guess maybe for my last question before I turn it over. I know you guys historically have sort of thought about pricing your assets relative to the cost of capital, right? You're trying to achieve a specific level of unlevered return on invested capital and then you're looking to boost that with additional services that you can add on after that. But just given the high level of demand that you guys have been seeing now for quite some time? And the visibility you have in demand looking forward, how are you thinking about the per unit economics of these aircraft moving forward? Is there an opportunity to sort of move the needle higher just given the level of demand we're seeing for your assets specifically looking out over the next several years?\nRich Corrado: Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Jack. As far as the market goes, we deal with all different types of customers, some very large and will take large blocks of airplanes at a time, as you know. Others will take medium blocks. And then we have smaller customers that tend to do business with our larger customers in other parts of the world. MasAir is a good example down in Mexico. They fly for DHL. SkyTaxi in Europe flies for DHL just some examples. And so there, when you look at the kind of the negotiating leverage side, it doesn't - even though these are smaller companies, they have to have a cost structure that can compete for that same type of business. So, we've been able to ratchet rates up a little bit. Keep in mind that, you know, when you\u2019re negotiating at least a term, how long the lease is and whether it\u2019s an eight-year lease, a seven-year lease or a 10-year lease will impact the lease rate per month. And so, a lot of times, you know customers will want to extend the term to get a better lease rate. But we've been able to get - ratcheted up a little bit, particularly on releases and extensions. In the past pretty much when you gave an extension to a customer, you know, you take a haircut on it because there was a benefit to the company not having to have the aircraft come back and be down for, you know, two to four months while you recheck and get it ready for another customer if you had one available. So, but now with the demand out there, you know, customers are hanging on to aircraft a lot longer. They're renewing their leases ahead of time, and the rates are firming up on those renewals. So, that's all good news.\nOperator: Our next question is from Helane Becker from Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks, Darryl. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the time. Well, first of all, thanks for adjusted free cash flow. That's very helpful, and I appreciate that. And then for my question, I have two questions. One is with the amount of flying you did, you know, for us moving people out of Afghanistan and so on. How should we think about the DOT revenue going forward? I'm assuming we're not going to have as much and just kind of wondering how to think about that.\nQuint Turner: Yes. I think Helane, this is Quint. We, you know, in terms of the fourth quarter, you know, I think we said we're expecting a fourth quarter similar to what we saw we\u2019re expecting a fourth quarter similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2020. As far as changes in the DOD longer term in terms of the volume of military flying, what we've seen in the past is that when theaters change, it doesn't necessarily have a large impact on the actual volume of flying because troops move from theater to theater and the rotations of those troops still take place. Training exercises move around but, ultimately, that we - our experience in the past has been that or Omni\u2019s experience is that it hasn't made a real significant difference over the long haul. But, no, you don't - as we've said in the past, we don't get as much visibility, right, as - on the passenger side with the DOD as we would, for example, with scheduled cargo network flying for our other customers.\nHelane Becker: And then my other question is on AMES. So, I think you mentioned about United and I - during the maintenance for them, and I know you have some other customers for them. When you think about growth for them, how do you think about - I guess, how many outside customers could they have because they also do some of your in-house maintenance, I think? So, how big can they get as non-ATSG customers?\nRichCorrado: So, it's a good question because we're - this is Rich, Helane. Thank you. It's a good question because we're - we are constantly balancing that internal versus external revenue as it relates to the AMES profile. Generally, they - we have demands particularly that CAM puts on them, and then the other - the airlines have C checks, etcetera. And sometimes there's things that only AMES can do. For example, they\u2019re the only MRO in the world that\u2019ll do an aft pressure bulkhead as far as we know. And so, we have some of those from time to time. So, we tend to populate the specific needs of airplane - our own airplanes where we know it's more beneficial for AMES to do those airplanes. We do send some of our airplanes outside due to - allowing AMES to optimize external customer views. So, when we get a customer like United that has a multi-year agreement that will be consuming hangar space, nose to tail, for a long period of time, that's a - that's a good deal for us. It's a very predictable amount of revenue and cash. And so, we optimize around that. We've got other deals such as with Frontier down in - down at AMES in Tampa. And then, we have conversion lines that are dedicated for the Airbus A321, and right now for the Boeing 737 down in - down in Tampa. Those conversion lines will probably shift by 2023. We'll have a two Airbus A321 lines most likely up in AMES. And we'll probably be back up from the Airbus 737, but - so, it's really, when we look at our annual plan, it's what's on the docket for C checks and odd maintenance items. We do profile CAM\u2019s needs to - for whatever they're doing. It's one of the huge advantages that CAM has over other leasing companies, is to have access to an MRO that'll prioritize their business. And so, when we have lessees that want upgraded avionics or they want some special work done to the airplane or they want us to help them put the aircraft on their certificate, all those things we can do, it's captive, and CAM - and we prioritize that with our MRO's from CAM.\nQuint Turner: But then in terms of total MRO capacity, it's kind of limited based on facility space.\nRich Corrado: Right.\nOperator: Our next question is from Frank Galanti from Stifel.\nFrank Galanti: Thank you very much, and thank you for breaking out the adjusted free cash flow and that sustaining CapEx number. That was very helpful. I wanted to dig in on that a little bit. Last quarter you had said, I guess my question on maintenance CapEx side that it was closer to $160 million a year. I just wanted to kind of get clarification around that versus kind of $195 million guidance today - target for 2021. Are those numbers or those numbers kind of different? I was asking a different question or is this kind of a higher year than normal? And I guess the real question is, what does that number look like generally going into the future? And previously had said that it will scale kind of linearly with plane addition. Can you give us a sense how to think about that on a per plane basis?\nMike Berger: Yes. That's a good question, Frank. The - you know, if you look at what is in that sustaining, we want to - we wanted to put growth and make it as pure as possible with just feedstock purchases plus conversion. And then, the - this - what we're calling sustaining is primarily what you would call maintenance CapEx, which is heavy maintenance on airframe that's scheduled and an engine overhaul, etcetera. But it also includes some of the CapEx that we invest here to - I mean Rich mentioned some of the technology improvements that we've invested in IT and so forth. And so from year-to-year, from period-to-period, like, for example, we've significantly upgraded, revised some of our big systems around here, whether it's flight, dispatch or maintenance, and we've made some investments in that which thankfully we're pretty much at the end of I think at this period, that cycle is kind of - kind of over. But that, I think, is responsible for the little bit higher maintenance or sustaining CapEx guidance that we've given of 195. I do believe that the - and timing of scheduled maintenance can have an impact from period-to-period, but in general, I think kind of 160 to 180 number is a good number for our fleet driven maintenance CapEx on an annual basis. And the thing about our business model is as the fleet grows because we lease these aircraft out to - for the most part to external lessees, they are responsible for the maintenance during the life of the lease. So, you know, you think about our business model, the maintenance or the sustaining CapEx will not grow in line with the fleet because for the most part, that's the lessees responsibility. So, you're going to see an expanding just - over time, you're going to see the adjusted free cash flow ATSG produces go up as we build out, Cam's portfolio of leased aircraft. It's not going to drive substantial maintenance CapEx. Now, we will have - in terms of engines, we will have some more CapEx as we enter next year, associated with some of the Boeing 767 engines that had previously been covered under powered by our agreement. So that will have some impact. That\u2019s more of an accounting thing than it is a cash flow thing because we won\u2019t to be paying for the power by cycle experience for and the maintenance of those engines. Instead, we\u2019ll be catalyzing those overalls. And so you'll see that have some impact but the good thing about our model is it shifts maintenance responsibility largely to our customer.\nFrank Galanti: Okay. That's really helpful. And then I wanted to ask on the capital commitments for 70 slots for conversions that you guys have booked. And obviously for that CapEx, requirements are going to be feedstock and not all of that - those feedstock assets have been purchased. Can you sort of give us a sense for how much that whole CapEx is, what's sort of happening to feedstock pricing today? And then from a holistic perspective, what - how does that sort of break out on an annual basis? Is that expected to be funded with internally generated cash flows? And there's a big question but what does that look like then on a debt basis for the company? What level of debt is are you comfortable with.\nRich Corrado: Yes. Let me help you out a little bit on that. It\u2019s kind of a broad question there. But the slot commitments are typically involve putting deposits down to secure slots But then, those deposits are part of your cost of conversion when you adapt the airplane. But where you put them at risk, obviously, is if you wanted to walk away and not use the slot, then you would forfeit your deposit, right? And so, we don't want to talk necessarily about what specific conversion providers have required in terms of deposits, but we account for those expenditures as capital expenditures when we put down the cash when we make the deposits. And it becomes effectively part of the inter-service and conversion cost of the aircraft because when you adopt it, it just gets applied to the cost of the conversion. So, hopefully, that answers that. In terms of commitments, you're right. I mean, the timing of capital expenditures for our aircraft investments for CAM are going to be more driven by the timing of feedstock purchases. And you see us at the end of this quarter already with, I believe, 15 767s that we have purchased feedstock for, and those are in some stage of conversion, either in or awaiting conversion, and one 321. So, that's already in our CapEx that we've reported for those aircraft. And then, in future years, of course, we\u2019ll - as Mike and Rich commented, we've already secured feedstock commitments to take aircraft to fill a large portion of these 70 slots, particularly for the 767 in the future years. We've negotiated conversion pricing and so forth. As far as how it impacts our debt or our debt leverage as we think about how we expect to grow our fleet, I mean, as you've seen with our business model, we have delevered while growing our fleet. One of our slides illustrated that quite clearly. And I think that with the adjusted free cash flow that we produced, we expect to continue to build out and grow our operating cash flow, our EBITDA, and our fleet size without really adding debt to any significant degree because the model simply produces that much adjusted free cash flow. It's a great situation to be in because as we said in our remarks, the business self-fund significant growth. In regards to the cost of the feedstock, I\u2019ll maybe take you through that piece of it. Richard mentioned that we've identified or acquired feedstock that takes us through certainly through 2022 and almost all of 2023. In the 767 side, feedstock remains a little bit tight from a market standpoint and that's really driven by the market demand and how the growth of the entire market is going. So there's really been, I would say, stability and pricing for 767s really from before the pandemic in 2019, through the pandemic in 2020, and really still stable from as we totally come out of the pandemic. So, from that standpoint, , feedstock prices have been relatively solid for the last couple of years. In regards to the A330, we haven't purchased any of those yet but we continue to look at feedstock and feedstock is very plentiful. And so, we think those feedstock costs and on that aircraft over the next couple of years will improve and come down as those airplanes become even and come down as those are - when it\u2019s become even more available.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna.\nChrisStathoulopoulos: Thanks for taking my questions. So, if I look at the focus here and the disclosure on free cash flow, the time you spent in your prepared remarks on the balance sheet, and also the out-year guidance on the slots. Having followed you - having followed you for a few years now or some time, if I put these together, I mean, are you signaling that perhaps this year is the next chapter for CAM and perhaps the enterprise as a whole as Amazon and its order book is fully appreciated by the market now? And just assuming, I mean, where you're at next year, 128 aircraft at the end of the year, I mean, if we put these points together and make some modest assumptions around the slot conversions, could CAM be a top 15 lessor by mid-decade or so? Meaning, is it reasonable to assume that we could see somewhere in the low-200s on an active fleets by 2025 2026? Thanks.\nRich Corrado: Yeah. I mean, based on the amount of slots we have and the amount of airplanes we already own, over the next five years we should be close to 200 airplanes. I mean, we already over the past few years had been the largest lessor of freighter aircraft. And there's a lot of large passenger lessors that acquire large blocks of airplanes, and they're just in a different business than we're in. There's a few larger freighter lessors that are - that are also passenger lessors freighter lessors that are also passenger lessors, like GECAS as an example, and they just merged as well. But - so why - you know, our goal is to maintain our leadership position in the medium range medium wide-body freighter market globally. We're there now and we intend to stay there. And everything we've done, whether it's our capital planning, whether it's the way we've restructured our balance sheet, whether it's the way we've acquired our slots got into the A321. Now the A330 is to maintain that position. We feel it's driving good returns for our shareholders and that the growth prospects in that segment, because it's been powered by the e-commerce growth globally, that's still - it's still in a very low penetration compared to general retail is going to have strong demand for years to come. And we think we're very well positioned at this point to continue to ride that wave.\nChrisStathoulopoulos: And then, Quint, could you just remind us as we look out past - well, as we look at next year and through 2025 with these slots here, how we should think about ballpark EBITDA per aircraft, considering now that you're going to have a bit of a different mix here with this move to Airbus? Thanks.\nQuint Turner: Well, you know, you're jumping out there, Chris, and it's a good question. In terms of how far forward you're looking. You know, we've talked about the 767, right, for a long time about what - and Rich gave you what some of the variables are in terms of how we think about pricing based upon on term and so forth. But the 767 just for the lease before you think about value added services is probably, you know, $3.75 million to $4 million of an annual basis of, you know, of - in terms of revenue. And if you think about the EBITDA margins on our lease, it\u2019s probably, you know, over 90% on just the leasing income. If you think about the A330, the A330 is 15% to 20% larger than the 767 in terms of key capacity and so forth, so 15% to 20% larger. So, you're probably looking at a similar increase over those numbers in terms of what you would expect to produce on the A330 side. The A321 is kind of what two thirds the size of the 767-300. Rich you can jump in here, but\u2026\nRich Corrado: You know, I was saying that the investment and the lease on the A321 is going to be about two thirds of what we get on a 767-300.\nQuint Turner: Yes. And we target as you know, Chris, and unlevered return in excess of 10% on incremental CapEx investments that we make to build out our fleet. And certainly, we are beating that in today's market. And then you look to add those value added services. You know, it all depends upon how many of those services are leasing customers who want to buy. You know, do they want us to fly the airplane for them? Do they want us to maintain it, etcetera.\nChrisStathoulopoulos: If I could get in one more question. The four slots at Boeing here. I\u2019m just curious why they move traditionally, you know, typically done the conversion with IAI, not just because of capacity or perhaps you got a little bit better deal on pricing. Thanks.\nMike Berger: This is Mike. We - it was solely driven based on ensuring that we meet our commitments, that\u2019s been our theme, Rich, it reemphasizes it all the time when he\u2019s not speaking. If we say we\u2019re going to do something, we're going to do it and it just - this allowed us really to ensure that we meet those commitments at - starting in starting in 2023. So, these four slots that we secured with Boeing, two of them will be for next year or two will be for 2023, but all the airplanes will be delivered in 2023 at this point. So, that's the nature of it. There are certain places in the world, if I could put it that way, where the Boeing freighter plays better for a variety of different reasons. So, it gives us incremental flexibility and opens up even more opportunities to diversify our customer base and ensure that we're, like I said, meeting the commitments of our customers.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephanie Moore from Truist.\nStephanie Moore: You just touched on this a little bit, in terms of the return profile of these new leases and then, kind of, targeting at least a 10% return, it sounds like it\u2019s been exceeding that. But maybe if you could, just to break that out a little bit further and just walk through the math between preparing, obviously, the feedstock and the depreciating and really how we could back it to the return profile of these leases. And as a follow-up to that, what's the opportunity for these returns to maybe increase over time, your thoughts overall in the long term? Thank you.\nQuint Turner: Yes. I mean, Stephanie, we - of course we don't, necessarily because of - as Rich says, there are some variables involved. We don't necessarily in that detail in terms of pricing strategy, but for example, I could tell you, if you take CAMs, if you take the assets CAM has on its books, you know, the pre - not net book, but investment costs, and you look at what CAM is gaining on those in terms of EBITDA for example inside of CAM it\u2019s gaining about a 12% return on an annual basis on its investments. And of course, CAM isn't the operating pieces of our company, it isn't the airlines, it isn't the MRO. So that's where those additional services are sold. So if you think about - we've talked about the cost of a Boeing 767-300 to put it on ramp and leasable condition, it can vary obviously, depending upon the age of the aircraft, et cetera, but you're probably looking for somewhere around $30 million to put one on ramp and leasable condition. And we look to earn an unlevered return on that $30 million on an annual basis over the life of the asset, which we believe is 20-plus years in excess of 10%. And as I mentioned, we're exceeding that based on the demand for these mid-sized cargo aircraft in today\u2019s market. And we expect to see that over the long haul. So and \u2013 as we\u2019ve said a minute ago, the investment costs for a 321 is going to be less. It's a smaller aircraft, but it's about two-thirds the size of a 300. So you could say it\u2019s going to be somewhere probably in the neighborhood of $20 million to put on ramp. And when think about 330 it\u2019s going to be, you know, 15% to 20% larger than that, so you can take that, you know, $30 million that sum  right? In terms of your investment costs, but our return targets remain the same on those investments. And we expect to achieve or exceed those over the life of the asset.\nStephanie Moore: Great no, that's really helpful. And then just - I'll ask you a housekeeping question for me, and I'm sorry I missed this earlier, but I believe you said that you were - you\u2019ve kind of locked in at least 10 new leases for 2020, I believe you mentioned that it\u2019s a high teens number for 2023, what - I\u2019m sorry, I just missed the color around 2023?\nRich Corrado: Yes, that's correct. We're still anticipating at least 10 in 2022 in the high teens, you know, somewhere 18, 19, at this point in 2023, Stephanie.\nOperator:  And our next question is from Jack Atkins from Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Great. Just a quick follow-up here, the vaccine mandate has been a major topic of discussion, I think, over the course of the last couple of days, certainly, but I think over the course of this earnings season. I'm just curious, if you think that was going to have any sort of impact on either your work groups, your labor force in general or productivity, that's something that you guys are kind of keeping an eye out for as this kind of goes into effect early next year?\nRich Corrado: That\u2019s a great question, Jack. People asked what you really sleepover right, the problem with this vaccine mandate - when it first came out. There was very little to no guidance from the government when they first put it out. The two executive orders were signed one, regarding government contractors, which a lot of our operations fall under in one that will be managed by OSHA for companies that have a more than 100 employees. And so, we have been working with our companies particularly with the unions in negotiating terms under which they would get vaccinated. We've been compensated - we've allocated compensation for that and we've also incented our own, not our own employee, but non-CDA covered employee to get vaccinated as well. So we\u2019ve had a plan ever before this executive orders to get the population vaccinated. But it\u2019s been really difficult to figure out how to look at some of our business, for example logistics which has some postal contracts and they sort mail for the postal service, but they also have Amazon Gateway that are completed separated from the government contract. And then here in Wilmington, all of our - where most of our companies reside although some of our companies like CAM, as an example, is not technically a government contractor. But they're in the same building and facility as our two airlines that are. And so, under the guidelines, the brand new guidelines that were just issued earlier this week, they are now considered CAM is not considered - impacted by the government piece of this. So we've been shucking and jiving and bobbing and weaving trying to figure out exactly how to execute on this thing. But right now, we feel really good. Our guiding principle has been to two, one is safety always, and that's been since the start of the pandemic and the second one for the fourth quarter in particular has been business continuity. And that's the guideline that we've been marching towards with each individual one of our companies as they tackle the requirements of the government going forward. I can say right now, because we run - we've been doing, surveys that's ongoing. And it's how an employee can get the incentive piece for getting vaccinated, and we've had over 80% of our employees respond. And out of those employees, the ones that have, they have, I think, it's until the - they've got another two weeks, I think, before - to respond and still get the incentive. And if you look at folks that are vaccinated or planning to get vaccinated or at one shot of a two shot or have some type of medical or religious exemption, 92% of the folks who responded are covered. We feel really good about that. All of the companies, the airlines and the MRO, and logistics have committed that they believe that business continuity will be strong in the fourth quarter. And so, we're real confident that we're going to be able to deliver for our customers and help them deliver for their customers. And so, it's been a - I'm probably telling you how to build a watch when you asked me what time it is. But this has been a real focus of all the leaders in the company that have done a fantastic job - I have to say that - managing their individual populations to get to the point now that we're confident that we're going to have - we're going to be able to service our customers without any disruption in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: You have another question from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thanks for taking my follow-up. So obviously, you haven\u2019t had to make adjustments to your workforce similar to your - passenger peers here. But curious if you\u2019re seeing any pressuring along the - pressure, excuse me, on the FTE line and what you're seeing in your hiring class for pilots, and then also where you are on the contract talks with ALPA for ATI and IBT and Omni? Thanks.\nRich Corrado: Yes so, in terms of - in terms of attracting pilots, we're still in great shape. Airlines are growing. Omni's got a soft spot right now, but we haven't had a problem attracting pilots which is good. We're managing any attrition due to retirements and those types of things. We've got - still ATI is a very fast-growing airline. And so, that's what pilots want to work for an airline that allows them to improve their career quicker and move from a first officer to a captain. So, we've had very strong response to when we put out a class for training to add crews for all of our airlines, which has been solid. In terms of where the negotiations stand, both ATI and Omni crew agreements, pilot agreements are amendable right now, and both are really at the beginning stages of their negotiations. They\u2019re in Section 6 bargaining. They're covered by the Railway Labor Act. And so, we know these things generally take a long period of time right now. They've defined kind of the process, the negotiating process, and the cadence of meetings. And so, they're meeting three times - three days each month to go through that really, just working on the agreements now, haven't gotten into working on accruals and some other things, haven\u2019t gotten into the compensation side of it yet. But they\u2019re working together well both the airlines and their unions. And we were hoping that we\u2019ll get through this and get in there and maintain a good competitive cost structure and good - and a compensation program that allows us to continue to attract the best pilots in the business.\nOperator: And I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Rich Corrado for closing remarks.\nRich Corrado: Thank you. This holiday season, the demands on logistics networks and the companies that operate them are greater than we've seen ever before. The people at the front lines of these networks will be under even more stress than COVID has already imposed. Our people will rise to the challenge as they always have while keeping safety first. I ask you all to think of those people across those networks every time you hit that order button on your screen this season. Have a great holiday season, and we'll be back with you again in 2022. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 2, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-08-06 14:27:17", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2021 Air Transport Services Group, Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Vanessa and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call.  At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Joe Payne, Chief Legal Officer. Sir, you may begin.\nJoe Payne: Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It\u2019s on our website, atsginc.com. Let me begin by advising you that, during the course of this call, we will make projections and other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call. Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following which relate to the current COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn. The pandemic may continue for a longer period or its effect on commercial and military passenger flying may be more substantial than we currently expect. It may also disrupt our workforce and staffing capability, our ability to access airports and maintenance facilities, our customers\u2019 credit worthiness and the continuing ability of our vendors and third-party service providers to maintain customary service levels. Other factors could also impact the market demand for our assets and services. These include our operating assets and services. These include our operating airlines ability to maintain on-time service and control cost, the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration, fluctuations in ATSG\u2019s traded share price and in interest rate which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments, the number of timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers, our ability to remain in compliance with key agreements with customers, lenders, and government agencies, changes in general economic and/or industry-specific conditions, and other factors as contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC including the Form 10-Q we will file on Monday. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings, and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG\u2019s financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials. And we advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website. And now, I'll turn the call over to Rich Corrado, our President and CEO, for his opening comments.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Joe, and welcome, everyone. I think it's fair to say that ATSG made significant progress during the second quarter this year. Our businesses across the board improved from the first quarter. Our adjusted earnings and EBITDA exceeded our own targets and many of yours. We leased three more Boeing 767-300 freighters to external customers in the quarter on top of the five we added in the first quarter. That's halfway to our 2021 goal that half way to our 2021 goal of at least 16 new leases this year. 7 of the 11 767s we promised to Amazon this year are now in the air and we're flying one that Amazon owns itself and has assigned to us. Our airlines rang up 26% more cargo block hours during the quarter versus a year ago and 11% more than in the first quarter. COVID-19 is still affecting our airlines, passenger and combi operations. But the effect on our recurring passenger operations is less than it was in the first quarter. We're ahead of the pace we set for achieving our 2021 guidance for adjusted EBITDA which remains at least $525 million. We've assumed that the second half would be stronger than the first and that's what we intend to deliver. I'll have more to say about outlook shortly. Quint Turner, our CFO is ready to review our second quarter numbers. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks Rich, and welcome to everyone on the call this morning. On a consolidated basis, our revenues were up a solid 8% to $410 million in the second quarter. The principal factors were more leases and more air express flying particularly for our customers Amazon and DHL. Our GAAP earnings of $80 million or $1.17 per share basic were strongly positive versus a year ago when a $110 million non-cash loss from revaluing more liabilities offset our positive operating results. We also recorded $30 million in second quarter after tax benefits from federal pandemic relief assistance under the payroll support program versus $8 million in the second quarter last year. Results for the second quarter last year also included a $39 million charge to write down aircraft asset values primarily related to four 757 freighters that have been retired. Three of those four were sold in July. On an adjusted basis, our second quarter earnings were $4 million lower than a year ago at $28 million or $0.35 per share diluted. But they are up $50 million from the first quarter. The primary driver of the decline in adjusted earnings versus last year's second quarter was decrease passenger revenues from our airlines due to pandemic effects. Our adjusted earnings exclude among other items, the effects of quarterly mark-to-market changes in the value of warrants and other financial instruments, as well as pandemic related government grants to our airlines. The diluted share count used to calculate adjusted earnings per share for both the second quarter of 2021 and year ago period, reflect Amazon's decision to cash exercise warrants in May of this year. Interest expense decreased $1 million for the quarter, rates on our credit facility balances and lower debt levels overall were principal factors. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $7 million for the quarter for more aircraft in service. Our adjusted EBITDA was $128 million, $2 million higher than a year ago. That is also up a solid $22 million from the first quarter. On a segment basis, our aircraft leasing business CAM performed very well. CAM\u2019s pretax earnings increased 15% for the quarter to $23 million. CAM owns 56 Boeing 767 300 freighter aircraft in service as of June 30, up from 40 a year earlier. CAM completed the modification of two feedstocks 767 to freighters during the quarter. CAM bought eight 767-300 feedstock aircraft for conversion during the quarter. That brought the total 767 purchases to 12 for the first half. Because of continued strong leasing demand, CAM now expects to acquire five more 767s in the second half, along with its first Airbus A321-200. Revenues for our ACMI Services segment which includes our two cargo airlines and Omni Air, our passenger airline, decreased $14 million during the second quarter to $273 million. We had a surge of charter demand at Omni last year when the pandemic shut down scheduled carriers. Those higher margin flights drove strong results for Omni in the second and third quarter a year ago. Since then, passenger charter opportunities have declined but military flying has rebounded from the first quarter. Billable block hours were up 12% overall. On a GAAP basis, pre-tax earnings for ACMI Services totaled $45 million during the second quarter, up from $30 million a year ago. Excluding federal grants realized in each period, earnings were $6 million, down $13 million. On a sequential basis, ACMI Services earnings excluding grants improved by $13 million from our first quarter results due principally to additional flying for express package networks. Omni Air has received $83 million in federal payroll support payments this year. These funds require Omni to refrain from involuntary furloughs of its flight crews and other personnel at least through this September. Our earnings on the other activities line were $3 million, a sharp improvement from a year ago and were driven by more fuel sales and gateway services. Additionally, maintenance operations for external customers were positive for the quarter. As we said in our release, the combination of our add-on notes offering bank credit facility amendment and cash from Amazon's warrant exercise strengthened an already strong balance sheet during the quarter. We were able to pay off our $615 million term loan balance early while also increasing our revolver capacity. These changes give us significant access to capital going forward, maximize flexibility by reducing secured debt and extend our maturities at favorable long-term fixed rates. We ended the quarter with a total debt to trailing EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.4 times under our credit agreement. With that summary of our financial and operating results for the quarter, I'll turn it back to Rich for some comments on our outlook. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint. ATSG\u2019s business as we like to say begins with the aircraft lease. It's the foundation for everything that comes after and the source of our incredible power to generate long-term cash flows. Demand for our leased mid-sized freighter Boeing 767s continues to be very strong as reflected by CAM's 18% revenue growth and growing lease order backlog. The pandemic continues to affect passenger travel, so we're fortunate that the vast majority of our cash flows stemmed from the cargo side. Our cargo airlines performed especially well in the second quarter generating good growth from busier schedules and expansion as some trans-Atlantic routes for DHL. We expect our ACMI services segment to continue to improve during the second half. That improvement will continue to depend on the restoration of revenue streams that the pandemic has curtailed but also operating efficiencies at our airlines. As we issued guidance of at least $525 million for adjusted EBITDA this year, we noted that our plan called for it to generate approximately 43% or about $225 million of the total in the first half. We ended the half a bit better than that. Our strong second quarter leaves me increasingly confident that we can exceed our own expectations. In the meantime, our freighter leasing and flight operations for air express networks are growing at double-digit rates. We're on track with an aggressive schedule to lease at least 16 767-300 freighters this year and at least 10 have already been specifically assigned to customers in 2022, including the multi-aircraft lease deployments to Amerijet, Star Air in Europe, and MasAir in Mexico, and the last of a four-aircraft lease order from DHL. Separately we're also deploying three returned 767-200 freighters this year under five-year leases to Raya Airways, Star Air and SkyTaxi. We're currently stacked with orders for customers who want to lease freighters from us as soon as we can get them. That's why we've decided to accelerate the expansion of our footprint in the dedicated cargo aircraft market first and foremost by acquiring more seven 767 feedstock to supply customers with freighters next year, but also by expanding into additional freighter types. We have accelerated our plans for CAM to add its first Airbus A321 freighter to its lease portfolio with lease deployments next year of at least three aircrafts. When available for lease, our A321 will offer a large standard payload along with an operator-friendly design and will be equipped with engines that deliver fuel efficiency comparable to the most popular Boeing 737 models. We have agreed to purchase our first three A321 aircraft. One this year and two in 2022, put them through the conversion process at our PEMCO facilities in Tampa and then make them available for lease next year. We're also pursuing additional A321s for purchase next year. At the same time, we are making plans to extend our leadership position as the world's largest lessor of mid-sized freighter aircraft by adding another platform for growth, one that will have operational synergies with the A321. We recently acquired rights to 20 Airbus A330 conversion slots from Germany's EFW for aircraft that would begin conversion between mid-2023 through the end of 2025. While the 767-300 will remain our primary mid-sized freighter growth engine for many years to come, we also see the A330 as an attractive platform with customer appeal and fleet synergies with the A321. We don't anticipate investing in A330 feedstock until 2023. While we believe securing convergence slots to be a wise investment, allowing us to continue to grow a leasing portfolio an attractive return targets while diversifying our lease options to customers. In fact, across three different aircraft types, we currently have right to 67 freighter conversion slots with induction gate starting in 2022 through the end of 2025. As you can see, we remain bullish on future opportunities in our cargo leasing space. With our devotion to service quality and expanding scope of service offerings, we anticipate CAM and our cargo airlines to remain the principal source for the mid-sized freighter capacity and flight support that our customers will require for the e-commerce-driven networks. That concludes our prepared remarks. Quint and I, along with Mike Berger, our Chief Commercial Officer, are ready to ready to answer questions. May we have the first question, operator?\nOperator:  We have our first question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead, sir.\nJack Atkins: So, I guess, Rich or Quint, if we could go back just to the guidance for a moment. The at least $525 million of EBITDA for this year, Rich, as you noted you're running ahead of plan through the first half of the year. Well, what's preventing you from maybe raising that floor as we sort of think about the full year? Is it just some uncertainty around the pace of recovery with military flying just given the Delta variant ramping up or sort of -- could you walk us through that kind of thought process?\nRich Corrado: Yeah. I think Jack, we built some efficiencies in some already anticipated customer business coming back. A good example is one of Omni\u2019s best customers vacation Hawaii is scheduled to start flying again in September. And they've been selling tickets and they're ready to ramp up their business again. And that's plan to start September. That's part of our guidance. And so we -- when we look at that business as we sit here today, it's scheduled to go. But the Delta variant is apparently still growing around the country. So we felt that given some of the still uncertainty around the pandemic that it was more prudent, and we're real confident we're going to hit our $525 million -- at least $525 million guidance number. But we thought it would be more prudent to not change guidance but we thought it would be more prudent to not change guidance at this time. We will revisit that in next quarters call see if it makes sense to do given what we\u2019ll know then about the pandemic.\nMike Berger: Yeah. And Jack as you know part of that of course is also military passing your client.\nJack Atkins:\nRich Corrado: And at least to \u2212 the current date subsequent to second quarter it's been \u2212 it's continued to be good. So, we're optimistic as you say that we -- we\u2019ll finish above the $525 million but as Rich says you've still got the Delta variant uncertainty that kind of keeps us from being able to give a more precise number at this time.\nJack Atkins: That makes sense. And I think everyone understands that, so just thanks for the color on that. And I guess kind of shifting gears with the commentary around the 67 the right to 67 conversion slots that you talked about a moment ago and it was disclosed in the release last night. As you think about matching those 67 with customer indications of interest. How many of those 67 convergence lives would you say you feel pretty comfortable or spoken for at this point? Is there kind of way to quantify that?\nRich Corrado: I think we've got great visibility for 2022 into 2023 where we were real confident and everything that comes out of conversion and paint will go right into lease.\nJack Atkins: Okay.\nRich Corrado: When you get out to 2024 we've got folks that are talking to us and want airplanes during that time but we're not into LOIs or anything like that given that far out. The new platforms we've got excellent interest in them. It's one of the reasons that we want to talk about it, that we've got strong interest in those. Still are -- the Boeing 767 remains our flagship backbone. And we've got commitments on all of our aircraft coming out in 2022 as well as 2023 is significantly down as well.\nJack Atkins: Okay.\nRich Corrado: So when you look at years past, we wouldn't be able to say we've got one to two years out locked up as far as customers looking for airplanes. But it's certainly a different market today which is great. So we're looking to capitalize on that. We believe that what's fueling it is the e-commerce growth around the world. And if you look at the market penetration of e-commerce, it's still small into general retail. And that will -- that growth will continue to happen and continue to expand that market. There are parts of the market that are in their infancy. One is cross-border e-commerce. And that's one where barriers are being worked on to come down. Things like banking to do cross-border transactions. Customs clearance to do cross-border transactions are still a little clunky. So when those -- as those barriers come down, that will accelerate the cross-border side of that. Of course, cross-border generally means airplanes.\nQuint Turner: And remember too, Jack, that the CapEx for a significant amount of slots will be committed to at a later date as we get even more precise visibility on specific demand.\nJack Atkins: Sure.\nQuint Turner: But certainly securing the slots based on having an order visibility that's really good into 2023 I think is a good decision.\nMike Berger: Yeah. Just to maybe give you a little bit more detail around what Rich was referring to and why we're so bullish on the growth piece of it. When you look at e-commerce and m-commerce -- if you look at a country like India, for example, less than 7% of their total retail sales is e-commerce and they get 25% growth last year. Latin America has 63% but yet it was still only 4.7% of their overall retail sales. So if you think about where our customers are and where we've looked to incrementally grow our existing customers as well as new customers when you started thinking about Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia and certainly Mexico and Latin and Central America where not only we\u2019ve develop new customers but we also have existing customers. That's why we're very prudent as we look out to 2024 and 2025. Rich mentioned that our order book for 2022 is full and we're almost full for 2023. So we're real confident the 2024 and 2025 will continue especially when we see what they -- where the volume and the engine is and as we continue to be an enabler for e-commerce throughout the world.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Fantastic. Last question and I'll turn it over. I believe part of your DHL contract comes up for renewal next year especially around some of those 762s. Where are you in discussions around an extension there? Anything you could share about it? I know you're probably hesitant to talk about specific customer but I think that is an area of interest for investors. I would imagine given the demand for aircraft in the market right now it should be a fairly favorable conversation. Would just be curious to begin a base on that?\nRich Corrado: Well, I can I can address the -- maybe the return piece of that. We have taken our two 767-200s back already from DHL in the Middle East. And you heard in Rich\u2019s comments that we redeploy those. We will have those out on lease one for SkyTaxi which will be delivered actually this week in a five-year lease. And the second one is right behind that in terms of being going under a C check that will go out to Raya. That's completely under agreement. So those first two returns that came back from DHL in the Middle East will go right back into service on five year leases. In regards to the upcoming agreements that are coming up for renewal in April of 2022, we're very confident at this point that we'll see renewals on both the aircraft side as well as the CMI side.\nMike Berger: In fact, we believe, Jack, that we'll be expanding the operating side of the equation with DHL in the United States. If you recall ABX was our main airline that flies for DHL in the US. We got the CBA contract with the pilots done in December to be effective in January. That's really done a lot to give us growth opportunities for that airline. And so as we're working with DHL and going through both the extension of the leases in the US and the extension of the operating agreement in the US, it's really been beneficial to us. So we're looking forward to getting that done and expanded. Hopefully we announce it by the end of this year.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Fantastic. That's great news. Thanks for the time, guys.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Frank Galanti with Stifel.\nFrank Galanti: Good morning. So I guess I want to follow up on Jack's question on 67 slots. Can you just give us on the 67 slots. Can you just give a sense for the financial obligations for taking those slots, and then kind of how fixed they are? Should there be kind of a weaker demand in those kind of out years?\nRich Corrado: There's a deposit because naturally, you're tying up the conversion house from marketing that slot and they're trying to make plans in advance. So there's a deposit. It's a relatively -- it's not a material deposit in relationship to the end of service cost of the asset. And that is the amount that would be I guess at risk if somehow you didn't fill the slot. Of course, there would be an opportunity to move the slot to another supplier or another converter if you needed to. So, I think it's a confidence statement about where we see that the market demand over the long-term. And with the additional platforms we'll have on top of the 767, we feel very comfortable that it's a prudent commitment to make.\nFrank Galanti: Okay. Now that's really helpful. Kind of switching gears a little bit to the Omni business, excuse me. Can you have a sense of geographic mix for that business and what -- I guess how those are faring from, just generally? And then is there a way to kind of quantify what Omni was generating from like an EBITDA earnings perspective, pre-pandemic? And kind of what is the run rate of that business relative to that?\nRich Corrado: Yeah. We don\u2019t -- other than our report -- reportable segments which was Omni\u2019s and ACMI Services segment, we don't breakdown individual entities in terms of their profitability, Frank, and the reason we don't is because they have some customer concentration within their book of business. And so we don't necessarily want to talk specifically for commercial reasons about the individual subsidiaries. I can't -- I can tell you that in terms of the passenger hours operated, we saw certainly improvements, significant improvement in the second quarter. All of our packs flying and that would include not only Omni, but the Combi, 757 Combi that ATI operates, the -- on an hour's flown basis, those were up 17% over our first quarter level which you know now to give you a sense of where we stand through the first half, we're looking at down -- well that was down 8% versus the prior year still in the quarter. But versus the prior first half, we were off 28% in terms of total passenger hours. So you can see a moat, the big drop was in the first quarter, second quarter recovering, up 17% over the first quarter run rate. And of course, we're expecting continued improvement as we move through the second half in our passenger operations.\nFrank Galanti: Okay. That's great. And one last one if I could, just trying to back into kind of a core free cash flow number from keeping the planes in the air and the business running. Can you give us an estimate for maintenance CapEx number at the current fleet size and then maybe way to think about that as the fleet grows over time?\nQuint Turner: Yeah if you think about maintenance CapEx in terms of this year's guidance and we're guiding it. As you know, we adjusted our total CapEx estimate up to around $550 million. You're probably looking at around $160 million or so of that as maintenance CapEx and that includes required heavy maintenance on the airplanes. It includes -- and things like engine overhauls to support the fleet. As we grow the fleet, we don't expect the maintenance CapEx to grow significantly. And the reason for that is because with our business model, the lessee maintains the asset during the life of the leaks and typically, it is returned in a like-for-like sort of maintenance condition as it was at the start of the lease. And so, that transfers that responsibility to the lessee under the lease. Our maintenance CapEx we have is, a lot of it is tied to aircraft that we lease internally to our affiliated airlines and those assets are used to support the CMI flying and so forth. And that's not growing as rapidly as the external lease deployments that CAM has make, which is what we're spending the majority of our CapEx on.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have our next question from Stephanie Moore with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nStephanie Moore: Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the A330. I'd love to get your thoughts in terms of potential customers for those planes. I think we talked in the past, the A321s are a nice replacement for the Boeing 757 and that represents a large really addressable market for conversion or replacement over time. So, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the A330s maybe as well as some of the economics and how does those -- it compares to the A321s or the Boeing 767. Thanks.\nRich Corrado: That's great question, Stephanie. Thank you for asking it. A couple of things. We've been looking at the A330 for a few years and one of the things about the A330, there's two variances. A330-200 and a A330-300 that have conversion opportunities for them. The A330-200 is about the same size of the 767-300. It's a little bit more expensive feedstock and it's get some higher operating costs because it's a heavier airplane. It's got great range but it's not something you need in an express environment. The A330-300 is slightly bigger than the 767-300. It's got about a 20% higher cube and about an 8%, 8% to 10% higher weight carrying capability. In the express environment where these mid-range freighters, midsize, medium-wide body freighters tend to be a solution for, cube is much more important than weight. So the A330-300 looks to be a real solid solution for the same customers that the 767 is providing service for today. It's a newer generation aircraft. So, I think it came out in 1996, mid-1990s, the Boeing 767 came out in the early 1980s. And so when you look at feedstock capability going into the future into the next decade, there'll be more prevalent feedstock coming available as the Boeing 767 over the next decade starts to wind down. So we look at it as a both a replacement and then it also has a little bit higher queue for line-haul operations, so going from country to country. As far as customers goes, we've got three customers that are already engaged in the airplane. DHL, I think is one of the largest users in the world of Airbus A330 freighters. And so hopefully there'll be a customer of ours in the future. We've got other customers that we're talking to about the aircraft. Now one of the other significant events that's occurred as a result of the pandemic is feedstock values for the Airbus A330 have come down significantly both -- it depends on which appraisal you listen to but pretty much the two or three that I've read is in the 25% range. And that was one of the key things that when we looked at the plane, it was more expensive and therefore the total cost of ownership and operating was higher than what the Boeing 767 could deliver. So we think when we thought at the time that it was going to be a good solution in the future when the economics made sense and with the feedstock coming down, going forward with the newer generation basis of the airplane, that we think it's going to be a solution that's going to be a long-term solution in the medium-wide body segment.\nMike Berger: Rich, the only thing maybe I'd give you a little bit more detail. There's a couple of hundred airplanes that are in the prime age area that you talked about from 13 to 25, they represent very good opportunities to be converted into freighters. The other reason we really like the 330 is that Omni can potentially expand into the large category to operate for the DOD which is something that we don't have the ability to do today. So, we're excited about that potential opportunity with our Omni organization, as well as with our omni-organization as well as all the other customers that Rich referenced prior as well.\nRich Corrado: Yeah. We do have the B777s with Omni Air today. But Mike I think\u2026\nMike Berger: Right.\nRich Corrado: \u2026what you\u2019re saying Mike is that this would be additive to the large part.\nMike Berger: Yeah. And the last thing obviously is it's a great synergy with our A321. So we have a kind of a multiple aircraft solution for the same customers that we have today in the -- for the Boeing 767-300. The A330 and A321 have a common cockpit. And so what that means is small differences training does need to be done to move a pilot between the A321 and the A330, much smaller than having to go get a full new type rating for a different aircraft type. So it's a smaller effort. And so there\u2019s significant crew savings and the synergy with that. And thinking like an airline, even though we're a leasing company, we think it's a really good solution to add to the coming A321 and for the future of the medium wide body leadership that we hold.\nStephanie Moore: Got it. No, that's very helpful. And then just broadly speaking, I'd love to hear your thoughts on really contract profitability and maybe ROIC pre versus post pandemic just given there's so much increased demand, increased e-commerce. Any color you can provide there would be helpful. Thank you.\nRich Corrado: Couple of things. One is the lease rates is definitely hardened. And so that plays out in a couple of different perspectives. So when we're negotiating with new customers or for new airplanes for existing customers, it's pretty much we're -- we've got a better negotiating position. The other thing is any lease that's coming on or that's coming due most of them tend to be extended or we are flipping them right over once they get through a maintenance event to a new lessee because the demand is so significant. A lot of airlines that we lease to right now that have assets coming due between now and the end of next year, they're already talking to us about extending those. And so folks that have capacity now don't want to let it go. So the high demand is good for our existing leases for extensions. The other piece of that is most of them are extending at existing lease rates, and we\u2019re actually in position to get better lease rates. Usually, on the leasing side, when you go through your second and third extension on a lease, you start to -- the lease rate starts to go down a little bit. But now we're seeing them hold up on extensions.\nOperator:  And we'll take our next question from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna. Please go ahead, sir.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. So, Rich, Quint, it sounds like you have a fair degree of high confidence, if you will, in translating these 67 slots to actually putting the aircraft in service. So, as we think about potential EBITDA earnings through the recovery, is it fair to say that you have 120 aircraft in active fleet at year-end? Could we see by 2025 north of a fleet of 180 aircraft in service? And then also thinking about the recovery, there's a lot of puts and takes here, right, because eventually longhaul belly capacity is going to come back on line. At the same time, you're DoD and passenger utilization should go up. So, could we do better through the recovery as we get towards 2025 assuming you fill out these slots here with actual aircraft? Could we do better than $5 million in annual EBITDA per aircraft over that period? Thanks.\nRich Corrado: Yes, certainly, could we be above $180 million in that time frame or somewhere in that zip code, Chris? Yes, we believe that's true. In terms of EBITDA contribution per tail, we think of it more in terms of return on invested capital. Right? And we believe that as we build the fleet out, we will maintain the sort of attractive returns we get today on our dry lease investments on our hard aircraft investments. And as Rich described a minute ago with the current demand environment, it's actually doing a good job of supporting higher lease rates. So, we hope to even add to that return on the asset investment. As you know, our business model provides an opportunity for incremental returns for building services around the lease. And so in our case, it also depends of course on opportunities to provide other services to the lessee, which may be as we do for DHL and Amazon sort of the full range of services or it could be some portion there, like just the maintenance etcetera. So, we certainly believe that our returns in this strong demand environment can return or -- excuse me, can improve over what we've seen historically. And we we're taking these steps because we think we'll certainly maintain or improve upon the returns on capital that we get for our leased assets already.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you. And then my second question, so the question I get a lot from investors lately is, why the stock isn't working this year? It's down around 19% in what's a very constructive market for freighter demand because of all the competing belly capacities effectively sideline. So one of the areas in addition to folks asking about USDOD contribution to EBITDA is, why not participate in the charter market or short-term missions if there's an opportunity here to grab some rate, or perhaps just -- I don't know if you can. I mean you have such a full order book here if it's an issue allocating a few assets here to shorter-term missions. It's just that if where consensus is that this long haul international passenger travel is not coming back for 2023 it would seem rates are going to stay high and there could be an opportunity here to potentially overearn here through the recovery. Thanks.\nRich Corrado: So we've pretty much had a tenant that for a $30 million asset it\u2019s a much better long-term commercial structure to get a 10-year, 8-year lease on that for the first lease and have that strong long-term cash flow than to put the aircraft on our own airline certificate and fly in a charter market. Now, the pandemic has obviously made the demand perspective on that market different. But eventually that will come back in line. I will tell you we have taken advantage of several charter opportunities. We put an airplane up for DHL between Hong Kong and Sydney last year and we\u2019ve put two or three other international routes, we take airplanes that we\u2019re flying the domestic network and are still linking to their CVG domestic network but are flying internationally to support their efforts. So, we have gotten more block hours related to that. We tend not to have excess capacity airplanes on our airline certificate other than what we need to cover our own maintenance or meet our commitments to the DoD on the cargo side. And again, we just think long-term it's a better use of that asset to get the longer term consistent cash flows out of it versus putting it in a charter environment where we'll get in this case maybe we'll get a year and a half of robust usage but then we'd be back in a situation where we'd be getting into an intermittent usage on that both on the crew deployment standpoint and the asset standpoint. Generally in the past when we've had situations like that we've taken the airplane and lease it. So, we think that long-term we've got the right strategy.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. If I could just get one more here and for the quarter where were your utilization or block hours per aircraft day on the DoD and the commercial flights? Thanks.\nRich Corrado: Well, as I said in terms of the majority of our DoD flight is passenger and the Combi and the packs all of our packs and our Combi flying were up 17% over the first quarter, that's still down about 8% over the prior year during the quarter. That gives you a sense but for the first six months those same For the first six months, those same staffs are up 28%. So, that shows you the recovery in the second quarter relative to the first. A 17% improvement over the first quarter levels. So, versus the prior year in the second quarter, we\u2019re down 8% in total packs flying. And that then includes a 17% sequential improvement over the first quarter.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Rich Corrado for closing remarks.\nRich Corrado: Thank you. Our latest commitments to convert and lease more mid-sized freighters over the next several years should make one thing perfectly clear. We expect e-commerce and other forces driving demand for our aircraft today will persist well into the future. Our employees at all over, all levels believe that as well. And they have continued to deliver superior service during this time. And they're working together to extend our leadership in this key market. I am proud to lead them and I'm confident that their hard work will yield superior rewards for those who choose to invest with us. Thank you and stay safe.\nOperator: And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-05-10 01:01:23", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Quarter One 2021 Air Transport Services Group, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jenny. I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Joe Payne, Chief Legal Officer. Mr. Payne, you may begin.\nJoe Payne: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website, atsginc.com. Let me begin by advising you that during the course of this call, we will make projections and other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based upon information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call. Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes.\nRich Corrado: Thanks Joe and welcome, everyone. I want to begin by commending our employees who continue to provide our customers with reliable, efficient service in any conditions, even under the added safety procedures that remain in place arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. I also want to celebrate with you and our employees several pieces of good news we have received over the last few weeks. The first, in March, was Amazon's decision to exercise for cash the warrants it holds to purchase approximately 13.6 million ATSG shares. Amazon will pay ATSG $132 million to purchase those shares, in addition to the 866,000 ATSG shares that are recently acquired in a cashless exercise. We expect to complete those transactions tomorrow. At that point, Amazon will become our largest shareholder, holding shares representing about 19.5% of those outstanding as well as being a principal customer of ATSG.\nQuint Turner: Thanks Rich and welcome to everyone on the call this morning. On a consolidated basis, our revenues were down 3% to 376 million in the first quarter. The principal factor was less passenger flying, mainly at Omni, but also from ATI's combi operation. Our fourth first quarter GAAP earnings of $42 million or $0.71 per share basic were also down but primarily due to a $101 million swing in our noncash gain from revaluing our liability for Amazon warrants, which was $108 million in the first quarter a year ago versus 7 million this year. We also recorded 22 million in first quarter after-tax benefits from federal pandemic relief assistance under the Payroll Support Program versus no such benefits in the first quarter last year. Our first quarter earnings on an adjusted basis were $14 million lower than a year ago at 15 million or $0.19 per share diluted.\nRich Corrado: Thanks Quint. Entering the first quarter this year, we knew we faced a tough comparison with the same period last year. In early 2020, as the pandemic was just beginning to affect the US, Omni flew several special missions to move military and civilian groups away from COVID hotspots and completed other rapid response missions for the federal government. ATI's combi and 757 freighter fleets were still generating good returns, and our aircraft maintenance facilities were humming with passenger aircraft work for scheduled airlines. When we issued guidance of $525 million for adjusted EBITDA in 2021, we noted that our plan called for us to generate only 43% or 225 million of the total in the first half. If you assume that we would generate more of the 225 million in the second quarter than the first, we were actually not far from the pace that we projected. In the meantime, our freighter leasing and flight operations for air express networks are growing at double-digit rates. We are on track with our aggressive schedule to lease at least 16 767-300 freighters this year and at least 10 already targeted for 2022, a 11 to go into Amazon this year, and at least five others are expected to be leased to other airlines, including Northern Air Cargo, Amerijet, Air Canada and DHL. We're also scheduled to deploy three returned 767-200 freighters under five-year leases to Raya Airways, Star Air and SkyTaxi. I mentioned last time that in addition to the 7 million to 8 million in higher wage and benefit costs this year from the amendment to the CBA with our ABX pilots, we are also incurring higher software costs under the continuous improvement processes that we launched last year. These investments are already beginning to yield benefits and will result in improved flight performance and more predictable maintenance requirements. We expect our ACMI Services segment to improve, particularly in the second half. That will depend on the restoration of revenue streams the pandemic has reduced, but also efficiencies that help us mitigate the incremental payroll costs at our airlines.\nOperator: Thank you.  And our first question comes from Jack Atkins from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Great. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my questions.\nRich Corrado: Good morning, Jack.\nJack Atkins: So I guess just to start, and Rich, going back to your prepared comments there at the end, it sounds like the first quarter played out roughly in line with your budget. Is the plan still, Quint, to have 43% of the expected EBITDA this year in the first half of the year? And then I guess more broadly, Rich, can you sort of talk about whether you're gaining some incremental visibility around passenger flying with Omni in the second half of the year, just given it seems like the reopening of the broader economy is going perhaps a bit better than expected?\nQuint Turner: Yeah. Jack, I'll go first. I guess the - in terms of the plan, you're right. We have not changed our full year guidance. And the first quarter came in very, very close to what we had projected in our budget. So that wading that you described with the back half loaded EBITDA is still the plan. And it all is tied into the effects of the pandemic on the passenger side, as we said in February. So really, nothing's changed in that regard.\nRich Corrado: In regard - Jack, to your question regarding what we're seeing in the recovery of the passenger operations, since the end of the quarter, we have seen an uptick. So we're optimistic that it's going to remain on the plan that we focused on when we gave our guidance. And so if I look at Omni as an example in April and through most of May was pretty close to its 2019 levels. So last year we look at as a very unusual year for Omni because of the recovery flights that they ended up getting, and they didn't have much of a dip in their business, other than the commercial stuff that went away toward the end of the first quarter. And they actually outperformed what they did the year prior because of all the supplemental flights they were getting to get folks out of COVID hotspots and things like that and some additional governmental flying. So it was a very unusual year last year for Omni. And this year, we - they seem to be responding as we had planned.\nJack Atkins: There's no doubt, 2020 will go down as an unusual year. So that's great to hear that things are progressing along with your plan. I guess, maybe, shifting gears, Rich, kind of thinking about demand for that 767 freighter assets. You mentioned an additional plane this year versus your plan three months ago and an additional contract for 2022. I guess when you think about what customers are coming to you and asking for now as they sort of look out at their capacity needs over the next several years, are you seeing any indication from customers that are maybe they're looking to create, not to the same size of what Amazon has put together here, but maybe create their own sort of captive express networks, just given how tight capacity is, and how tight it's likely going to stay for some time?\nRich Corrado: Yeah. I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, a lot of the customers that we lease airplanes to, particularly in other parts of the world, predominantly fly for other express carriers. And so they're responding to the needs of the larger express carriers in some respects. I would say there's a few of them that are - have long-term plans for multiple aircraft over several years, and I think we talked about this on prior calls. And that's something we haven't seen before. And so in places like Mexico, Malaysia, we're seeing multiyear demand for freighters to support the growth that they're seeing. Now we haven't seen any kind of non-transportation companies step up and want to put up a network like Amazon did, and we don't perceive that there is anyone with that type of scale, at least on the domestic side, to be able to do that. So the demand profile - it has changed over the past year significantly, as we've talked about before, to where airlines are more comfortable ordering aircraft over multiple years as opposed to just giving us an order for like one or two planes this year or next year. And that's - like I said, that's an unusual phenomenon for us.\nMike Berger: Hey, Jack, it's Mike. I just would add to that - and you made note - you made reference to in your comments that the US economy seems to be coming back a little bit better and faster than most thought. And certainly, passenger traffic in this country is coming back very nicely, not the case, obviously, from an international perspective. And when you think about the growth and where we're seeing growth outside from a global perspective, international flights, specifically from the larger hubs, those schedules remain very soft. And all the analysts expect the international passenger flights to continue to stay that way out to 2023, '24. Why is that important? Well, Rich made reference to who's after all this capacity, the major integrators out there. And they're moving time-definite products, right? That's what they're selling. So as those demands continue to drive the growth, they've got to make sure the connectivity is in place. And without the flying of the passenger planes, they've got to control that capacity, and that's why we think the global strength is going to continue.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Thank you for that, Mike. That makes sense. I guess for my last question before I turn it over. Rich, I would just be curious to know how you and the board are thinking about priorities for your cash and your capital. You've got this additional cash coming in the door, I guess, tomorrow from Amazon. You just did a successful refi of some of your debt. I mean the stock is trading at a fairly low multiple here relative to the broader market. How are you thinking about just the priorities for that capital, either organic, inorganic growth? And then at what point can you maybe be more aggressive buying back stock, especially at this valuation?\nRich Corrado: Yeah, Jack. Well, part of our participation in the CARES program and the - receiving funds to support the passenger airlines, there's some limitations on what we can do with our capital in terms of buybacks and in terms of other things. And so we're - right now, for the proceeds from the bond and the Amazon purchase of shares, we're looking to pay down our revolver and reduce our debt - our cost of debt short term. And we're always looking for alternative things that we could invest in. But right now, we've got a full plate of investment in aircraft going forward, for which we have customers waiting. And so when looking at that and the growth that we've produced over the years and the returns that we've produced over the years in terms of acquiring, converting and leasing assets, we believe that's the strongest return that we could provide to our shareholders for the next year and a half, if you will, until we're able to have a little bit more flexibility with our capital plan. I don't know, Quint, if you have a comment?\nQuint Turner: Yeah. I'd just kind of echo that, Jack. We - as Rich said, the payroll support program ties the company up a little bit there for a period of time on buybacks and so forth, but that certainly has always been part of the potential capital allocation that we've considered with the discretionary cash flow that the business model produces. The good news is we're signing up these long-term multiyear agreements that we've talked about with the leases. And as you know, the leverage of the company with the cash inflows that we talked about, the Amazon warrants were likely to be levered not much over two times by the end of the year. And so as we enter next year, the discretionary cash flow that we'll have available to allocate to create value is, yield-wise, it's something like a 15% discretionary cash flow yield. So it's - we'll have attractive options next year. And certainly, the robust demand for freighter aircraft is going to remain one of those. But the good news is it's not a mutually exclusive choice, right? You can create value through allocating capital in a lot of ways. And all those will be on the table for us next year as we clear those restrictions on the payroll support plan.\nJack Atkins: Okay. That's great. Thanks so much for the time, guys. Really appreciate it.\nQuint Turner: Thanks Jack.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. I just have two questions. So on the A321 conversion, how are you thinking about the shift to - I mean I know, I guess, probably more than a year away. But how are you thinking about the shift away from A320 - from 767s to A321s? And are there differences in the process timeline, cost to do it versus the 767? Can you just talk a little bit about the difference between these two?\nRich Corrado: Sure. So first off, thanks for asking the question because it gives us an opportunity to talk about the A321. We're really happy that the STC was just approved. And so we are, in fact, starting up a conversion line at PEMCO. PEMCO has an agreement with 321 Precision, our joint venture, to do conversions, which is a separate revenue stream. So we'll make money on the kits and on the royalties, on the STC, and then PEMCO will make money converting the airplane. And that's an airplane that - the first one that goes into PEMCO in June is actually not an ATSG or CAM aircraft. It's just a third party that we're able to generate revenue and profit on. Our plan is to acquire A321s ourselves, convert them at PEMCO and then lease them to the same customers, the same types of customers, if you will, that have been taking 767-300s. The A321 is a fantastic airplane for express operators. It can compete with both the 737-800 and offers a great opportunity for replacement in the 757-200, which up until about a year and a half ago, was the most prolific express aircraft in the networks of the large FedEx, UPS, DHL express operators. And so when you look at that, it really gives us a nice platform. I will say it's not - we're not going to transition from the 76 to the A321. The A321 represents an incremental platform for ATSG. So we'll be doing both. We've got a plan to - from an acquisition standpoint and a leasing standpoint, to produce both 767-300s and A321s at the same time. So in - as far as how that is going to flow will depend on our ability to secure feedstock. We're in the market now for A321s. We're negotiating, in fact, for some aircraft right now, and we'll see how that goes. Obviously, as we have approached the 767-300, we look to get a line of aircraft, kind of a fleet segment that we can have deliveries produced to us over multiple years, and we're going to continue to look for that. As far as the economics of the aircraft, you think about it this way, it's about two-thirds of the investment when you talk about buying the feedstock, C-Check conversion, paint, et cetera. So it's about two thirds of the cost investment that you would have on the 767-300. And so the lease rate on that would, commensurate be about two-thirds. And so that's the way to think about how we're investing and generating revenue off the aircraft.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's helpful. Is there - do we have to think about it like an OEM would? Is there like a number you have to do to break even on the investment to go - having gone through the whole process to get the STC and so on?\nRich Corrado: Well, a couple of things. One is, as far as the joint venture goes, right, the joint venture is - we've invested the money to develop the STC, and you want to look for return on that individual investment. As it relates to that, then yes, thinking about it in that way is probably as close to the way it should be thought of in terms of, we're going to get revenue from the royalties and the kits going forward, and how many royalties and kits do you need to sell to get return on what both parties have invested in the joint venture. But the rest of the revenue streams, and the rest of the investment, and the rest of the profit that generates on the A321 is additional. It's supplemental. It's not really related to that scenario. It's the great thing about our business model. All the things that we do, whether it's leasing, whether it's engine leasing, whether it's MRO, C-Checks, line maintenance, logistics around the aircraft, load, unload, all the things that we do to add value and significantly differentiate ourselves from any other operator on the - any other leasing company in the world, we're going to wrap those services around that airplane and hope to produce the same leadership position for the A321 that we hold currently for the 767-300.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.\nRich Corrado: Thanks Helane.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nRich Corrado: Hi, Chris.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So just digging into the guidance here, your express airline business is doing well. Block hours in the quarter were up 10% year-on-year, but - and your order book is filling out really nicely here. It just feels like there's perhaps some conservatism in the guidance for this year. And I realize that we're still not out of the woods yet with COVID. But is your baseline assumption that there isn't much improvement in commercial charter and military flying or looked at another way perhaps benefit from improving vaccination rates here in the US and globally?\nRich Corrado: Well, there's a couple of things that have impacted the way we've constructed our guidance. And one of them is, as it relates to the passenger flying, and where the revenue is, it's also - one of the other impacts of that in that area is cost. And so as an example, Omni, in providing similar service to the government is having to fly through airports that they don't normally fly through because of pandemic-related restrictions in other airports. And that has raised the cost. So it's not that the revenue and the flying may not be there, it's the cost profile is a little bit different. And so one of the things that Omni is doing and as the flying stabilizes, they're going back and trying to negotiate cost reductions in areas that - in airports that they know that they'll be flying through more consistently than they have in the past. So that's one thing. So the cost profile is a little bit different. There's other things on the express flying that aren't as visible. For example, when we - we had a major schedule change from one of our customers in the first quarter, and that required us to open several stations. We already knew we were going to be training pilots, more pilots to put in - put more aircraft online. But those are costs that are setup costs that are expenses but that won't be recurring as we move through the year. So there are things like that that we understand really well that will allow us to improve quarter-over-quarter going through the year. We're - we don't believe there's conservatism in our guidance right now. We're confident of the number. We've put a lot of thought. We understand the business, both on the freight side, on the leasing side. The one thing that's a little less predictable, of course, is the passenger side. And so we're keeping an eye on that closely. And as I indicated already, April looks to be on the plan that we had set at the beginning of the year.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then the active fleet, so based on the order book details in the press release, it looks like next year you're going to be at around 126 aircraft. It sounds like there's a lot of demand here for 767s. Could we get above 130 or potentially 135 planes by the end of next year?\nQuint Turner: The order book, we've talked about it. We're going to - we anticipate to at least deliver 16 this year. We - and that's up one from the guidance we gave last quarter. And our 2022, our communication was last quarter that we would do nine. We've upped that to 10, so we've increased it. We anticipate minimally to do 10 next year. And as Rich mentioned earlier, we have several orders beyond that into 2023 and '24. Supply chain issues and other potential things that might pop up, that's why we're at the numbers that we're at right now, at least 16 for this year and 10 for next year. So we've got slots, as we've always talked about. Conversion slots are at a premium this year and for the next several years, but we feel very good about the numbers that we have to ensure that we meet the demand that - and commitments we've made to our customers.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: And just a follow-up to that last point, have conversion costs gone up? And could you just kind of remind us what the cost is normally to convert a, say, 20-year vintage 767? Thanks.\nRich Corrado: Yeah. We've been doing business with IAI for decades, and we tend to - we negotiate long-term contracts that we just tag amendments on. So we don't generally adjust our pricing from year-to-year, other than it was already in that agreement. So there's no change, really, to the conversion cost. And generally, you're looking if there's C-Checks and there's paint and there's moving the airplane around, and not every conversion is the same due to the condition of the airframe that you're buying. And so if you look at - your acquisition cost is probably - is a little less than 50% of what your conversion costs would be, and conversion costs, these days, is running in about - with the C-Check and all the other added expenses - probably between $14 million to $15 million. And then you've got the acquisition on top of that and perhaps some other stuff. There's things like - sometimes, we'll have to upgrade the cockpit, sometimes we won't, right, those types of things. Every aircraft is a little bit different.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thanks for the time.\nRich Corrado: Thanks Chris.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Joe on for Stephanie.\nRich Corrado: Hi, Joe.\nUnidentified Analyst: I just wanted to maybe quickly talk about maybe - we've been talking about the lease side and the demand there but also seeing some good demand on the CMI side. I was wondering how you guys felt about sort of your pilot number and as well as sort of your ability to recruit, retain pilots right now?\nRich Corrado: Well, Joe, it's - we have not had any problems, really, over the past few years, attracting crews to the opportunities that we have at our airlines. So - and that continues to this day where we've got 2,000 or so resumes on file and ATI as an example from opportunities this year. Our average hours of crews that we're hiring is significantly multiple times the required minimum, and so we're getting very qualified crews and pilots. One of the best things that a pilot looks for is growth opportunities to be able to move from the right seat as a first officer to a captain in the left seat, and the way to do that is the airline has to grow and opportunities, add airplanes. And we've been doing that - from the growth of our customers, we've been doing that really since all the way back to 2015, 2016. And those opportunities are real for these pilots. So we really haven't had a problem. ABX that had not been growing up until this year is now back in a growth mode. They're putting on more block hours, if they're - we're looking to put a couple of airplanes on ABX in the third quarter. And so, that airline is growing as well. And again, they're not having any problems. So the pilot situation is real solid for all of our airlines.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, that's very helpful. And then maybe just switching to the military side, I know previously, you guys had mentioned units have - they kind of have a snapback on that. I was wondering if that was still sort of the correct way to think about that military flying and then maybe if there's any comments about moving out of Afghanistan, any incremental there?\nRich Corrado: Yeah. As of right now, we don't have any guidance as it relates to what the Afghanistan movement may look like in the types of aircraft that we fly to support the military. So that's one thing. And as I said earlier in the call, we - as the military flying looks right now, it appears to be on plan for the way we looked at as we constructed our guidance for the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That was all great color. That's all I had. Thanks, guys.\nRich Corrado: Thanks Joe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve O'Hara from Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nSteve O'Hara: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nRich Corrado: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve O'Hara: Good morning. Just curious if you could just walk me through the delta between 4Q ACMI pre-tax and 1Q. I mean, obviously, you have you've stronger flying in the fourth quarter, I guess, on the cargo side. But then I don't think there was much on the Omni side with any troop movements or anything like that. And I know you guys talked about increases in wages this year due to the ABX contract, I think it was. I mean, if I look at 1Q over 1Q, I think wages was up 16.5 million. I think you guys were looking for something like a 7 million increase for the full year. Just was there something in there like a signing bonus or something that kind of pushed that up higher?\nMike Berger: No. There was no signing bonus in there. We had -\nQuint Turner: In logistics.\nMike Berger: Yeah. In terms of - we have some postal operations that we didn't have, for example, in the year ago quarter, Steve, two postal facilities that drove a lot of that wage. We - of course, compared to the prior year, we've got the ABX crew agreement, which the amendment that kicked in, in January.\nRich Corrado: And the other thing is we put on - the CMI operations that we put on additional in the first quarter, we put on in March. And so the training related to both the crews and the maintenance technicians -\nMike Berger: Related to the additional Amazon tails that we've put on, we added four leased aircraft to Amazon during the quarter, and then we've added another one here in the second quarter. So as we mentioned, we had a couple of million dollar increase in training costs. Some of that is in salary, the salary line as well.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay.\nQuint Turner: Yeah. I guess I just - I think it said block hours were down 5%, and then salaries and wages were up 13%. I guess I just would have expected more of a kind of consistent rate there.\nRich Corrado: Well, keep in mind that one of the conditions on accepting the payroll protection is we cannot furlough or lay off any employees at Omni. As it relates to whether those employees, whether it be administrative or crews or maintenance or what have you, are commensurate with the volumes that they're currently flying, right. So that's one issue where if the flying is down under regular circumstances, you may look to reduce your workforce to match the flying that you have. We're not able to do that right now, so we'll be carrying folks. And as the plan goes, we're going to need them later in the - by the third - by the end of the third quarter, anyway, based on the way the pilot - based on the way the plan is ramping. So - but that's one thing to keep in mind is that we're - in accepting that revenue, we're not able to cut personnel costs.\nSteve O'Hara: Right. Okay. And then you talked about, I think, April, May kind of looking more like 2019 levels. I mean I guess what - I think DoD is your largest customer, was your largest customer. Maybe how do you think about that flying versus the passenger flying and maybe the profitability of that going forward? I mean it wouldn't seem like the DoD flying would be as affected as kind of the traditional ad hoc stuff. And I would assume the ad hoc's a little more profitable or maybe much more profitable. Does international have to come back to what it was? Or does business travel have to come back to what it was for Omni to kind of get back to where it was in 2019?\nRich Corrado: Well, certainly, on the commercial side, that would help. We know one of the larger commercial customers is coming back this year later in the year. They've already been selling tickets, and it's just a matter of getting them started up. Keep in mind, as I said before when we were talking about flying internationally for the DoD, that we're having to work around airport restrictions and fly. So the military demand is still there to move troops and things like that but more so than the commercial passenger, I would say. But the - but it has impacted the cost on a short-term basis as it relates to providing those services to the military and to some of the other government passengers, government programs for which Omni flies. So it's kind of a - it's a tough question to answer in some respects because every type of charter or ad hoc or governmental flying, they all operate differently on the way in which you have to plan them, the consistency of the flights, whether there's - it's a one per quarter or whether it's a regular movement. I mean there's a lot of different things in the question that you're asking. We don't generally give any margin guidance by customer, and we're not - I don't think we're going to be doing that here today. But certainly, as the airports across the world stabilize, that will be a good thing for the cost side of the business.\nQuint Turner: And Steve, keep in mind since we spoke to you guys in February, we did apply for and were included in the Payroll Support Program 3, which I think is an additional $40 million award, which, if you think about the pandemic effects to our passenger flying, we feel like certainly the military has never stopped flying. There have been reductions associated with the pandemic certainly at times and certain theaters were impacted that they operate in and out of. But if you look out beyond this year at all, I think most folks would expect that to come right back to normal. And the good news is that the payroll support is doing what it was designed to do, which is allow us to maintain readiness, keep personnel levels where they are. And from a cash flow standpoint into ATSG, we're certainly whole from that when you include that program. We don't, of course, include it in our adjusted guidance, as we've discussed. But in meantime, the company is continuing to execute on long-term contracts that will bring cash flows in for many, many years. So we've certainly been more fortunate than most. And we expect our passenger business to come back faster than sort of the ticket selling commercial business and leisure traveling side would to its pre-pandemic level.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one last one for me, if you think about 2019 and maybe we assume we get back to - from an Omni ACMI Services standpoint, if we assume we get back to 2019 levels for a full year in 2022, how do you think about the profitability of that business in terms of - is there a way to compare it to 2019 from maybe a pre-tax standpoint or EBITDA standpoint and then kind of bake in all of the additional flying that you're doing for all the customers that you've added from '20 and 2021?\nQuint Turner: Yeah. We don't, of course, speak to individual airlines because they tend to have a fairly concentrated revenue book of customers, so we don't speak to pre-tax earnings of individual operations. But the ACMI Services segment, as you know, includes the operations for all of our airlines. And I think that - I guess, what I can say is that, as is evident in our guidance with the weighting of EBITDA that we've forecasted, you can see that we're expecting, in the second half of this year significant improvements in the ACMI Services segment profitability. As you think about first quarter into second quarter, we'll see some improvement in the second quarter, but we believe marked improvement throughout the second half in that segment. And Rich spoke earlier about April's military and Omni-type operations being on plan. So that's a good sign as we move through second quarter, but the most significant change we anticipate to be in the second half in the ACMI Services segment. The CAM segment, also, we expect a very strong second half with the tailwinds from all the leased aircraft that we've spoken about. So it's a little more back - second half weighted, and sometimes you've seen our plans play out. I know I'm thinking of last year. I think our first three quarters were all almost the same EBITDA, right? And so it's a little different. But we had, as we said to Jack and he agreed, 2020 was an unusual period. We had first quarter opportunities and even second quarter opportunities that were pandemic-related that mitigated a lot of that impact. And so that's why our guidance is unchanged since we spoke to you in February. And where we ended up in the first quarter is on plan with what our - we had anticipated. So that's - we're not really making any significant change to that forecast.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. All right. Thank you very much for the time.\nQuint Turner: Thanks Steve.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dan Sargen from Rice Hall James. Please go ahead.\nDan Sargen: Hey, good morning, guys.\nQuint Turner: Good morning.\nDan Sargen: Just my first question is we've talked about this a little bit in the past. But at what point do you guys consider curtailing growth below EBITDA and cash flows so that you're generating free cash flow at which you can use to repurchase stock next year when the window becomes available again?\nQuint Turner: Well, I mean, if the window were - I mean there's nothing capital structure or access to liquidity-wise, Dan, that would require us to curtail growth to think about buying back stock. I mean, again, the things aren't mutually exclusive, and we have a balance sheet that would allow us to pursue more than one allocation. But in terms of when we curtail growth, I think as long as growth is at attractive returns, why - it's generally not anything that we would look to curtail as long as those returns are - as they have been in the leasing business. In terms of the operating results and the changes year-over-year and things that you're seeing now, as we've said, those are more tied to the pandemic and its impact on our passenger operations than on the cargo side, which is where we're investing our capital. Those returns have been consistent and strong, and the demand there has probably never been too much better than we see it right now.\nDan Sargen: But is it a good idea to expand, I mean, to significantly increase your fleet into a very hot market when there's no belly capacity? And then the other - I mean, I appreciate it. I want you guys to grow. I just wonder if you'd grow more methodically. It's amazing the level you're growing. It's currently self-financed, which is incredible. At some point, though, I should say this is going to be another very good year for ATSG shareholders. I'm not sure that - it seems to me $2 billion market cap for $525 million in EBITDA and you don't pay cash taxes just seems way too low where I would think the return for share repurchase would be significantly better. I also think if your CapEx is going to consistently increase commensurate with cash flows, you used to there - I just think you have a lot of levers, and it's kind of the exact same claim book over and over.\nRich Corrado: Yeah. I appreciate the perspective. A couple of things to keep in mind, and that is when we're investing in aircraft growth, and based on the way the market is performing right now, these are - we're looking at 10-year leases. And I think the average we have this year is about 8.75 or nine years for the leases, for the returns that we're going to get on its investment for the first lease of these airplanes is significant. And when you look at the cash flow that comes from the investment, it's long term, and it's a very good return. That's one thing. The other thing is because of the long-term nature of planning to acquire feedstock, convert the aircraft and provide it to the market, I mean, if you're flat-footed right now and you say, I want a 767-300. How do I get one? We couldn't give you one, much before the third quarter of 2023. And so if we go in and out of the market as it relates to our slowing down or giving away some of our slots that we have as an example, then what we do is we impact the strategic focus of the company, and we actually hurt our position as the market leader in the space, talking about 767-300. And so we - from a strategic standpoint, we need to be very thoughtful because of the time lines and because of the lead times, I guess is a better word, that are inherent in what we do.\nQuint Turner: So it's been really not relying on spec right now.\nDan Sargen: Again, though, I would think the A321 would give you guys more flexibility. And second of all, though, you're not getting a higher multiple for being a market leader.\nQuint Turner: Well, it's a - what we look at, Dan, is what kind of long-term returns that - cash flow returns that we can generate in our leasing niche. And we've not been terribly aggressive in buying aircraft on spec.\nMike Berger: We're not buying or converting any aircraft on spec.\nQuint Turner: Right. These aircraft that we're buying, we have a very high visibility on where they're going to go and for what the duration is and what the returns are.\nDan Sargen: Well, if you could just compare that for the returns for share repurchase and begin to communicate a plan, I would appreciate it, for sure. But, thank you, guys, for your time.\nQuint Turner: No. I appreciate it. And I'd just say the - again, the legislation, the payroll support does preclude us from that for some period of time. But those have always been options that we have weighed, along with investment and growth.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Hey, thanks for taking my follow-up. Perhaps a follow-on to the previous question here but from a different angle. So your CAM portfolio is just shy of 100 aircraft here in 1Q. I'm curious how big do you think CAM's portfolio could get to, say, in three to five years. And whether - do you think you can continue to grow that portfolio organically? Thanks.\nRich Corrado: We have - and Mike, you may want to talk to that. I mean -\nMike Berger: Yeah. I mean we've communicated, obviously, 2021, and we communicated 2022. We will anticipate to at least deliver 10 in 2022, and we're starting to already build out the order book for 2023 all the way with interest out to 2025. So if you go back just a few years, the numbers that, in terms of newly converted freighters, has increased significantly over 2019, 2020, 2021 now. And as I said, we've already got minimally anticipate 10 for the following year. So we feel we can continue that number as long as the market continues to stay where it is. And our growth doesn't necessarily have to just be centered around the US and North America. And you've seen that recently where we continue to grow outside the US and globally and really every region of the world. And we already know that we've got built-up demand within those regions of the world, whether it be Asia, Southeast Asia, into Africa as well as Europe. And the 321 is also going to just really emphasize that as well. So we strongly believe that we're going to see the continued growth very strongly as we go forward.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And just my last question, and I appreciate the time. So you have 46 - you're anticipating flying 46 767s at the end of this year for Amazon. Well, just remind us, I don't know if you gave this, what the order book is for, what do you expect to be flying for 2022? And now that you've been flying for Amazon here for a few years and we know who the domestic carriers are here in the US, yourself, Atlas and Sun Country, curious your thoughts, given your experience on operating their network, where do you think their fleet overall, not just ATSG's, but their consolidated fleet might be in three to five years. Is it 100, 110 aircraft? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.\nRich Corrado: No. I don't - I would not venture to speak for Amazon and their growth planning and how it relates to where they'll be in a few years. What I can tell you is that if you look at how we've done with our growth platform with Amazon at both the leasing and the flying side, so we - by the end of this year, we'll be leasing them 42 aircraft, and we'll be flying 46 for Amazon. And we believe in all the services that we provide the Amazon, leasing, flying. We do heavy maintenance for the aircraft that we fly for them, and we do logistics work in different airports around the country. And everything we do for them, we've focused our employees since 2015 that the best way to put us in position for growth with Amazon is to provide them with the very best service in everything we do, whether it's flying, whether it's leasing, et cetera, et cetera. And what I would say is that we're - we feel that given the service that we've provided that we are still in the best position to continue to grow with Amazon of all their other providers. And that's been our goal since day one, and I take my hat off to all of our employees who not only perform every day but they understand Amazon's business, and they understand that every airplanes pull up thousands and thousands of promises that they've made to their customers. And that's the focus that we've taken, and that will give us opportunity to continue to grow with Amazon as they grow, whether it's 100 airplanes or 200 airplanes or whatever. Hopefully, we're going to be in a position to get our share of that.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thanks for the time today.\nRich Corrado: Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. I will give the floor to Mr. Corrado for final thoughts.\nRich Corrado: Thank you. Well, thank you for joining us on the call today. Our strong confidence about the value we are creating at ATSG stems mainly from substantial long-term cash flows we get from leasing 767s, the most in-demand cargo aircraft in the market today. Faster fulfillment in e-commerce orders will require many more of those and other midsized freighters. That's why customers are coming to us to make six-to-10-year commitments to at least 26 we can acquire and convert through 2022 and more beyond that. Although our passenger operations are challenged by the pandemic over the short-term, we very much like our market position and our long-term prospects. Thank you again for your interest in ATSG and please stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 4, "year": 2020, "date": "2021-02-26 15:31:03", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2020 Air Transport Services Group Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Hilda and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. . Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Joe Payne, Chief Legal Officer of ATSG. Mr. Payne you may begin.\nJoe Payne: Good morning, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website atsginc.com.\nRich Corrado: Thanks Joe, and welcome everyone. I want to begin by again thanking our employees for the outstanding service they provided this past year to our customers under all kinds of adverse conditions. We continue to invest more on safety and productivity measures to improve performance across all of our businesses. This is ATSG's culture and action. We'll keep improving and innovating to improve service long after the pandemic ends. Additionally, all three of our airlines have flown vaccines and other COVID-related supplies in support of our customers. For all of 2020, we exceeded our adjusted EBITDA goal with revenue and growth from all of our principal businesses. The pandemic continues to affect our results overall and our passenger flying in particular. But demand for our Boeing 767 freighters both leasing and flying remains very strong and not just for those coming out of conversion every month. We are redeploying return freighters to new customers at a faster pace than before. I have great confidence in our results for 2021 and beyond, based on the strongest order book in our history for our 767 freighters and support from customers who choose us to fly for them. But I'm also tempered by the knowledge that the end of the pandemic, has proven hard to predict, including the willingness of the flying public to return to the air in pre-pandemic numbers. I'll have more to say about our outlook shortly. Quint Turner, our CFO is standing by to recap our 2020 results. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Rich, and welcome to everyone on the call this morning. As Rich said, we beat our $490 million target for 2020 adjusted EBITDA by a healthy margin. On a consolidated basis, fourth quarter revenues were down a bit from $403 million to $399 million. The principal factor was lower block hours for passenger flying at Omni from a year ago and ATI's combi flying. Our fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $2.3 million or $0.04 per share basic, was substantially better than our loss of $41 million or $0.70 per share a year ago. The quarterly non-cash loss from revaluing our liability for the Amazon warrants was $38 million roughly half of what it was a year earlier. We also booked $12 million in fourth quarter benefits from our 2020 CARES Act grants. Finally, we had a $4.5 million positive swing in our retiree benefit adjustment and a smaller loss from our joint venture than the prior year. Interest expense was down for both the quarter and year. We had lower rates on our credit facility balances and lower debt levels overall than in 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $5 million for the quarter and $20.5 million for the year from more aircraft in service.\nRich Corrado: Thanks Quint. A year ago in the early stages of the pandemic, we took note of the risks it posed but advised you that our business model was resilient enough to adjust and we would achieve good results for the year. That was true in those early days of 2020 and remains true now in early 2021 as we look ahead toward what we hope will be a year of recovery for the economy and the transportation sector as a whole. Despite continuing uncertainty, we expect our business model to provide another year of revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in 2021. When the pandemic took hold last year, we had to dial back our expectations. We were fortunate last spring and summer to pick up several short-term passenger charter assignments to offset the loss of commercial passenger charter demand resulting from the pandemic. But as fall arrived the vacation and other commercial charter companies we typically serve were facing their own pandemic effects, which impacted our fourth quarter and will continue at a minimum through the first half of this year.\nOperator: Thank you. The first question comes from David Ross from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nDavid Ross: Yes. Thank you and good morning, Rich and team. Wanted to talk first I guess about the A321 freighter. Some are \u2013 I guess there's an article that DHL is already putting some into service overseas. How do you expect to be able to compete with the others that are maybe already doing their conversions? And what's the appetite look like from the customers you're talking to over the next couple of years?\nRich Corrado: Yes. It's a good question, Dave. So the A321, we're hoping to have the STC approval by the end of March. And there's only one other conversion house that's delivering aircraft right now and that's EFW and I think they have a couple of aircraft out there, one of which was produced for a lessor called Vallair and Vallair is leasing that aircraft to SmartLynx, which is the operator that's flying for DHL. Our first aircraft are \u2013 that's in conversion right now, that's our prototype model is actually a Vallair aircraft as well and slated to go to SmartLynx. And so we believe that that will enter that same profile network. In that article, I believe they indicated that SmartLynx was lined up for a couple more aircraft for this year. And so \u2013 and we believe \u2013 we welcome the competition as it relates to DHL and SmartLynx, looking at both aircraft. We believe our design is superior. We worked with Precision and as an operator we focused on looking at this aircraft as the way an operator would want to view it. And so there are some differences in our design that would make the aircraft more operator-friendly both on the sortation and container loading and also on the way the crews would utilize the aircraft both in jump seating and being able to have their luggage on the upper deck. So we welcome that opportunity. We're hoping to start the production line midyear this year. We're also getting PEMCO, our conversion subsidiary that's part of our airborne maintenance and engineering services group, that's located in Tampa in the conversion business midyear as well and start a line going to deliver more aircraft.\nMike Berger: Yes. I would just add Rich that DHL has indicated they do plan to compare the airplanes as you mentioned.\nDavid Ross: Okay. And then just a follow-up on that. As we think about the opportunity over the next several years because the idea is that there's a lot of 757s being retired that need to be replaced. If you think about ATSG's revenue stream from the 321 conversions, are you expecting most of the business to come through the traditional ACMI route or the A plus CMI in CAM and the other segment, or is there going to be a bigger revenue stream coming out of PEMCO and the conversions? And then how do you think about that on the 321 opportunity?\nRich Corrado: Yes. So initially beginning this year 2021, we'll be taking advantage of the joint ventures STC, so that we'll be participating in kind of the kit and the conversion piece of this. On the touch labor side, as I said PEMCO will also be participating, so they'll be converting the aircraft directly. So those two segments will go into play this year. We'll be in the market this year, call it the second half of the year, looking for \u2013 we're looking for feedstock now, but we'll be looking to make some transactions towards the second half of the year into 2022 to start building a leasing portfolio at CAM. The prognosis of whether we would fly the aircraft or not depends on our large customers or where they want us to fly it. As we have in the past, we generally don't do a lot of spec work and throw aircraft onto our certificates to try to leverage new charter business. It's not a big robust piece of what we do. And so we're going to move in that direction. Our existing \u2013 one of our existing customers, DHL does fly a lot of 757s as does UPS and FedEx. There are a number of airlines around the world in Europe and in Asia that fly 757s as well. So the \u2013 on the kind of the operating and leasing side, there should be robust demand. The other interesting thing and you see this in most situations with new conversions, is leasing companies that have passenger aircraft portfolios that are coming off lease, generally look to, whether they can get a second a third lease on an airplane passenger-wise. And if not, then they look to -- may look to convert that aircraft and create a new revenue stream and a new life frankly on the aircraft. We've already gotten a lot of interest from leasing companies that have portfolios. Obviously, with the pandemic and the utility if you will of new leases and putting those passenger aircraft back into service is more challenged right now. So, we're seeing an uptick certainly of interest on the conversion -- on the STC and conversion side from leasing companies looking to get in as well. So it's a unique stream that we're watching closely.\nDavid Ross: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Atkins from Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Great. Good morning. Thanks guys. So I guess maybe just to kind of go back to the outlook for 2021, Rich or Quint, maybe if you want to take this as well. Just curious, you're absorbing a fair amount of costs related to the passenger charter and the combi flying that I guess that the hope is that will come back at some point once the world normalizes. Is there a way to think about the headwind that that's maybe serving the profitability in 2021? Just kind of help us think about that, because the idea would be one day that would return back closer to normal and you'd be able to absorb that overhead and that would go from being a headwind to more of a tailwind.\nQuint Turner: Yes. I mean, Jack this is Quint. I mean, as you noted, if we have a headwind going into this year, it's related strictly to the pandemic and the passenger operations. And we talked a lot in earlier quarters about our successful efforts to really mitigate some of that through taking the opportunity to do some charters. Some of those charters were also driven by pandemic requirements, PPE and taking -- and repatriating citizens and so forth. And so, we saw more and I think we told you guys when we talked in November or October, we expected to see more of that in the fourth quarter because, we didn't foresee as many of those opportunities. And that's kind of what we're looking at, as we head into at least the first half of this year. Our view is that we're going to continue to see those pandemic effects. The primary places you see them obviously is in Omni's commercial operations in particular and also in the combi flying that we do. I mean, we've been -- we've seen our hours drop for example on the combi by something like 40% over what they had been. And the opportunities to mitigate that, while they may come about, there may be some of those or not as clearly visible as they were heading into the pandemic. So that's kind of the -- I think Rich mentioned that, the first half we're expecting about 43% of our EBITDA in the first half and 57% in the second and that reflects our view that we'll see recovery in some of those opportunities as we move forward. And we also get more scale as we put additional CAM leases in place, moving through the second half of the year. Some of the opportunities we had early on in 2020 for those charters, tended to be pretty profitable opportunities. As is often the case with charters that need to be done in a compressed time frame, you typically are able to realize a little better margin on some of those. And so, that again presents a little bit of a headwind going into the coming year. But in terms of where we invest our capital for aircraft, as Rich said, on the cargo side, we've not really seen any more robust environment for demand than we're seeing right now. And we're achieving the returns we're getting there. And of course that was also a big part of our story last year.\nJack Atkins: Absolutely, absolutely. And all that makes sense Quint and thanks for that additional sort of color there. I mean, Rich, when you sort of think about where the business is today, you've got I think just an unprecedented level of visibility into customer demand. And I think there's a concern in the market that, air freight has been a beneficiary from the pandemic to some degree. But I guess, what your customers are telling you with their desire to lease planes in 2022, and then you've got visibility you said through 2025 for multiple aircraft, what is that telling you about the stickiness of what's happening in the business right now and the rise of e-commerce penetration not just in the United States but more globally?\nRich Corrado: Well, Jack, I think before the \u2013 even before the pandemic, e-commerce was dominating growth in air cargo. If you look at air cargo in general, you've got two broad segments generally air cargo, which is your intercontinental large aircraft moves that ebb and flow with global trade. And you saw in 2019, the market dipped by 3% and you saw the impact that that had on large charter operators that have large aircraft and they had a very rough and rocky year. 2019 was a record year for us, and 2020 was an even better year because we're finally tuned towards express and that's being powered by e-commerce. So that's the other second \u2013 the other segment is this express network operator. And that's over 50% of the global fleet of aircraft is with the integrators. And so \u2013 and that's where we play. Now, if you look at e-commerce now, it's growing significantly. It's up \u2013 depending on which analyst you look at it's up 30% to 40% in the US, depending on which month you look at and it's \u2013 in 2020. Obviously, that was powered by the pandemic, but it's bought \u2013 it's brought a whole host of new consumers that would not have otherwise used e-commerce that are now using e-commerce and are predicted to stay and continue to use that even when the pandemic is finally over. So that stickiness in your words is predicted to stay. What's great for us and we've talked about this a lot is we're not \u2013 other than our passenger operations on the cargo side we don't \u2013 we're not a big charter operator. We don't have a lot of assets hanging around waiting for charters. They're all utilized on \u2013 generally on CMI for customers. And so what's great about what's happening with our business model is this spike in cargo is leading to long-term dry leases. So long after this pandemic's over, we'll still be getting very strong cash flow from these aircraft that are leased, and will be leased all over the world both into the large integrated cargo networks and into networks in other parts of the globe. I don't know, Mike, if you have more \u2013 \nMike Berger: I'd just add a little bit and then \u2013 Jack I appreciate you bringing up some of the growth opportunities that happened on e-commerce. As Rich said, it really stands up for what our model is all about, right? I mean we saw great support and great growth pre-pandemic and certainly through the pandemic, and we're going to see it coming out of it. But the statistical side of e-commerce, you've gone from 14% e-commerce in terms of retail U.S. retail sales in 2018, all the way to well over 21% now. But what we're excited about is that from a global standpoint, retail e-commerce sales across the globe are really starting to propel in places that, we're starting to grow into. So for Latin America, for example, over 36% growth in e-commerce, and we talked about we're putting airplanes down in that part of the world into places like Africa, where they're just under 20%. So we see great e-commerce growth across the globe. And as we penetrate, new markets that's what makes us really excited. And as Rich talked about, it's not only our dry lease piece of it it's where they're going to and who our customers are serving. And that plays right into where the growth engine is and that's e-commerce and m-commerce across the board.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Okay. That makes sense. Maybe last question, and I'll turn it over. But just given the level of demand that you're seeing for your assets right now, is that giving you incremental positive opportunities to maybe price more aggressively on some of these leases? That's question one. Question two, are you seeing opportunities to maybe extend the term of these leases? I think the Amazon leases are 10 years at least the most recent leases. What about some of these other customers? Are they multiyear leases? Could you maybe kind of help us kind of think about that? So curious on pricing and then lease terms as well.\nMike Berger: Yes. We see our leases are normally, Jack, five to seven-plus years or so. And we have seen a tick-up for our lease -- our monthly leases. So you're absolutely right about that. The demand has allowed us, not only to stabilize prices, but also take increases. The other thing it's done, it's allowed us to -- on our re-leases we've gone out and been able to -- as leases end and we go into new ones with different customers or the same customers, that's allowed us also to go out for multiple years, five-plus years, not only on our 300s but even on our 200s, which has really done a great job and it still remains a very reliable plane. So, yes, no doubt about it. The market has certainly allowed us to take our rates up slightly and also allow us to take our lease terms out into multiple years for the future.\nJack Atkins: Okay. That's great to hear. Thanks again for the time, guys. Congratulations on a great 2020.\nMike Berger: Thank you, Jack\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Jack.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much.  everybody I think in the time. I just have a couple of questions. When you're out there looking at feedstock are you seeing a lot of competition to the same aircraft? And is it driving up prices?\nRich Corrado: That's a good question, Helane. It's interesting, because there's a lot of talk in the market about, because of the pandemic operators are looking to get out of aircraft or they're parking aircraft and looking to flip airplanes in the cash flow, et cetera, et cetera. But frankly, we have not seen any spike in demand related to aircraft. There's -- the competition we tend to see out there is from the large integrators and operators. We don't see it from -- necessarily, from other leasing companies. The other thing is, we did this program with Air Canada that we thought was unique. We were in the process of acquiring two Air Canada jets from a leasing company and then we got into a conversation with Air Canada directly. And one of the things we thought about, as a result of the pandemic, combination carriers or carriers that were combination carriers, handling both passengers and cargo, or even passenger carriers, were going to rethink that -- what cargo means and cargo revenue means to their overall growth profile, particularly, as you saw in the pandemic, where a lot of them were -- were customizing, if you will, their passenger jets to operate them as freighters. So we got in this deal with Air Canada where we acquired their two 767-300s from them. We're going to convert them and then we're going to lease them back. And so, that was a unique program and we've talked to a few other operators about the potential to do that too. So that is one area where, there's kind of some availability, but it's a stickiness availability where we could take advantage of those types of things. On the competition side, some of the things that we see is that, some operators that are looking for feedstock only want really young airplanes. Your Chinese operator, as an example, SF Express, they want an aircraft that's 15 years or younger and we'll take 15 years or older. So we don't really butt heads with them when we're bidding on things. But we've been able to -- we've got our order book full for this year. We've got all the feedstock aircraft we need to deliver, all the airplanes that we're delivering this year and we're working on 2022 right now. We've got slots lined up for 2022 and we've got, probably, about half of them pulled with feedstock for 2022. So where we sit right now in the end of February, we're in really good shape for next year. And that's what we're planning and looking forward to as we go forward. I don't know, Mike, if you have any -- \nMike Berger: The only thing I would add Rich is that we -- there's plenty of feedstock in regards to other engine types and we're in the midst of evaluating Pratt-powered 767-300s. Traditionally, the majority of our fleet, as you guys know, is GE-powered and we're now taking a hard look at the Pratt-powered engine. Now we do fly three today in our ABX network today, so we're familiar with it and it flies just fine from a reliability standpoint. So we're not concerned about feedstock, specifically when we think about the broader piece of it in engine types and we'll go from there.\nHelane Roukas: That's very helpful. Thank you. I just have two clarifying questions if you don't mind. On the Air Canada leases, are you -- because they were leased aircraft before. So do you just keep the same monthly lease rate or do they renegotiate that lease rate with you?\nMike Berger: The two aircraft that we acquired from them they were owned. So they had some fleet that was owned and some of that was leased. And so these two particular aircraft are owned and were -- those are the ones we bought. \nHelane Roukas: Okay. So when they pay you every monthly rent rate is that negotiated? How is that negotiated I guess I'm trying to figure out?\nQuint Turner: It's no different Helane that any feedstock plan we would buy and convert and lease at a market rate. \nMike Berger: Yeah, we purchase the airplane. We'll convert the airplane Helane and the lease won't commence until we redeliver the airplane back to them and that's when they'll start paying the monthly rent.\nHelane Roukas: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just on the pilot pay increase, is that all in January then that full $7 million or $8 million you mentioned is that all in the first quarter? \nQuint Turner: No that's an annual impact Helane.\nHelane Roukas: Okay. All right. So we should think about it as like whatever $2 million a quarter kind of thing?\nQuint Turner: Exactly. \nHelane Roukas: Perfect. All right. Thanks guys.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Helane.\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Helane. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Steve O'Hara from Sidoti & Company.\nSteve O'Hara: Yeah. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. \nRich Corrado: Good morning,Steve.\nSteve O'Hara: Good morning. Just on the CARES Act benefit that you exclude from earnings, I mean is there some sort of -- is there a mismatch there in terms of the -- you're kind of carrying extra salaries things like that. I guess I can understand excluding the benefit, but you're also carrying heavier expenses too. I mean, is there the right way to think about maybe what EBITDA would have been kind of on an apples-to-apples basis, if you kind of factor in the benefit from CARES and what that offset in terms of the cost that you're carrying the extra cost that you were carrying?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Steve. It's a good question. The benefit is based on the formula that's in the legislation and it tends to be based on a view more of the total payroll. And when it comes to impacted positions that might be furloughed due to reductions that's more predicated on the -- those that are direct involved with loss of flying. So it's not a perfect -- it's not as if you can equate the benefit with the dollar-for-dollar or anything with the potential furloughs.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. I guess I'm just trying to figure out maybe with the negative impact on the quarter was from carrying those extra salaries. \nQuint Turner : Yes. I mean it depends upon I guess the timing and the level of impact to specific operations comm and so forth and we haven't really -- we haven't calculated exactly what that might have been. It's just more of -- we want to make sure that you understand the relationship between what's in and what's out of our adjusted results and the rest of the impacts. \nSteve O'Hara: Okay, okay. And then just maybe on the pandemic headwind that you're considering for 2021. And I had a user error here on the call early, but is there a way to think about what you're factoring in kind of in the first half of the year? I think you said 57% in the second half. How do you think about the -- what you're factoring in? Without the pandemic what's the run rate earnings look like, or at least what are you factoring in for the pandemic in the first half of the year? \nQuint Turner: Yes. Again, I guess the -- if you look at where the year-over-year changes are and what we've got in there, the biggest impacts we've said are obviously the passenger portions of our operation, which is Omni and which is also ATI. We haven't really, you're talking about an earnings impact or are you talking about an EBITDA impact, or what was your question?\nSteve O'Hara : Either.\nQuint Turner: Yes. I mean, it's tough to, I guess, calculate exactly what is related to that and we haven't. If we were going to put something like that out, I think, we probably would have included in the materials we've published last night Steve. We can tell you that the biggest year-over-year drop is at Omni. And if you look at the portion of their business for example that is commercial passenger driven, it's probably about 20% of their revenue, which is about $100 million a year. And you can figure an EBITDA margin on that revenue. If you -- which -- you can see what the overall EBITDA margin is. If you look at the combi flying, its flight hours are down about 40%. You're talking about probably another EBITDA margin on about call it $40 million of revenue for the combi. So you've probably got about $140 million of revenue that's impacted at an EBITDA margin. And that's about as good a gauge as I could give you because to do a more refined estimate would involve a lot of assumptions. But if you apply that to that that might be one way to think about the EBITDA impact related to the pandemic. And remember we're expecting that to improve in the second half. We've made assumptions in our guidance about an improving picture in the second half.\nMike Berger: I mean, the other headwind you have around the commercial Omni business is that just the competitive nature of it with all the available capacity that's in the marketplace as they go for opportunities. In the first half, it will come at a lower profitability, but those headwinds will ease as we progress through the balance of the year.\nQuint Turner: Yes, okay. Certainly, the good news is if you look beyond if you believe the pandemic as we do, we'll see that lessening impact in the second half. And you look out very far at all into 2022, those aren't impactful beyond the pandemic period. And in the meantime other portions of our business particularly the cargo portion well as Mike and Rich just described is performing extremely well and continuing to make gains looking into 2022.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then two last ones. Just if you think about the run rate heading into 2022, I mean, it should seem like you should have, I guess, if I take the second half and maybe annualize that and haircut it a little bit for maybe first half is slower typically, I mean, it seems like you have a pretty good runway for 2022 EBITDA. I mean, is there a way to think about the run rate heading into 2022?\nQuint Turner: Well, I think we're going to -- we're -- I don't think today we'd necessarily want to give you a 2022 guidance Steve. But again, assuming that the pandemic impacts clear up certainly with the onset of at least 15 additional leased aircraft and you can kind of know what those contributions are like on a per unit basis. I think you're -- you can sort of make your own assumptions there. We'll say more about it obviously as we move through the year, and we get more visibility on exactly where the pandemic effects are going and at what rate. But I think it's true that if you assume that things are resolved on that issue by the end of the year, 2022 would certainly be accelerated because you wouldn't have these passenger flying impacts that we're talking about.\nMike Berger: I mean, you get back to the core of it. With the number of airplanes that we're going to put into service in 2021, the number that we're providing in terms of high-single digits for 2022, the feedstock 13 airplanes, all plays to the model that Rich talked about in the beginning of really turnkey solutions, right, because the more airplanes we're putting out in the marketplace, specifically customers that not only are leasing airplanes from us but we're also doing the maintenance on through our MROs, as well as our logistics company, as well as flying and when our customers need them. Really, really pleased to how the model has performed and will perform even at higher levels with incremental numbers.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. And maybe just lastly on the A321. How long does that take to get on your certificate, or \u2013 and is there in terms of the airlines how long does it take them to get up to speed? If you were to buy the aircraft tomorrow when could you start flying it for customers?\nRich Corrado: It generally takes about six to nine months to get an aircraft on certificate with an airline. And usually you need an MSN serial number to do that. So that's how long it takes to get at that. And that includes training pilots and getting your maintenance, your flight, your operations, your ground and your cargo handling manuals all straightened out and approved by the FAA. That's kind of what the view would look like.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. Got it. Thanks very much for the time.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you.  The next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nRich Corrado: Hey, Chris.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So Quint or Rich I understand the conservatism around the EBITDA guide for this year given the uncertainty with COVID. But assuming the vaccine rollout here continues to move forward and we're at let's say 50% of the US population has at least one shot by mid-July. Could you walk us through what your utilization assumptions are for commercial passenger and US military flying in that $525 million? And of the 15 dry leases this year how many of those are CMI? And for 2022 just \u2013 I think you said you have nine plans in terms of dry leases. And of those what do you have locked in for CMI? \nQuint Turner: Yes. Rich do you want to take the lease part and I'll take a shot at the...\nRich Corrado: Yes. Out of the 15 leases this year 11 will be at this point CMI operations all for Amazon. And then in \u2013 right now on the nine going in next year we're \u2013 there's no \u2013 nothing firm on the CMI. And I should also say on the remainder of this year there may be additional CMI for other customers as well. So we may have an upside on the CMI both in 2021 and 2022.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And on the utilization assumptions?\nQuint Turner: I don't know Rich, if you mentioned but we do anticipate we might have a shot to fly some of the \u2013 a couple of the Amazon-owned planes.\nRich Corrado: Correct. \nQuint Turner: Yes, right, right. Okay. So 13. I think we had assumed about \u2013 that was \u2013 maybe as many as 13 will be added to CMI this year.\nRich Corrado: Right. So there may be an upside there as well. On the utilization piece, it's not just US. And part of the disruption of service and activity has been particularly on the combi side and even with Omni, when they're flying for the military, it's not that the \u2013 on the combi side, let's take that first. It's not that the military doesn't want to fly. It's that the venues that they're flying into have significant restrictions: Singapore, Bahrain, Ascension Island, where for us to fly in, the pilots would get quarantined for an excessive amount of time, those types of things. And so it's a situation where it's not that the customer doesn't want to fly into these venues it's they're unable to effectively and productively do that. And the same goes for some of the Omni flying. Some of the airports they normally would service are not allowing foreign operators to fly through. And so that's disrupted on the military side some of their opportunity going forward. So it's not just the vaccine rollout in the US. It's the success of the vaccine in other countries and in the military for which we would \u2013 for those areas which we fly to. So that's what's impacting kind of the utilization on how we feel we'll rollout of this. We have some commercial customers such as, Vacations Hawaii that was a regular charter business for many years for Omni flying between Honolulu and Las Vegas. They're projecting mid-year to be back in service. But depending on, how the pandemic goes that may get disrupted. And so we don't have that in our first half, but we do have some of that revenue in our second half, is a good example. And we're in regular dialogue with that customer about their opportunity. So it's just a matter of how the markets are in terms of -- and how the public is buying into going -- utilizing that vacation type option. So those are kind of some examples of how we're thinking about getting utilization improved in the second half of the year.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And of the 116 aircraft, I think you have in your release for this year-end that's nine additional for next year. Should we think about the fleet around 125, 124-ish for 2022?\nQuint Turner: I think, we'll add to the nine Chris. That's sort of what we currently have\u2026\nMike Berger: Correct.\nQuint Turner: \u2026 are working specifically on. But I think that, it'll probably -- we'll add a few aircraft to that.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then, Quint, cash flow from operations for this year ex-PSP2 and the aircraft impairment?\nQuint Turner: Well, of course, it'll all be in our cash flow statement here, that we'll publish on Monday with the K. But hang on here. Are you talking for 2020 or 2021?\nChris Stathoulopoulos: For 2021, I'm sorry, for last year 2020.\nQuint Turner: For last year, yeah, cash flow from operations is about what $512 million for the full year. Now that includes about $76 million of CARES proceeds.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay, all right. And then, I can just take out the aircraft impairment. Last question, just how should we think about G&A maintenance and interest expense for 2021? Thanks.\nQuint Turner: Interest expense is rough -- roughly in terms of cash interest, because we do have some non-cash components. In terms of 2021, you're looking at around just over $50 million call it, $53 million of cash interest expense. And as far as -- what was your other question on D&A?\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Maintenance and D&A.\nQuint Turner: You're not -- you're talking about CapEx, or you're talking about the Omni expense side?\nChris Stathoulopoulos: On the expense -- just for modeling here on the income statement, I'm guessing that there's going to be some maintenance associated with the new -- as you ready the new 767s.\nQuint Turner: Yeah. I really -- I don't know, if we want to get into the specific modeling stuff here. Obviously, we can talk about that later, I guess Chris. I don't have an income statement here in front of me for the 2021 budget that breaks it down that way.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thanks for the time everyone.\nQuint Turner: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call to Mr. Rich Corrado for final remarks.\nRich Corrado: Thank you. I'd like to again thank all of the employees at ATSG. All of our companies have been operating at full speed during the pandemic delivering essential transportation, maintenance and logistics services to the economy. We have delivered for our customers and for our shareholders. I know I speak for everyone at ATSG, when I say, we're proud of the results achieved in 2020. And we're confident, that we'll do better this year. Our strategy has always been about long-term cash flow. And that's not going to change, simply because of a pandemic. We hope to see many of you online via Zoom or other investor conferences this spring. And we thank you for your support of ATSG.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 2, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-08-08 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to Second Quarter 2020 Air Transport Services Group, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sylvia, and I'll be operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Joe Payne, Chief Legal Officer. Mr. Payne, you may begin.\nJoe Payne: Good morning, Sylvia. During the course of this call, we will make projections or other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call. Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to the following, which relate to the current COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn: the pandemic may continue for a longer period, or its effect on commercial and military passenger flying may be more substantial than what we currently expect; disruptions to our workforce and staffing capability and our ability to continue to access airports and maintenance facilities; the impact on our customers' creditworthiness; and the continuing ability of our vendors and third party service providers to maintain customary service levels; and other factors that could impact the market demand for our assets and services, including our operating airlines' ability to maintain on-time service and control costs; the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration; fluctuations in ATSG's traded share price and in interest rates, which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments; the number, timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers; our ability to remain in compliance with key agreements with customers, lenders and government agencies; changes in general economic and/or industry specific conditions; and other factors that's contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-Q we expect to file tomorrow. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pre-tax earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials, and we advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which were included in our earnings release and on our Web site. And now, I'll turn the call over to Rich Corrado, President and CEO.\nRich Corrado: Thanks Joe. Welcome everyone to our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Quint Turner, our Chief Financial Officer, is with me today, along with Mike Berger, our Chief Commercial Officer, who is standing by to field any questions you may have about our market outlook. We issued our earnings release today after the market closed. It's on our website, atsginc.com. We will file our 10-Q tomorrow. I'm happy to tell you that during the second quarter, the cash-generating potential of ATSG's unique business model was on full display. We delivered more of our strong ongoing cash flow from more long-term leases of midsize freighter aircraft. We also achieved better-than-expected returns from our cargo and passenger airlines, which found innovative ways to serve our customers and our nation. Our revenues increased by 13% to $378 million and adjusted earnings minus warrant and other effects were $0.47, up $0.20 or 74% from a year ago. On a similar basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $126 million in the second quarter and 14% to $250 million for the first half. In this economic climate, those results are remarkable, but even more impressive is the fact that we sharply expanded our leading role in freighter aircraft dry leasing during the quarter. The order from Amazon for 12 more 767s that we announced in June will extend our leadership position and ensures an expanding stream of cash flow from those leases through 2021 and beyond. 11 of the 12 leases will be delivered next year. One was delivered in June. Even so, our 767 dry lease schedule for 2020 has grown from what we projected in May. We now plan to execute 12 767-300 freighter leases this year, up from our prior guidance of 8 to 10. We also expect to release at least three 767-200s this year, including two in the second half. Of course, we are not immune to the pandemic. As we told you in May, we asked for $75 million in grant funds for Omni and ATI under the airline provisions of the CARES Act. We were granted that amount to offset reductions in our ongoing passenger operations, including combi flying for the Department of Defense and also flying for certain commercial passenger customers. Those reductions did occur and are continuing. We recognized a bit less than $10 million of CARES support in the second quarter pre-tax GAAP earnings, and we'll recognize the remaining CARES proceeds in GAAP quarterly earnings through the second quarter of 2021. We are excluding those amounts from our adjusted results. In addition to the effect on our airlines, our aircraft maintenance business is also down due to the pandemic as some of its external customers have parked the aircraft we were servicing. Matching our second half outlook for airline and other businesses, with CAM's leasing growth, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA for 2020 to be at least $470 million, up $18 million from our 2019 total of $452 million. Quint is ready to fill you in on the details of our consolidated and operating results. I'll close with more comments on our second half outlook, including why and how our business model helps us to weather and even grow during economic storms like the ones we are facing today. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks Rich, and thanks to all of you on the call for joining us this morning. As Rich said, our second quarter results were very good on both our top and adjusted bottom line. We're proud of our high-quality service reputation, both for our superior everyday performance and particularly for our ability to deliver in tough times. On a consolidated basis, second quarter revenues rose 13% or $43 million from the prior year to $378 million. The increase stems primarily from more leased aircraft in service and expanded airline operations versus a year ago. 72% of our first half revenues came from our three largest customers. The Department of Defense represented 32%, Amazon 29% and DHL 11% of the total. On a GAAP basis, we had a second quarter loss from continuing operations of $105 million or $1.78 per share basic. The 22% increase in ATSG\u2019s share price during the quarter plus $7 million in additional warrants awarded to Amazon in June in connection with its latest freighter lease commitment had the largest impact on those GAAP results. The warrants and other financial effects reduced GAAP income by $108 million or $1.75 per share. To date, none of the warrants ATSG has issued to Amazon have been exercised. We also recognized a second quarter noncash impairment charge of $30 million after tax. The impairment charge, like the Amazon warrant effects, are excluded from our adjusted earnings and EBITDA. The impairment stemmed primarily from our decision to retire our four Boeing 757 freighter aircraft. Three of them were retired by June 30 after DHL opted not to continue operating them in its North American network, 1 remains in service through the end of 2020. We expect to continue to derive some benefit from that aircraft and from leasing out several 757 engines. Keep in mind that the impairment charge is unrelated to our four Boeing 757 combination freighter passenger aircraft or combis, which are under contract to the DoD. We also recognized the benefit of nearly $10 million in GAAP pretax earnings from the CARES Act grants for Omni and ATI, representing a pro rata share of the $75 million in grants we will recognize through June 2021. The effects of warrants, CARES funding and the impairment charges were excluded from our adjusted results along with other mostly noncash items referenced in our earnings release. Our adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $0.47 versus $0.27 a year ago. On the same basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased $21 million or 20% to $126 million. Second quarter interest expense decreased by $800,000 versus last year. The change reflects lower effective interest rates, stemming from lower pricing and lower market rates on our variable rate debt. We devoted $266 million of our cash flow to capital expenditures during the first half, up 23%, mostly for seven feedstock 767-300s and related mod costs. Those purchases and modification costs will continue through the year as we fill strong demand for our 767 freighters from Amazon and others. We are now targeting $465 million in 2020 CapEx, up from the $420 million guidance we gave you in May. Some of that CapEx is for freighters to be delivered in 2021. If we purchase more 767s this year, that will mean less required CapEx next year. We had available revolver capacity of $408 million at the end of June. Our total debt to adjusted EBITDA at quarter end declined from 3.6 to 3.25x under our credit agreements. That summarizes our consolidated financial results for the quarter. On a segment basis, I'm pleased to tell you that results from our ACMI Services segment continued to improve year-over-year. That segment earned $20 million on a pretax basis in the second quarter, up from just $1 million a year ago. Our airlines operated seven more aircraft and flew 17% more block hours compared to the prior year period. The earnings improvement came from Omni's ability to find charter opportunities even as regularly scheduled DoD flying declined. Also, ACMI flying for commercial passenger customers largely dried up. Increased cargo network flying and a reduction in the significant ramp-up costs we were incurring a year ago were also factors. Omni played a key role in retrieving U.S. citizens and their families from abroad as the pandemic swept through Asia and Europe. It flew charter assignments for other U.S. government customers and transported energy workers after the scheduled passenger airlines reduced service. These and other ad hoc assignments offset much of Omni's second quarter revenue shortfalls. However, very little of that ad hoc business has continued into the second half, and our combi flying will remain sharply lower than a year ago. CAM, our leasing business, continues to perform well, with pre-tax earnings up 18% to $20 million for the quarter. Its externally leased fleet increased by seven aircraft and external revenues increased by $10 million to $50 million. Fleet growth increased CAM's depreciation and amortization expense by $3 million and its interest expense by $300,000. CAM purchased seven feedstock 767s in the first half of the year, including two in the second quarter. Four more 767 feedstock aircraft are scheduled for purchase in the second half. External customer revenues from our other businesses, grouped as other activities, were slightly higher than a year ago. Higher aircraft fuel sales and more revenues from gateway services were offset by reduced revenues from external aircraft maintenance customers, many of which parked the passenger aircraft we were servicing. The pre-tax loss from those businesses for the period was largely due to lower aircraft maintenance service and parts sales volumes. That's the summary of our financial and operating results for the quarter. I'll turn it back to Rich for some other comments on our operations and outlook. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks Quint. Overall, I'm pleased and proud of the way the ATSG businesses are performing this year. Our employees are helping our customers respond to the pandemic, sometimes under very challenging conditions. We are a service business, and services are delivered by people. Our financial results and strong reputation are possible only because our people excel at virtually everything they do. During the second quarter, we offset much of the revenue gap from operations the pandemic took away with better-than-expected revenues from the short-term charter and ACMI opportunities that ironically the pandemic brought us. Protecting the health and safety of our employees and others they work with is always a top priority for us. During the pandemic, flight crews and ground support personnel are distancing where possible and using the best available PPE. We are maximizing work-from-home opportunities and monitoring temperature and other health indicators in our offices. The pandemic is driving changes in the way people shop and work. That gives us confidence that express package transport will continue to expand as online order preferences grow even faster. In the meantime, customer-dedicated cargo and passenger aircraft like ours are compensating for the contraction in belly space capacity from the scheduled passenger airlines. These factors are growing the markets that ATSG serves now and in the future. We talk to current and potential customers about other ways we can help them. We don't intend to make charter flying a major part of our business, but we will meet their needs with ad hoc support where we can with a goal to convert some of that business to ACMI or dry lease plus CMI flying over time. Quint told you that our passenger flying was down in the second quarter. In the second half, we expect that to continue. That's the main reason we expect our adjusted EBITDA will be down from the first half. The cargo airlines will remain very busy. We just announced new ACMI agreements with DHL for freighter service between Hong Kong and Australia and between Europe and the US. ATI will operate four more Amazon-leased 767s deploying in the second half along with one it added in June. Revenue growth in our cargo CMI operations is encouraging, but there is more to do. We are not yet satisfied with margins on our cargo CMI flying. Earnings are challenged by high line maintenance and other costs to support rapidly changing customer flight schedules. We are adding pilots to fly those 767s in what has become a dramatically different market for recruitment. We're having no trouble finding pilots that meet our high standards. At the same time, ABX management continues to meet with its pilots to reach agreement on an amended contract. We now expect to exceed our prior target of leasing 8 to 10 767-300s this year. Our plan includes 12 such deployments with 10 in the second half. We also anticipate leases for three 767-200s during the year, including two in the second half. We had expected two customers leasing 767-200 freighters from us to return them this year. Instead, they have extended their lease commitments for them through the end of 2020. Those redeployments and extensions are evidence of the continued strong demand for 767 freighters. We are looking forward to completing our Airbus A321 freighter conversion initiative. We expect the first FAA test flight of the A321 prototype to take place next month and FAA certification of our design to follow in the fourth quarter. We believe that our A321 freighter platform will be the preferred narrow-body choice for regional air networks, replacing 757 freighters, whether as a lease from us or from conversions of customer aircraft. We will make our own fleet investments in A321s, but perhaps only minimally until 2022. We raised our projected capex spend for 2020 back up to $465 million with the signing of the latest Amazon order. We own or have available all of the 767 feedstock we will need through 2021. We expect to acquire only three to five feedstock 767s next year versus 11 this year. CAM projects deployments of at least 20 newly modified 767 freighters from July 2020 through December 2021. That includes 17 under firm customer agreements and three currently being finalized. I want to reaffirm that our 2020 adjusted EBITDA will grow despite pandemic effects beyond the $452 million we delivered last year. We currently expect at least $470 million this year. That's our best estimate now, but we would urge you to keep in mind that forecasting in the current climate is especially challenging. Omni's commercial customers include sports teams and vacation travel companies that have already reduced demand in the face of continued growth in COVID-19 cases around the country. Our combi operations are continuing on a limited basis, but that could change further if the military or foreign governments impose new restrictions. In total, we project that our second half adjusted EBITDA results will be $30 million lower than the first half for many of the reasons I've just mentioned. Today, we expect a good peak season for our cargo airlines. By November, however, we could be facing a different fourth quarter outlook than we have today. But what won't change is our strong confidence in the long-term results of ATSG. We expect that as our spending of 767 fleet growth declines next year, our CapEx spend will fall by at least $115 million to about $350 million. That reduction, together with strong cash flow from at least 20 additional 767 leases and normalized returns from our passenger flying and aircraft maintenance operations, point to a very attractive discretionary net cash flow outlook for ATSG in 2021 and beyond. You may have factored our cash flow growth into your own outlooks for ATSG. But also keep in mind that much of that cash flow comes from freighter leases that extend well into the next decade as well as the returns generated from our other businesses that support that growing fleet now and post pandemic. With the growing cash flow generating power of our businesses, we look forward to expanded opportunities to allocate capital among a wide range of value-enhancing alternatives to increase shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks. Sylvia, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jack Atkins from Stephens.\nJack Atkins: So I guess, just maybe start with the guidance for a moment. If I go back to the initial 2020 guide, I think that was $487 million to $492 million that you guys put in place in early March. Obviously, the world is totally different today versus then. But as you sort of think about the puts and takes with at least $470 million guide relative to the initial $487 million to $492 million, can you kind of walk us through the bridge? Because certainly, it feels like the first half of the year came in much better than initially expected. Second half, it sounds like there's going to be lower passenger demand. It just feels like that the run rate is pretty strong, even with that lower passenger level. Could you just kind of walk us through the difference between the initial guide and sort of where we are now?\nQuint Turner: Sure, Jack. This is Quint. I guess when you look at the year so far, of course, the biggest impacts, and we started seeing the pandemic effects in late February, was to our commercial passenger flying that Omni does. I mean just like all the other commercial pax carriers, it had a really significant impact. And so there, we were sort of heading into second quarter -- into the first quarter, but what we were fortunate in, in the first half was having these opportunities for charters because there were -- and that was as we said, on some of these repatriation-type missions, where we brought citizens back. Some of those charter opportunities were with the military, the Department of Defense and other governmental agencies. There were also some charters that we operated. We mentioned moving some energy workers. We did some ExxonMobil charters. We had -- and charter opportunities often come at a little higher margin, right? Because they're not regular consistent flying. And so, you typically generate nice bottom line effects from those. So, we were fortunate to replace the loss of our commercial flying as well as some curtailments on the military, the sort of regularly scheduled military-type rotations we were running, including the combis that ATI operates, the 757s, because the pandemic, of course, resulted in restrictions in some airports and some locales, getting in and out. And those, we were able to mitigate with some nice high-margin charter opportunities. And a lot of our DoD flying is considered essential. So, as we've said before, the military flying really has never stopped, although there had been effects. And so what that helped us do is, of course, post some really great -- we feel really good about our first half. As we look to the second half, those citizens that were displaced, of course, have been brought back. There may be some other charter opportunities, but we don't foresee it to the same degree. So the opportunity to mitigate sort of these ongoing effects of the pandemic on our commercial flying, our combi flying, to some degree -- and to some degree, the regular military flying will be reduced in the second half. And so you're really seeing more of the effects of the pandemic in the second half. Now, that could change, things could improve. Things could, I suppose, get worse. But that's sort of the guidance we have given for a lower second half EBITDA. And we have increased our guidance for the full year based on this really strong first half. We'd love to climb back near -- more closely to our initial guide range that we gave in February. But right now, we're foreseeing something $470 million or better.\nRich Corrado: There's one thing Quint didn't mention. It's a smaller issue, and that is our maintenance group did a lot of work for passenger airlines for Delta, for United, for Frontier, Allegiant, carriers like that, and they had aircraft in the hangar and they had aircraft scheduled for the remainder of the year. Those dried up, obviously, because those airplanes have been parked. Now, the MROs have been able to fill those slots with our own airplanes that had been put outside for C checks and things like that. So we're able to fill the hangars with our own work, but as you know, that revenue and profit gets eliminated in our consolidated profile.\nJack Atkins: So maybe kind of shifting gears for a moment and kind of stepping back and thinking about this significant growth that we've been seeing in ecommerce demand that's really been pulled forward by the pandemic. We're hearing about additional retailers that want to put speed first and sort of get the product to consumers quickly to compete with the likes of Amazon. What do you think that does to the outlook and the demand for the midsize freighter assets like yours? And are you -- as you look out over the next couple of years, Rich, is there anything in your mind that's slowing down the growth outlook for the type of assets that you guys put into service?\nRich Corrado: It's great question, Jack. I mean what we're seeing so far this year is that the two large customers that we service on a network basis, DHL and Amazon, are essentially flying right now at peak levels. And so -- and that was not an opportunity they had -- they could plan for. It's not like you know peak is coming in November or December, and you got all year to kind of get your ducks in line. And that spans right from pickup through line haul, through air, through delivery challenges. And at the same time, demand is picking up even more significantly because people who didn't use to order online are now ordering online. And some of the studies I've seen have said that about 60% of that's going to stick. So people who never ordered online before are -- 60% of them are going to continue to order online even after the pandemic is over. So all that said, it's one of the reasons we went from eight to 10 projected 767 this year to at least 12, and that's because we've kind of realigned the way we're deploying the 767s, because short term, we had a big jump from our existing customers to get more airplanes in the network quicker. We're currently flying just about everything we can. We've got two customers, as we noted, that were going to be returning 767-200s that have opted to hang on to them at least through the end of the year and probably into 2020. And so, the demand is really strong. Now, since the online ordering has picked up, all the projections I've seen is that it's going to continue in the future. And so what that means is not just this year, but going into 2021 and even into 2022, the demand for freighters is going to continue to be strong. I'll let Mike Berger, you can add any color if you...\nMike Berger: No, that's very solid stuff there, Rich. The other thing I would just add that, obviously, driving the demand is, belly freight is down 70%. So obviously, with the passenger folks, sitting a lot of planes on the deck, that's also driving an incredible demand for the freighters. And we're seeing freighter usage as an industry up 30-plus percent as well as block hours are up 7% to 11% over the last few months. And the great part about it, we're not only seeing the demand here in the US, but we're really seeing it around the globe. We had mentioned that we had first -- put our first lease in Mexico, for example, with MasAir a few weeks ago and further expansion with our customer in Malaysia with Raya Airways, and we anticipate at the -- for the end of the year, that will also expand into Africa. So the demand continues not only across the US, Jack, but also really around the globe.\nJack Atkins: Last question, I'll turn it over, but there's obviously quite a bit of passenger feedstock that's available for both the 767 and then the A321 because of what's happening with passenger air travel from the pandemic. How does that change feedstock cost for you guys? And sort of what are the implications for free cash flow over the next couple of years because of that?\nMike Berger: We hear and we see and we read all the feedstock that's coming available to the market. As it relates to the 76, though, for example, we really haven't seen, on a formal basis, Jack, those airplanes become available. There's been a lot of discussion about them or a lot of talk about them, but there's been no really formal communication in terms of RFPs and that type of stuff that we normally would see from the providers. In regards to the ones that we are seeing, the onesie-twosie that we're seeing out there in the market right now, the price of the 767 is actually very stable, if not increasing some, which is really quite interesting. In regards to the 321 as well, it's -- again, we anticipate quite a few of those coming on the market, but Rich gave some guidance in terms of where we see our investment over the next -- this year, over the next few years in the 321 itself.\nQuint Turner: And Jack, it's Quint. Regarding free cash flow, we had -- we discussed in the remarks earlier. The fact that we foresee increasing free cash flow as we look towards 2021, keep in mind, at the end of June, we add, I think, between aircraft and mod and -- 767-300s and mod and 300 staging for lease, we add 15 aircraft. As we sit here today, we have seven more committed feedstock purchases, four in the second half of this year and three next year. So that would bring you to, what, 22 available. And as we said, we have 20 newly moded 300 leases to deliver at least by the end of next year. So that one leaves a couple that kind of aren't sold of what we have committed to buy currently. Now we said we may buy a couple or more next year, which would mean we'd be delivering somewhere between 11 and 15 leases, if all of them got filled, and we committed to a couple more planes. But the guide in CapEx of $350 million is quite a reduction next year versus this year's $465 million. So we see a lot of free cash flow growth next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. Our next question comes from David Ross from Stifel.\nDavid Ross: I wanted to start out, Rich, one of your last comments there in the prepared remarks was about using capital in potentially a wide range of alternatives. There has to be demand from customers right now to get into the cargo charter market. How are you thinking about service extensions, product extensions to do more on that side of things?\nRich Corrado: Well, Dave, we are doing a little bit of charter work now. We -- what we'd call charter. And -- it's not part of our long-term strategy. We like to move charters into ACMI and then to leases, if we can. We -- in the fourth quarter of this year, we'll have several more aircraft out of maintenance, and we'll be able to expand on the -- what we do for peak in general every year with -- and we plan for those aircraft to be out of maintenance. But our view in the charter is, it's a short-term fluctuating thing. And although, it's a real spike right now and probably will be for the remainder of the year, when you look at our business model and how we've got these 20 aircraft tag with leases going forward and the ability to do more, we believe that it's a much better return to the shareholders for the money that we invest to have the long-term return on the assets that we buy and put into service. That said, we are doing as much chartering as we can, the aircraft that we have. As a matter of fact, we just signed a deal right now to put our combi up. Believe it or not, a combi that normally flies for the military since we've got less flying there, we're putting it up as just a freighter for one of our customers to take the place of the 737 for a week or two that's in maintenance. So everything we can fly, we are flying now, but we don't -- still don't think the charter is going to be a long-term part of our strategy because it really doesn't match the long-term investments that we make in the aircraft.\nDavid Ross: And then you mentioned the two temporary ACMI routes you're flying from Hong Kong to Sydney and Asia to the US. It seems like short-term multi-month contracts. What's going to happen to those planes when those contracts are over, do you think?\nRich Corrado: Well, yes, you're exactly right there. Those are lanes that were -- that are augmented what were formally -- some of that material was handled in belly space and some of it is just an increase in demand for the lanes that they're in. We believe both of them will go through the fourth quarter. The one that's in the Far East, it's flying between Hong Kong and Sydney, we think will go longer than that because we don't believe that there'll be enough charter -- enough passenger belly capacity back into service for quite a while. When we originally got into that platform, we were looking to handle that charter business for the rest of the year and then convert it to a dry lease, in fact. And that's still a possibility because we've -- it really just depends on the long-term needs of the customer that we're flying for DHL. But we anticipate that both of those routes will at least fly through the end of the year, and the one of this in the Far East will probably go longer into 2021.\nDavid Ross: And the last question is just on the staffing side. In the past, we've talked about some labor issues with mechanics in the hangars. Has that changed? Has that been more of an issue, less of an issue?\nRich Corrado: The best way I can tell you, a couple of things. One is, we anticipate that hiring will be easier through the rest of the year. There's a lot of airline personnel that will be available when the CARES Act period on no furloughs is up. Right now, it's still kind of tight, but we've made a number of changes in our -- some of our human resources policies and compensation. And we've actually reduced the turnover by 50% of our maintenance technicians, and we are having an easier time of finding people. We anticipate that it's going to be a lot easier to find people. Now, we noted in the prepared remarks, if you saw, that we're not happy necessarily with some of our line maintenance costs for our network operations, and that really goes into not so much our ability to hire people as it is in the frequency of the changes in the schedule. And in general, when you go into a market, you have to kind of rely on contracting that line maintenance out initially until you're able to train your own folks to go in and backfill. But we believe that the market will certainly get better. And in the meantime, we've made some changes on our own that have kind of solidified our workforce.\nOperator: Our following question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Did it work this time? Can you hear me?\nRich Corrado: Yes, of course. Loud and clear, Helane. We were worried about you.\nHelane Becker: I was worried about me, too. I could hear you perfectly fine, but whatever, I guess, this is how it goes. Thanks for all the help and the comments that you made. Just a couple of questions. When you think about like demand worldwide going into some of these new markets like Mexico, Africa, increasing in Indonesia, is -- in Malaysia. Is that something that long term we should think about is available to you? Or are these like one-offs that wouldn't be there if belly space was more readily available?\nMike Berger: Helane, it's Mike. We definitely think it's long term. And we're -- I mentioned Raya as a start. We placed our second aircraft with them. We anticipate further aircraft development with those folks in 2021. And we also anticipate further growth into Mexico with MasAir. Outside of -- outside the first delivery they took this year, we would anticipate another delivery in 2020 and also are quite confident we're going to enter into a longer-term opportunity with them over the next -- that will take us through the next three to five years or so. As it relates to Africa, we also, as I said, anticipate being in the market this year and are quite excited to get ourselves into that part of the world and do not see that as a one-and-done at all. In fact, we see that much as our growth plan as possible with the customers that we're working with. So we're quite excited about the future in Mexico and Southeast Asia and really excited to move into Africa as well. So, that should give you a little bit more color to your question.\nHelane Becker: And then, my other question is, I know that most of your customers are high quality and probably prompt payers. Do you -- are there any customers we should be aware of that are so impacted by the coronavirus that they're not paying on time?\nQuint Turner: Helane, this is Quint. I would say no. At this time, we're not foreseeing any collectability issues. As Rich commented, the customers for our MRO, the passenger carriers, of course, were impacted quite severely. And we did, of course, have discussions with them early in the year when the pandemic was settling in. And they have all performed as agreed and are paying their bills. So we really don't foresee a lot of issue. As you know, over 70% of our revenue is the DoD, Amazon and DHL.\nHelane Becker: Just that other revenue that you replace -- where you talked about, I think, in answer to Jack's question that you're replacing with your own maintenance.\nQuint Turner: And the cargo lessees, of course, have been seeing a lot of demand. So, unlike a lessor of passenger aircraft, we're not being approached with a lot of requests to defer rent or have those issues.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Benjamin from Truist Securities.\nStephanie Benjamin: I appreciate the update that you provided on just the A321. I think you mentioned FAA approval expected in the fourth quarter. Could you just remind us how that should play out, first, in the short to medium term with your current joint venture? And then long term, how you might be able to leverage that with your own leasing model? So how we should think about the impending approval?\nRich Corrado: So the way we're looking at this right now, we'll start our flight testing. Most of our ground testing is in process now or completed. And then we'll start our flight testing next month and look forward to the STC being approved for the one engine type. There's two different engine types on the airplane for the CFM56 engine. And I mean, once we've got that completed, then we're on our way. We're in the process of getting the second aircraft lined up for conversion. And then we've got a pipeline of about six customers with 14 aircraft that we're in conversations with. And they'll go into conversion next year. When you look at the way we're planning our capital spending as it relates to the A321, for the year 2021, it's really just involving kits to get prepped for conversions. Our MRO in Tampa, their conversion business, PEMCO, we're in the process of finalizing an agreement with our joint venture to be a converter of the A321 in Tampa, and we believe that we'll be able to convert up to four of the A321s in Tampa. There will be other conversion houses in other parts of the world that would be involved as well. And we don't anticipate being a lessor of the aircraft and investor in the airplane and conversion to be a lessor until late '21 into 2022 before we'd have that as an ongoing platform for investment. Our plan is in addition to the leasing and the conversion and being a party to the licensing of the STC, if our customers want us to fly, we'll put it on certificate and fly it, kind of wrapping the rest of our business model around it. So we'll have an A+ to CMI. And then also, obviously, our MROs are already well involved in doing maintenance on A321s today for their customers. So in that respect, we plan to have an even bigger business model around the A321 that we do around the 767.\nStephanie Benjamin: And then just lastly, obviously, stressing the plans and a reduction in CapEx next year and the continued cash flow improvement. Could you kind of discuss intentions from a capital allocation standpoint? What you would possibly focus on?\nRich Corrado: Well, I think we've got a situation right now where we've -- since we're going to be converting and having available several of the aircraft that are deploying next year, it will be in process this year. So next year's CapEx will be -- although there'll be a lot of airplanes deployed, the CapEx will certainly be lighter. And we'll have options to use that capital for other things or continue to grow the 767-300 fleet. The demand on the 767, just as evidenced in addition to the way that we're redeploying our 767-200s, is very strong, and that's a solid return as we've seen in the growth of that. We have, however, got kind of a more structured M&A program right now in terms of evaluating companies that are adjacencies that make sense to enhance the value proposition that we currently have for our customers to add even more value to what we currently do. So that's a potential. And then also, once we're through the restrictions that we have in the CARES Act, there would be a potential to return capital to shareholders.\nQuint Turner: And Stephanie, although we talk about CapEx of $350 million, or this year, $465 million, remember, the maintenance CapEx portion of that annually probably is on average around only $100 million. So, there's a significant amount of discretionary cash flow that we allocate to generate returns. And we have that ability going forward. As you know, back at the end of, what, 2018, we committed to buy a 20 aircraft fleet that have been operated by American Airlines. And we complete that next year. And as I said, if you look at committed aircraft purchases, you get -- next year, there's only three as we sit here today and nothing beyond that. So with only $100 million of annual CapEx and EBITDA heading, probably next year, we would hope somewhere north of $0.5 billion. There's a tremendous amount of cash flow that we can aim at generating attractive returns.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Howard Rosencrans from VA.\nHoward Rosencrans: I'm going to actually continue with exactly where you were in terms of -- with what you were talking about. The three planes -- and talking about the free cash flow, three planes are like $75 million. So please correct me -- when they are retrofitted. So aren't we really talking about the starting point for CapEx for '21 being $175 million?\nQuint Turner: Well, you've got 11 aircraft that you have to deliver to Amazon, Howard, next year based upon current orders. And remember, those aircraft are going to be in conversion -- many of those aircraft in conversion throughout next year. So you're going to have the conversion costs on those aircraft as well along with the maintenance capex that you mentioned.\nHoward Rosencrans: I thought most of the conversion on those was going to be done this year, but I...\nQuint Turner: Yes, there will be several that are largely done, but not 11, and you're still going to have to complete those conversions on the rest of the order.\nHoward Rosencrans: Would it be fair to say, just for kicks-and-giggles, if you were not to commit to further aircraft, sort of back of the envelope math, it seems to me that you would have at least another $50 million. So let's say, you would cut your capex to $300 million, that seems like -- I don't even really know how you could get to $300 million. But is it fair to say if you don't commit to more than $300 million, your real -- your capex is going to go sub-$300 million?\nQuint Turner: That's ballpark correct, Howard. I think that's correct.\nHoward Rosencrans: So I applaud you for what you've accomplished, not just this year but over many, many years, and I mean that very sincerely. It seems like what you guys do and what you've accomplished, that's certainly few and far between the companies that are performing this year along the lines of their original or very close to their original expectations. There's still a six multiple associated with this stock. No matter what goes on here, there's still a six multiple. So in some way, there's not -- we're sort of lacking a connection. As analysts, we'll get lost here, we'll go over the minutia, we'll decide if it's $470 million and whether next year is $500 million or $510 million, but the bigger picture message seems to get lost. And I'm just hopeful that you'll start redirecting that -- since it's going to get lost anyway, why not redirect the -- more free cash flow to sending that message to shareholders in the form of, I guess, formal share buybacks, but maybe initiating a modest dividend for those who can't own stocks that are -- I mean, you're going to go to substantially less than 3 times next year on your leverage ratio. That's the sort of bogey or bar, whatever that you were looking for to really move it in, I assume, a return of capital direction.\nQuint Turner: Howard, we certainly understand the sentiments that you're expressing here. And these are -- I think we all acknowledge, right, these are good problems to have, as the saying goes. We also recognize that the cash flow part of our story is a very powerful part of our story. We've been in growth mode because the demand has been so strong, and we feel like that was the right thing to do. Over the last couple of years, we invested a lot of capital, as you point out, to generate a lot of really long-term returns. Remember, we aim our CapEx at investments that are going to generate cash flow in the case of these Amazon leases, for a decade. And so, we think that was the right decision. If that environment, of course, changes as things do tend to change, we recognize that there are other ways to provide value to shareholders and -- as you have mentioned. So, those are part of the array of capital allocations that we can consider. As Rich stated, the legislation on the CARES funding put some moratorium on that, I think, through at least September of next year. But those are things that, depending upon the demand environment, are alternatives certainly to provide value. And those are things that we will, and we do consider, the Board considers as we look at the business. So these are good problems to have. I mean the short answer is there's -- this model is producing strong cash flows even in a stressed environment like we're in. And the trajectory we're on with the growth next year will provide continuing growth in cash flows even through 2022. So we look forward to wrestling with those issues, but we hear you. I don't know if that's the answer you're looking for, but\u2026\nHoward Rosencrans: It's only a high-class problem if you're not a shareholder. But anyway, thank you.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Howard.\nOperator: Our next question come from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So I'll keep it to one question. Obviously, this is a very unique time for anyone in aviation. And curious what are the obstacles to driving, say, 10% to 15% adjusted EBITDA growth through the next two to three years and getting your leverage down to 2 to 2.5x and possibly establishing perhaps a floor in high single-digit margins for ACMI. You have the expanded TSA, you did back with Amazon in June. I don't know if ATI has gotten the full lot there, but you look to have at least 1 passenger, belly capacity doesn't look like it's coming back to pre-COVID-19 levels for at least two, three years. So curious, why can't we see that sort of 10%, 15% EBITDA growth through this -- through a recovery?\nRich Corrado: So one of the things to keep in mind that right now, we're looking at 20 deployments of 767-300 freighters between now and the end of 2021 -- at least 20. And as we sit here today, there aren't too many companies that you can look at in today's economic environment that have their entire book of production, if you will, already booked through the next year, which will deliver results into 2022. Now we also have the opportunity to fly a lot of those 767-300s. The ones that go to Amazon, will have an opportunity to fly those as well. And we are looking at ways -- one of our key initiatives right now is trying to get more productive. You saw in my prepared remarks, I noted the line maintenance issue. And we believe that we'll have more profitability coming out of the ACMI segment as a result of that. And so when you look at the profitability we get out of the leases, we're -- we believe we can improve on our returns as it relates to the network flying that we do. And then, of course, we've got the military that remains stable in more market volatile times. We believe we'll be able to maximize our EBITDA returns as we go forward.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So just a follow-up there. So if we look at it, perhaps that a good chunk in the capacity that has perhaps competed with the cargo airlines is not coming back. And I realize that the way this model works, you need to add aircraft to grow. But organically speaking here, would it be fair to say that over a two to three year recovery period, you could kind of easily put up 8% to 10% EBITDA growth? Thanks.\nQuint Turner: Well, Chris, one of the things that drives -- of course, the biggest thing that drives our EBITDA is investment in additional aircraft. And so, again, the prior question we had from Howard, there is a sort of a balance, right? It's a cash flow story. So we look at EBITDA production, and we look at cash flows, net of investment, free cash flow, if you will, is also being important. So there's -- it's being able to sort of adjust based upon the demand environment to when it's a good idea to go all in sort of with investment and grow the EBITDA line, when it may be more wise to pull back somewhat, but generate more free cash flow. So, that's the sort of the situation. But if you're just looking at driving EBITDA organically, it requires a continued pretty substantial investment in capex. And of course, we're growing on a bigger base because our EBITDA has grown rapidly. We've seen double-digit-type EBITDA growth over the last several years. So, that becomes -- to put up 10%, 15% ever-growing number, it's requiring more investment.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Corrado for closing remarks.\nRich Corrado: Thank you, Sylvia. First, I'd like to thank all the ATSG employees. The agility, tenacity and creativity that they have shown on behalf of safety and servicing our customers has been extraordinary in very challenging times. Their performance has delivered the strong results for our customers and shareholders that we saw in the second quarter. Moving forward, the challenges remain, but the ATSG business model will continue to mitigate challenging fluctuations in business cycle demand. Our strong portfolio of long-term dry leases, our network flying for blue chip customers, including our position of flying passengers for the Department of Defense, all provide us immunization against market volatility. In closing, as we noted in our discussion, we have at least 20 newly converted 767-300 freighters to still deliver by the end of 2021, all of which will also contribute to our 2022 growth for a full year in service. The resulting cash flow and lower capex in 2021 will provide us with more options to deliver even better returns for our shareholders. Thank you for your interest in ATSG, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You many now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 1, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-05-10 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Q1 2020 Air Transport Services Group, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions].And I will now turn the call over to Joe Hete, CEO of ATSG. Sir, you may begin.\nJoe Hete: Thank you, John. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me today are Quint Turner, our Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Corrado, our President and my incoming replacement as CEO. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website, atsginc.com. We will file our Form 10-Q later this week.The first quarter of 2020 was a good one for us, but it also reflects a different world than when we last talked to you in early March. We are adapting to the coronavirus pandemic where necessary, but we are not compromising the core principles that have made us successful: safety in everything we do, superior customer service and solid returns on your investments in us.Throughout the first quarter, our business was on a strong pace with solid increases over the first quarter of 2019, including results from Omni for each period. Revenues increased by 12% to $389 million and adjusted earnings, minus warrant and other effects, were up 13%, which translated to $0.43 per share, up $0.06. On a similar basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $124 million.Our airline operations were particularly strong in the first quarter. And that pace continues through today for the cargo portion of their work, principally for Amazon and DHL, who are benefiting from a surge in e-commerce activity. Meanwhile, our CAM leasing business remains solid and is still on track to lease 8 to 10 newly converted 767 freighters this year, including at least 4 for Amazon and 3 for UPS.Quint is ready to flesh out those consolidated results. Rich will cover our segments and operating highlights. And I'll close with more comments on our new, more focused outlook for the second quarter. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Joe, and thanks to all of you on the call for joining us this morning. As always, I'll start by saying that during the course of this call, we will make projections or other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call. And Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes.These factors include, but are not limited to, the following, which relate to the current COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn; our expectations regarding the receipt of funds by 2 of our subsidiary airlines pursuant to the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act and the final terms of the grants issued through such program; the potential for reduced flight operations, disruptions to our workforce and staffing capability; the impact on our customers' creditworthiness and the continuing ability of our vendors and third-party service providers to maintain customary service levels; and other factors that could impact the market demand for our assets and services, including our airlines -- our operating airlines' ability to maintain on-time service and control costs; the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration; fluctuations in ATSG's traded share price and in interest rates, which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments; the number, timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers; our ability to remain in compliance with our agreements with key customers and lenders; changes in general economic and/or industry-specific conditions; and other factors as contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-Q we will file this week.We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials, and we advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website.As Joe said, our first quarter results were very good on both the top and bottom lines. Both before and since the coronavirus pandemic caused widespread curtailment of economic activity in March, our air cargo business has been solid, reflecting our customers' imperative to move essential supplies rapidly to help abate the spread of infection and support stay-at-home guidelines.On a consolidated basis, first quarter revenues were $389 million, up $41 million or 12% from the prior year. That gain stems primarily from more aircraft in service and expanded airline operations. Block hours rose 31% versus the first quarter last year. The Department of Defense remained ATSG's largest customer, representing 30% of our revenues for the first quarter. 29% of revenues came from Amazon and 11% from DHL.On a GAAP basis, first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $134 million versus $23 million a year ago. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $2.27 per share basic versus $0.38 a year ago. The 22% decline in the price of ATSG's common shares during the first quarter had the largest impact on our GAAP earnings. That triggered an unrealized reduction in the value of our warrant liabilities with a corresponding gain in income. None of the warrants ATSG has issued to Amazon have been exercised.ATSG's operating expenses increased by $38 million or 13% over last year. Salaries, wages and benefits increased 26% as our airlines added pilots over the last 12 months to crew additional 767 freighters for Amazon. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 11% as the CAM-owned fleet increased. Maintenance expense decreased primarily due to some external MRO customers reducing their scheduled maintenance commitments in March, along with reduced unscheduled engine repairs at our airlines. Fuel costs increased 25%. In midyear last year, Amazon started up a regional hub in the Wilmington Air Park and logistics services took over fueling operations for aircraft at that location.Interest expense decreased more than $1 million to $16 million for the quarter. The change reflects lower effective interest rates stemming from ATSG's unsecured debt offering in January and from reductions in lender pricing and market rates for our variable rate debt. Several, mostly noncash items in our GAAP earnings, continued to obscure our operating performance in the first quarter. This time, we recorded unrealized gains and losses in our warrant and interest rate derivative liabilities amounting to net $108 million gain after tax compared with a $5 million net gain on the same basis in the first quarter of 2019.On a net basis, this and other items reduced our reported GAAP diluted EPS by $0.41 per share versus a $0.12 increase in the first quarter last year. Our adjusted earnings, EPS and adjusted EBITDA exclude those mostly noncash items. As a result, our adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.43 versus $0.37 a year ago, up 16%. On the same basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased from $114 million to $124 million or 9% for the quarter.We spent $143 million on CapEx during the first quarter, including $105 million to purchase 5 767-300 aircraft and to continue freighter modification on those being ready for customer deliveries. We still expect a 2020 CapEx spend of about $420 million, mostly to acquire and modify more 767s for deployment through next year. Joe will share more about our fleet development progress shortly.We ended the first quarter with significant borrowing capacity, thanks to the fortuitous timing of our unsecured $500 million bond offering at the end of January. We used that to reduce our outstanding secured revolver borrowings, giving us significant liquidity. At present, under terms of our senior secured credit facility, we have access to additional borrowings under our revolver of approximately $300 million. Our total debt to adjusted EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 3.6x. We expect to continue to benefit the remainder of the year from lower interest costs tied to LIBOR on our variable rate debt.As we told the market last night in our earnings release, 2 of ATSG's subsidiary air carriers, Omni Air and ATI, which carry passengers, each submitted an application for worker protection grant funds available under the CARES Act. ABX Air, an all-cargo airline, has not been significantly impacted by the coronavirus and is not expected to participate in the program.In late April, Omni received notification from the Treasury Department that its application for grant funds under the Payroll Support Program has received preliminary approval and that it can expect to receive approximately $67 million to be paid in monthly installments through September. ATI's application for a grant under the Payroll Support Program is pending. Our air carriers intend to use these funds to maintain their respective airline staffing necessary to serve the Department of Defense and commercial customers during an extended period of economic uncertainty due to the pandemic. That summarizes our consolidated financial results for the quarter.Rich is ready to share some segment highlights. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint. Over the past two years, the principal factor in our earnings growth has been the improvement at our airline. That progress continues in 2020. ACMI Services on a pretax basis earned $18 million in the first quarter, up $6 million from a year ago. The three airlines earned revenue from the operation of 69 aircraft at the end of the quarter, six more than a year ago. That includes 35 freighters we lease to customers and operate on a CMI basis.Increased support for Amazon drove the bulk of that gain, thanks to 8 more 767s we operate for them, 6 of which were CAM-leased last year. Also, the prior year's maintenance expense included higher costs for unscheduled engine repairs and crew training for Amazon assignment. Interest expense allocated to our airline segment, mostly from debt used to fund the Omni acquisition, was lower than a year ago due mainly to lower rates associated with the repricing of our variable rate loans and our unsecured notes offering in January.The pandemic had a limited effect on our ACMI operations in the first quarter. It began with reduced combi flying by ATI to remote military installations in late February and extended to reduced commercial and contracted military passenger flying for Omni in mid-March. Several ad hoc assignments for the federal government in March offset part of the cuts to contracted flying. Those ad hoc assignments have continued in April but are anticipated to decline during the second quarter.CAM, our leasing business, performed as expected, with pretax earnings of $16 million, slightly below what it earned a year ago. Earnings from the larger leased fleet were offset by a $4 million increase in depreciation and amortization and a $300,000 increase in interest expense, both tied to its expanded fleet and capital requirement.CAM deployed a third converted 76 freighter to UPS during the quarter. It also accepted lease returns of 3 freighter aircraft: 1 767-200; 1 757-200; 1 737-400. We expect to complete the sale of the 737-400 freighter in the second quarter. CAM has purchased 4 feedstock 767s for conversion to freighters and 1 existing 767 freighter this year. At the end of the quarter, CAM had 12 767s in or awaiting conversion to freighters, all of which we expect to deploy this year or in 2021.Results of our businesses, grouped as other activities, included $10 million in first quarter customer revenue growth but minimal pretax earnings. The lower margins reflect Amazon's decisions to in-source some of the gateway services that our logistics services unit had performed for them in the prior year. We also had a different mix of scheduled heavy maintenance work and higher low-margin jet fuel sales at Wilmington aircraft and the Amazon network. During the quarter, logistics services and its subsidiary, TriFactor, announced a new agreement with the U.S. Postal Service to design, develop and manage a new USPS regional sorting center in Aurora, Illinois. The new center is scheduled to start up in the third quarter.Overall, the ATSG businesses performed well during the winter season with minimal aircraft downtimes and good on-time performance over the express network routes we cover. Our dedication to continuous improvement programs across our operating business also continues to pay off. As with all businesses, the pandemic has led to changes in our operating procedures to protect the health of our employees and that of our customers. But it has also created opportunities for us to be part of the solution, carrying medical supplies and other essential goods rapidly to U.S. destinations and supporting others on similar missions.Like the rest of the logistics industry, we and our employees know that we continue to play a vital role in our nation's recovery from one of the worst episodes in its history. At ATSG, our employees have stepped up with creative solutions that are focused on safety and service for our customers. But adjusting to the speed and scope of recovery will present challenges for many months. We have continuously demonstrated our agility in the past. And this will serve us well going forward.I'm confident, however, that the vulnerabilities that the pandemic has exposed demonstrate that the strategic importance of commercial air cargo and outsourced military air transport will become greater than ever. We are seeing new awareness of the need to onshore the production and storage of vital commodities versus relying on international suppliers, which bodes well for the regional air networks that we serve.This adds to the expectation that the increase in e-commerce shopping and air fulfillment will lead to lasting changes in buying habits. And we expect that it will be many months, if not years, before the major passenger airlines fully restore their networks. So cargo carriers can expect to receive volume that had traveled in belly space with passenger jets for some time to come. We will keep you up to date on how our business evolves and grows as these trends play out.With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Rich. I wish we're able to hand you the CEO role and begin my retirement under more favorable circumstances. But the management team you will lead has already shown that they are more than up to the challenges ahead. That team includes talented and battle-tested leaders in each of our business units. Our operating teams down the line are full of people who can extend ATSG's record of exceptional performance. The ATSG businesses have responded with fresh thinking, innovative solutions and close cooperation with customers that need their support now more than ever as the coronavirus unsettles the economy and our industry.You may have heard that our maintenance techs here in Wilmington responded on short notice and under very tight deadline when we are called to modify avionics on the 767 that normally carries the New England Patriots. They were sending that plane on a special mission to China, its first trip to Asia, to bring back more than 1 million masks for health care workers in the Boston area. We have also worked closely with DHL and Amazon to protect the people who handle the cargoes we carry by adopting new sanitizing and shielding practices. Those measures will remain in place and become stronger as this crisis unfolds.As Rich noted, Omni's military business has been more significantly affected in the second quarter due to a global curtailment of nonessential troop movements to limit coronavirus spread among U.S. forces. Omni stands ready to pick up the pace when those movements resume and for the ad hoc transport that is likely to continue as well. That service included providing passenger capacity to repatriate Americans who were stranded abroad when the pandemic unfolded.As evidenced by our 31% growth in block hours, the ATSG airlines remain very busy through the winter, mainly in support of Amazon's air network. We expect those operations to continue to grow, and we are already recruiting and training the pilots that will fly at least 4 additional Amazon 767s we will deploy for them later this year. We now own all the 767s we expect to deploy as newly converted freighters this year, plus a few that will fill orders for delivery next year.The 8 to 10 767-300 freighters we expect to convert and deploy this year will complete a decade of rapid growth in the medium wide-body component of our fleet. This will bring us to 50 767-300 freighters our airlines will operate by the end of 2020 compared with just one at the end of 2010. We expected aircraft type to remain the primary component of regional air cargo networks for many years to come, and we will continue to deploy them at a similar rate in 2021.At the same time, becoming a major aircraft lessor means coping with aircraft returns as customers' needs change. We will receive some aircraft back from external lease and ACMI deployments this year. Transitioning costs and loss of lease revenue from those aircraft will offset some of the gains from leases of newly converted 767s.Our 767-300 investments will continue, even as we pursue opportunities with other types, as evidenced by our joint venture investment in the STC for the passenger-to-freighter conversion of Airbus A321s. We expect them to replace, at a minimum, the more than 300 757 freighters now in operations and also be the preferred narrow-body choice for our customers who operate regional air networks for many years to come.Quint mentioned that our CapEx guidance for 2020 remains at $420 million, which will be down $34 million from our 2019 spend. We have access to additional 767 feedstock under our arrangement with Jetran and available conversion slots, if needed. At the same time, we are boosting our 767 passenger capacity at Omni this year with one leased-in aircraft in the first quarter and another one in the third. These fulfill Omni's commitments to a third-party lessor made before we acquired Omni in 2018. We are pursuing both military and commercial options for them as they arrive. When we last spoke with you in early March, the coronavirus was already sweeping the globe and beginning to affect both our cargo and passenger flying for the military. But the broad-scale contraction of economic activity that followed soon after was beyond what anyone anticipated at the time.I want to affirm that 2020 will be a growth year for adjusted EBITDA, the yardstick we choose to measure our progress. We expect to exceed the $452 million we delivered for 2019, but are currently not able to forecast how strong that growth will be. Instead, we are providing guidance of $110 million to $115 million for the second quarter alone. That's $5 million to $10 million more than the $105 million in adjusted EBITDA we generated in the second quarter last year. I'm confident that if the economic recovery from the pandemic continues and once the military reopens its transport network, Rich and Quint will be able to revisit 2020 guidance when they report third quarter results next August.ATSG is fortunate in that its leasing operations are centered on freighter aircraft for customers who have not seen the demand disruption of passenger operators. In fact, we continue to see significant customer interest in long-term leases for freighter aircraft. The only passenger aircraft we own are primarily utilized to service the U.S. military and other governmental agencies with limited exposure to commercial passenger operations. Once virus suppression efforts are relaxed, we expect the demand from our governmental customers to return to historic levels quickly. That concludes our prepared remarks, John.We're ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jack Atkins from Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Congratulations on a great quarter. So a lot of places we could go here. I'm going to ask a handful and then jump back in queue. But well, I guess, maybe if we could just sort of start off with the places in your business where the pandemic and the containment efforts related to COVID-19 are impacting things. I'm just -- it sounds like it's principally related to military flying at Omni. It doesn't sound like you saw much of that in the first quarter. And then is it impacting your MRO operations as well? And how does all this play together with the CARES Act funding, Quint, that you're receiving? I just want to make sure we understand how it's all flowing together.\nQuint Turner: Yes. Good questions, Jack. The -- as we mentioned in the release, the passenger business that we have, we have a little bit at ATI with the combi. And of course, Omni is a passenger carrier. So those were the areas most impacted and the ones we expect to be impacted the most going forward. The flights for the military, the Department of Defense, particularly for May and June, we're expecting to be perhaps down. Actually, through the first quarter, even though there was some reduction as early as late February and into March for the combi, we were able, really pretty much into April -- through April to continue to have chances to do ad hoc moves for the Department of Defense.There was some repatriations of American citizens that were abroad and so forth that helped offset that. But the DOD has put some restrictions in place. And for some of the troop movements that will be more evident in May and going forward, we'll just have to see how long that persists and how it plays out. You also mentioned the MROs. And as you know, we do a mix of our owned aircraft and aircraft that our lessees use. And that's probably, what, about 50% to -- 50% of the business, then about half of it is external customers, passenger carriers, we do Frontier and American...\nRich Corrado: United and Delta.\nQuint Turner: United and Delta. And given what's going on in the passenger side, that business is likely to be scaled back as we go forward. But where we have opportunities as we can bring in more in-house of our own aircraft, we were planning on actually farming some of our maintenance checks out this year because of the amount of external business we had. So we had the ability to pull some of that back in and avoid that external cost, which is nice, given our business model.As far as the CARES funding goes, the CARES funding was aimed at airlines. So it was not aimed at MROs. But of course, as business volumes are impacted in MROs, we have the ability to reduce our costs, make changes in staffing and so forth based on the volume of work that they have. So we'll be able to deal with that, we feel, going forward. And we, of course, disclosed in our release the situation with the CARES funding. We've been told that Omni has been approved for $67 million, which will certainly help offset the impacts there, and the ATI application remains pending at this time.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Got you. Thank you for all that additional color there, Quint. And so I guess as we sort of think about 2021, obviously, there's a lot of different moving pieces in 2020. But when you think about the longer-term impacts from COVID-19 on your business and you think about how that would play out, I'm not asking for 2021 guidance, obviously. But I mean is there any reason to think that any of these different -- there's any structural change to your earnings power when you look out in 2021 relative to sort of the way you were thinking about it 90 days ago from all of this?\nQuint Turner: Well, certainly on -- to the extent that impacts to the passenger side of the business linger, there's always a chance for some spillover of that, although the majority of our passenger flying is done for the military. And where we think we are fortunate is that when restrictions ease and begin to be lifted, troops need to be deployed, redeployed. And so we see that demand is coming back to historic levels rather quickly once those restrictions are eased, unlike the commercial passenger side, where, I think, the pace at which demand comes back is more in question.Now Omni does do a little bit of commercial passenger flying. They have some vacations business. They fly and have flown for many years, for example, for folks traveling from Hawaii to Las Vegas. And just as with the rest of the commercial passenger market, that was impacted. It's not a particularly large piece of business though in the overall scheme of things for ATSG. And on the cargo side, as you're alluding to, we -- that's done -- that's been strong and demand for our lift and our services there remains strong. So as we look at 2021, provided that the world makes some progress at all with this virus, we see us less impacted certainly than many others who have more persistent lingering effects.\nRich Corrado: I think Jack, I think, it's important to note also on the leasing side, we've got a number of aircraft conversion now that will come out towards the end of the year. That will be deployed in 2021. And we've seen no degradation in the demand for the 2021 converted freighters that will be leasing as well. So still strong demand for the folks that need freighters.\nJack Atkins: Okay. That's great, Rich. And I guess that leads into my last question, and I'll turn it over, but -- and this was going to be for you. But could you talk about the extent to which ATSG is benefiting from lower passenger belly space, both in -- whether that's in the domestic market or internationally. And given this -- what feels like a structural shift and acceleration of the move towards B2C and e-commerce, what are you hearing from additional customers who maybe wanted to set up their own networks, maybe a smaller version of what you're doing for somebody like an Amazon? Is that beginning to sort of percolate a little bit?\nRich Corrado: No. We haven't heard from any new customers wanting to establish new networks at this point. We've had some conversations in the past. Nothing is accelerating on that. And in general, in the market, I think you know that with the 85% to 90% of the passenger flying, not going on right now, the belly capacity, particularly with the larger long-haul jets, is not available right now. And so even though air cargo, in general, is down, the capacity is down even more because of the passenger jets being down. So there's more volume for main deck freighters than they normally would be. So there's a heavy demand right now. We're seeing a lot of requests for charters. We are currently bidding a couple of long-haul charters that will last for months, the regular routes for existing customers that we're hoping to get. We don't keep a lot of assets around and crews around to fly charter work. So these are coming out of some other deployments that are transitioning. And so it's kind of fortuitous for us, so heavy demand.We've also had hundreds of requests to Omni to fly cargo. And obviously, it's complex. And the U.S. regulatory basis has been a little bit behind the rest of the world in allowing cargo in the upper deck. So we're just now getting into the ability to reconfigure the aircraft. So where that goes, we're not sure because the cargo rates are very volatile, they're high because of the lack of capacity in the long-haul lanes. But we think we'll get some good long-term business out of this for some longer routes. And one thing is for sure is that the network flying that we do is very strong and looks to be so for a long time to come.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Great. And Joe, congratulations again on your semi-retirement here.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Jack.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Ross from Stifel.\nDavid Ross: Based on the current pipeline backlog that you guys were talking about, how much growth CapEx is going to be left for 2021, assuming that you don't add any more new contracts or new planes to the mix? We think most is being spent this year for both 2020 and 2021 growth. But how much might be left for next year, for next year's growth?\nQuint Turner: Well, Dave, we think -- this is Quint. We think right now in terms of looking at just feedstock procurement, we expect to take, I think, 5 aircraft next year, 5 new airframes as feedstock for conversion. Otherwise -- and you compare that to this year, where we're taking 8 aircraft, and we're -- by the end of the year, I think Rich will have, what, 3 aircraft that are pretty much converted that are waiting for 2021 deployment. So the investment for those will all be in.\nRich Corrado: Correct.\nQuint Turner: I think that we continue to expect next year to be, CapEx-wise, down versus 2020. We're not prepared to give specific guidance on it, of course, today. But it will be a fairly significant decline in CapEx next year, we believe.\nJoe Hete: One of the things we'll be looking at next year as well, Dave, is starting to potentially make investments in the 321. We still expect to get our STC for the cargo conversion this year. And look forward to starting to add that to our leased fleet in 2021.\nDavid Ross: And given the growth in the fleet, where would you say maintenance CapEx sits right now, Quint, up $90 million, $100 million?\nQuint Turner: That's approximately correct, Dave. Yes.\nJoe Hete: Yes. Just keep in mind, under the business model that, the customer's responsibility when we lease them an aircraft for the heavy maintenance piece. We obviously carry the legacy 767-200 fleet as part of our maintenance CapEx. But for all the third-party leases, that becomes the lessees' responsibility.\nDavid Ross: And then last question is just around the Amazon CVG hub and the build-out there. Any updates on when you think that's going to be ready to fly and impacts for ATSG and its operations?\nRich Corrado: We really don't get a lot of guidance out of Amazon in that respect. But just based on what it looks like right now from the construction, probably late 2021 before they start operating out of that, maybe 2022. They would know better.\nDavid Ross: And you guys still have room at Wilmington to grow in the meantime?\nRich Corrado: Yes. There's plenty of room in Wilmington. I mean we used to fly 115 aircraft out of here. And I think the Amazon operation is in the 10% to 15% right now. I don't think they plan to get it much bigger than that. But again, they don't share their plans with us until we need to know.\nJoe Hete: Need-to-know basis.\nOperator: Our next question is from Helane Becker from Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Joe, it has been a pleasure. And while you are leaving the business in good hands, I will still miss you. Now for my questions, are you noticing the price of 767 feedstock? First of all, there's obviously a lot that are being parked than a lot that more being retired, right? So are you noticing prices coming down? And can you go back and renegotiate any of the prices that haven't delivered yet?\nRich Corrado: Helane, it's Rich. So there's some bids out now for handfuls of planes that were probably already in process. It generally takes an airline a little bit of time to package up fleets. Or anything of significant size, they have to get their records together, the engine records together. So we haven't -- we know there's more coming, certainly. And until you get into the bidding and the negotiation piece, it's difficult to say. Supply and demand would tell you that there's going to be more in the market, and therefore, the price should come down. But engines drive a lot of what the value is on the airframe. And of course, the conversion is -- that price is around $15 million, about half of what you'd expect of the total cost to be. So that's not going to change. So we expect that the prices will come down. As far as renegotiating what we've currently got in the pipeline, that's not really what we're looking at, at this point in time. But we think we still have a good value and will produce a good product and that will be -- have a competitive lease rate at the end of the day.\nHelane Becker: Right. Okay. And then my other question is, what's the right mix of new aircraft and number of lease expiries every year that you think makes sense for the business?\nJoe Hete: That's a pretty wide-open question, Helane. I mean when you think about the number of aircraft, obviously, market demand is going to dictate what we continue to acquire over time. And if you look at our history in terms of our leases, for example, a lot of them come in bunches on a calendar year basis. You've got the DHL, which runs through 2022, for a number of aircraft, and then you start looking at when we started the Amazon business in terms of potential returns. But by the same token, you look at it and say, \"Well, heck, where are they going to replace those number of aircraft in such a short order?\"So our expectation is generally, those leases are going to get rolled over. And if they do, then it's really a function of keeping up with what the market growth requirements are. At some point in time, you're going to see it peaking as far as, at least I believe so, in terms of the number of 767s that will be demanded by the market. There will be some upgrades from the 200s to the 300s over time. But that's one of the reasons we got into the 321 is we think that's going to be the next real growth opportunity from a cargo conversion -- converted freighter perspective.\nHelane Becker: Great. Got you. And then the other question I have is your 3 customers provide a big percentage of the business. And Joe, you and I go back to the start when, I know, ATSG's predecessor was spun out from Airborne. And you had one customer, it was all your revenue. And you've done, over the years, an amazing job of diversifying the business. And in some years, given really sort of bad -- being dealt a bad hand in some years that we can reminisce over at some point in our future.But what are the opportunities for other growth? Like I don't know if you or Rich want to answer this. But where do you think the business should trend -- I mean I know Amazon is going to keep adding more business, right? We think they need to scale up to something like 200 aircraft. But what's the right mix there for diversification? And what are the opportunities that you see?\nJoe Hete: Helane, I'll let Rich answer the future piece. But to your earlier point, you do go back to -- with us all the way to day 1 essentially, when DHL was 99% of our book of business. I remember you showed up for our first shareholder meeting here in Wilmington way back when. And so you're the one person that's been with us through thick and thin. And we've had a lot of thick and we've had a lot of thin over that period of time. So before you sign off, I just want to say it's been a pleasure working with you as well. And with that, I'll turn it over to Corrado to talk about where things -- he sees things going.\nRich Corrado: No, it's a good question, Helane, and one we frequently discuss here because it is what we do is try to grow the company, right? So the 767 market is going to continue for several years. We think it's a strong market. They're still building new freighters. And there's -- as we already discussed, there's more feedstock coming available. So we plan to continue to drive that as long as the demand is there. We've invested in the A321, and we're hoping to get the STC approved midyear this year and then start putting that aircraft into the same business model we have today, in fact, extending it because we'll have the STC. We would like to convert it in -- at PEMCO as we do 737s now, lease the airplane, fly the airplane if our customers want us to, et cetera, et cetera, so we can build a nice business model around it. It's a replacement for the 757, which has an installed base of over 300 in the market right now. So it's a significant market opportunity, plus it can compete with the 737-400 installed base. So it's got a very flexible opportunity for us. So that's one area of growth that we think.And keep in mind that when you look in to grow aircraft, it comes from 2 places. One is growth in cargo, so as the market grows. And the other one is for replacement. And the A321 is a solid replacement for the 757, which is getting long in the tooth at this point. So that's one area that we're heavily focused on, continuing to grow the 767, transition into the A321 as an additional growth platform. And the other thing is we've always managed the company with a conservative balance sheet. Of course, we spent some money on Omni. And we've got -- I think we're at 3.5x roughly right now EBITDA on our debt. And we traditionally float around between 2 and 2.5. And we're managing the company and managing the growth to drive towards that again. And the reason for that is to remain flexible to M&A opportunities in adjacencies and opportunities that enhance the business model and diversify the revenue base further. So those are the 2 areas where I think we have the strongest opportunity for growth in the future: one, building on our expertise and our business model and our differentiated business model today; and the other one, looking for opportunities to differentiate -- to diversify the revenue and build the company growth going forward.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna International.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So on the military side with the stop order movements, could you give us a sense of where we are in terms of utilization levels and any indication that those might improve? I'm guessing that the military passengers will fly before we do for obvious reasons. And then you alluded to in an earlier question the opportunity to potentially use these for main deck ops. But it sounded like there were some regulatory issues there. What's the likelihood that you could repurpose those aircraft and use them for freight?\nRich Corrado: On your first question on the military side, so the military order was to cut back on nonessential troop movements. So they still have been moving troops, but it's just been cut back. I believe we've been told around mid-June, they should start to ramp that back up. The other governor on that, if you will, is the airports that those military routes fly through. The initial restriction that interrupted some of our flying, particularly on the combi basis, but also on some of the Omni routes was that the airport routings that we went through were not available to us to smoothly run the route. For example, you couldn't fly from Singapore into Bahrain. And that was part of a normal route for us. And so that had to be rerouted in some of the flying change. So that's one of the restrictions. So we're looking for mid-June for that to snap back. We believe that the passenger flying as it relates to the military will be more of a V-shape than what you'll see in the passenger environment with leisure and business travel, where that will probably be a much slower role to come back.As it relates to Omni's utilization for its potential for main deck cargo on the passenger jet, a couple of things. One is we haven't had the capability yet because those 777s have been utilized, either for military routes or for repatriation of Americans abroad. And so they probably wouldn't be available until June as we're looking at it now. We believe that the approvals are now in for the way in which you can put cargo in the upper deck. And so there's opportunity to do that. That's not a long-term business profile. It's more of an opportunistic solution to support mostly PPE movements. Generally, you're not going to -- the cargo rates for flying that do not support the level of freight that you would get in a converted or using cargo in the upper deck of a passenger jet. So as soon as those moves come down, that business goes away. So it would only be an opportunity to utilize those jets if they're available.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then there was also -- you made some comments earlier about you've had some interest in the charter market or short-term ACMI, which is an area historically you haven't participated in. Can you give us some more color there?\nRich Corrado: Yes. So we -- because the military -- we've got some military routes that we fly cargo on, ATI and ABX fly every other week, certain routes. So in the last weeks, we do have some assets available. And so we've been able to get a few charter routes that way. But it's not a regular thing that we count on or look to establish kind of an ongoing revenue and profit stream out of that business. We just look to kind of utilize our excess capacity, which is not as predictable as companies that keep assets around as a charter business. We find that investing in a long-term asset like an airplane and using it in the charter market is not a good long-term strategy for that asset. We'd rather lease it or get long-term ACMI or CMI agreements on that asset.As I said, I think, in my remarks earlier, we do have a couple of long-term routes that because, as an example, the 757 flying that we had from DHL is transitioning. We're down to 2 aircraft. We had 4, we were down 2 last month. Those crews, they could, becoming available. And so we're looking to do some additional flying, some long-term routes for existing customers using those crews and available aircraft to take advantage of that. So that's good. It's fortuitous. And it's going to add to our plan going forward for the rest of the year.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then two questions for Quint. Quint, your liquidity exiting the quarter and assuming that there's no pickup in Omni and if this doesn't come back in June, what the -- how we should think about the drag on cash through the quarter for that piece of business? And then in your prepared remarks, you spoke about keeping an eye on the credit of your customers now, Amazon, DHL, UPS, high credit customers. But I'm curious if you could just give some color on your other book of business.\nQuint Turner: Yes. Chris, as we noted, we purchased 5 of the 8 aircraft in our CapEx in the first quarter. So we had, what, $143 million we spent in the first quarter. So we'll see, on a sequential basis, some reduction, right, in terms of what we're spending for CapEx as we move through the year. So that will help our cash position certainly. And then we spoke about the CARES funding for Omni, which certainly will help with that as well. ATI application is pending. So we really anticipate, and you can see that we're saying that in our guidance that we expect as best we can project that we will still exceed last year's adjusted EBITDA of $452 million, $453 million.So I mean I think we'll be in good shape liquidity-wise. Certainly, as we said in the remarks earlier, having completed the bond offering at the end of January gave us a lot of flexibility. And the business model we have that has certainly helped insulate us. If you think about the cargo side, that business really remains strong. And we have in some sort of a scenario where we really, for whatever reason, had to pull back harder. A lot of our capital spending is in the conversions itself, which gives us some flexibility, further flexibility, should we need it. So I think we'll be in good shape cash flow-wise.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: And then on credit with your sort of customers outside of Amazon, DHL, UPS, how we should think about that?\nQuint Turner: Well, of course, as Rich mentioned, the cargo business, particularly in the network operator, integrators, has remained really strong. And so no issues there. The DOD is a great payer. We just need that business to get back to its full volume that it was at previously. And I guess, from our standpoint, it would be more at the MRO location where we do have, as we said, some external customers, some of the big flag carriers that we operate with. And of course, they were participants in the CARES Act as well. They have scaled back their business volumes with us. And in some cases, they've cleaned up outstanding amounts. And we feel good about where we are at in terms of receivable position from those customers. So we really don't anticipate any issues with that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve O'Hara from Sidoti & Company.\nStephen O'Hara: Yes. First, I'd just echo the comments by everyone else. Joe, it's been a pleasure. And I know it's tough to leave at a time like this, but it seems like timing is pretty good, could be worse.\nJoe Hete: I did miss our annual road trip, Steve, through Ohio.\nStephen O'Hara: I know. I'll have to christen Rich on that. So I guess just in terms of the outlook for 2020. I mean is the current expectation that 2Q is kind of your toughest comp here, given the -- I mean it seems like the cargo side is performing pretty well. Obviously, the MRO, there's some questions there. But with military maybe coming back or beginning to come back in June, would you expect 2Q to be kind of the toughest comp?\nQuint Turner: Well, I think you hit on the key is at the pace at which things come back and the degree to which things come back, particularly on the military side, based -- assuming that things do resume to something resembling normal operations by the third quarter, I think it's fair to say second quarter does present perhaps the biggest comp. We still expect that cargo business to remain strong. And of course, the leases that we have, we're fortunate again that we're a lessor, but we really don't -- we concentrate on cargo leases and the cargo business has remained robust, and the demand is strong, as Rich said earlier, and the passenger aircraft that we have in our portfolio are primarily operated for the military and other governmental agencies. So I would say you're correct, Steve, the second quarter probably is a little bit the one that is probably most in question, I guess.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay. And then just in terms of the aircraft coming online, and I know Amazon is lined up to take a number of those, but when you talk about demand strength, are you seeing kind of improving demand in terms of long-term desire to kind of take these aircraft under contract, assuming kind of a swifter economic recovery? Or is this maybe people thinking this is kind of a new normal in terms of cargo demand? And I guess that's on a regional basis more so than long haul.\nRich Corrado: Yes, this is Rich. So the demand profile from our existing customers hasn't changed. The aircraft that are in queue for those folks are -- they remain in queue, they remain focused on taking those airplanes. And as it relates to other markets and other opportunities, there's a large level of interested folks inquiring, if you will, about things. But you look at some of these -- some parts of the world and some of the smaller groups and things like that, and it's more inquiry than it is kind of solid opportunity with an existing airline that's looking to add the 76 freighter. And so we would question the credit opportunity. So it's kind of a dual market out there. The existing strong credit folks that we deal with and the existing customers that we have are growing, and they're looking to take more aircraft. There's more inquiry from folks that need a lot more diligence on our part before we get into some of those parts of the world.Other than the ones we've talked about, the Amazon and the UPS jets that are going in this year, we've got an existing operator in Malaysia that's looking to take an additional 200 that's in paint right now. And we've got another 300 going to another air carrier in the Americas. So good demand outside the core large customers that we deal with. And we look for that to be strong going forward. But the other thing I should say is on the A321, I didn't mention before, but the feedstock on that aircraft was always one of the things that we would keep a real strong look at because it needed to come down a little bit before that the economics of that airplane got into an advantage over the 7 -- an older 75, if you will. And it's there now, given where the feedstock values of the A321 and the amount of them that are parked right now. So that's another real solid plus that the demand for that aircraft should be there right away when the STC is available, and we start to deploy those things going into 2021 and 2022.\nJoe Hete: Yes. I think the other thing to think about, Steve, is clearly with the pandemic here, buying habits of the public have changed significantly. People aren't going to retail outlets like they were in the past. It's more convenient and safer for them, I guess, to have it delivered to their homes. So I think the demand from an e-commerce perspective only got accelerated by the pandemic issues.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay. And then maybe lastly, just in terms of maybe a pull-forward of e-commerce demand or kind of a -- maybe a shortening of the curve in terms of adoption versus kind of a -- maybe a weaker economy with job losses and things like that. I mean how do you think about maybe the potential for economic weakness here with all the issues, with job losses and things like that? And how do you think that might affect the business in the maybe near term?\nQuint Turner: Steve, this is Quint. That's one of the pluses, I guess, in terms of the -- we lease the airplane. We don't sell the cargo on it. We lease the aircraft itself. And so as Joe said, buying habits are a plus, right, that should help add volume and to the extent that's been accelerated by the pandemic. But understanding your question, I guess, we'll have to see what the longer-term effects on consumer spending are and everything in terms of that volume piece. But in terms of us leasing the aircraft and having these long-term leases in place, we're pretty insulated from the direct exposure to that.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay. And maybe just a follow up on that, I mean, in terms of the results for the quarter, how much of it was kind of driven by volumes and maybe abnormal flying for the quarter versus kind of having more aircraft in service for long-term customers, things like that. Is there a way to kind of think about that maybe for the quarter and then maybe going forward, if things kind of play out where maybe flying demand is reduced, but you do have more aircraft in service?\nQuint Turner: Well, I mean I think we saw better performance out of the ACMI Services segment, which helped drive improved results compared to the prior year quarter pretty significant. You recall last year, we had a lot of ramp-up costs as we were taking on what ultimately was, what, 6 -- actually, 8 aircraft for Amazon. And this year with at least 4 in the back half for them on a CMI basis, a little bit not as steep a ramp in terms of the cost that helped. We had some engine cost last year that we did not -- some unscheduled engine repairs last year that we didn't have this year. So all those things helped generate a better result for the ACMI Services segment.As far as the flying that we did, we mentioned there were some ad hoc opportunities for Omni that, while not part of their typical scheduled routes, certainly it did help during the quarter mitigate reductions in some of those and restrictions in some of those locations that Rich mentioned that affected some of our military flying. And so that was certainly a factor. Had we not had that in the first quarter, it would have not been the quarter that it was. But that was only somewhat of a replacement for what we didn't fly on the more scheduled basis.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephanie Benjamin from SunTrust.\nStephanie Benjamin: I just wanted to touch on quickly on the 5 767s that you called out that were purchased already in the first quarter as part of our CapEx plans. Can you speak to the -- really the timing of service that you're kind of viewing those aircraft when they should be deployed? But also just the types of customers interested, are these customers largely looking at replacement? Or is it growth in cargo, geographic expansion? Any color there would be helpful.\nRich Corrado: Yes. So they're -- all of those aircraft are designated for U.S.-based operations. I'm just trying to go through in my head when they're going to come out of conversion. But I think a couple of them will be 2021 deployments and the remainder will be deployed throughout 2020.\nOperator: And we have Jack Atkins again from Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Quint, I guess this one is just a quick one for you on modeling. Does the CARES Act funding impact the book tax rate at all for modeling purposes?\nQuint Turner: No, it shouldn't. We're projecting, what, about 24% to 25% once you exclude the warrants from the impact. And that does not affect that.\nOperator: And we have another question from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Quint, the PSP, was that a straight grant? Or did it include a loan provision as well?\nQuint Turner: It was -- in terms of the Omni piece, it's a grant.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And have any of the carriers apply to the LP program under CARES Act?\nQuint Turner: No, they have not.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And last question, any update on just labor, where we are with ABX?\nQuint Turner: ABX, actually, they're in negotiations this week, Chris, with the -- obviously, the mediators are involved in the process. And again, as we've said on previous calls, cautiously optimistic that we will get a deal sometime this year. But like I said, they are still in negotiation process.\nOperator: And I'll now turn the call back over to Rich Corrado for closing remarks.\nRich Corrado: Thank you, moderator. I'd like to congratulate Joe Hete on his retirement from the CEO position and his function of his new role as Chairman of the Board. Joe built this tremendous organization, establishing a real strong foundation. This includes a significant differentiated business model and the safety and service culture that transcends the parent holding company to every ATSG subsidiary. We need to preserve that important part of ATSG and use our culture to propel our value proposition into the next growth phase of the company.Our challenge moving forward is to keep all the good stuff, if you will, that got us here. But if there's one thing that the current COVID challenge has taught us is that change comes rapidly in today's world, and we must maintain our flexibility and agility as a core strength as we adapt to the changing business needs of our customers. I'm excited to be leading such a seasoned, hard-working and innovative group of employees as we take off into the future, understand that together, we can build on that solid foundation that Joe Hete built, but with renewed challenge to take this company to the next level with the same worth ethic, integrity and customer focus that defined our reputation. Thank you for your interest in ATSG. Have a great day, and stay safe.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 4, "year": 2019, "date": "2020-03-03 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Q4 2019 Air Transport Services Group Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Joe Hete, CEO.\nJoe Hete: Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning. And welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me today are Quint Turner, our Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Corrado, our President; and as we announced last week, our CEO-elect.We issued our earnings release and our Form 10-K yesterday after the market closed. They are on our website, atsginc.com.I am very happy to report to you that in 2019 we beat the annual adjusted EBITDA goal we set for ourselves, as well as the market's expectations for adjusted EPS. This is the third year in a row we have exceeded our adjusted EBITDA goal and the fourth quarter was the fifth in a row that our adjusted EPS has exceeded the consensus of the analysts who follow us.In 2019, we substantially outperformed our 2018 results. Revenues rose 63% to $1.45 billion, a record since we became a public company in 2003, excluding the reimbursements we used to include in revenue.Our adjusted earnings grew 32% to a record $105 million or $1.51 per share and our adjusted EBITDA rose 45% to $452 million, both a record and $2 million above our $450 million guidance. That was despite significant unbudgeted investments in pilot training costs during the year due to flying schedules that expanded when Amazon adopted one day delivery service.We are growing and generating strong returns for two main reasons. Our leased aircraft fleet is growing and we acquired Omni Air in November 2018. We are leasing more 767 freighters because e-commerce is driving delivery speeds. We bought Omni because its principal customers, the Department of Defense and other government units, are largely immune from the business cycle like our aircraft lease investments.Because we are confident that we can continue to grow and generate superior returns, we are setting a 2020 goal of $487 million to $492 million in adjusted EBITDA. That includes completing our current 767 freighter lease commitments to Amazon and UPS, leasing other 767s to new and existing customers, and growing our airline and other businesses.I will say more about those goals shortly. First, Quint is ready to review our consolidated results for 2019 and Rich will cover our businesses. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Joe. Good morning to all of you on the call right now and to those who will listen later on replay.As always, I will start by saying that during the course of this call, we will make projections or other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here.These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and the estimates as of the date of this call, and Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes and underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes.These factors include but are not limited to changes in the market demand for our assets and services, including potential reduce flight operations arising from the outbreak of COVID-19, our operating airline\u2019s ability to maintain on-time service and control costs, the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration, the fluctuations in ATSG\u2019s traded share price and in interest rates, which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments, the number, timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers, our ability to remain in compliance with our agreements with key customers and lenders, changes in general economic and our industry specific conditions and other factors that are contained from time to time and ATSG\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-K we filed yesterday.We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG\u2019s financial position and results.These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials. We advise you to refer to reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website.As Joe said, 2019 was another record year for ATSG, with both fourth quarter and annual results well above our results from a year ago. We also took several steps to secure continued access to grow capital at today\u2019s very attractive long term rates. I will say more about that in a moment.Our revenues again rose sharply this time by 44% for the quarter and by 63% to $1.45 billion for the year. Our work for the U.S. Department of Defense and other government units by all three of our airlines Omni, ABX and ATI was again the biggest source of our gains last year.The U.S. DOD is ATSG\u2019s largest customer and represented 34% of our revenues for the year, 23% of our 2019 revenues came from Amazon and 14% from DHL. That\u2019s a lot different from just five years ago when DHL represented more than half of our 2014 revenues.Our GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $60 million for the year and a loss of $41 million for the fourth quarter. For several years, our GAAP numbers have included large unrealized effects of quarterly revaluations of several financial instruments. These are mainly the effects of revaluing interest rate hedges on our bank debt and the non-cash effects of changes in the projected value and number of the warrants we have already issued to Amazon or those we anticipate issuing in the future.Another significant item this quarter that favorably affected both our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is a reduction in our projected state tax rate. A greater portion of our flight operations during 2019 including Omni\u2019s were outside of state tax jurisdictions. That resulted in a one-time fourth quarter state tax benefit of $4.9 million or $0.07 per share.The company expects its effective tax rate for this year to be 24% after excluding the impact of warrant re-measurements and related amortization of aircraft lease incentives. ATSG did not pay cash federal income taxes in 2019 and we don't expect to pay significant federal taxes until 2024 or later.Diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were a positive $0.78 for the year and a negative $0.70 for the quarter. GAAP earnings exclude the per share effects of mark-to-market changes and warrant liabilities when they are accretive.The adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA we reported this quarter excluded those warrant-related gains and losses. They also leave out the amortization of warrant lease incentives for Amazon from CAM, affiliate losses from Airbus A321 development costs and the non-service related costs of our retiree benefit plans.You can see how each of those items affected our results in the tables included in our earnings release. Netting those effects, our adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $39 million or $0.56 per share, up from $23 million or $0.33 a year ago. Annual adjusted earnings were $105 million or $1.51 per share in 2019, up 32% versus $79 million or $1.16 per share in 2018. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased by 29% to $124 million, which pushed our total for the year 45% higher to $452 million or $140 million better than a year ago.Operating income for 2019 rose 59% to $177 million. Our revenue growth offsets significant increases in fuel, depreciation and amortization, and salaries and benefit expenses. Almost all of the increases stem from aircraft and headcount additions, including those related to Omni and from expanded flight operations from Amazon.Interest expense, including $9 million that was non-cash increased 18% to $66 million in 2019. Higher borrowings for the Omni acquisition and aircraft investments were the principal factors.Cash flow from operations in 2019 increased nearly $100 million to $397 million and capital spending rose $161 million to $454 million. The bulk of that spending $328 million was to acquire 11 Boeing 767 300 passenger aircraft and for passenger to freighter modification costs. One of those acquired aircraft was deployed in passenger service for Omni\u2019s customers.When we announced our third quarter results in November, we also announced another amendment to our secured credit facility, which reduced our rate markups over LIBOR for our revolver and term debt, expanded our capacity and extended the use of the senior secured credit agreement until late 2024.It also paved the way for our initial publicly rated debt offering in January, a $500 million private offering of eight-year unsecured notes. Response to the offering was so favorable that we were able to raise its size to $500 million from the anticipated $400 million and it priced at an attractive 4.75% fixed rate.Proceeds were used to pay down the balances on our revolver debt, which will provide us great flexibility in accessing capital going forward. The addition of the unsecured bond and our debt capital structure lengthens our remaining debt duration and along with the favorable bank amendment in November also reduces our annual interest expense.That completes our financial highlights for the quarter and year. Rich is ready to cover our operations. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint, and good morning, everybody. Our ATSG business has stepped up to the challenge of integrating Omni and its people in assets into our operation as they continue to deliver superior service for all of their customers.CAM, our foundational aircraft leasing business, grew revenues net of warrant related lease incentives by 18% for the quarter and 25% for the year. CAM had a full year of results from the 11 passenger aircraft that are acquired from Omni and leased back to them in 2018, plus revenues from seven more newly converted 767 freighters added during the year.External customer revenues increased 8% for both the quarter and the year. CAM\u2019s pre-tax earnings for the fourth quarter were $18 million, up 17%, and $69 million, up 5%for the year. CAM\u2019s allocated interest and depreciation expense each increased by 16% for the fourth quarter.Interest expense rose 76% and depreciation rose 25% for the year due to both organic and acquired fleet growth.The 2019 highlight for CAM was lease commitments for five 767 freighters for UPS, two of which were delivered in 2019, a third was delivered in January and the remaining two will be ready later this year.While we have a long history of peak season ACMI flying for UPS, this was the first time they leased aircraft from us. Our airlines had a strong quarter and year. Thanks to the addition of Omni and more CMI flying for Amazon.Total block hours increased 47% for the fourth quarter and 40% for 2019, which included an expanded flight schedule for us in support of Amazon's one-day delivery commitment and stepped up ACMI operations for UPS.ACMI services revenues increased 51% in the fourth quarter and nearly doubled for the year topping $1 billion for the first time. The fourth quarter included a full three months of Omni contributions, compared with less than two months work in 2018. Pre-tax earnings from ACMI services increased 83% for the quarter and nearly tripled for the year over 2018. Good margins on airline operations by Omni Air were the principal factor.Our air and ground operations employees including mechanics, flight crews and ground and logistics employees did a great job during peak and that continues into this year. ABX Air management continues to negotiate with union representatives of its flight crews for an amended agreement and has made progress on some fronts. Their next meeting is scheduled for later this month.Our overall 767 fleet expansion plan includes two leased in passenger 300s that Omni agreed to take before we acquire them. That will bring Omni's overall fleet to 16, including 10 passenger 767-300s, three 767-200s and three 777s. Omni is already lining up customers for its two additions.This year, our airlines are scheduled to fly six 767 aircraft that CAM does not own, up from two at the end of 2018. That includes four Omni passenger 767s and two 767 freighters Amazon leases from another owner, but opted to shift ATI for CMI operations last fall.Revenues from other activities increased by 10% for both the fourth quarter and full year, both maintenance and ground services for external customers increased. Our ground operations for Amazon continue to evolve as we added gateways for them in Charlotte, Tampa and our support services here in Wilmington, offsetting the loss of gateways we managed for them through mid-2019.Pre-tax earnings from other businesses more than tripled during the fourth quarter and rose 20% for the year. Fourth quarter gains came mostly for more ground support for Amazon.That's the summary of our operations for the quarter and 2019. I will turn it back to Joe for his outlook comments.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Rich. ATSG\u2019s results for 2019 were remarkable for more than just the records we posted against our own prior results. They also speak to the sustained cash flow that our business strategy yields, and e-commerce and other growth drivers spurring demand for our aircraft and support services. Nearly five years into our Amazon relationship and after a year in the charter and ACMI passenger business via Omni, we are executing on all cylinders.I usually begin any presentation about ATSG with the comment that our business starts with the lease. The nearly 100 aircraft we have in service today including 63 freighters, which are leased externally make us far different from most of our peers and others in the air cargo and passenger charter space.Our contracted cash flow from our growing share of this aircraft extends to the end of this decade and soon more will extend beyond it. Also, that external lease cash flow continues regardless of changes in customer payload, fuel price volatility, health risks or other events beyond our control.Even with Omni in the fold as an ACMI and charter operator, we are still freighter lease driven today. Eight to 10 additional 767s are due to emerge from mod this year. Seven of them have lease contract commitments from Amazon and UPS and we have LOIs for the others. Our order book as indicated by our CapEx appetite of $420 million for 2020 is nearly full for the next two years.We continue to look forward to FAA approval later this year of our Airbus A321 freighter certificate. Once approved, we may acquire 321 feedstock aircraft later in 2021. The values indicate a good potential return. Our CapEx budget for 2020, however, does not assume any 321 feedstock purchases.In the Leasing business, deployments are not the entire story. Lease terminations and returns are a noble part of it as well. This year, we expect returns of three currently leased 767-200s and all four of our 757 freighters as their wet lease ranges with DHL expire.We had factored transitioning time with those aircraft into our 2020 plan and it\u2019s reflected in our adjusted EBITDA goal for 2020 of $487 million to $492 million, what we know and can commit to today. As always, we will update you on our outlook as the year progresses.At that level, our adjusted EBITDA would have increased nearly 60% in the last two years. The business we have built is a strong producer of sustainable cash flow. Our maintenance CapEx requirements are approximately $100 million per year. That means we have significant discretionary cash flow to produce shareholder value.At today's share price, our discretionary cash flow yield, after maintenance CapEx and interest expense is more than 25%. We expect our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to come down from 3.3 times today to around 3 times by the end of the year and to decline further in 2021 as our CapEx spend drops.Like you, we are watching what appears to be an extreme response from Wall Street to Coronavirus threats. We are particularly concerned about what we see as investor\u2019s inability to differentiate ATSG from other companies that are far more vulnerable to its near-term effects. Our operations are primarily domestic and mostly time definite express package-related.Apart from that, however, our business model also has built-in flexibility. We can reallocate discretionary capital quickly towards opportunities that promise better returns than freighter investments. That could include subject to lender approval redeploying some of our cash toward a share repurchase program if our current stock price persists.As always, our focus is on maximizing long-term returns from the businesses we operate in investments we select. Our track record for delivering on that commitment is hard to beat and much better than investments tied to the major market indexes. The job of this management team and those who execute their plans is to keep outperforming and show investors the value we are creating.That concludes our prepared remarks, Vanessa. We are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Hey, guys. Good morning. Great quarter.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Jack.\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Jack.\nJack Atkins: Joe, congratulations on your semi-retirement, I guess, and Rich, congratulations on your new role.\nJoe Hete: Thank you, Jack.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Jack.\nJack Atkins: So let me kind of start out with a question just around \u2013 when you look at the feedstock available to you guys this year and next year, could you kind of update us in terms of where you think you will be in terms of those 20 aircraft that you secure the rights for, I guess, that was at the end of 2018. How many of those will be through conversion or at least will be in service at the end of 2020? Is there a way to kind of think about that?\nRich Corrado: Yeah. I think, if you look at we have already started deploying some of those one. The first one went to Omni and passenger configuration. We have got some lined up this year to go and fulfill our Amazon commitment and some other commitments that we have got for this year.At the end of the year we will have an additional three that will actually be converted for 2021 deployment and then about five airplanes that tranche left for conversion in 2021. So it's kind of the way the flow is going.\nJack Atkins: So that\u2019s about eight Rich if I am hearing you right.\nRich Corrado: Yeah. So that\u2019s about eight. There are some of that tranche is in conversion now and so those will be the help us fulfill the Amazon commitment for second part of this year.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Got you. Got you. That makes sense. And I guess, as you are looking out through this year you sort of have your 2020 plan fairly well committed from your customers at this point. You mentioned in the press release, you are seeing very strong customer demand for 2021 already. Could you talk about sort of the types of customers or the types that sort of mission that those planes will be going into service for, maybe geographic comment as well in terms of where the demand is coming from?\nRich Corrado: Sure. We \u2013 obviously, we specialized in the 767 freighters, that\u2019s what we are talking about. If you look globally, about 90% of those 767 freighters on a global basis are deployed and express networks. You are talking FedEx, UPS, DHL, Amazon, the UPS network in Europe, some of the aircraft we have deployed with West Atlantic flying for multiple express carriers over there.And so -- and that's pretty much where our aircraft are targeted. We lease our aircraft currently to either the express carriers or carriers that fly for them. Cargojet is a good example. We have four aircraft with them up in Canada and they fly for the Canada Post, for UPS, for Amazon. So that's where those aircraft are going.If you look at the global demand for air freight right now, 2019 was a very poor year, the worst year in a decade for global air cargo and that\u2019s your intercontinental moves, the ones that are impacted by trade and tariff disruption that we saw in 2019.But if you look at the other side of the coin, which is the express business, it's growing very well. UPS had over 25% growth in 2019 in their overnight product. You saw Amazon still going through some great growth. DHL in several parts of the world was up between 6% and 8%. So the express business powered by the e-commerce is growing very well and that\u2019s where the 767s are deployed in those types of networks.Now for what we are looking at, the U.S., Far East, we have got a couple of opportunities in Far East. We have got a signed agreement for one airplane already and then we have got another deployment \u2013 we are looking at two more down in South America, or I should say, Mexico and South America.So it's the Americas, the Far East. We don\u2019t see much growth out of Europe right now on the express side, but keep in mind they have a very strong road network in Europe and so aircraft are not as prevalent as they are over here in \u2013 given the size of the U.S.\nJack Atkins: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for that, Rich. And I guess, last question for me and I will turn it over. But, Rich, you have been in a senior leadership role in this company for a long time. So you have had a very clear role in the direction ATSG has taken for quite some time. But I guess, now as you assume the role of the CEO here in a few months. How are you thinking about your priorities for the organization as you look out over the next several years?\nRich Corrado: Yeah. Great question, Jack. We have built a great \u2013 Joe has built a great company. We have a great culture here. We have a great team. We have \u2013 one of the strengths of the company has been our conservative approach to our balance sheet to ensure that we have got capital to invest in the market when it's growing.We look at ourselves as a very efficient user of capital. So if the market's growing like it has been for the past five years then we will take our cash flow and invest that in airplanes and growth, we would rather get the growth and advocate it to somebody else.But if you look at the market slows then we will have that cash available to do other things and that equity includes returning some cash to shareholders. So, on one level, we are going to continue that conservative view of our balance sheet and continue investing to get the best returns for our shareholders.I believe that the most important thing that this company can do is to maintain its service leadership. If you look at the way we both meet our commitments to customers from a leasing basis and the way that we deliver when we fly for them on an express basis. Our heritage is that of an express airline and so quality service I believe is going to win the day.And so we are investing now in a lot of things internally to maintain that service leadership that includes updating a lot of our IT systems, our \u2013 developing a much more robust continuous improvement program. So we are going to maintain our quality service approach and that we feel will be our best ticket to maintain our growth on the flying side. So leasing and flying.The other thing is we have got a real solid culture here in terms of the way we approach our customers. We strongly believe in the commitments that we make and that that will always be a hallmark of who ATSG is. So I hope that answered your question, Jack.\nJack Atkins: It does. Thanks, Rich. Really appreciate it.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Jack.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Kevin Sterling with The Benchmark Company.\nKevin Sterling: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.\nJoe Hete: Good morning, Kevin.\nRich Corrado: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin Sterling: First of all, Rich, let me say congratulations, and, Joe, I just want to tell you how much I have enjoyed working with you over the many years. I do hope you \u2013 I know you are not going to completely fully retire, but I do hope you enjoy some semi-retirement. I hope you don't drive your wife too crazy if you are home all the time.\nJoe Hete A: Might be the other way around, Kevin.\nKevin Sterling: Well, congratulations. I have certainly enjoyed working with you for many years.\nJoe Hete: Same here.\nKevin Sterling: Yeah. So real quick, can you guys, I guess, talk a little bit about the Coronavirus and kind of maybe some customer conversations you are having? I know your business is regional. It does seem isolated. But maybe a little bit about some of the conversations you are having with some of your express customers and how they are viewing the world today?\nJoe Hete: Hey, Kevin. The reality is \u2013 this is Joe. Since most of our operations are domestic, we haven't seen any impact per se, but I am sure you have seen some of the announcements where a customer like Amazon, for example, is restricting travel, et cetera, and some people are pulling back from conferences and things of that nature.But where we have the greatest potential disruption from our revenue stream would be in the things we do for the military, because of the number of foreign countries that we fly through. Some you can come through but then you have got crews that would be quarantined on the other end.So far we haven't had any disruptions in our service levels, but you just don't know how that thing is going to play out over time. So that's probably where we are most exposed would be on the international portion of our business which is the military side.\nKevin Sterling: I have got you. But on the flip side though the military starts moving troops around in and out of these affected countries that could help you as well, am I thinking about that right, possibly?\nJoe Hete: Yeah. I mean, there is that potential but you \u2013 like you said, it\u2019s a very fluid situation, there's calls almost on a daily basis with folks at DOD, so that everybody's up to speed on how things are changing.\nKevin Sterling: Okay. Also, you guys -- you talked about returning capital to shareholders. I know you mentioned a buyback and things like that. Would you consider possibly looking at buying back some of the converts there in the open market possibly? Is everything on the table as you think about return to capital shareholders?\nQuint Turner: Hi, Kevin. It\u2019s Quint. Yeah. I mean, we don't necessarily \u2013 nothing would be off the table per se. But I think at the \u2013 yeah, I think, our references were more with regard to the current share price being where it's at and we certainly think that the reaction to the Coronavirus has been extreme with respect to our stock. As Joe said, we really haven't seen disruption to this point and so, I think, that was more.There\u2019s about \u2013 I think we have about a little over $60 million left on the authorization the Board put in place. As we have mentioned on previous calls, we have a bank covenant that requires you to be under 3 times after giving it back and we are currently around 3.3 times.But certainly, there's \u2013 based upon the allocation alternatives that are in front of us and if the stock price persists there, that's something we are going to take a very hard look at. It becomes a more attractive option to do that certainly when you are talking about a share price that\u2019s been in our view unjustly punched.\nKevin Sterling: Yeah. No. I agree with you. I think sometimes we throw the baby out with the bathwater. Lastly, and I know this \u2013 I know we are just in 2020 and you guys have given 2020 guidance. As I look at your CapEx, I think, for 2020 is down roughly $30 million from 2019 and I believe briefly referenced 2021. You said it might be even a little bit lower in 2021. And I mean, are we talking significantly lower or kind in that $400 million-plus level possibly just to kind of maintain growth CapEx, maintenance CapEx for 2021. Is it \u2013 as we think about that as that $400 million range? I guess, my question is we don't think will materially lower but also is probably not going to go higher, but maybe that $400 million give or take for 2021 the right way to think about a combination of growth CapEx plus maintenance?\nQuint Turner: Yeah. I mean, Kevin, as you think about, of course, we are down versus last year. I think we had guided to $460 million for 2019. So we came in, I think, $7 million below that. So part of what you are seeing in the $420 million we are projecting for 2020 is just a spillover of that. And then we talked about the 8 to 10 aircraft in service. We have said that maintenance CapEx for us is about $100 million. So that kind of gets you in that $420 million zip code.But as Rich said, at the end of the year, we will have \u2013 projections are to have eight 767-300s in mod. About three of those, the investment is pretty much in as of the end of the year. So in some respects, we are prepaying on 21 deployments a little bit. That has to do with the timing of the mod slots and so that really has the effect of reducing the requirement we will have in 2021.So I think that the $400 million you are referring to could be quite a bit less than $400 million and that\u2019s what we mentioned when we talk about the improving picture for free cash flow. I mean we expect to delever this year, but most of that comes from the growth in our EBITDA.And then as you look at 2021, certainly there's significant opportunity for free cash flow. I mean our maintenance CapEx is about $100 million. We have got cash interest of about $55 million. We probably could in $7 million in pension plans.So, if you are thinking about EBITDA of $490 million. That's about roughly $328 million of discretionary cash flow call it that can go towards what we view as the best alternative to create value for the shareholders.That's been growth of late, because as Rich said, you don't want to advocate growth when those good opportunities are there. But when we are looking at \u201821, I think, you could see a lot of that cash flow making it, being available as free cash flow. So, it could be significantly less from the $400 million.\nKevin Sterling: Okay. No. That's great. I mean, if I hear your goal right now is you are going to delever, maybe get down about 3 times by year-end and then 2021 could really be a massive, massive free cash flow year for you guys, giving you a lot of optionality, is that a fair statement?\nQuint Turner: Yeah. I mean, the company \u2013 when you look it on a per share basis if you have got that much discretionary cash flow that's like $4 -- $4.5 per share to $5 per share of discretionary cash flow that you have got available. On our current share price, that's over a 25% yield.So, I mean, we are going to have a lot of opportunities. Certainly, we don't want to disappoint our customers who are waiting on aircraft and when those opportunities look good, they generally are going to be the first option for us. But I think that very good chance \u201821 has a lot of CapEx reduction and cash flow.\nKevin Sterling: I got you. That's all I had. Thanks so much for your time and once again Joe best of luck to you.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning, everyone.\nJoe Hete: Good morning, Chris.\nRich Corrado: Good morning, Chris.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So continuing along the line of the Coronavirus, so your stock has been trading like a payload sensitive airline stock, and let's say, that the virus accelerates and how are you thinking about the various risks to your businesses, perhaps, with a look towards these various subsidiaries? And I am guessing CAM, which is one of the largest contributors to your pre-tax earnings is fairly immune? But what about the other segments such as LGST, airborne or maintenance?\nRich Corrado: Well, Chris, a lot of it's going to be dependent upon how widespread the virus is in terms of their customers. I think the customers are still going to be there LGSTX for example is servicing the Amazon business, and of course, on the AMES piece or the MRO side people have to get their airplanes fixed.So it's really a matter of is it going to be \u2013 is it going to get severe enough that you would end up with significant number of people being quarantined at home for lack of a better definition to where they can't come to work and produce the revenue side of the equation.But as you pointed out, from a CAMs perspective, I mean, the leases \u2013 the lease payments come in regardless of whether the airplanes fly in one hour or hundred hours or whether it's carrying 1 pound or 1,000 pounds on board. So that cash flow stream still comes in over time.But as I said earlier, the biggest exposure we have from a revenue perspective would be in the military side of the equation, but since most of the time we are flying into military bases, the bet is that the \u2013 they will still continue to have those troop movements. And I think, as Kevin even pointed out, there is the potential that you may even have an acceleration of the number of troop movements going on around the globe.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. So along those lines I know you have a relatively small commercial cargo charter business. So there's less opportunity to participate in any demand surges once China production is back online. But at the same time, I am guessing there's opportunity on the scheduled services side perhaps with the flying with DHL.\nJoe Hete: We have got limited resources for extra flying and its 767 flying so it's regional based, right? So we are not going to fly a 767 from China into the U.S. It's not an efficient use of the aircraft. So there's a little bit of opportunity there but not a lot. It's not like we have four or five airplanes sitting around waiting for work.It's not -- really we don't do much charter \u2013 pure charter work anymore. We have aircraft that are available -- some of our aircrafts are available like every other week because they fly military route one week and then they are available to back up the network.So it's not a big part of our business today. If there are opportunities, it would probably be in the fourth quarter where we do have a lot of aircraft available and we tend to use those to fly during peak.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then with all the pressure on the passenger airlines particularly in China, and of course, their aircraft values are \u2013 are there any opportunities you are seeing in the market with perhaps opportunistic P-to-F, freight \u2013 passenger-to-freighter conversions? And then also are any concerns around credit profiles with any of your customers at this point? Thank you.\nRich Corrado: We haven't seen any kind of flood to the market of feedstock. We track the 767 fleet out there and there's still over 300 of them left in the world and there are some airlines that have large fleets of them and we keep a very good view of those and the ones that we know will come available in 2021 and 2022 as an example, they have not made any decisions to release those aircraft early.The 737 MAX is still having an impact on the way airlines view their fleet and the way they view their \u2013 what they are going to be releasing and what they need to hang on to. So at this point in time, we haven't seen any impact as it relates to feedstock availability.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thanks for the time.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: We have our next question comes from Steve O\u2019Hara with Sidoti & Company.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Hi. Good morning.\nJoe Hete: Hey, Steve.\nRich Corrado: Hi, Steve.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: First \u2013 yeah, just I\u2019d like to echo the comments regarding Joe and the new team. Congrats on everything and I am sure you guys seem to have a deep bench, so that\u2019s a good thing.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Steve.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Steve.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: You are welcome. And then, just, I guess, on looking at the 767-200s and I mean, you have, I think, or have 33 at the end of the year. You expect to go down at 32 by the year-end 2020. I mean, is there a potential for that to speed up in terms of these aircraft coming back or they \u2013 what's the possibility of those coming back sooner and as they come back, you expect those to be replaced by 767-300s?\nRich Corrado: So, a couple of things, one is the aircraft is \u2013 the 767-200 is still in demand. It\u2019s still an efficient aircraft and still very reliable aircraft, as just as reliable as the 767-300s. And I am with DHL late last week on just a quarterly meeting and they commented we have 767-200s flying that they fly in their Middle East network and they commented on how great their reliability is for the airplane.We are taking the aircraft out of service when there's several maintenance events that occur. There's a 50,000 cycle limit that requires you to significantly step up your maintenance program. There's an air pressure bulkhead that\u2019s about $1.5 million to $1.75 million event. And there's a large S4C check that you have to do every four checks that \u2013 when those \u2013 when two or three of those things come together it doesn't make sense to invest that much money in the aircraft depending on how many cycles are left till 50,000. So that's why we have been taking aircraft out of service. They are still very much in demand and so, we are pretty bullish on the aircraft going forward.We do \u2013 we don\u2019t we are going to have a lot coming back. We are having some returns this year, but we are also having some deployments and so the softness is that time between the transitioning when you get the aircraft back, you have a C check and repaint it for the new customer, et cetera, et cetera, then you lose lease months. And so, although, we are getting some aircraft back, we are also redeploying some of those aircraft and just having to go through the transition, which is normal for a lesser oil aircraft.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Right. Okay. Thank you. And then maybe just looking at the improvement within the other business segment, I mean, is that something that you think is sustainable going forward and is there a further improvement maybe to come, I mean, it looks like revenue in the fourth quarter was up very significantly. Just wondering about maybe the trajectory there, but it seemed like a pretty steep growth in 2019 for the most part, back-end loaded, but I am just curious maybe going forward? Thank you.\nJoe Hete: Yeah. Steve, on the maintenance side, the AMES which is a big part of that, obviously we have a limited amount of hangar space. So the additional growth potential there is somewhat limited in light of the facilities space, as well as the continuing challenge of trying to find qualified maintenance technicians. So it's a very nominal growth rate that we would expect in the maintenance side of the equation.On the logistics side of the business, if you recall last year, about mid-year we lost the management that we had over a number of locations for the Amazon gateways where we managed third-party providers.We backfilled some of that with the opening of up two of our own managed gateways, one of them in Tampa, Florida and the other one in Charlotte. We continue to have both of those in place this year albeit the Tampa one will scale down about mid-year when Amazon opens up its own facility over in Lakeland, which is 20 miles or 30 miles away from Tampa. We still expect to have an operation in Tampa albeit be a lot less than what it was last year.So when you look at the guidance that we gave, one of the things that was factored in there was a fact that part of the business would show lower returns than what we saw in 2019 and in 2020 at least based on what we know today.We are chasing another \u2013 a number of other opportunities with Amazon, with DHL, with UPS on the logistics side of the business. So we are fortunate enough based on our track record of how we manage with our express heritage. How we can manage those facilities better than your normal third-party providers. We hope to be able to recoup some of that business as well.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. And then maybe finally on the, I guess, the loss from non-consolidated \u2013 consolidated affiliates. I assume that's all of kind of the A321 conversion process. Could you just talk about maybe what you expect the total investments to be there and if there\u2019s any \u2013 if you have any customers lined up or how that process is going? Thank you.\nJoe Hete: Yeah. From A321 perspective, Steve, that's really where those numbers are coming from. And essentially, we are still targeting having the STC approve, call it midyear of this year. The prototype aircraft already has an end user customer as well as the second aircraft, which will be inducted shortly for \u2013 to begin its modification process.At the end of the day, we will have, probably, $25 million to $30 million invested on our piece of that for the development of that STC. But as you noticed in our remarks, one of the things we pointed to was that the DHL no longer wanted to utilize the 757s in their network.And as we have said on previous calls, one of the reasons we jumped into the A321 is because it gives you essentially the same cubic capacity of 757 for a significantly lower operating costs, and I guess that probably bears it out more than anything else is that the DHL says they need to reduce the number of 757s in their network.So that bodes well for the A321 as it's the most likely replacements, the only thing that comes through with an equivalent amount of cubic capacity and has significantly lower operating costs. So that's why we believe it's going to be in the long poles a significant portion of our fleet complement.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. And maybe just a follow-up for that, I know the 73 \u2013 Amazon has been taking 737s and I am just wondering is the A321 a decent comp to that or is it more for larger aircrafts like 757? Thanks for the questions.\nRich Corrado: Sure. This is Rich. The A321 is a larger aircraft. It's got about 95% of the cube of a 757. So if you look at the 757 today, it's got 15 upper deck positions, 737-800 has 11. So it's about 30% larger cube if you will.But it flies with the same engines and so if you look at this \u2013 if you are carrying the same weight in A321 and the 737-800, it\u2019s about 8% higher operating cost than A321. But you have got that much more cube capability to carry another three pallet \u2013 three to four pallets worth of cube.So it can compete with the 737-800, a little bit higher cost, but it \u2013 but if you look at \u2013 if you are an express carrier, you can fly an A321 in place of a 737-800. But then during peak you get an automatic lift of 30% a cube to fill those lanes when you \u2013 when the seasonal market aren\u2019t. It's a great airplane and obviously the investment we made were really high on it. But it is a \u2013 it isn't necessarily a direct replacement for the 737-800, it's a direct replacement for the 757-200.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have our next question from Travis Pascavis with HIMCO.\nTravis Pascavis: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question, part of it was just answered, but maybe if you could just take a step back and describe the relationship with DHL and anything we should reach into in terms of the change? It doesn\u2019t sound like you have given the context in the last question but just I would ask it direct?\nRich Corrado: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Travis. No. We have a very good relationship with DHL. We \u2013 like I said, we had our quarterly meeting with them. It was a great meeting. The service we provide to them is best-in-class in terms of the flying that we do for them in the U.S. and again we lease other aircraft to them in other parts of the world and they are very happy with that as well.757 decision by them was more directed at kind of optimizing and right-sizing their fleet. As they grow, the 757, as an example, we have some lanes that hop through a couple of markets, so they will take some 737-800 that they are taking and put them on direct route to some of those markets just as an example.And so it's not reflective at all of the relationship that we have with them. We are looking for more opportunities going forward both on leasing and flying basis. This happened to be ATI our airline that flies 757 is the only 757 airline \u2013 cargo airline in the country other than UPS and FedEx.And there's a reason for that. It\u2019s not an efficient aircraft. It works okay in express environment, if you have only got enough freight to fly the planes that it flies, but it really is a higher cost aircraft and that's why you haven't seen us grow the airframe.We always tried to push our customers towards the 767 to 200 rather than the 757. And I think DHL, as you know has looked at the 757 and looked at the alternatives that they have and they recognize as much as anybody that aircraft is. There are other opportunities to right size your network and be more efficient.\nTravis Pascavis: Do you expect things to be relived in or will those be retiring, I missed that part?\nRich Corrado: So we are looking for different opportunities for those aircraft. The one thing about the aircraft that powered 2037 engines and those are very much in demand right now. And so we may make more money leasing the engines than we did leasing \u2013 haven\u2019t getting the lease revenue on the airplane through the ACMI operation.But we are looking for other opportunities. We have got a company interested in taking two of them right now, of course, we have still got \u2013 we are still flying one of them right now, two of them right now for DHL and we will fly one into April, but \u2013 and two of them are on the deck here.But we believe we will be able to get more revenue out of those aircraft by the end of the year and we will be able to deploy at least two of them and then maybe some of the engines. But we believe we will get some more value out of those aircraft.\nTravis Pascavis: Great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Travis.\nOperator: And we have a follow-up question from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. I was wondering if you could give us an update on labor and where you are with the CBA on ABX and whether this year\u2019s EBITDA guide includes any new labor deals?\nRich Corrado: Yeah. Chris, right now I think the last we mentioned to the number of investors when we were at the Stifel Conference, for example, is that we met in February at the National Mediation Board headquarters in Washington, D.C.We are scheduled to go back to the table the week of the 23rd for three days I believe it is of negotiations. We actually have one of the Board members involved in the negotiations at this point in time to try to move them along in a more rapid pace than what we have seen in the past. We have not factored any of those costs and potential cost increases into our guidance for 2020. So anything that we would commit to would be a reduction of our overall guidance for labor settlement.But as I have said on a number of occasions, we feel cautiously optimistic that we will get a deal done this year. It\u2019s just a matter of what the end amount looks like from our perspective. As I have said on many occasions, we already have one airline hauling cargo for Amazon at ATI and we know what the cost is for that particular agreement and there is no rational reason for us to have any higher cost structure with the ABX folks assuming we get a deal done. So that's kind of our guideline going through the negotiation process, but cautiously optimistic we will get something done this year.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then as a follow-up to that, how should we think about headcount growth for this year\u2019s mid-teens or similar to the 12%, 14% we saw in 2019, a good place to start?\nRich Corrado: Now, the headcount will probably be less in terms of the number of flight crews we had to add last year with the combination of the additional aircraft for Amazon plus the fact they went to the one-day service. We added on the ATI side, for example, like 118 pilots overall with the \u2013 just the additional five aircraft, four aircraft that we owe them this year. That number will come down significantly.Another driver in the overall headcount was the two gateways, I mentioned earlier, in Charlotte and Tampa. As Tampa has pulled down from the current volume of freight going through there to something less by the end of the year, that headcount will come down as well. So, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate anywhere near as many \u2013 as much of a headcount increase in 2020 as we saw on 2019.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. All right. Thanks for the time.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe Hete for closing remarks.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Vanessa. As it\u2019s been mentioned by a couple of people here and I am sure most people are aware by now that I announced that I will be retiring after the conclusion of the shareholder meeting on May 7th. I do have to say that it was an honor and privilege and most times pleasurable working with you folks over the years. I think I am leaving you in very capable hands with Rich and Joe Payne, our General Counsel, and Quint, of course, as most of you know, and the newest addition to our senior team here, Ed Koharik, and of course, Mike Berger, our Chief Commercial Officer. So, I think, you are in good hands. I appreciate all the support over the years and have a quality day.\nOperator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-11-12 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Q3 2019 Air Transport Services Group Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.And now I will turn the call over to Joe Hete, Chief Executive Officer, ATSG. Mr. Hete, you may begin.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, John. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me today is Quint Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Rich Corrado, who became President of ATSG in September, is traveling overseas today. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website, atsginc.com. We will file our Form 10-Q later this week.Once again, I'm pleased to report to you that this year, we are performing at levels consistent with the adjusted EBITDA guidance we have shared and exceeding our targets for adjusted EPS. Our business strategy of investing in and leasing midsize aircraft to major express and e-commerce customers and combining those assets with crew, maintenance and insurance services for those who require them continues to be a winning formula. Our purchase of Omni a year ago has continued to provide accretive contributions to our operating results.For the third quarter, we again substantially outperformed our prior year results. Our revenues are up 79% to $366 million. Our adjusted earnings are up 10% to $21 million or $0.31 per share, and our adjusted EBITDA rose 47% to $109 million. Our airline operations are expanding, and our leased aircraft fleet is growing. Our air network services for the Department of Defense and Amazon are up versus the prior year, and we have 19 more aircraft in our operating fleet than a year ago. These results, plus significant increases in scheduled peak-season flying, support my confidence in our ability to achieve our $450 million target for full year adjusted EBITDA despite a few headwinds to our plan.Quint is ready to review our consolidated results, including the release we also issued yesterday about a new amendment to our senior credit facility.I'll close with comments on our outlook. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Joe. Good morning to all of you on the call right now and to those who will listen on replay.As always, I'll start by saying that during the course of this call, we will make projections or other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call, and Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in market demand for our assets and services; our operating airline's ability to maintain on-time service and control costs; the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration; fluctuations in ATSG's traded share price and in interest rates, which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments; the number, timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers; our ability to remain in compliance with our agreements with key customers and lenders; and other factors as contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-Q we will file this week.We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials. We advise you to refer to reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website.As Joe said, our third quarter results compare very favorably with our results from a year ago and show sequential improvement from results for this year's second quarter. Our revenues again rose sharply, this time by $161.2 million or 79% from the prior year. Once again, a solid contribution from Omni was a principal positive factor. Our work for the Department of Defense with contributions from all 3 of our airlines make it ATSG's largest customer, representing 34% of our revenues in the third quarter. 26% of revenues came from Amazon and 13% from DHL.Once again, our GAAP earnings include large unrealized effects of quarterly revaluations of several financial instruments. These are mainly the effects of revaluing interest rate hedges on our bank debt, plus the noncash effects of changes in the value of the warrants we have issued to Amazon, which, this time, was positive due to a reduction in the value of our warrant liability. Those factors contributed to a tripling of our GAAP third quarter earnings from continuing operations to $105.1 million this year compared with $32.9 million a year ago.Diluted GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.19 versus $0.24 a year ago. Warrant accounting excludes from GAAP earnings the per-share effects of mark-to-market changes in warrant liabilities when they are accretive. The adjusted earnings, EPS and adjusted EBITDA we reported this quarter exclude those warrant-related gains as well as amortization of warrant incentives for Amazon, affiliate losses reflecting our share of Airbus A321 development costs and the non-service-related costs of our retiree benefit plans. As a result, our adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $0.31, as Joe mentioned a moment ago, versus $0.28 in the third quarter of 2018. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased by $35 million to $109.2 million, and we are at $328 million through 9 months, up 52% over the first 9 months of 2018.Operating income for the quarter also rose 52% to $40.8 million. Operating expenses increased to $325.3 million with significant increases in fuel, depreciation and amortization and salaries and benefits. The increases are primarily related to Omni and expanded operations for Amazon. Quarterly interest expense increased from $5.6 million to $16.7 million, which includes the effect of higher borrowings for the Omni acquisition and aircraft investments.Our capital spending was $336.9 million through 9 months of 2019. We have acquired 9 Boeing 767 aircraft to date and placed 4 767s into service through September. Our projection for full year CapEx is now $460 million, down $15 million from our August forecast. Joe will talk more about our fleet development plan shortly.You probably saw last night that we also completed another amendment to our senior credit facility. The principal changes increased our revolver capacity by $105 million, consolidate our 2 term loans into 1 and reduced our interest rates at a given level of borrowing from the prior pricing schedule. We estimate that these favorable changes will cut our interest costs by approximately $4.7 million per year at our current borrowing level.On the operating side, our principal aircraft leasing and airline businesses continued to improve our bottom line as they expand their top line business volume. ACMI Services on a pretax basis earned $4.4 million in the third quarter compared with a loss a year ago and earnings of $1 million in the prior quarter. We had advised you in August that third quarter ramp-up costs for expanded second half flight operations for Amazon would be about $4 million, which was roughly where we wound up. We're now expecting another couple of millions of those costs in the fourth quarter as the updated flight schedules we received from Amazon in September require more crews than we had projected. That includes the effect of 2 more aircraft we will operate on a CMI basis for them.CAM, our leasing business, performed as expected. Revenues net of warrant-related lease incentives increased 21% due mainly to 17 more aircraft in service versus a year ago, including 11 from Omni. CAM's pretax earnings were $17.4 million, down from a year ago and flat with the second quarter. That's net of $4.8 million more in allocated interest expense and $7.7 million more for depreciation than a year ago, much of it related to the addition of Omni's owned passenger fleet. Costs and revenue shortfalls from delays in leasing newly converted aircraft and from aircraft transitioning between lessees were also factors.External customer revenues from other activities for the third quarter increased $4.6 million, primarily due to additional revenue for ground services and fuel sales. That was offset by the termination of sort facility management services for the U.S. Postal Service in the third quarter of last year. Pretax earnings from our other businesses were flat for the third quarter. The loss of business with the U.S. Postal Service was offset by additional revenues to support Amazon's expansion, including gateway and aircraft fuel services and sort equipment maintenance.That completes the summary of our operations for the quarter. Joe?\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Quint. ATSG looks substantially different today than it did a year ago. On November 8 last year, we acquired Omni Air. Before the year ended, we won rights to acquire 20 more 767 feedstock aircraft and agreed with Amazon on leases for 10 more 767 [ph] freighters and extensions on 20 others we lease and operate for them. Last spring, we added 3 years to our freighter leases and operating agreements with DHL.We are a bigger company now, and we'll keep growing over the next several years as we meet increased demand for our freighters and now the passenger 767s and 777s that Omni operates. We have also diversified our revenue stream with the Defense Department now representing 1/3 of our revenues. Our growth is exceptional in comparison to the overall air cargo industry. Our operating fleet will reach 100 aircraft by the end of the year, up 19 from this date last year, and all our available freighters will be flying during peak. We're growing because we principally serve the North American domestic express and integrated market, which is driven by e-commerce demand that is growing rapidly year-over-year. We're also growing because we have, in Omni, the passenger assets and reliable earnings stream from another market largely insulated from economic volatility, specifically transported military personnel.Omni's leadership in that arena continues. As we look back on a year's worth of results from Omni since we acquired it, we can tell you that it has performed just as we expected and is poised to do well again in 2020. While others faced strong headwinds from slowing economies abroad and tariffs, our U.S.-based operations are moving forward. The evidence of that trend is easy to find.DHL reports that its Americas market continues to outgrow its other global regions. UPS recently said that its second quarter overnight growth was up 30%, and third quarter was up 24% year-over-year. E-commerce volume is being driven by the convenience of mobile technology and the integration of transaction platforms with social media. The projections we follow call for 20% growth in e-commerce worldwide and 15% growth in the U.S.A. through 2021.Anticipating that trend, our 767 freighter growth pipeline is in good shape. We will convert and deliver to awaiting customers 8 to 10 767s next year, the majority of which are under agreement. Our growth opportunities are primarily in the Americas but also in Southeast Asia and the Mideast. In addition to our agreement a year ago with Jetran for 20 ex-American Airlines 767s, we have been acquiring feedstock from other sources to meet specific customer requirements and market demand through 2021. To date, we have purchased 3 of the 767s in our Jetran allotment. In short, we have largely locked up the feedstock we expect to require for the next 2 years. This puts us in excellent position to service customer demand as the feedstock market remains tight.Even as we manage significant growth in our airline operations, we are leading the way in providing safe, reliable, on-time service to our customers every day. Both the words and actions of our customers affirm our performance quality. Our freighter deliveries are backloaded this year as we told you would be the case. From late June through the end of the year, we will put 8 767 freighters into service for Amazon. That's 6 that CAM is leasing them and 2 others Amazon has shifted to ATI from another carrier. We are also dry leasing 4 converted 767s to UPS, plus a fifth in January. We expect to end 2019 with 5 767s, and we're awaiting modification.Given the short 2019 lease and operating periods for these new assets, they will deliver much greater cash flow in 2020 than in the fourth quarter when we will also absorb their start-up costs. So our guidance remains unchanged from the $450 million we gave you in August. Our fleet growth profile for next year is shaping up to look much like this year as well: a full year of contributions from the aircraft we are placing now, plus cash flow, mainly in the second half from deliveries of 2020 aircraft.Quint mentioned that we have just amended our credit facility in ways that add flexibility and reduce our interest costs. That's a strong endorsement from our banks of our ability to generate exceptional cash flow to fund most of our growth while we continue to operate at comfortable or even decreasing debt leverage. We're aware that many investors have turned away from the air cargo sector because of the macro factors we're all aware of. Certainly, our stock price is reflecting a lot of that skepticism. Those who look closely at ATSG, however, will find a company with almost no fuel price or payload risk, reliable performance and in-demand assets. We are looking forward to years of strong cash flow without federal tax cash obligations generated from long-term lease and operating contracts. Some of those leases extend late into the next decade.That's the performance we have been saying for years that our business model can and does deliver. We expect to moderate our fleet investments next year and do so further if e-commerce and other long-term trends driving our growth subside. We would instead use more cash to pay down debt and return some to shareholders, but we have no intention of forfeiting today's growth opportunities to competitors because they drive the shareholder value we are generating today.That concludes our prepared remarks, John. We're ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Jack Atkins from Stephens.\nUnidentified Analyst: You've got Wade [ph] on for Jack. Congratulations on the quarter. So to start, when we think about the puts and takes of your guidance, it sounds like there are some increased customer demand in the fourth quarter but also some ramp-up costs related to that and then some timing issues related to some aircraft deliveries. So first, are we reading that correctly? And while this might mute some upside this year, does that provide some greater visibility into additional growth for next year?\nJoe Hete: Well, I think the upside for peak season is just strictly related to peak in terms of demand for the assets that we normally have tied up in maintenance, et cetera, so we've got increased demand there in terms of its utilization. And as we mentioned, in addition to that, we've got 2 aircraft that weren't originally part of our plan that were transferred over from another operator that we had to gear up for. So we're going to see costs associated with that. And then when you look forward, going into 2020, one of the things you run into is all training, for example, seasons for line crew members, other than the upgrade side in the fourth quarter, and then it picks back up again in the first. So we continue to have to add people into the mix to accommodate the existing lift and then be able to transition into the first of the year to keep the aircraft going.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, that makes sense. And so when we think about the goal for 10 deployments in FY '20 with 5 already under contract and sounds like strong demand for the other 5, could that plan for 10 move any higher?\nJoe Hete: No. I think we're constricted by the production lines from a conversion standpoint, and that's why we usually say it's 8 to 10 because you can always run into an issue where you can't get the airplanes out as quickly as you would like to. We pretty much occupy all the modification lines at IAI from a conversion standpoint. There's another airplane or 2 from other operators in there, but we pretty much monopolize them. So the ability to kick that up is -- will be extremely difficult and most likely wouldn't happen.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then last one, and I'll hand it off. Can we talk preliminary CapEx outlook for 2020? Do you guys have that yet?\nQuint Turner: Yes. We -- this is Quint. We would foresee some reduction certainly from 2019's level, which we've guided for this year at $460 million. I think you would see us more closer to the $400 million type level, somewhere in that vicinity. Obviously, we're not -- we haven't totally finalized all that, and we hope to give more guidance on that, of course, the next time we talk. But it is a -- we foresee a lower CapEx requirement certainly as we go into 2020.\nOperator: Our next question is from Helane Becker from Cowen.\nConor Cunningham: It's actually Conor Cunningham on for Helene. Just on -- maybe coming at 2020 a little bit different, I mean, for the EBITDA outlook. I know you don't -- you aren't giving formal guidance, and I think you spoke to a little bit today. But when we think about 2020, is it -- should we be thinking about it in the context of EBITDA growth of at least the growth in your fleet? I mean just given what you did this year, I realize there are some start-up costs. Maybe you can give a little -- some puts and takes on what you're expecting maybe on the cost side and maybe on revenues if you have any visibility there.\nQuint Turner: Yes, Conor. As you say, we, of course, will give the guidance when we -- as we always do in February when we come out with the end of the year. But because of the timing of the aircraft entrants this year, you're right that full year contribution next year will be evident. We've got, I believe, 6 -- well, 8, counting the 2 that came in from Amazon from a different carrier, but we have 6 that CAM will be leasing that will be starting in the fourth quarter. And so you're going to see a full year contribution from those. And we sort of -- I think -- the analysts that follow us kind of know roughly what we expect to see in terms of contributions from the lease for those as we look forward.And we've also had a lot of start-up costs in 2019 given the growth, the number of aircraft that we brought on. So we would hope to see some efficiency there, although there'll be more new aircraft coming online next year. Certainly, it doesn't appear to be the number that we've had to gear up for this year. We also had to gear up for a heavier flight schedule in the second half, and that was a pretty significant driver of the start-up costs that we've talked about this year. So having that behind us, we would expect to see some efficiencies in our airline ACMI operations next year once they've cleared those start-up costs. So I do think that we'll have a tailwind on our EBITDA going into next year, and we expect a double-digit-type growth rate for next year.\nConor Cunningham: Great. And then just on maybe on the DoD business. So how was that looking into 2020? Are you expecting it kind of to remain at a very robust level that you're seeing now?\nJoe Hete: Yes. From a DoD perspective, we don't anticipate that we're going to see any reduction in that. As the -- if you look out from a military perspective, as we said on previous calls, one of the things they're trying to do is minimize somewhat the utilization of the military's own assets, which means anything that can and could be done by the commercial sector will drive some of that. It's not going to be a significant growth number; but on a year-over-year basis, we expect to see growth.\nConor Cunningham: Great. And maybe one on the A321 conversion. So you're targeting certification in mid-2020. When do you expect to start looking for feedstock for that aircraft? And have you already started to have some discussions with customers on that plane? And does it actually open you up to additional customers that you don't actually have right now? Just curious on your thoughts there.\nJoe Hete: Yes. The 321, right now, the target is to get the certification, call it, in the latter part of the second quarter of next year. The aircraft, from a conversion standpoint, is down off jacks. It's sitting on its own landing gear. We're still doing some testing, expect to start test flying in the first part of the year going forward. As far as the aircraft itself, feedstock, we're always on the lookout for feedstock if the right opportunity would come along. But right now, when you think about things like the 737 MAX being grounded, et cetera, a 321 is an equivalent lift, actually a little bit more, but that's going to hold feedstock availability down. But we're talking to a number of customers, both ourselves and Precision. Obviously, we can leverage the 321 from the perspective of buying aircraft, converting them and leasing them out ourselves. We can leverage it from the standpoint that we're part owner of the ultimate STC that would come out, and so we'd share in those proceeds as well.Really, from a production standpoint, if you're talking about a second quarter certification of the aircraft, you might get a couple more aircraft into the mix in the latter part of 2020. And from a full production standpoint, I don't see it being a big production line going forward until probably the latter part of '21 and '22.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. In terms of like the actual conversion, is it a similar time frame as the other aircraft that you normally do? Or is there any, I don't know...\nJoe Hete: Are you talking about the elapsed time to converting an aircraft?\nConor Cunningham: Yes.\nJoe Hete: Yes. That's difficult to say at this point. It is a fairly extensive mod, although you are actually obviously talking about a smaller airframe than the 767 is. But until we get through the certification process itself and understand all the piece parts. As you can imagine, during the certification, there's a lot of form and fit issues that you have to deal with, but in no way shape or form should it be any longer than what the 767 is, which right now is, call it, 120 days.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Ross from Stifel.\nDavid Ross: It's actually me. A question on the -- yes, I guess on Omni first. It's been almost exactly a year. So what's the post-deal postmortem in your analysis after having Omni as part of ATSG for the last year? Is it better than expected, worse than expected? How is it different?\nQuint Turner: Dave, it's Quint. And we are honored that you actually joined us on the call today, so. Yes. It's a good -- great question, Omni. As Joe said in his remarks earlier, it's performing as expected and I would say better in some respects certainly than expected. So we're-- as far as the postmortem, it was accretive from the beginning and has remained so to our earnings. We talked about what our assumptions were when we purchased it, about its trailing 12-month EBITDA and cash flow production. And I would -- we've -- as you know, we've taken the 11 owned aircraft and they're part of CAM's portfolio. So part of that EBITDA manifests itself with CAM. But in total, if you look at it, I think it is -- it has met and/or exceeded what our expectations were for cash flow production. And moreover, in terms of, I think, putting us -- putting our revenue book in a place where it's less exposed to volatility from things like the general cargo market, it really was a game changer for us. And I think, given all the growth opportunities that remain with us in the e-commerce space, it's going to provide a nice balancing immunization impact on our exposures to the broad economy.\nJoe Hete: David, if you look at it from a utilization standpoint, obviously mix comes into play if you're talking about 777s versus 767s. But if you look at third quarter, for example, on a year-over-year basis, Omni's block hours were up 16% versus third quarter last year. So it's growing in addition to what we expected to get from a baseline perspective over the long term. And of course, as we've mentioned, I think, on the last call, we've given them an additional 767-300 out of the American fleet to operate in the -- not the military sector, but commercial sector. And it's -- right now, as Quint mentioned, it's doing everything we expected it to.\nDavid Ross: But the block hours are up mostly on an apples-to-apples basis, but there's one more plane in there?\nJoe Hete: No, because the one more plane isn't going to drive a 16% increase in block hours on a year-over-year basis. If you look at that from a raw numbers perspective in terms of the -- if you look at it, there was 9,000 block hours flown by Omni in the third quarter of this year versus about 7,800 the prior year. So you're not going to get that kind of utilization out of one aircraft. So everything in total is growing.\nDavid Ross: Okay. And Omni did also bring some charter business to you, although it's not the long-haul cargo charter that's exposed to the air freight market and what's going on with trade and tariff issues? How do you think about the charter business as part of ACMI? Does it change the profile of the earnings longer term? Is it more volatile? Is there something about the passenger charter market that's more stable than the cargo charter market?\nJoe Hete: No. I wouldn't say it's more stable. I mean charter is what it is. I mean think about Omni in total. Remember if you look at the book of business they had, it was 70%, DoD; 15%, government; and 15%, commercial. And one of the commercial -- on the commercial side, they had one long-term customer. They had a dedicated aircraft to it. So it's not going to be a huge driver of revenue for us from a charter standpoint in terms of -- in comparison to the total book of revenue that we have. But certainly, if you can put hours on an asset that otherwise might be sitting on the deck, it certainly helps the bottom line.\nDavid Ross: And then, when we're looking at the fourth quarter and maintaining EBITDA guidance for the year, do you expect ACMI margins, given the puts and takes with the more aircraft, more hours but somewhat increased training costs, should ACMI margins be up year-over-year or flat or a little bit down?\nJoe Hete: No. It should be up on a year-over-year basis, just because the number of additional assets we have flying out there. But as Quint mentioned, we've incurred a significant amount of investment in training costs for crews, and that will roll into the fourth quarter as well. We've had about $4 million to this past quarter, third quarter, in terms of just training costs associated with bringing crews online. And that will continue not to that degree in the fourth quarter, so margins should improve as we go through the fourth and start off the year.\nQuint Turner: And remember, Dave, we only had Omni for a partial quarter a year ago, right? So that will have -- that will help margins having them for a full quarter this year.\nDavid Ross: And last question, Quint, on the interest expense. I don't know if I was writing too fast or what. But did you say that with the new credit agreement that interest expense is going to be down $4.7 million a year, so more like $15 million a quarter?\nQuint Turner: Yes. At the current -- right. At the current borrowing level, we essentially were able to achieve a lower pricing in terms of the spreads based on the pricing grid that the banks charge interest to us on. And so I think at our -- at current pricing level, immediately it would drop 37.5 basis points, which is you just take that across our secured debt at the current level, it equates to about $4.7 million per year of lower interest costs.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Steve O'Hara from Sidoti & Company.\nStephen O'Hara: I guess just, first, on the start-up costs and things like that for the -- I assume it's just Amazon. But can you just -- I mean I think the total is something in the neighborhood of $13 million or something. Is that kind of a -- I mean that should be a tailwind for next year. And then I assume this is kind of ramping up faster than expected. But the way Amazon utilizes the aircraft, is that turning to sort of having extra crews maybe not as heavily utilized in 1Q and 2Q? Does that turn into more of a headwind having extra crews? Or how does that work?\nJoe Hete: From a crew costs or training standpoint, Steve, the number isn't quite as high as $13 million for the year on a forecasted basis. But as I said, we still will incur some in the fourth quarter as well. As we transition into the next year, obviously, we have to again start people running through their recurrent training cycles, which they haven't had, as well as open up vacations again for folks. So you need people to backfill where otherwise they would -- they were not in a training mode, and you're gearing up for a regular utilization of the aircraft themselves. So it will be a tailwind for us in the first part of the year. But then again, it all depends on what the demand is in terms of the flying. We came into this year with -- expecting less than half of what we think we're going to incur this year from training costs, but that changed pretty quickly when the aircraft utilization changed, which primarily driven by Amazon is going to a 1-day delivery service.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then in terms of the impact on the MAX grounding, do you know kind of roughly what that impact is maybe so far this year and then maybe what you expect it to be for full year, assuming that plane eventually starts flying again?\nJoe Hete: Well, from the MAX standpoint, I'm not sure what you mean by the impact. Now we are flying one aircraft for Air Canada to cover for their MAX being grounded, so we're getting utilization out of one aircraft for that. As I mentioned earlier, it does have some impact from a feedstock standpoint, particularly on a light kind of asset basis, the A321. There may be some folks out there that are holding on to a 767, for example, to cover for a MAX that may be grounded. But outside of that, there's really no direct impact to us today, other than the fact that we are operating that one additional aircraft for Air Canada.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay. So I guess that was the impact I was talking about. So it's really just one aircraft and probably not a huge driver of anything or negative when it goes away?\nJoe Hete: No, it won't be.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay. And then maybe just lastly, in terms of the -- did you say kind of what the expected EBITDA run rate was at the end of the year?\nQuint Turner: We didn't. We didn't a give a number for that, Steve. And of course, we'll give that guidance in February. So I think you know it's certainly north of $460 million and less than $500 million. How about that? So somewhere in between.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: I was wondering if you could talk about, given all the changes in ACMI over the last 2, 3 years with Amazon, certainly Omni, how we should think about pretax margins on a steady-state basis, assuming that there aren't any other significant acquisitions and perhaps in the kind of 2% to 3% GDP backdrop?\nQuint Turner: Yes. I mean, Steve -- or Chris, we've always, I think, said that the ACMI Services margin is a single-digit-type margin. It has more volatility associated with it because the changes in customer demand, such as we've had this year where you're ramping up operations, can impact it. Omni, if you look back at our historic ACMI margins, you'll note that there's been improvement, certainly, with the addition of Omni and with their customer base and the nature of their contracts. So I still believe we are looking longer term at a single-digit margin target for that. It's -- certainly Omni has helped move that a little higher, if that helps.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay, that's helpful. In the release, you talked about lower CapEx in the out-years and reducing leverage. And Joe in his prepared remarks said that you have visibility into your feedstock, I think, for the next 2, 3 years. So putting all that all together, are you suggesting that beyond 2020 or so we could see free cash flow, positive free cash flow on a sustained basis, which I know is kind of contrary to the way the model works with an aircraft to grow, et cetera? But I was just curious how to reconcile that versus what you called out in the release.\nQuint Turner: I think that certainly we've been in an investment cycle given the growth opportunities that were in front of us. And as Joe said, when good growth opportunities are there, we like to pursue those because that produces the best value long term. I do think that we're in a great position in that our maintenance CapEx needs are pretty low. We said only about $100 million. We were proactive in securing feedstock when we bought the 20 aircraft fleet, ex-American fleet, and it's fit well into this investment cycle. But if you look beyond that, I mean, I think you'll see plenty of opportunity for free cash flows, deleveraging and free cash flows. And there's a lot of capital allocation option certainly that we'll have at our disposal if you look out. Really, you don't even have to look that far for that.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then, just one follow-up here. So how dynamic the peak season has been over the last few years, looking specifically at the integrators and all the changes, investments they're making in their network to handle volumes. I'm curious, as a lessor, you operate some of these planes, how you've seen the peak shape? What's perhaps easier today as an operator? Or more challenging, how are you balancing utilization and on-time performance for a business that continues to grow in the double digits?\nQuint Turner: Chris, Mike Berger happens to be sitting here with us. And since, Rich Corrado usually fields those kind of questions, but he's traveling. We're going to bring Mike, our Chief Commercial Officer, into play here. So Mike?\nMichael Berger: We'll have all our aircraft flying during peak this year, and we've been committed to that for a number of weeks now. So we saw extremely strong demand early on from some of our customers, so we'll get full utilization out of our fleet this year. It's also a little bit more condensed this year with Thanksgiving falling in the last week of November. So that will make crunch time, so to speak, even more important in terms of on-time performance. But as Joe stated in his remarks -- earlier remarks, we continue to see all of our airlines performing at very high, on-time performance levels. So peak this year, shorter in terms of a condensed standpoint and full utilization of all of our aircraft in our fleet, so very good season for us.\nJoe Hete: One of the challenges going forward, Chris, from the industry's perspective is there's very few assets that aren't already dedicated to utilization on a 12-month-a-year basis. And when you start talking about peak assets, you have to have something that either has some book of business that occupies it for 10.5 or 11 months out of the year and then frees it up, which those are -- just really aren't out there to any great degree at all. So it's going to be a challenge for the industry as a whole from a service perspective to deal with peak volumes as the e-commerce sector of the business continues to grow and stuff has to move by air versus service movements.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Last one, you say Rich is overseas, and, Joe, you talked about e-commerce potential overseas. Outside of Amazon flying in, say, Europe, I'm just curious what other e-tailers or operators are out there that you can point to that might look to supplement their existing air capacity or perhaps start up a dedicated fleet?\nJoe Hete: Yes. I mean there's not a lot out there in terms of that have the bandwidth to. I mean people always talk about Walmart, for example, but Walmart has such an expansive surface distribution network that it'd be difficult. And as far as I know, they don't do a darn thing by air today. I think you have to start looking around the globe to find other opportunities. Certainly, Amazon, as you mentioned, in Europe could be one. You could get into Asia, for example, but our ability to operate there is pretty limited. But certainly, it would be a potential outlet for leasing aircraft in there, especially when you start talking about something like the 321. One of the reasons we like that airplane is great cubic capacity, much better than the 737-800. So we see potential markets in the long pool if, for example, an Alibaba or something like that sets up a network in the Asian sector. That would certainly be a great location for the 321 because, right now, a bunch of the things that they do in China, for example, is point-to-point as opposed to hub-and-spoke.\nOperator: Our next question is from Christopher Hillary from Roubaix.\nChristopher Hillary: Just a quick question. I know there's a lot of differences, but do you have any observations on the acquisition of Aircastle? As earlier you kind of commented on how the stock price might have reacted to some negative trends in the freight market? I was curious if you thought there was any read-acrosses [ph] from what happened with Aircastle.\nJoe Hete: No. Nothing we can see. I mean generally your larger leasing companies are focused more on new -- buying new assets, primarily focused on the passenger market. We're -- as we're on converted assets in the cargo market, so I don't think there's much overlap there.\nOperator: We did have another question queue up from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Just on -- I don't think anyone's asked about labor but the open CBA with one of the subsidiaries. I think it's ATI. And then also, given all the aircraft additions for this year and next year, how we should think about headcount and maybe if you could split that between pilot and crew versus corporate.\nJoe Hete: Well, I think from -- it's actually ABX that has the open collective bargaining agreement, not ATI. They're still under the auspices of the National Mediation Board. They met for 3 or 4 days last week with the federal mediator, so negotiations continue. Now that we're heading into peak season, you probably won't see any additional mediated discussions until after the -- after we get through the first of the year. But like I said, from our perspective, even though we've got this collective bargaining agreement that's open, the crews continue to move the airplanes on an on-time basis. Their performance remains at the usual high level. So things are on an even keel there. And second part of your question, Chris, was?\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Just with all the aircraft additions, how we should think about headcount growth for 2020 and if you could maybe split that between pilot and crew versus corporate.\nJoe Hete: Well, it's difficult to say until we know what the schedules would be from a pilot standpoint. Like I said, 4 of the aircraft go to Amazon, 1 to UPS and -- of the 5 that we have firm commits on. As they add aircraft into the network, it could lower the utilization on other assets as they add those in. So it's difficult to say what the actual number would be until we receive schedules for that. As far as the -- let's call it, the admin side of the equation, it's a pretty small number overall that you have to add in order to support the growth of the airlines themselves. Probably the bigger driver is on the maintenance side of the equation as you have to add technicians depending upon whether you're using an existing location to run that airplane through or a new location. And all the talk you hear out there in the industry about pilot shortages, I'm here to tell you that I think there's a much more acute shortage of qualified maintenance technicians than there is pilots. And of course, if we can't fix the airplane, you don't need a pilot to fly it. So we've had no difficulty attracting pilots to date with ATI because of the great opportunities, so it's -- we're able to put butts in the seats, so to speak.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then last one on the Amazon warrants; have any been exercised? And just remind us again when the 2016 and 2018 tranches expire.\nQuint Turner: Yes, Chris, nothing exercised as of yet. The first warrant tranche, which we issued in, what, March of 2016, was a 5-year exercise period, so March of 2021. And then last December, we issued the other tranche associated with the lease extensions on the 20 aircraft, the additional 10 leases in the CMI agreement, 5-year extension. Those warrants have an exercise period of 7 years from that date. So that would be, what, 2025, late 2025.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time.\nJoe Hete: Well, thanks, John. On behalf of the Board of Directors, I want to thank those of you on the call today who shared their thoughts last month about the factors affecting our stock price. We appreciate all the ideas about how we can make ATSG a stronger, more profitable and more shareholder-focused company. Thank you for your continuing support, and have a quality day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 2, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-08-06 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2019 Air Transport Services Group, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brandon, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded.And I will now turn it over to Joe Hete, President and CEO. Mr. Hete, you may begin.\nJoe Hete: Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me today are Quint Turner, our Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Corrado, our Chief Operating Officer. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market close. It's on our website, atsginc.com. We will file our Form 10-Q later this week.Halfway through 2019, we're meeting our targets and working toward a successful second half as focused as ever on growing markets such as e-commerce infrastructure and transport for our U.S. troops and their supplies. Here are the second quarter headlines. Compared with the second quarter last year, our revenues were up 64%. Our adjusted earnings are up 10% to $18.7 million or $0.27 per share, and our adjusted EBITDA rose 50% to $104.8 million. Our airline operations are expanding, and our leased aircraft fleet is growing. Our air network services for the Department of Defense and Amazon are up versus the prior year, and we have 16 more aircraft in our operating fleet than a year ago. Our relationship with DHL is now governed by an amended agreement signed in April that extends our 16-year role in its U.S. and Mideast networks for at least 3 more years, and we added more capacity under our senior credit facility to ensure we can deliver the aircraft and services our customers want. Our strong start and projection of a strong peak season for the air networks we serve give me confidence that we will achieve our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook of $450 million.Quint is ready to review our consolidated results and changes in our balance sheet. Rich will cover our segment highlights, and I'll close with comments on our outlook. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Joe. Good morning to all of you on the call right now and to those who will listen on replay. As always, I'll start by saying that during the course of this call, we will make projections or other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call, and Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in market demand for our assets and services; our operating airlines\u2019 ability to maintain on-time service and control costs; the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration; fluctuations in ATSG's traded share price and in interest rates, which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments; the number, timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers; our ability to remain in compliance with our agreements with key customers and lenders; and other factors as contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-Q we will file this week.We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials. We advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website.As Joe said, our second quarter results compare very favorably with our results from a year ago, and our adjusted earnings rose 10%, thanks to contributions from the freighters and passenger aircraft we've added to CAM's leasing portfolio. On a consolidated basis, second quarter revenues were $335 million, up $131 million or 64% from the prior year. Our acquisition of Omni Air last November was the principal factor in that gain as it was in the first quarter. The Department of Defense is ATSG's largest customer, representing 36% of our revenues for the second quarter. 20% of revenues came from Amazon and 15% from DHL.Once again, our GAAP results reflect the unrealized effect of quarterly revaluations of several financial instruments. These include noncash effects of the warrants we have issued to Amazon based primarily on changes in ATSG's stock price from quarter-to-quarter and the effects of revaluing interest rate hedges on our bank debt. Second quarter earnings from continuing operations were a negative $26.6 million on a GAAP basis versus positive $24.5 million a year ago. On a diluted basis, GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter were negative $0.45 versus positive $0.21 a year ago. That $0.66 variance primarily reflects a $0.52 after-tax loss from warrant and derivative revaluation versus a $0.01 gain a year ago. Other factors included a $0.10 increase in losses from affiliates, primarily reflecting our share of Airbus 321 development costs via our joint venture with Precision.Higher noncash charges for the non-service-related costs of retiree benefit plans also were a headwind against GAAP earnings versus the prior year. The adjusted earnings, EPS and adjusted EBITDA we report exclude those items. As a result, our adjusted EPS for the second quarter was $0.27 versus $0.25 a year ago. On the same basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased by 50% to $105 million.Operating expenses increased $117 million or 65% with significant Omni-related increases in fuel, depreciation and amortization and salaries and benefits. Compensation costs also increased because of higher headcount at ATI to support expanded CMI flying in the second half. D&A, overall, increased 52%, and maintenance increased 8% for the quarter.Interest expense increased $11 million to $17 million, which includes the effect of higher borrowings to acquire Omni, our larger CapEx budget and higher rates. Our capital spending for the second quarter was $125 million and $217 for the first half.We acquired three Boeing 767 passenger aircraft during the quarter, including one we held out a freighter conversion dedicated to Omni Air in response to increased demand for passenger charter flying in the second half. We are maintaining our projection for full year CapEx spend of about $475 million, mostly to acquire and modify more 767s for deployment through next year. Joe will talk more about that shortly.Also, we added $100 million of credit capacity when we amended our credit facility in May to continue our fleet development program. With our growing EBITDA, we expect to maintain a comfortable debt-to-EBITDA ratio under 3.5x through the balance of the year.That's the top-level summary of our financial results for the quarter. Rich is ready to share some segment highlights. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint, and good morning, everybody. As Joe said, our principal aircraft leasing and airline operations are off to a solid start this year, and even better results are anticipated in the second half. ACMI Services on a pretax basis earned $1 million in the second quarter, up $0.5 million from a year ago. That performance was, of course, led by Omni's contributions which began last November. Pretax earnings at ACMI Services were lower than the strong first quarter results due to the timing of maintenance events, including engines, and fewer block hours for the DoD in the second quarter. During the second quarter, we incurred approximately $3 million of ramp-up costs for expanded second half flight operations for Amazon, and we expect approximately $4 million more of those costs in Q3 as well. We do anticipate sequential improvement in earnings for ACMI Services in the third quarter and significantly improved segment earnings in the fourth quarter when ramp-up will be complete and scheduled airframe maintenance is light.On the hiring front, we have hired over 70 new pilots as well as technicians and other employees to fully support CMI and ACMI operations this year and allow us to continue to provide exceptional service to our customers. We amended the collective bargaining agreement with our ATI pilots a year ago with new wage and benefits packages, but we remain in contract discussions with our ABX Air pilots.CAM, our leasing business, had a good quarter. Revenues, net of warrant-related lease incentives, increased 27% due mainly to 5 more converted 767 freighters in service versus a year ago. CAM also had a full first half of revenues from the 11 passenger aircraft that are acquired from Omni and leased back to them. CAM's pretax earnings rose 8% to $17 million from the prior year quarter. That's net of $5 million more in unallocated interest expense and $8.2 million more for depreciation than a year ago, much of it Omni related. CAM had 56 cargo aircraft leased to external customers during the second quarter, 2 more than the prior year. 11 767s were awaiting or undergoing conversion to freighters at June 30, including 3 passenger 767s acquired for conversion during the second quarter of 2019. One of them was deployed in passenger service with Omni at the end of July in response to strong second half demand for charter passenger lift. We have seen increased interest from airlines who operate the 737 MAX and do believe that its continued grounding has created additional charter opportunity. We expect all of our aircraft to be fully deployed during peak season, but the steps required to get all of our aircraft ready for peak will include readying the 767s in staging now for redeployment.Results of our maintenance and conversion businesses, previously reported via the MRO services segment, are once again included in other activities. Our consolidated revenues with Omni mean they are no longer large enough to require reporting as a separate segment. Pretax earnings for other activities, net of intercompany transactions, are up $1 million to $4 million versus the prior year. External maintenance results remain on track, partly offsetting the loss of our sort-center management services for the U.S. Postal Service last fall. Amazon notified us during the second quarter that they will be insourcing the management of 8 gateway facilities where we supported independent contract employees. The transition of our responsibilities to Amazon at these facilities will be completed this month.We have also gained some logistics work, including managing and staffing Amazon's gateway operation in Charlotte and the aircraft fueling and maintenance responsibilities for material handling and ground equipment in Wilmington. Amazon now operates a regional air hub here, currently involving 8 of our 767 aircraft. The core competencies of our logistics group make it a virtual Swiss Army knife, which can add value for the customers who lease and operate our aircraft.Our service remains best in class for our largest customers, and we get consistent, positive feedback regarding not only our service quality but also our ability to adapt to rapidly changing needs and respond with predictive solutions to improve service. Our customer-first service culture spans all of our service providers, and we feel that this differentiation, particularly in the express and e-commerce segment, will continue to reward us with growth going forward.That completes the summary of our operations for the quarter. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Joe.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Rich. The fact all of our business units are performing well thus far and from an operating standpoint are mostly on track with our plans for the year. In April, we lengthened our 6-year -- 16-year relationship with DHL by extending leases and operating agreements with them for 11 aircraft for another 3 years. 3 of our other 767-300s are already leased to DHL for even longer terms. When we announced our agreement with Amazon in December for 10 more leased 767s and lease extensions for the 20 we had already leased them, we expect to deploy 5 each in the second half of 2019 and 2020. At Amazon's request, we have changed that schedule to lease them 6 767s this year and 4 more in 2020. In late June, CAM deployed the first of the 6. The second one entered service in early July, and the third is due later this month. The 3 others will be in service by peak season. We also told you in May that we have agreed to lease 4 767s to UPS in 2019 and potentially another in 2020, all under 6-year terms. In addition, we'll be supporting UPS during peak with additional 767 capacity under short-term arrangements as we have done in past years.Quick note that our projected CapEx spend for this year remains at $475 million, which is up $182 million from 2018. A portion of that is for increased capitalized maintenance cost for Omni aircraft, but most of it is to expand CAM's portfolio of 767 leased aircraft. I expect that we will be able to place a minimum of 10 more 767s for the full year 2020. That includes 4 more 767s already committed to Amazon and the one we expect to lease to UPS next year.We're in good shape for feedstock. We arranged with Jetran last year to purchase 20 767s, most of them formally in service with American Airlines. We have purchased 5 of our Jetran allotment so far. Last week, we contracted to purchase 3 other 767s from ANA with one to be acquired in 2020. We're continuing to make progress with our JV partner toward FAA approval of an STC for the Airbus A321-200 passenger-to-freighter conversion. We continue to expect that approval by the middle of next year and anticipate investing $6 million more in the second half of this year into the venture. CAM continues to assess the market for A321 feedstock in anticipation of STC approval in production possibly beginning late next year.Like those of you who analyze the air cargo space, we're still getting plenty of calls asking about the effect on ATSG of the current global trade disputes. Our response remains unchanged. We don't sell space. Our midsize freighters fly in time-definite regional networks, not in the long-haul lanes moving manufactured goods, and we get the bulk of our cash flow and return on investment from long-term aircraft leases with much of that lease demand coming from customers expanding their e-commerce and express networks. Government entities now comprise more than 40% of our total revenue, which even further immunizes us from the effects of trade disruptions and economic cycles. In short, we do not base any significant exposure from tariffs or other trade negotiations. That doesn't mean we can't be impacted by other items, including customer changes to their network flight operations, including the DoD. Also, smaller regional air cargo operators sometimes struggle when markets shift, but we have built a business which can generate sustainable, growing cash flows over the long term, not just when the market conditions are stable. That differentiates us from our competitors, and we'll continue to create shareholder value.That concludes our prepared remarks, Brandon. We're ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And from Stephens, we have Jack Atkins.\nJack Atkins: Congratulations on a great quarter here. So Rich, let me, if I could, start off with a question for you and just kind of dovetailing on Joe's comments there at the end of his prepared remarks. But could you just maybe talk about what you're seeing and hearing from customers with regard to interest in incremental aircraft leases from here? Obviously, we saw Amazon pulling an aircraft forward into 2019 and UPS likely wanting another plane for 2020. Could you just talk about what you're seeing and hearing generally in the marketplace? And has anything changed in the tone of your customers over the last 3 to 6 months? I mean I think that's clearly a concern for folks. And from what we're seeing in your business, that's not having an impact but would just be curious if you're picking up on any changes in tone.\nRich Corrado: No, Jack. In fact, we see the market as -- what we do is very strong in all geographies within which we currently lease aircraft. If you look at the United States, we've already talked about what we're deploying this year. We've got a significant portfolio already committed for next year, and then we've got demand, talking to existing customers and new customers in the Far East. We're talking to customers in the Middle East. The only place that shows a little bit of weakness is Europe. But even there, there are carriers looking for aircraft. So again, if you think about the market that we even talked about this a lot over the years, and that is we fly these airplanes in regional markets, and we fly for express carriers and companies that provide e-commerce fulfillment. And those markets are going very strong. Look at UPS' second quarter results. They have 30% growth in their express business. 30% growth, as large as they are, is extremely significant. So we see the market as very strong. We're bullish on the market, and we've acquired some more feedstock this year. We think we'll have no problem deploying all the aircraft that we're going to produce next year going forward.\nJack Atkins: Okay. That's very encouraging. And I guess just kind of following up on your comment there on sort of the market. I mean when we think about Amazon who's obviously a major customer, speeding up their supply chain and going from 2-day prime to 1-day prime, that obviously has ripple effects across the rest of the market. And as you guys think about the potential market opportunity, I don't know how you want to slice it and dice it, but particularly within the domestic market for domestic express capacity over the next 5 to 7 years, to me, it seems like there's quite a long runway there. But I just would be curious to get your take on how you see the market developing over the next several years because it doesn't seem like the need for express capacity is doing anything but going up.\nRich Corrado: No. Again, it's a good observation, Jack. If you look at the growth, again, of UPS, you look at the growth of Amazon and you look at the penetration of e-commerce since the retail segment of the United States, as an example, it's probably 12% to 13%. That's it. And you look at the retail environment that's struggling, you still see a lot of closures of brick-and-mortar stores with that business transitioning over to online. So all those signals and all of the things that you read about, we see on the aircraft front. We're hearing from customers. We wouldn't have thought 2 years ago that we would be leasing airplanes to UPS, but here we are. And so trying to keep up with this growth, trying to get enough assets going forward, the customers that need 767s, A321s in the future, we're very bullish on the market.\nJack Atkins: Okay. That's great. And just last one for me, and I'll jump back in queue. But I guess this one's for Quint. Quint, when we think about CapEx needs looking out into 2020, and I know you guys are sort of still formulating your budget for next year or just beginning that process, so I'm not looking for formal guidance. But as we sort of think about the $475 million this year, the plan, I think, is to convert and put into service 10 planes next year, I guess how should we be thinking about the CapEx needs of the business, just maybe if you want to put brackets on it or just sort of a rough ballpark? Next year, if the plan is to convert and place 10 planes into service, what would the CapEx requirements for that be -- for the business be next year under that scenario?\nQuint Turner: Well, Jack, again, as you noted, we're projecting in terms of a deployment plan a very similar year to what we're seeing this year. And it -- we will enter the year with, I think, 11 aircraft in mod that we already own the airframes, so we've got to complete those. But we will -- we do anticipate taking some more of the ex-American fleet next year in terms of additional airframes. And so I think it will be still a pretty significant CapEx year in 2020, down somewhat certainly because we've been -- in terms of filling some of the orders, including the UPS order, we've been pretty aggressive about our acquisitions of airframes this year. So I would expect a lower number, but it won't -- will be north of -- certainly north of $300 million next year, well north of that, closer to probably $400 million as just a placeholder for now. But we'll, of course, give you updated guidance on that as we get further along in the year.\nJack Atkins: Okay. No. That's helpful. But I mean you've been north -- close to $400 million, which still imply some pretty nice free cash flow generation next year, and that's just kind of what I wanted to get some more color on. So that's helpful.\nOperator: From Stifel, we have David Ross.\nDavid Ross: As you think about the plane additions going forward, the call for 10 more next year doesn't factor in any A321s, but you said that there's a possibility of, I guess, the certificate is approved that they could be entering the fleet as early as the second half of next year. Is that correct?\nJoe Hete: Yes, Dave. I mean the -- right now, the target is to have the STC approved by the end of the second quarter of next year. Production would start off relatively slow in terms of gearing up multiple lines to produce the converted freighters, and of course, there's the feedstock question. With the issues with the 737 MAX, if that continues to go down the rails further than what it already has, that's certainly going to keep some of the potential feedstock tied up. And then of course, right now, it's keeping feedstock prices pretty high. But we would expect potential acquisitions of feedstock aircraft by the latter part of next year. Unlikely that we would have any converted into service at that point, but certainly, we'd be looking to do some acquisitions of the feedstock and get that program started.\nDavid Ross: And would they mainly be converted in Tampa?\nJoe Hete: We're looking at that as a go-to option at this point in time. We've got folks down there meeting today. It's been factored today and tomorrow, just to review what the potential is to set up multiple lines down there. So that's certainly high on the list.\nDavid Ross: And when you think about the plane type versus the 767 model that's prevalent in e-commerce today, is that -- I guess do you think about it incrementally? Or is it a competition with the 767 for those customers who are on certain routes, where they're thinking about either/or?\nJoe Hete: No. That would not be a competitor to the 767. We look at it on 2 fronts. Obviously, the reason we like the airplane is just because of the cubic capacity associated with it. It's essentially equivalent to a 757, give or take a percentage or 2% of cubic capacity but at significantly lower operating costs. And when you look at the potential marketplace out there, if you just say, \"Well, okay, let's assume for a moment there's not any growth that would require those assets.\" Just look at the number of 757 freighters that are in the marketplace today between FedEx, UPS, DHL and a couple of others, I mean, you're talking about well over 200 aircraft of 757 type that these would be replacements for. So anything that you would get from a pure growth standpoint would be additive to that, so we see it as a very strong market. It's not dissimilar to when we jumped into the 767 way back in the late '90s as an ideal candidate for the express market, and now that same thing applies, that same process -- idea applies to the 321 for the e-commerce and express markets.\nDavid Ross: And then, Quint, on the CapEx side, how much would you consider the CapEx to be replacement CapEx, not typical maintenance CapEx and not growth CapEx, but any planes that are maybe coming out of service and you replace them with a new plane for a long-term contract? Or is that minimal right now?\nQuint Turner: Yes. It's fairly minimal. I mean there could be as many as a couple airplanes that we elect. And keep in mind, Dave, when we take an aircraft out, and we've really only taken, I think, the one 767-200 freighter out so far, it's an elective thing. I mean we do it based upon the opportunities that are in front of us, so there's nothing that requires us to put the airplane out of service. But it may be that the demand for the larger 300 causes us to say, hey, it's a better investment rather than maybe do some maintenance on the 200 to go ahead and take it out of service, cannibalize engines and other parts and then invest in the 300s, which, of course, carry with them a higher EBITDA production, higher lease rates. So it's not even replacement. It's not a one-for-one because you're getting an asset back that has a higher cash-generating potential.\nDavid Ross: And then when you look at the 2020, is there any need to replace much of the fleet? Or is it still humming along, and all that CapEx is pretty much going to be for growth?\nQuint Turner: Again, it's elective. But I would say over the next couple of years, you may see 2 or 3 200s that we elect to, as I've said, invest in a higher-production 300 asset and bring them down. But that would -- that's just sort of a guesstimate, but that would be, I guess, a placeholder.\nOperator: From Cowen & Company, we have Helane Becker.\nConor Cunningham: It's actually Conor Cunningham on for Helane. Appreciate the comments on the trade dispute. Your results and guidance certainly suggest that you're insulated from all the issues there, but I just wanted to come at it from a different angle. Maybe you can talk about what surprised you as a result of the trade dispute. It actually seems like you might be benefiting from shifting trade flows. Just interested on your thoughts there.\nQuint Turner: We really haven't seen -- I guess it's really hard to tell what benefit we're seeing from it because the type of flying that we do is network flying. And so if there's more packages in the plane, the planes get higher utilization as a result and the routes that we're flying. We haven't been asked on the -- we have very few charter resources available, and they tend to be not available over consistent periods because of the way we fly. So haven't seen much. I have heard anecdotally just things that come into the charter desk, where tariffs and things that have popped up in the U.S., so on seafood and some other things, have resulted in Canadian routes picking up more volume going to China and to other parts of the world. So there are some things that are changing a little bit, but it doesn't really come into play with our business.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then just on the 10 aircraft next year. So as you said already, 5 of them which are currently or likely spoken for. I think in the past, you've talked about like 12 to 14 being able to induct by 12 to 14 aircraft annually depending on conversion slots. Can you just see what -- can you just speak to like what your customers might need to see to be closer towards like the 14, 15 range next year in the market?\nQuint Turner: Yes. So the five are not lightly committed. They're under agreement, so those are under agreement for deployment for next year. And when we talked about the 12 to 14, we were talking about the feedstock we have and the potential slots that we could get to allow us to deliver that many aircraft. A question we got last quarter was how many -- what's the most you could deliver in 2020, and that's the answer that we've provided. We believe, based on the pipeline and the customers that we're talking to, we'll have no problem deploying the additional 5. And as we said, we believe there's an upside there, a potential depending on what the market looks like. So we're -- again we're -- we look at the demands being very strong. To be halfway through 2019 and have half of our 2020 fleet already deployed, I think is a good statement of where the market sits right now.\nConor Cunningham: Yes. Okay. And then I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you're talking to new customers in the Far East. I'm just curious on maybe you can revive some makeup of what they are. Are they traditional express companies? Or are you seeing more demand on the e-commerce -- from the e-commerce players?\nQuint Turner: Good question. They happen to be -- a couple of them fly express networks, and a couple of them fly for other companies that have express networks. So it's the same type of flying that we do, but it's in geographies that -- where we don't have operating authority but where our assets represent a good economic platform through which to leverage the deliveries. The -- you look at companies like DHL, DHL has a large contracted base around the globe, and they have a lot of different operators that fly for them. So we currently lease to one in Malaysia that flies for DHL, and they're also looking at a growth profile as well. That's Raya Airways in Malaysia.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Do you actually think that there's -- what's the probability that you think that they move forward on these contracts? Do you think is it more favorable than not or -- just curious.\nJoe Hete: Well, like I said, very favorable on deploying our assets. Where we deploy those will be where we can get the best return on the asset, so -- and it's great to have choices in terms of customers.\nOperator: From Susquehanna, we have Chris Stathoulopoulos.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Just wondering if you could give us any additional color on the MAX grounding and the opportunity that Rich mentioned in his prepared remarks?\nRich Corrado: Well, I think everybody pretty much knows the airlines that are impacted by the MAX grounding. It's a matter of what we have in the way of available capacity through Omni with their -- seeing as they've focused on the passenger market. We did, as we noted in our remarks, take one of the American aircraft and delivered to Omni as a growth asset, so they can employ in that kind of replacement lift. But right now, of course, nobody's going to commit to anything that's a real long term. Generally, you're talking about 3- to 6-month contracts to replace their grounded 737s.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And in your release, you talked about not having or you suggest that you don't have a lot of exposure to payload-sensitive business models, which I look at as charter, but I don't think you've ever really sized up what your exposure might be to the charter market or shorter-term leases.\nRich Corrado: We don't do much charter because we don't have consistent assets available. If we do charter, it's a one-off, fly from here to Cambodia with -- and then try to get a load coming back, not a 2- or 3-month assignment or we don't put up airplanes on a scheduled basis. We don't sell block space. When we have extra aircraft, in fact, we usually stage it as a spare in one of our express network to enhance service. And usually, those aircraft get used by the companies that we're staging them for, and we get additional revenue on the aircraft that way. We think that's a much better deployment of that asset in terms of supporting our larger customers such as DHL and Amazon and getting incremental revenue in that way versus having us in the commercial charter market.\nJoe Hete: Yes. Chris, if you look at it from a pure ACMI perspective, we have 4 757s that we fly on an ACMI basis with DHL. We have one that's with another customer on the West Coast, and then we have a couple that are tied into the military. Outside of that, everything else is either a part of the dry lease with the CMI or just a pure dry lease, so our exposure is virtually 0.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then last one. If you could you give us an update on labor talks with ABX Air and if you're seeing any signs of labor disruption similar to what a competitor recently pointed out.\nJoe Hete: As a credit to the guys at ABX, even though we're going through a protracted negotiating period, they continue to move the aircraft. We're not seeing any kind of game playing or increase in sick calls, fatigue calls, mechanical issues, anything of that nature. They're doing what they've always done, which is move the aircraft on time. And for all intents and purposes, they are the best in class out of our airlines in terms of the cargo sector. Right now, we're scheduled to go back in mediation in September. Hopefully, we'll continue to make some progress. We did a little bit the last time around. Sides have been working back and forth and exchanging ideas. So hopefully, we'll see some progress on that front. And of course, as you know, we have both ATI and Omni which already have collective bargaining agreements in place.\nOperator: From Seaport Global, we have Kevin Sterling.\nKevin Sterling: Congrats on a really nice quarter. And I'm going to apologize up-front because -- just because I always have phone issues. So if I ask a question that you've already been answered, please just tell me. As we think about -- and, Quint, this is probably for you. As I think about your EBITDA guidance for 2019, it implies roughly, call it, $230 million, $232 million of EBITDA for the back half of this year. And it sounds like Q4 is going to be stronger than Q3 because of heavier second-half flight schedules. But for modeling purposes, Quint, how should we think about that breakdown? I'm not looking for specific dollar figures. But is 60% of that EBITDA in Q4 and 40% in Q3 or 55%, 45%? Can you help us just for modeling purposes, just to make sure we're on the same page?\nQuint Turner: Yes, Kevin. Thanks for the question. I think if you look at Q3, and keep in mind we've got -- as we've said, our asset additions are coming skewed towards the later half, and of course fourth quarter always has some peak for cargo in it, I would think about Q3 as -- if you look at our Q1, which was a strong quarter, and I think we did -- went a little over $113 in adjusted EBITDA. Now we have said that we expect some continued ramp-up costs in the third quarter, right? And I think we've estimated around $4 million. So if you think of that first quarter and then later on, had it had those ramp-up costs, you're just a bit below the $110 million level. That's kind of where we see third quarter. I mean -- and of course, fourth quarter is -- makes up the difference, and you can sort of see what the relationship is. You're right. We have quite about $230 million or so in the back half.\nKevin Sterling: Okay. That's very, very helpful. And with your military flying with Omni, while down sequentially, I assume it looks like it was in line with your expectations. How should we think about military flying for Q3 and Q4? Do you have some visibility there?\nQuint Turner: Well, if you look at Omni, Q3, hopefully, would be a little bit stronger than what the second quarter wasn't, but Q4 is their light quarter. So when you think about how their business model works, on the cargo side, Q4 is always a peak. From a military standpoint, it's probably their lowest quarter of the year. But if you look at it sequentially from our military business, we were down about 700 hours from the first quarter, so we're down about 9%. If you look at it on a year-over-year basis, second quarter last year to second quarter this year, we were actually in total, not just Omni, but also counting the cargo side, we were up about 4% on total military flying. Now there is some mix issues in there depending upon on the pax side of the equation as to whether you're flying with Omni a 777 or 767, but the numbers still are pretty strong year-over-year.\nKevin Sterling: Got you. And last question here. Joe, assuming you get the FAA certification for the Airbus A321 converted to freighter in mid-2020, when do you think we could see that aircraft possibly in your fleet? Is 2021 realistic? And are you beginning to get some customer indications or some interest from customers for this type of aircraft in 2020?\nJoe Hete: Yes. I think in terms of being in our fleet, Kevin, it would probably be 2021 would be the earliest in terms of the aircraft actually being available for operating purposes. But I think if you look in terms of any significant contribution, it would probably be out in the 2022 time frame. From a customer perspective, yes, I mean, the folks at Precision that are doing the marketing side of the equation are talking to a lot of people out there. There's a lot of interest in the aircraft. They said it's got ideal characteristics for the market where it is today with the lack of density, call it, in the e-commerce segment. And of course, the operating costs compared with 757 are significantly less. So it's -- I think it's -- we're going to be well positioned with that aircraft type. The alternative to it would be a 737-800, but that 737-800 is about 25% less cubes than the 321. So if you're looking at something that replaces an existing 737-400, for example, the 321 is ideal from a growth standpoint as well as replacement for the 757. So we're pretty excited about it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And from VA, we have Howard Rosencrans.\nHoward Rosencrans: I don't want to get too lost in minutiae. I just want to make sure -- although I'm certainly baffled by the stock before and after, so maybe I'm missing something. You made some sort of comment about -- I just want -- the Amazon in terms of moving back and moving forward fleet deliveries, and you mentioned something, I believe, about Amazon doing some insourcing and then -- which I guess I had some minutiae negative, and then you were going to add some logistics for them. So maybe just a touch more color to the extent you can provide on those items.\nRich Corrado: Sure, Howard. On the moving forward and back, it's -- recall that the commitment from Amazon was 10 airplanes, and the -- and your initial thought structure of that was for five to be delivered in 2019 and 5 to be delivered in 2020. What's changed on that is we'll be delivering 6 in 2019 and 4 in 2020. So that's the -- how the aircraft are flying. Still 10 airplanes, but they moved 1 forward due to their volume needs.On the gateway logistics side, we had agreements -- still have agreements till the end of the month to handle 8 of Amazon's gateways, but we do that on a contracted basis. So we manage the process, but we hire independent contractors actually do the loading and unloading, and we do it on a cost-plus basis. And so those 8 locations are going to be insourced by Amazon, and we're losing that business. Now it's a very small margin, so it's not a significant amount of business that we're losing. That's being replaced by -- you won't see any impact because -- in the numbers because it's being replaced by other business that will roughly be about the same.And that business is here and -- some of it's here in Wilmington where we're doing some of the ground service equipment. We're doing the maintenance on that. We're doing the deice for them in the winter, and we're doing the material handling equipment maintenance for the large sort building that they have operating right now. In addition to that, we opened a new gateway that we're handling directly in other to hiring our own employees to do the sortation, the loading and unloading and loading of the airplane. And those two business segments of growth will offset the loss of the gateway business that they're in-sourcing.\nHoward Rosencrans: The fact that you're moving the Amazon to 6 and 4, so you're taking one more this year and one less next year, does that increase the associated start-up costs? So you mentioned that you absorbed 3 in Q3 and will absorb 4 in -- excuse me, 3 in Q2 and will absorb 4 in Q3. Is that heightened by the move-up, the pull forward of one aircraft for Amazon?\nRich Corrado: Yes. So the aircraft we already had in our plan to convert and deploy, it happened to go to Amazon because of their business need. But what's increasing our costs versus our original plan was the need to crew that aircraft, and so we had to hire a complement of pilots for it, also a little bit of increased maintenance costs. And with the costs that we're talking about when we say we're ramping up, it's training costs for crews that is significant, but we don't get any revenue -- those crews aren't generating revenue until they're fully trained and in the aircraft. And so that's why when Quint had noted that sequentially in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, our ACMI operations will show improved results as a result of those crews that are currently in training, actually getting out and flying aircraft and generating revenue.\nHoward Rosencrans: Okay. Apologize if I'm missing your answers. So the fact that you're adding -- the fact that you're pulling forward one of the aircraft for Amazon, is that having a short-term negative impact on be it, let's say, Q3 in particular? Just to get -- so that maybe you get more positive benefit in '20 since you'll have less? That's my question.\nRich Corrado: Yes, yes. So that we'll have increased crew training cost in Q3 to deploy for that additional aircraft that we're adding in Q4...\nHoward Rosencrans: Okay. So that will decrease in '20 be your prior expectations, yes, sir?\nRich Corrado: Correct, on the crew training front and ramp-up costs.\nJoe Hete: But will increase the revenue because the aircraft will be out there in Amazon's network flying for the whole year. Whereas right, now we anticipate that the 2020 aircraft would be backloaded similar to what 2019 was. So we'll actually have one airplane flying for them a lot sooner.\nHoward Rosencrans: Okay. And you mentioned -- you sort of hopped over maintenance as it's no longer material. You're not going to break it out, et cetera. You didn't provide as much commentary in that regard, but I thought that -- obviously, you're a much bigger company now, but I thought that the maintenance -- thought that, that maintenance business had some pretty compelling prospects to grow nicely, particularly since you were looking into getting the -- into doing Airbus, et cetera. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts are. If we go out a little further, do you get accreditation for Airbus? I'm just curious, your old MRO division, do you -- is that going to be -- can that generate some, I don't know, $5 million, $10 million or something in -- I think, at one point, I envisioned it was going to be a $15 million, $20 million EBITDA contributor maybe a few years out. So could you give us any sense since it's no longer a broken-out segment?\nJoe Hete: Howard, in terms of the MRO side, I mean, there's 2 primary pieces to it. One is the heavy maintenance side, which requires the hangars, et cetera, then there's the line maintenance piece. Most of the line maintenance is focused on the internal airlines, the affiliates, but you're always limited in terms of the heavy maintenance side of the equation by your hangar capacity per se. So when you think about growth, if you're operating at max capacity within the square footage that you have available to you, it's going to level off, and your growth is going to be more born of what efficiencies you can bring to the table and what rate increases you can get out of your customer. So we would not consider the MRO side to be a high-growth part of our business, like the leasing side is, obviously. But it's a good stable portion, and it always serves as a nice additive to our CAM leasing business because it does give us the flexibility to move aircraft around more effectively, even if we had to wait for a third party to perform heavy maintenance checks, et cetera, as we transition aircraft back and forth. So it's one of those things that's kind of a needs of the business for us at this point in time. We'll still continue to generate, as you said earlier, $5 million to $10 million worth of bottom line benefit, but going to $15 million or $20 million is probably not in the cards, unless we go out and build some more hangar space.\nHoward Rosencrans: Well, I guess I meant through external, and I get a little confused between internal and external. I thought, if assuming you get all your Airbus certifications, I thought there was a bigger opportunity on an external basis, but maybe you're saying your space limited them. I apologize for my confusion.\nJoe Hete: Yes. That's one of the reasons we're assessing it, Howard, to see what makes the most sense for the utilization of the space that we have. So stay tuned.\nHoward Rosencrans: Okay. Any thoughts on whether you'll reallocate capital or go for a slight -- you're less than 3.5x, and you're going to drop down further next year, particularly with lower CapEx next year. What are the prospects you'll assess to be returning some capital to shareholders through buying back stock? I think you've done some of that in the past. I'm just wondering what your perspective is on it this time. Maybe you could remind us as to sort of the prices you paid when you were buying in some of the -- sort of the issued Amazon stock, which you're now again issuing more of in the new deal.\nQuint Turner: Yes. Howard, it's Quint. As you've mentioned we've done stock buybacks in the past, and then we did a large buyback, I think it was in 2016, from -- at the time, our largest shareholder. And I think it was, what, $13, $13.07 or so that we bought about 3.8 million shares, if I recall. And we have that, as we've said, as a way to create value for our shareholders. We've been in the growth cycle, and Rich has described what our opportunities are. But to the extent that there's any slowing of growth or at least a reduction in CapEx, that creates more opportunity to look at, we believe, that as an accretive way to get value to our shareholders. So you're right. It will be an option that becomes a greater option for us, assuming that CapEx needs decline.\nOperator: And from Susquehanna, we have a follow-up from Chris Stathoulopoulos.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: I was wondering if you could just remind us of the mechanics around the military business. I believe the business goes on the government's fiscal calendar, which is October through September or thereabouts and whether -- also get some color what you're seeing around passenger flying for the military, where your competitor also recently announced that things were a little bit slower than expected.\nJoe Hete: Yes, Chris. You're correct that the government fiscal year is October 1 through September 30. When you look at the military flying, as I said, with Omni, a lot of it is determined by whether you're flying a 767 or, in our case, a 777, which obviously generates more revenue than the smaller 76. And in Atlas' case, it's a 747 versus a 767. And I think what Atlas ended up seeing was a decline in the 747 biz, even though the hours might be the same if you replace 747 hours with a 76, there's going to be a revenue decline. If you look at hours, and we don't give a breakdown per se, but as I mentioned earlier, if you look on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, we were down about 1.5% on total pax up and block hours with Omni.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And final question. Could you give us any color around how we should think about headcount growth for this year? I think, last year or December, you finished just a hair under 4,000. Is this kind of mid- to upper single-digit growth the right way to think about it?\nJoe Hete: When you look at it from a growth standpoint, Chris, the -- obviously, as Rich mentioned earlier, we've got the Charlotte hub that we start up for Charlotte gateway for Amazon. It's not a large facility per se, so it's not going to be a big numbers driver. Where we're really seeing the growth is on the airline side. And as we put in our opening remarks, we've hired over 70 flight crews year-to-date just at ATI in order to be able to meet the Amazon schedule requirements for the latter part of the year. So you're not talking big numbers, unless we're in a position to open up additional gateways, et cetera, but I would see growth from a people standpoint, 150 to 200 people max.\nOperator: And no further questions at this time. We'll now turn it back to Mr. Hete for closing remarks.\nJoe Hete: Thank you, Brandon. Most of our colleagues in the air cargo industry are focused on what's happening in China and other markets affected by tariffs and economic uncertainty. That's not the case with us. The vast majority of our business is with customers that need what we provide, regardless of how the trade winds blow and whether the economy grows. We hope you appreciate the cash flow visibility our model provides and how it can carry our shareholder value higher in the years ahead. Thanks for joining us today, and have a quality day.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 1, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-05-08 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Q1 2019 Air Transport Services Group, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is John and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note the conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Joe Hete, President and CEO. Mr. Hete you may begin.\nJoe Hete: Thank you, John. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me today are Quint Turner, our Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Corrado, our Chief Operating Officer. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website atsginc.com. We'll file our Form 10-Q later this week. I'm very pleased to report that 2019 has begun on a fast pace. The highlights are that revenues were up 71% and our adjusted EPS increased $0.07 to $0.37 per share and adjusted EBITDA rose 58% to $114 million. Our airline operations has started particularly strong. Our services for the Department of Defense increased sharply versus the prior year with the added contributions from Omni Air International, the passenger airline we acquired last November. We ended March with 10 more converted freighter aircraft in service than we had a year ago for a total fleet of 91. Based upon our strong start in the first quarter and a projection of heavier aircraft flying requirements recently provided by our customers for the rest of this year, we are increasing our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook to $450 million. Our expectations for leased 767 aircraft deployments for the rest of 2019 remain substantially as we told you in February. We anticipate placing at least nine aircraft in service this year with all but two of those coming during the second half. Additionally, we currently have customer commitments for six more leases in 2020. Quint is ready to review our consolidated results, Rich will cover our segment highlights, and I'll close with more comments on our outlook. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks Joe and thanks to all of you on the call for joining us this morning. As always, I'll start by saying that during the course of this call, we will make projections or other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans, and estimates as of the date of this call and Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information, or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in market demand for our assets and services; our operating airline's ability to maintain on-time service and control costs; the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration; fluctuations in ATSG's traded share price which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments; the number of timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers; and other factors as contained from time-to-time in our filings with the SEC including the Form 10-Q we will file this week. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings, and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials and we advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures which are included in our earnings release and on our website. As Joe said our first quarter results were very strong and our adjusted earnings rose sharply thanks to the contributions from the 10 additional freighters and 11 additional passenger aircraft we've added to CAM's leasing portfolio since last year. We also benefited from increased airline flight operations, primarily to support the Department of Defense. On a consolidated basis, first quarter revenues were $348 million, up $145 million or 71% from the prior year. That gain stems primarily from the expansion of our Airline business through our acquisition of Omni Air. As a result, the Department of Defense is now ATSG's largest customer, representing 37% of our revenues for the first quarter. 18% of revenues came from Amazon and 15% from DHL. On a GAAP basis, we have first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $23 million versus $16 million a year ago. On a diluted basis, GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.25, $0.01 less than we earned a year ago. Operating expenses increased $126 million or 72% with significant Omni-related increases in fuel, depreciation and amortization, and salaries and wages. Topic 606 under which fuel and other direct aircraft operating expenses reimbursed by our commercial customers are now netted against revenues does not apply to operations for Omni's military and other government customers. Interest expense increased $12 million to $17 million, reflecting increased borrowings to fund our Omni acquisition and continued aircraft fleet investments as well as higher rates on net debt. As we have noted previously, our operating progress continues to be clouded by several mostly non-cash items in our GAAP earnings. This quarter those items included quarterly unrealized losses in our warrant and interest rate derivative liabilities along with significant cost increases in the non-service-related portion of our retiree benefits. On a net basis these items reduced our reported GAAP EPS by $0.12 per share versus the $0.04 reduction in the first quarter last year. Our adjusted earnings EPS and adjusted EBITDA exclude those items. As a result, our adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.37 versus $0.30 a year ago. On the same basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased from $72 million to $114 million or 58% for the quarter. We spent $92 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter including $71 million for purchases of four 767 feedstock aircraft and modification cost for other in-process aircraft. We spent $10 million for required capitalized heavy maintenance and $11 million for aircraft engines and other equipment. We now expect a 2019 CapEx spend of about $475 million mostly to acquire and modify more 767s for deployment through next year. Joe will share more about our fleet development progress and our growing confidence in customer demand for CAM's assets. That's the top-level summary of our financial results for the quarter. Rich is ready to share some segment highlights and our market perspective. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint and good morning, everybody. Just as it was in 2018, the principal factor in our earnings gain this year is the improvement in our airlines. ACMI Services on a pre-tax basis earned $12 million in the first quarter up $9 million from a year ago. The three airlines operated 63 aircraft including those we leased to customers and operate on a CMI basis, 11 more than last year. Increased support for the Department of Defense via Omni and our other airlines drove the bulk of that gain. Also, our expenses associated with scheduled airframe inspections were lower than the prior year. Offsetting factors included a $6 million increase in allotted interest expense from debt used to fund the Omni acquisition, higher wages and salaries for pilots of ATI under a contract amendment that took effect in the second quarter a year ago and $3 million increase in unanticipated engine maintenance expense during the first quarter. CAM, our leasing business also had a good quarter with pretax earnings of $16 million, up from $15 million a year ago. Additional earnings from a larger leased fleet were offset by a $9.9 million increase in depreciation and an increase of $5.4 million in interest expense, primarily related to the growing lease fleet, including the 11 leased to Omni since last November. CAM deployed one more freighter aircraft during the first quarter, which will operate in ACMI Service with ATI and be leased to Amazon later in the year. Four additional feedstock 767s were purchased for conversion and deployment, leaving eight either in mod or waiting for an available conversion slot at the end of March. Results of our maintenance and conversion business previously reported via the MRO Services segment are once again reported in other activities as our consolidated revenue growth, means they are no longer large enough to qualify as a separate segment. Pretax earnings for other activities, net of intercompany transactions fell from $4 million in the first quarter last year to $2 million this year. Sort-center management services for the U.S. Postal Service ended last September and we had a loss from our minority investment in our European airplane affiliate, West Atlantic. From an operating standpoint, the ATSG businesses performed well during the winter months, avoiding significant weather-related downtime over most of the express network routes we cover. On-time performance was very good for our largest customers owing in no small part to investments in continuous improvement programs by our airlines to ensure the reliability of our aircraft. Excellent service reliability has long been a differentiator of our airlines, which they remain proud to offer their customers. The integration of Omni Air into ATSG is proceeding smoothly, thanks in part to great cooperation among management and our shared experience with Omni as part of the Patriot team of outsourced carriers serving the military. As you know, our take on the state of the air cargo market is far more bullish than others who fear that fuel cost or continued trade disputes will cramp their near-term margins. Our markets, both commercial and government have much more visibility. And customers we talk to, are more -- are worried more about having too little capacity than too much. We want to be their reliable source of midsize aircraft capacity for many years to come and offer them the packages of services they need when they need them. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Rich. I want to echo Rich's remarks about the smooth transition of Omni into ATSG, which had required a great deal of work from management teams here in Wilmington and at Omni's headquarters in Tulsa. Jeff Crippen leads a very talented group of airline executives who have produced great results since the acquisition last November and so far on a very good pace for 2019. In fact, all our business units are performing well thus far and from an operating standpoint are mostly on track or ahead of our projections for the year. We just completed renewal agreements with DHL for three-year extensions of leases for most of the 767s we lease to them. The lease extensions were for 11 of the 14 aircraft. The three others are already in service under longer leases with more than three years to run. DHL is keeping six of the 14 in the Middle East operated by one of its airline affiliates there. The other eight remain in DHL's U.S. network operated by ABX Air. We're pleased to extend what is now a 15-year relationship with DHL that dates to ATSG's formation as a public company back when DHL acquired Airborne in 2003. Quint mentioned that we have raised our CapEx guidance for 2019 to $475 million, which is a significant step up from the $293 million we spent last year. A portion of that is for increased capitalized maintenance cost for 11 Omni aircraft we own, but most of the rest is for more 767 feedstock and mod costs. Last December's deal with Jetran for 20 American tails was a great opportunity to secure the capacity our customers are telling us they need as they gear up their networks for even greater speed. The Jetran arrangement limits the number and timing of tails we can expect from American each year. That's why we have increased by four the number of 767 feedstock aircraft we will acquire this year since we last spoke to you in February. As we mentioned before, Omni has expanded our horizon for the ages of aircraft we can consider since we now have the option to keep them in Omni's fleet as a passenger aircraft for a few years prior to conversion. In fact, we do intend for one of the passenger 767s we're acquiring this year to be deployed with Omni. As I said at the outset, we could very likely place more than 10 converted 767s this year, if we could get them and we're already booking orders for 2020 beyond the five that Amazon wants. In short, the investments we're making today are based on confidence about our prospects throughout -- through next year. Our JV partner Precision continues to make progress toward an STC for its freighter variant of the Airbus A321. We expect that approval next year and anticipate investing $12 million more this year into the venture to make that happen. CAM will be alert for opportunities to add A321 to its leasing portfolio as those feedstock aircraft become available next year and beyond. We now have customer commitments for at least nine 767 freighters this year including the five we will lease and operate for Amazon and at least four others for United Parcel Service, a new dry leasing customer for us. Under ideal circumstances, we could exceed that target by year-end, but the pacing factor remains how quickly our conversion contractor can complete freighter modifications. Production is running slightly behind schedule on what was already a very busy second half deployment calendar. In addition to deploying the converted aircraft our customers demand, we also need to recruit and train pilots to fly them, which means a few months of carrying those additional cost prior to the start of flight operations. Recently our customers updated their flight schedules for the balance of the year, which will require increases in our flight operations starting late in the second quarter. This is certainly positive news overall, but it will raise the $1.5 million in ramp-up costs we anticipated when we spoke to you in February to about $7 million much of which we expect to occur in the second quarter. Given these considerations and factoring in our strong start to the year, we're increasing our 2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $450 million for the year. We anticipate slightly more than half of that full year number to occur during the second half. As those of you who have followed us for years know, we emphasize the cash-generating power of our business model, especially given that we are not currently a cash tax payer. We deploy our attractive assets on long-term -- long-duration contracts with a blue-chip customer base. We always have an array of options to deploy capital to maximize shareholder value. These include, Investing in growth assets, where we target a greater than 10% unlevered return on our investment, paying down debt, which currently costs us a bit below 5% or returning capital to shareholders. Growth investments are the logical choice today, with the market now providing us with attractive opportunities. But our three options are not mutually exclusive. We have built a business that can thrive and generate shareholder value in any phase of the economic cycle. We look forward to updating our projections again, when we speak to you in August. We hope that our already optimistic view about 2019 will be even stronger then. That concludes our prepared remarks, John. We're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Jack Atkins from Stephens.\nAndrew Hall: Hey, guys. It's actually Andrew on for Jack. Congrats on a good first quarter, strong start of the year.\nJoe Hete: Hey! Thanks Andrew.\nQuint Turner: Thanks.\nAndrew Hall: I guess I'd start off, I think it was mentioned a couple of times in the prepared comments about the Omni integration everything seems to be going well. I guess if you look at the performance of Omni during their first quarter, how did that perform relative to your initial expectations? And I guess, as you look at the full year, has there been any change in the expected contribution from Omni this year? I think especially Joe, as you mentioned, there's going to be I think one 767 passenger plane going to be added to the -- added to their fleet?\nJoe Hete: Yeah, Andrew, the Omni actually performed better in the first quarter than what we had anticipated. Demand from the U.S. Military was strong. In fact, we think on the large passenger portion of the business for the military. Omni flew about 49% of the total long-range passenger business. And if we look at April, it looks like they will be about 50% of that total. So, starting off the year apparently strong for Omni much better than what we anticipated. Now that can change obviously as the year goes on, but right now we're pretty optimistic about how they will perform through the balance of the year. We did elect to take one of the American birds rather than convert it into a freighter. Because we had another aircraft, we acquired that we wanted to put into that slot. And the commercial demand is pretty strong as well. Part of it may be short-lived because of the 737 MAX issues. We're getting requests for additional lift from multiple carriers. How long that will go on? We don't know. But we expect as we transition into the latter part of the year, that the demand will still be there from a commercial perspective. So, in short, we're extremely pleased with the acquisition.\nAndrew Hall: Good deal. And I guess Rich one for you. I think you guys -- you mentioned the four planes that you bought that were in excess of the ones you're getting from American. I'm assuming those planes are going to be put in service -- or expected to go into service in 2020. I guess if you could just provide a little color. Are those due to existing customers coming back to you guys, indicating that they perhaps, need more capacity for next year? Are those new customers coming to you? Just kind of -- just some sense on where that demand coming from?\nRich Corrado: Yeah. So, the demand from our newer customers required a specific variant of the 767 that we didn't have in the American feedstock. So we needed to go out and procure some additional aircraft that were specific to their needs.\nAndrew Hall: Okay. And you said that's for a newer customer?\nRich Corrado: Yes.\nAndrew Hall: Okay. Perfect. And I guess, Joe, I don't know, if this is for you or for Rich. As you guys -- you have six planes already under contract for next year. You have demand across the board that seems elevated. If this demand holds and remains strong into next year, I know it would depends on conversion capabilities, but what's the maximum number of planes that you could place into service next year if kind of all the dominoes fell in your favor?\nRich Corrado: Yes, Andrew, so we got a late start this year and we're going to deliver between 9 and probably 11, hopefully 10 aircraft this year. And we got a late start. Rolling into 2020, we'll have a number of aircraft already in conversion. So we feel we could deliver between 12 and 14 next year, depending on how the conversion lines work. There's a lot that goes into converting an aircraft in terms of when we take delivery of feedstock, there's a schedule that we got generally when we acquire airplanes in advance. But sometimes, for example, as the 737 MAX situation has developed and other situations, even though we have rights to aircraft the airlines may hang on to them a little bit longer. So that can disrupt and delay the flow. That's one of the reasons we got kind of a late start this year, as we got a late jump on some feedstock. So we think we can deliver, like I said, a lot of planes next year up to 10 this year. And the conversion line right now is running full speed for ATSG.\nAndrew Hall: Okay. Good to hear. And then squeeze one last one in for Quint. I think in the last call you mentioned that given the delivery schedule EBITDA growth would be weighted to the back half. I think you said maybe 45-55 split between first half and second half. Given the first quarter performance, is that still the expectation? And then as you look at 2020, the start-up expenses that are coming this year for Amazon, should we expect a similar level of those in 2020? Are those going to kind of fade off?\nQuint Turner: Yes. I think that your first question on the weighting of the EBITDA, I would -- if I were going to modify, I would probably say it's more like call it 48-52 in terms of the percentages between first half and back half, Andrew. As far as the ramp-up cost, of course, depending -- again next year the Amazon demand is back-half weighted so we will again have some ramp-up cost. I think we had -- as Joe mentioned in his remarks earlier, previously estimated about $1.5 million. So you could probably figure in something along those lines again next year. We escalated our ramp-up costs for this year to more like $7 million. And that was tied not just to the additional five aircraft but to sort of some heavier flying that we're forecasting for the second half. So absent that, you could probably figure for five airplanes next year, something akin to $1.5 million of ramp-up cost in 2020.\nAndrew Hall: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Congrats on a good quarter.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Andrew.\nQuint Turner: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve O'Hara from Sidoti & Company.\nSteve O'Hara: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just on the guidance that you guys previously gave for interest cost and depreciation. Are those pretty much still in line with your forecast for the full year 2019?\nQuint Turner: Yes. I'd say interest cost maybe perhaps a little over than we guided to last time. But we're -- and depreciation, it's pretty much in line with what we gave you Steve.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. And then just on the passenger flying with Omni. Is that going to an existing customer, so DoD flying, or is that going to a new customer? And then I'm just wondering if you could maybe comment on any opportunities out there for expanding the 777 flying within Omni?\nJoe Hete: Steve as far as the commercial side or the 767 Pax side with Omni, there's no one specific customer that, that additional aircraft would be tied to, it will be -- can be used for both DoD as well as any commercial customer. So there's not one specific, it's just that they're getting sufficient demand out there that it makes good sense for us to hand over one of those aircraft to them to generate additional revenue. As far as the 777 goes, certainly we would like to see them transition into the 777 freighter business. In today's market that would be most likely on a CMI basis. Not that we would go out and acquire an additional 777 Pax or a 777 freighter. But there is some interest in utilization of their services by other folks that have 777s. And then in the longer term you look at converted 777s which are probably at least two or three years away at best at that point in time that would certainly be an asset we would look at as oppose to trying to go after factory-built new ones.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. And then just lastly on the start-up costs, I think you said previously $1.5 million now it's $7 million I think. It seems a pretty big jump. Is that partially due to the fact that you're taking another passenger aircraft? Or maybe reallocating at the passenger you need maybe crews or something more crews because of the rest requirements? I'm just wondering what the big jump is from $1.5 million to $7 million?\nRich Corrado: Yes Steve. A couple of things are involved in that. But first is we were looking to transition some crews off an ACMI route that we've been flying for a couple -- actually an A plus CMI route we've been flying for a customer over the past year. But they decided to keep the airplane flying with us and so there was a number of crews that were to transition over to the additional flying that we're going to do with Amazon. So we had to fill some spots that we thought we would have crews to fill. And then additionally to that our existing customers are just projecting significantly more flying than they had projected at the end of last year. So it's -- we had planned initially for the increase in the aircraft they were adding into the Amazon network but due to the increased flying and due to the fact that some of the flying we stopped was going to -- we thought was going to stop that's where the larger ramp-up is coming from.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning guys. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on what you're seeing for military flying with the DoD last year. And the sort of the context I'm thinking about is competitor Atlas last week saw weaker-than-expected flying in the first quarter, where I think some cargo flying was unexpectedly sort of taken off the schedule, but expected to reset over the remainder of the year?\nJoe Hete: Yes Chris from the cargo standpoint, of course we don't fly the large aircraft which is what Atlas flies with the 747s. There's really only -- from a cargo perspective for the aircraft types we fly, the 767 there's really only three runs all of which we operate with our airlines. One is down to Guant\u00e1namo Bay and back. Another one is over to Ramstein and then on to Cairo and back. And that last one runs into the Pacific. So the utilization in the -- by the military has been consistent on those routes. But again, they're scheduled and we don't have any volatility related to the cargo side. And on the pass side, it's a different story. As I mentioned previously, we ran about 49% of the total large passenger business for the military in the first quarter. And right now it looks like about 50% for the April time frame. So if there was weakness, it was in the heavy-lift side of the cargo business, but certainly didn't impact us.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then, moving to the rhetoric around the trade war and tariffs heating up again. Could you just remind us of how you're thinking about, what's at risk here, given what the change in your revenue base here with the DoD, now more than -- was it close to 37% of revenue; and then you have the e-commerce, DHL and Amazon? Regionally, if you're thinking about perhaps what's at risk? Or from an end market, how you size up risk? Thanks.\nQuint Turner: Yeah, Chris, this is Quint. I think, you mentioned a couple of things that we've been emphasizing, certainly, with the acquisition from Omni, but talked about even before that. Our particular book of business, we don't believe, is very exposed to sort of disruption that can occur due to trade negotiations or that. And it's because -- precisely because our assets are deployed almost entirely within these time-definite regional integrator networks. And so -- and, of course, we deploy our aircraft on long-term leases, which give us that visibility, long-term visibility of our cash flows. Then when we acquired Omni, it only enhanced sort of the immunization we have against the -- sort of the economic cycles that occur in the cargo business and the broad economy. As you say, the government demand and the public sector is a completely different market. And Joe mentioned, we and Omni -- through Omni hold -- and our own combi flying, a pretty dominant stake in that market, which isn't tied to the economic cycles.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. So given that, if we could extend that argument just for a bit here. So we have a piece of EBITDA revenue here that's seemingly immune from fluctuations in this cycle; and e-commerce piece like a customer, Amazon, that's perhaps outside of that too, given where they are in their cycle. But how then should we think about your free cash flow profile going forward, again, with the DoD close to 40% of your revenue? Is there -- could we see a situation where -- in the past, where you've gone into acquisition mode and picked up aircraft, you've gone free cash flow negative. But could we see, given the sustainability of cash flows here with the change in revenue mix, a situation where you could still acquire aircraft and throw off a positive free cash flow? Thank you.\nQuint Turner: I mean -- thanks, Chris. Yes, absolutely. And Joe went through sort of the capital allocation options for us. And if you look at the business that ATSG has built, the maintenance CapEx is probably roughly $100 million. But as we mentioned, this year we're investing in growth, because those opportunities are very attractive. And we're going to see CapEx, which we said is going to approximate $475 million. But if you take our EBITDA production and you back out sort of a maintenance CapEx number, you back out cash interest and a little bit that we kick into, sort of, frozen pension plans. The free cash flow production in our business is pretty impressive -- a couple hundred million dollars a year that we essentially have the luxury of choosing between the best alternative to create value for our shareholders. So if for example, we decide -- was a period of time where the growth options were not as attractive then certainly from a free cash standpoint, we can be -- we can generate cash excess cash for those options, and that enables us to grow without really adding leverage in fact, deleveraging as our EBITDA expands. And so that's a great place to be. As you know we don't have extremely long-term CapEx commits and a lot of the CapEx that we do apply to aircraft is tied into the modification itself. So there's a lot of flexibility there to adjust our CapEx spend based upon how hot or not hot a market is in any particular time for our assets.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Tyler Seidman from Cowen.\nTyler Seidman: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question.\nJoe Hete: Hi, Tyler.\nTyler Seidman: So just -- hey, so just to kind of go back to the MAX question, I think it was one of the first question. So Air Canada said that they're going to use Omni as a way to backfill the MAX issues. And I'm wondering if you guys have enough passenger planes that aren't being flown with the military to kind of switch over to another airline in case the MAX issues kind of linger on longer than expected. Or is there not enough kind of feedstock in case the MAX -- if the MAX kind of continued -- the MAX delays continue longer than expected?\nJoe Hete: Tyler, you know, first and foremost obviously is making sure that we have enough of aircraft going through the conversion process to meet the customer commitments we already have in hand for those. But if we were in a situation where an opportunity came up for a long-term or I should say probably more short-term lease for a passenger aircraft that otherwise might be sitting idle or waiting for a conversion slot that's certainly an option that would be available for us. And most likely if we were going to do that it would be through Omni so that we can get the revenue generation not just off the asset but also on the operating of same. But it would really be dependent on what that customer demand would be. How long the 737 MAX stays grounded at this point is anybody's best guess, but I'm sure it won't be a long-term situation if Boeing is devoting all the resources they can to rectifying the issues and concerns with that particular aircraft.\nTyler Seidman: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we have no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Hete for closing remarks.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, John. At our Annual Stockholders' Meeting here in Wilmington tomorrow, we'll share the rest of our story about the growth in cash flow that our business model is generating and why we expect a great 2019. The nine cargo aircraft and expanded CMI operations we expect to add this year are proof that our customers are growing as well and we will work hard to support them. Thank you for joining us today and make sure to remember your mom, this Mother's Day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 4, "year": 2018, "date": "2019-02-28 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Q4, 2018, Air Transport Services Group Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Adrian, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Joe Hete, President and CEO. Mr. Hete, you may begin.\nJoe Hete: Thank you, Adrian. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are, Quint Turner, our Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Corrado, our Chief Operating Officer. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website, atsginc.com. We will file our Form 10-K tomorrow. I'm very pleased to report that we ended 2018 with substantial increases in revenues, and earnings on the strength of a solid fourth quarter. Our revenues increased 27% for the quarter, and 15% for the year excluding reimbursables. Our earnings on an adjusted basis were up 23% for the quarter, and 42% for the year, largely due to the 10 additional aircraft we leased, and improved results from our airlines. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $96 million, or a record $312 million for the year. Those excellent results stem from revenue growth in each of our segments, a better than expected contribution from Omni Air and solid peak season service levels for our customers. 2019 is off to a great start as well. We expect to drive lease 8 to 10, newly converted 767 freighters this year, including the five we will deploy with Amazon in the second half under the expanded and extended agreements we signed with them in December. We also expect overall stronger results from our ACMI segment with the addition of Omni Air in November, which brought passenger ACMI and charter capability via its fleet of 13 767 and 777 aircraft. Quint will summarize our overall financial results for the fourth quarter year. Rich will add a few words on the business units, and I'll close with some perspective on our outlook. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Joe, and thanks to all of you on the call for joining us this morning. Once again, let me start by saying that during the course of this call we will make projections or other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we described here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans, and estimates, as of the date of this call, and Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information, or other changes. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in market demand for our assets and services, our operating airline's ability to maintain on-time service and control costs. The cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration, fluctuations in ATSG's traded share price, which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments, the number of timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers, changes in general economic, and/or industry specific conditions, and other factors as contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-K, we will file tomorrow. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings, and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials, and we advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release, and on our website. Our consolidated results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 were evidence of the power of our complementary family of businesses, and the investments we're making to grow, and broaden their capabilities. Our customer revenues were $280.8 million in the fourth quarter. We adopted Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 and now reports certain revenues net of related expenses that are directly reimbursed by customers. After eliminating reimbursement revenues from 2017, our 2018 fourth quarter revenues increased 27%, from the prior period. Full year 2018 revenues increased 15% to $892 million on the same basis. Overall, our revenues increased due to additional aircraft leases, expanded CMI and logistics services for Amazon, higher aircraft maintenance and modification services, and passenger transportation services, primarily for the Defense Department, Omni Air's largest customer. We closed the army acquisition on November 9. So the fourth quarter and year included 52 days of their contribution to our results. On a GAAP basis, our earnings from continuing operations for both 2018 and 2017 were affected by several non-cash items. These include the full effect of changes in the fair market value of warrants we issued to Amazon, and a $59.9 million, non-cash positive contribution in 2017 from the effect of the 2017 Tax Law, on our deferred tax assets. Including those and other factors, GAAP earnings were a loss of $5.2 million, or $0.09 per share for the quarter. That compares with earnings of $94.1 million, or $1.11 per share diluted in fourth quarter 2017. Our adjusted earnings exclude those non-cash tax benefits and the Amazon warrants, along with other items such as deal fees related to our on acquisition, and gains and losses from revaluations of our interest rate derivatives, all of which we referenced in the reconciliations to GAAP results in our earnings release. In the fourth quarter, our adjusted earnings were $24.1 million or $0.36 diluted versus $19.6 million, or $0.28 a year ago. For 2018 adjusted earnings increased to $1.25 per share from $0.89 in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $96.2 million, up 19%. The improvement reflects contributions from additional 767 freighters CAM deployed during the quarter and nearly two months of contributions from Omni Air. 2018 capital spending was $293 million, down $4 million from 2017, but higher than the $280 million we projected on our third quarter earnings call. That 2018 total included $197 million to purchase eight 767s, plus related mod and spare engine costs. In December, we paid a deposit toward the purchase of 20 767-300s from American Airlines, which will be delivered through 2021. We expect to acquire six of those 20 and begin to convert this year in addition to the five that were in conversion at the end of 2018. We converted and deployed ten cargo aircraft, nine 767s and one 737 in both 2018 and 2017. Besides CapEx, uses of our capital included $855.1 million to purchase Omni Air, and additional contributions to the joint venture with Precision, that is developing a passenger to freighter conversion program for the Airbus A321. Funding for these transactions came from ATSG's operating cash flow, plus proceeds from our senior credit agreement with our banks. Balances at year-end under that credit facility included two unsubordinated term loans with a combined outstanding principal balance of $731 million and a revolving credit facility with a $475 million balance. Together with our $259 million in convertible notes, total debt principal outstanding was a bit under $1.5 billion at year end. The revolver has a capacity of $545 million, but also a feature that allows us to borrow an additional $400 million subject to the lender's consent. We currently expect to seek authorization to tap a portion of that resource later this year, as we acquire and convert more 767s for 2019 and 2020 deployments. As a result of the increased debt level and higher interest rates, we do project 2019 interest expense to increase significantly from 2018 levels. We project full-year 2019 interest expense to increase by $48 million to $77 million, inclusive of approximately $12 million of non-cash amortization related to capitalized loan fees and the convertible note discount. Our year-end debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.4 times, as calculated under the terms of our secured credit agreement. The unsubordinated term loans and the revolving credit facility bear variable interest rates of approximately 4.7%. Our goal is to keep our debt ratio at or below 3.5 times this year. As Joe mentioned earlier, we deepened our partnership with Amazon through extending and expanding our aircraft lease and operating agreements in December. We also agreed to issue them 14.8 million additional warrants, which, along with the warrant rights granted to them in 2016, could expand their potential ownership in ATSG to approximately 33%. These additional 14.8 million warrants are at a strike price of $21.53, and Amazon has, until January 2026, to exercise those warrants for cash or on a cashless net share basis. We also agreed that should Amazon and ATSG agree on lease terms for up to 17 additional aircraft beyond the 10 already committed, we will issue them incremental warrants. Warrants for all of those additional aircraft would take their potential ownership stake to approximately 39.9%, if our Amazon lease fleet were to grow by 17 more to 47 aircraft. Any such future warrants after March would be priced at a 30 trading day average price based on the date of contractual commitment for leases. As a consequence of issuing Amazon additional warrant rights, ATSG will ask shareholders to authorize additional common shares at the Annual Meeting in May 2019. Finally, I want to emphasize some points to consider as you think about ATSG's expenses and adjusted EPS in 2019. These include the elevated interest expense I mentioned earlier and higher depreciation and amortization expense after putting Omni on the balance sheet. We are projecting, for 2019, that our depreciation and amortization expense will be about $265 million, including a non-cash amortizing customer relationship intangible from the Omni deal of approximately $11 million. Also, the $14.8 million of additional warrants I mentioned earlier will affect ATSG's adjusted share count. That share and impact will depend significantly on the movement in our traded share price throughout the year as we apply the treasury stock method to those additional warrants. For our internal planning purposes, we are currently assuming that we end 2019 with an adjusted share count of approximately 69 million. Now, I'll turn it over to Rich Corrado for his operating review. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks Quint. In 2018, the businesses of ATSG maintained a strong pace of freighter lease deployments, delivered continued strong service to our customers and expanded and extended our relationship with Amazon. As a result, we completed the year with strong growth in adjusted revenues and earnings, and our business segments reported good results overall. CAM's revenues grew by $19.4 million during 2018 as its base of externally leased aircraft increased by 8 to 59. Revenues from external customers rose $16.1 million to $156.5 million. Revenues from its airline affiliates, including Omni, rose $3.3 million to $72.4 million. CAM added nine 767-300 freighter aircraft and one 737-400 freighter to its lease portfolio during the year. It also sold one 767-300 to a lease customer and retired one 767-200. The acquisition of Omni Air added 11 passenger aircraft to CAM's leased fleet, including two 767-200s, six 767-300s and three 777s. CAM earned $65.6 million in 2018, an increase of $4.1 million or 7%. Increased pre-tax earnings reflect nearly two months of lease revenue contribution from Omni's 11 passenger aircraft, as well as the 10 freighter aircraft placed into service in 2018, and were negatively impacted by $2.9 million of increased non-cash lease incentive amortization related to Amazon warrants. CAM's fourth quarter earnings were down slightly from a year ago. Delayed freighter deployments and transitioning aircraft offset gains, plus higher interest and depreciation expense and lower maintenance revenues offset earnings gains from the 10 freighters added to the fleet during the year. The fourth quarter of 2018 also included $3.5 million of additional interest expense allocated to CAM, driven by the investment in Omni. CAM purchased eight 767-300 passenger aircraft for freighter conversion in 2018. Turning to our ACMI Services segment, total revenues increased 20% during 2018 to $548.8 million, net of revenues from reimbursable in 2017. Principal factors were additional aircraft operations for Amazon, a 5% annual increase in billable block hours, as well as Omni Air's contribution since we acquired it on November 9. Pre-tax earnings were $17.7 million during 2018, compared to $8.6 million for 2017. Those gains were offset in part by higher compensation for ATI's pilots, who ratified an amendment to their collective bargaining agreement with ATI in March 2018. Fourth quarter revenues for ACMI Services increased by 52% to $193 million, net of 2017 revenues from reimbursed expenses. Pre-tax earnings were up 10% to $12.7 million. Billable block hours increased 4% for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter hours were negatively affected by operating restrictions at airports near the California fires in November and December. Our third segment, MRO Services, generated revenues of $207.5 million in 2018, up $2.1 million from 2017. External customer revenues increased to $11.1 million. Pre-tax earnings from MRO Services, before internal eliminations, decreased by $5.2 million to $14.5 million due mainly to a greater proportion of lower margin maintenance services with longer completion times. For the quarter, revenues from MRO Services increased 5%. Pre-tax earnings more than doubled to $6.4 million from $2.9 million for the same period a year ago. The increase reflects more support for ATSG airlines. Total revenues for other activities decreased for the fourth quarter and full-year 2018. External customer revenues from this group, excluding reimbursables, decreased $3.1 million in 2018. In September 2018, the US Postal Service ended contracts with logistics services for support of five sort centers. The reduced revenues were offset partially by additional customer ground support agreements. Pre-tax earnings from other activities increased by $3.5 million to $9.1 million in 2018 and by $300,000 to $600,000 for the fourth quarter. Improved earnings were a result of additional ground support services and improved results from West Atlantic, an airline affiliate accounted for under the equity method. We look forward to improved operating and financial performance for all of our businesses in 2019, as they deliver even better service to their customers. That's a summary of our business unit performance in 2018. I'll hand off to Joe for his recap and outlook comments.\nJoe Hete: Thanks Rich. 2018 continued our trend of strong year-over-year improvement in our operating results, somewhat masked by the accounting rule changes and warrant valuation adjustments that make our steady progress less evident. Our double-digit percentage gains in adjusted revenues, earnings and EBITDA last year demonstrate the strength of our business model and the cash flow we can leverage to make both organic and strategic growth investments as we did in 2018. We're starting off 2019 with a significant new airline affiliate in Omni Air, a secured pipeline of additional feedstock aircraft and a strong commitment to our shared future from Amazon. In December, Amazon selected us to support the next phase of its air network growth with a 10 freighter order and multi-year extensions of leases and operating support for today's 20 aircraft dedicated fleet. The extension of those 20 aircraft will include a step down in lease rates during the extension period. Although cash lease rates will not change until the start of the extension period, the lease revenue recognized for them will be lower by $3 million in 2019, due to averaging the rent over the remaining full lease term. In total, we invested more than $1 billion last year to grow and diversify our business. We expanded into the ACMI passenger market to diversify and supplement that growth, even while our future in cargo is still very bright. Omni Air is a number one outsource provider of dedicated passenger air service to the Defense Department, other government agencies and commercial customers. Rob Coretz, who joined our Board of Directors last week, built Omni as a leader in a niche of its own, ACMI and charter passenger service for major government organizations. We expect Omni to continue to profitably apply its flexible, go anywhere, anytime capabilities to commercial as well as government customers, while generating strong and steady cash flow for our shareholders. Along with their growth potential, we value the revenue diversification that their public sector concentration provides and the fleet synergy possible as their 767 passenger aircraft may become feedstock for cargo conversion at the appropriate time in their life cycle. At the same time, we are reinforcing our commitment to the mid-size freighter market under an agreement with Jetran. We will be purchasing 20 passenger 767-300s for conversion and freighter deployment over a three-year period as American Airlines retires them from passenger service. We are able to make commitments like this purchase and the Omni acquisition because we have maintained a strong balance sheet and waited patiently for the right opportunity. This was also key in starting our relationship with Amazon, first with a request for five freighters, crews and maintenance support to run an express network trial in 2015, and again, last fall, when they needed 10 more 767s on top of the 20 we have provided to-date. The first five of those freighters and the crews that will fly them will be ready to go later this year. We anticipate related 2019 crew training and deployment costs of about $1.5 million. We have used our financial capacity and management focus to acquire assets and extend relationships that answer most of the key questions you have been asking us for more than a year. That includes our recent plug-in acquisition of TriFactor, the engineering and design firm we acquired two weeks ago, that add those capabilities to our material handling service offerings. Many of the customers require material handling services from our logistics group for the same customers to utilize our aircraft leasing and our operating capabilities. During 2019 the feedstock 767, will acquire convert and deploy will again put us within the range of another 10 freighter year including a 5 will deploy with Amazon in the second half and three or more we will lease to a major global network integrator. Many of you are aware that the agreement underlying our long-term relationship with DHL are due to expire at the end of March. Our discussions are pointing toward additional multi-year extensions for 14 or the 16 767 they currently lease and a similar extension of the related CMI operating agreement. We expect those costs to conclude before the end of March. Our marketing team is working to redeploy into two 767 200's that DHL is returning. We're budgeting to spend another 400 million in 2019 CapEx principally to purchase and modify more Boeing 767, but also to cover the increase in engines and capitalized airframe maintenance, we will incur from our overall fleet growth including the Omni fleet. It will be our responsibility along with our leadership teams to turn the assets we are acquiring into strong cash generators that exceed our targeted investment returns. To that end, we projected our adjusted EBITDA this year will exceed $445 million, which is a 43% increase from the 312 million we generated last year. We are well-provisioned with the right resources and targeting the right opportunities not just for 2019 but for 2020 and beyond. I updating you on our progress at our Annual Meeting in May and for some of you as we go back on the road with our story of growth and financial strength to spring. And now Adrian, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes to Kevin Sterling from Seaport Global. Your line is open.\nKevin Sterling: Congrats on another great quarter and 2019 outlook. And along those lines with 2019, thank you guys for all the additional guidance you've given us a share count expense in SG&A. And as we think about your EBITDA for 2019, 460 and 445 million and it does seem like it's definitely back-end loaded as you take delivery of the planes and further ramp with Amazon. How should we think about EBITDA percentage for the back half of the year, said the last two quarters. Is it 60%, 70% of your EBITDA generation coming in the back half of the year, just to help us think about as we model throughout the year, if you don't mind, maybe just give us a little bit of color.\nQuint Turner: You're right that it is backloaded as we say with the aircraft coming on, predominantly in the second half. That's the big driver there. Perhaps not as back-loaded, as you might have - as you were suggesting there. That has to do - Omni has some impact on that as well in terms of when there, how their distribution works. I would say that the second half will contain approximately 55% of our total EBITDA for the year. So it's kind of a 45, 55 split, perhaps not as back-loaded, as you might think.\nKevin Sterling: And then, Joe, thank you for the update with DHL and sounds like those are talks are progressing nicely. How should we think about, I know you've done the ATI labor contract and how should we think about how it's progressing with other union partners the Teamsters and getting to a new labor agreement with them?\nJoe Hete: Obviously, Kevin it's not progressing as well as we would like it to. We've still having discussions under the auspices of the National Mediation Board. Hopefully we'll be able to get a deal sometime this year. I wouldn't project that is being in the first part of the year. I think we are next scheduled to meet sometime in May, I believe is the next scheduled session. So if we do come to an agreement, the impact would be in the latter half of the year and we have not built any of that into our guidance at this point in time.\nKevin Sterling: Is it possible to quantify the impact of the California wildfires on your operations - I know you said it impacted the following a deal with Amazon, is it possible to quantify that?\nRich Corrado: I would say that we're talking probably - it's certainly less than $1 million sort of somewhere between $0.5 million or $1 million call it.\nKevin Sterling: In terms of EBITDA, or is that revenue or --\nRich Corrado: Yes, in terms of EBITDA. Yes, obviously both the expenses\u2026\nQuint Turner: It\u2019s pretty much both.\nKevin Sterling: And you guys did a great job end of 2018 getting those 20 planes from American. How should we think about potential feedstock availability this year or next year, new customers come to and would like some aircraft. How does the - how is the feedstock - how is the feedstock situation look today.\nJoe Hete: Well, if you look, we've had five aircraft, I think in convention at the end of the year that will come out a couple of those are dedicated to Amazon at this point in time. Yes, the American fleet is mostly back loaded for the year, there is a couple in the first quarter, one in the second or third quarter and then the rest of them are in the four. So pretty heavily backloaded from that standpoint. Outside of that, we're not doing a whole heck of a lot of looking at this point in time since we've got - call it 20 in the queue, but we are always keeping our eye off for something that may pop up that may make sense for us to acquire to fulfill customer requirement.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Joe. More or less address what we have and what our needs are at this point in time but as far as what's out there today, there is nothing, large, like the American buy that we just made which we strongly prefer to buy fleet. There are 1G's, 2G's out there, they are coming available and there is several bidders going after each lot that comes available.\nOperator: And our next question from Jack Atkins from Stephens. Your line is open.\nJack Atkins: So Rich if I could start with you, obviously just with the data points, we've been hearing over the last, call it four, five months from the folks in the international trade sort of arena. You\u2019re seeing - some strains in terms of global growth out there beginning to emerge in Europe and Asia. Also the IATA statistics have begun to sort of moderate somewhat I know you guys don't \u2013 the freight that you guys moved up necessarily get captured in the IRS statistics generally. So just sort of curious if you could update on what your customers are telling us about their outlook for growth over the next year call it 12 to 24 months and how would you sort of rate the demand for 767 assets because it sounds like there's still multiple bidders for every aircraft there still a lot of demand for your assets.\nRich Corrado: Yes, thanks for the question. The market that we play in really is the integrator space e-commerce and regional flying and those markets don't tend to be impacted as much by global trade and the efforts of large lanes Far East to the U.S. is an example. And so those markets today are very hot. I mean we've got demand all over the globe right now we've got demand in Europe, We got demand in the Middle East, We got demand in the Far East. In the US, we wouldn't have gone out and bought 20 airplanes that we didn't think we'd be able to deploy them as they became available. So we're very bullish on the growth in the segment that we're in. If you look at the eCommerce statistics at this point going out through 2024 they're projecting about a 60% increase in e-commerce purchasing and larger penetration of general retail in e-commerce. With the growth of mobile commerce the phones and tablets and those types of things, it's really growing the purchasing of e-commerce exponentially compared to your general freight or even your integrator business. If you look at the IRS statistics I think they're predicting about 3% growth in general cargo, but if you look at the integrator growth on the international sector. They've probably averaged over 7% CAGR for the last five years. So they've outgrown general cargo and we'll continue to outgrow general cargo. So if you look at the segments with this aircraft deployed into that market is very strong, it projected to be very strong throughout the next five years.\nJack Atkins: Thank you for that color Rich. And then Joe just going back to your comments on the TriFactor acquisition, could you expand a little bit \u2013 in the terms of how TriFactor fits into your existing portfolio of logistic services. And what are the potential opportunities from a revenue synergy perspective as you leverage those capabilities over the next couple of years?\nJoe Hete: Joe TriFactor is a Company, we work with for a number of years now. They do small design, MAT design work and we've done some installation work of the things that they've designed and that was one piece of MHEG group Material Handling Equipment Group that we lacked which was the ability to design systems. Yeah, relatively small company overall, but one of the constraints they've had over time is that they didn't have capital to be able to bid on larger jobs. And so we think the synergies between us and them is going to be we bring the capital to the table, they bring the expertise in terms of design work, and then ultimately the leverage that to grow that piece of the business from smaller jobs to much larger ones. Material handling piece of our business has grown quite a bit. I mean it's not a huge bottom line mover at this point in time. But when you look at our customer base, we basically do work primarily on the maintenance side and against small installations for UPS, FedEx, Amazon, Target and a whole host of others in terms of being able to pick up one telephone and make a call and get your equipment serviced, no matter where it is in the country.\nJack Atkins: And then Quint I guess a question for you on the 400 million in CapEx for this year. Can you help us break that down between growth and maintenance CapEx and I'm just trying to think about how much of that relates to the bulk purchase of the aircraft from American and I guess we're just trying to figure out. Yeah how much of that 400 million CapEx is tied to aircraft placements for this year. And if any of that sort of pulling forward CapEx into this year for future growth in the outer years so that question makes sense?\nQuint Turner: Of course as Joe said, we had five aircraft in process at the end of this year, we've said 8 to 10, are going on during 2019 and we\u2019ll have five in conversion at the end of 2019. So you are acquiring tails that you won't see go into service until 2020.\nJack Atkins: Yes.\nQuint Turner: In terms of the American fleet as it happens, I think we've said that we expect to take six of the 20 take delivery of those this year. If you think about the CapEx of 400 million and we're putting eight to 10 online as they move through the cycle we say roughly what 25 million. A copy all in that may have ticked up somewhat right with the competition for feedstock out there. So if you figure that's more like call it the 28ish kind of number \u2013 for 10 airplanes you're roughly 280. All in you've got maintenance CapEx with Omni right in the past we've said just ATSG is 60 million/70 million of maintenance CapEx. So with Omni you're more like 100 all in. And so that gets you to kind of a 380ish kind of number. And then you've got another 20 million for some of your other business requirements of any group.\nJack Atkins: Last question also for you Quint, can you help us think about operating cash flow and how that should trend in 2019 \u2013 when you are talking about in excess of $445 million of EBITDA. Can you walk us down to the operating cash flow expectation that would underpin?\nQuint Turner: Yes, I think Jack in the discussion of debt leverage, we said we had a goal what to stand at 3.5 but we\u2019re 3.4 roughly as measured under our credit agreement.\nJack Atkins: Right.\nQuint Turner: Currently, so what we're saying is that we're in a growth mode. I think Rich talked about all the, in terms of the market what the demand profile looks like, still very strong and as you can see we're investing in that growth with the American fleet, et cetera. We don't anticipate our leverage to change much during the year and at times during the year may slightly tick up, but again we have that goal of kind of maintaining a steady 3.5 type leverage number. You think about the EBITDA of 445, but we also have cash interest expense. And we talked about the elevated interest expense in our earlier remarks and our portion of that interest cost that hits the P&L is non-cash, its bank fees that have been paid and will be amortized over the life of the loan. But when you put the interest with the 400 million of cash CapEx, it's pretty much a push in terms of the net cash and that's why our debt leverage is fairly steady.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is open.\nTyler Seidman: This is actually Tyler on for Helane. So thanks for the color on the Amazon deal in the low release rents that was very helpful but just to kind of dig a little deeper into the EBITDA guidance for the year. It looks like Omni is about 130 million for 2019 from an EBITDA standpoint. So that implies that each - so that implies that no your organic EBITDA is growing kind of low single digits. And I'm just wondering, is this all due to the structure of the Amazon deal or is there other factors kind of playing into that?\nQuint Turner: Yes Tyler it\u2019s Quint. There is a factor certainly is the extension of the Amazon deal, particularly the lease agreements for the 20 aircraft that we have as we got multi-year extensions on those 12 for two years and eight of the 300's for three years. And as its customary, when we have customers that are, they're giving you very long lease terms, it's not uncommon to see some rent reduction in the extension periods, and while that doesn't affect cash flow perhaps. And until you get to the extension period under the revenue recognition rules you average that over the remaining lease term. So we're just a little north of $3 million would be the annual impact to our revenue from those extensions. We also mentioned in there that of course we're currently working to renew and extend agreements with DHL. Their aircraft demand, which we had 16 aircraft for example at the end of the year with them is going to go down by two, it looks like, and those are domestic placements that we also do CMI flying for that will go from 10 airplanes in the domestic network. The other is being in the Middle East down to eight. So we'll have two aircraft that we've got to work to redeploy. So they'll come out of revenue service for a period of time and we'll have to place those aircraft with new customers. So those are some I guess headwinds in terms of the base ATSG EBITDA piece.\nTyler Seidman: And then one more follow-up; just on the DHL commentary, it sounds like you guys are pretty confident you could place these assets in 2019. Is that fair to assume that within like 2H 2019 you'll be able to place these two Boeing 767s with customers?\nJoe Hete: We do feel confident that we will be able to replace those aircraft. One of the two I believe has - it will require little maintenance first. But otherwise we're very confident that we can get those two redeployed.\nOperator: And your next question comes from David Ross from Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Ross: I guess first question is on the 8 to 10 planes or the 3 to 5 really that you're adding outside of Amazon this year, are those expected to be CAM only or ACMI or some other version?\nJoe Hete: No, they're expected to be dry lease only\nDavid Ross: And the margin profile in ACMI post the Omni deal, what should we be looking for there, Quint, as we move through this year certainly has taken a step up?\nJoe Hete: The margin profile with Omni, you saying the Omni impact on the margin profile? Was that your question Dave?\nDavid Ross: Correct.\nJoe Hete: Well, certainly, yeah Omni has - will certainly improve the ACMI Services segment results and I think even saw some impact from that in the fourth quarter. So you're right that that will have a very, very positive impact on there on their results. And that's where we're leading the segment. Now, we took a portion because the aircraft that Omni owns, the 11 they own, are owned by CAM now and leased into Omni. A portion of their EBITDA and earnings impact will also go to CAM as we separated the assets based on our structure of putting the assets in CAM and have the operations be in the ACMI Services segment. We did bifurcate the assets from the operating piece.\nQuint Turner: Yeah, we're just trying to figure out if 4Q is just seasonally strong or if there was an impact of Omni that's going to take the margins permanently higher in that segment.\nRich Corrado: I think Omni's impact is going to be a recurring impact\nDavid Ross: And then on the unallocated interest expense piece, that was up significantly. I know debt was taken on for the Omni deal, was some of that not allocated to the segment?\nQuint Turner: CAM bears most of the allocation. I think Rich mentioned that CAMs interest cost was up $3.5 million and that's the impact of that. There is some of that that is going to the ACMI piece and then the goodwill as well. But as you know, CAM gets the lion's share of the allocation\nDavid Ross: Yeah, I guess our question was more, why is there a much bigger portion that's not allocated? It went from $700,000 to about $4.2 million in unallocated interest expense year-over-year in the quarter?\nJoe Hete: So that piece is related to because with the purchase of Omni, we leave that as unallocated. That's related more to the airline portion of our acquisition. The portion that's related to the assets that went into CAM are going into CAM. And so what you're seeing there is the remaining impact which we're leaving down in the unallocated section.\nDavid Ross: I just don't know why that wouldn't be in ACMI if it's the airline portion?\nJoe Hete: We have not historically burdened the ACMI Services segment with interest costs.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Adam Ritzer from Pressprich. Your line is open.\nAdam Ritzer: I just had a couple of things. Most of my questions were answered. Can you give us the pro forma numbers for Q4 if you would have owned Omni for the full quarter instead of just the two months?\nQuint Turner: Adam, we are not. We typically - and the reasons for that is we don't break out individual subsidiary results, subsidiary companies. We talk in terms of the segments.\nJoe Hete: If you want to dig a little deeper, Adam, you can go to the 8-K that we filed. That gives you a little bit of a view into what the Omni piece would generate.\nQuint Turner: Exactly. And the 10-K we intend to publish tomorrow will also have some stuff in it as well. But we don't separately talk to the individual subsidiaries.\nAdam Ritzer: Okay, yeah. Maybe just getting like a round number if it would have been 100 something, but no big deal. I can wait to go through the filings. You went through all your free cash numbers et cetera. So, my other question is: For 2020, does your current purchase deployment model you gave out for next year, does that get you to the 10 minimum for Amazon or do you need more new planes in 2020?\nJoe Hete: You're talking about what the acquisition in American airplanes, Adam?\nAdam Ritzer: Yeah,\nJoe Hete: Yeah. We've got the feedstock available for that piece of it. Remember, there's 20 in total. We'll take six this year, five of them will be in modification at the end of the year and then whatever we take and - it's a fluid schedule somewhat with American in terms of when we get airplanes from them. And then the balance would be purchased in 2021.\nAdam Ritzer: Okay. Can you like - but does that include any additional to get to the 17 more that they have an option on?\nJoe Hete: Again, the 17 are options and they've got basically or the term of the entire agreement to do that. So there's a lot of runway there for them to be able to exercise on the options on the 17 to get the additional warrants. So there's really no definitive timeframe on that. As you know, we put in the agreement that if they exercise any of the option signed in definitive agreements, they can get the $21 warrant price if they do that by the end of March. And then thereafter if they exercise any of those options for aircraft, then they would be at the 30 day VWAP at the time they execute a definitive agreement.\nAdam Ritzer: Okay. So Amazon has flexibility and you also have flexibility with the 20 purchased from American, is that the best way to look at it?\nJoe Hete: Yeah, that's a fair statement.\nAdam Ritzer: Okay. So they want more, you go to American and say: Hey, we need 5 or 10 more in 2020 or 21. You could kind of play both sides against the middle, so it kind of averages out. We are not sitting with a bunch of empty aircraft waiting for Amazon?\nJoe Hete: No, it doesn't work that way. The aircraft are committed to and whatever American's release date comes up, we have to buy the aircraft whether we have a customer forward or not.\nAdam Ritzer: Okay. So you're committed to the 20 even if Amazon may not want 17 more?\nJoe Hete: That is correct.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos from SIG. Your line is open.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Your guidance for the operating fleet this year is 100 aircraft. But given the jet trend deal, how should we think about the fleet size in 2020 and 2021?\nJoe Hete: Look, as we said, Chris, the number of aircraft that we would take delivery of from American next year is a little bit fluid because of their release schedule. But it could be anywhere from 6 to 10 that we would take from them next year. And then whatever hasn't been delivered at that point falls out into 2021\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Just moving to labor, if you do revise the deal with ABX this year, what are some of the things you can do to help offset the increase, whether it's passing some of it along to customers or productivity? And are you renegotiating deals with related step up in mind?\nJoe Hete: In terms of, well, if you look at the Amazon deal, I mean basically that's been in for 7 years going forward, we're currently working on the DHL piece, which is the other primary customer of AVX and outside of that the only other flying to do is for AeroMax, which is one aircraft which is renewed annually from a contract standpoint and then they do some for the military, which military contract comes up basically the new fiscal year will be October 1.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: And then final question, the three to five non-Amazon aircraft that you're expecting to place this year. Where are you in terms of placing these and how many are close to securing deals versus still being actively marketing? Thank you.\nJoe Hete: As I noted in my remarks. Right now to release three in the aircraft are designated for a major global integrator out there, which we cannot name so we pretty much well down the path for three of the aircraft on top of the five with Amazon. So that gives you eight and then there are two more in play, which we think we'll be able to secure contracts for in the not too distant future.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Steve O'Hara for Sidoti. Your line is open.\nSteve O'Hara: Just curious if you could talk about and with the aircraft yearly, I think it's around ten or has been around ten. I mean has that I am not saying you necessarily will, but has that increased with the scale of the fleet or anything like that and user ability to add much more than that at some point, as you continue to grow?\nJoe Hete: There is two constraints on adding aircraft one is feedstock and the other one is capacity for conversion. And so at ten aircraft, we're pretty comfortable that where we can meet both those needs for the coming three years, call it the 767 feedstock there's probably about 200 of those left in the market right now that will come out over the next, call it seven to ten years. So we see that over that period, we will see the 767 get a little tighter to achieve, that's one of the reasons why we've invested in the A321 conversion and to get the A321 out there. We're hoping to have it out by first quarter of 2020. And then that will grow from there. So we look at as we'll be investing and growing in the A321, at the same time that will go on the 767 300. So you're going to look at two situations of feedstock and two situations of conversion capacity, which will only enhance our ability to grow both lines.\nSteve O'Hara: And then one more, just on the omni deal and maybe the accounting there. I apologize if you covered this, but in terms of the fuel expenses on the income statement now on the - in the fourth quarter, I assume the big jump was omni. Is there a difference in the accounting there with maybe their ACMI flying or CMI flying relative to what ATSG currently uses or is that the same across the Board and it's just they have higher fuel expense and it's not a pass-through?\nJoe Hete: Good question. The rule change at 606 that we adopted in the beginning of 2018 that had rules in it that resulted in. For example, the fuel that we purchase as sort of an agent for Amazon being netted with the revenues of the expenses, but similar to our own combi flying the structure of the contracts with the government, the military would not qualify for netting and so you're absolutely right that the fuel that's purchased by omni is not netted out and it will show up therefore, in the expenses and the revenue. So it's going to be a bit of a different certainly between how we treat, for example, the fuel we buy for Amazon.\nSteve O'Hara: And I believe there is margin on the fuel as well?\nJoe Hete: It's a little to nothing, probably it's the margin is on the other operating costs.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with SIG. Your line is open.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thanks for taking my follow-up. With the omni acquisition and the expanded Amazon agreement, could you give us a sense of what your revenue mix looks like back in October you put up a slide deck with the omni call where you had some pro forma stats? I think omni was around 33%, but could you just give us a sense of what that looks like now?\nJoe Hete: Chris, when we put that out we didn't have the Amazon additional swap growth baked in because we haven't finalize those agreements, but I don't know that it will change all that significantly because of the back loading of the additional five aircraft. And as you'll recall, we have said the largest customers likely to be the DoD and other governmental flying with Amazon, then certainly being second. I think we had the DoD at roughly a third of our revenues when we referred to that earlier last year.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: And then just last one on the new Amazon the five for this year, five for next year. What's the average age of those aircraft? And then when those are in play, what would be the overall average age for the entire fleet operating for them?\nJoe Hete: Yes, the aircraft that we are putting in are early to mid-90s and that's consistent with the existing fleet.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Joe Hete for closing remarks.\nJoe Hete: Thank you, Adrian. We tend to focus a lot of attention on these calls on aircraft, dollars and rates and our plans to grow ATSG and make it stronger. Last Saturday we all received a stark reminder that what really makes our business special are the people that make everything happen and the kingship that develops from our shared experience with others throughout aviation. All of us at ATSG and our families send our deepest condolences to the families and coworkers of those aboard Flight 3591 and our appreciation to first responders in Houston and others working to understand how this event could have happened. For our part, we will honor their service by keeping people first and everything we do. Thank you and have a quality day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "ATSG", "quarter": 3, "year": 2018, "date": "2018-11-02 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Air Transport Services Group, Inc. Conference Call. My name is Nicole and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Joe Hete, President and CEO of Air Transport Services Group. Mr. Hete you may begin.\nJoe Hete: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Quint Turner, our Chief Financial Officer and Rich Corrado, our Chief Operating Officer. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It's on our website, atsginc.com. We had another good quarter with more year-over-year revenue adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA growth than we had in the second quarter. We also announced our agreement to acquire Omni Air International which will contribute substantial growth and significantly broaden our revenue base in 2019. Our revised fourth quarter guidance reflects modification delays resulting in some 767 freighters deploying later than we projected and lower margins in our MRO business in the second half than we had hope to achieve. But we're still on track to place five more converted 767 freighters in service this quarter meeting our plan to deploy 10 of them during 2018 plus the one 737 we placed in April and deliver record adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share. Quint is standing by to summarize our overall financial results for the quarter. Rich will add some color on our other businesses and I'll close with more on our outlook. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks Joe and thanks to all of you joining us this morning. During the course of this call, we will projections or other forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we described here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call and Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include but are not limited to changes in market demand for our assets and services, our operating airlines ability to maintain on time service and control cost. The cost and timing with respect to which we're able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration, fluctuations and ATSG's traded share price which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments. The number, timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers that one or more closing conditions to the acquisition of Omni Air International LLC including certain regulatory approvals may not be satisfied over waived on a timely basis. The risk that the acquisition may not be completed on the terms or in the timeframe expected by ATSG or at all uncertainty of the expected financial performance of the combined company following completion of the acquisition. And other factors as contained from time-to-time in our filings with the SEC including the Form 10-Q we will file today. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pre-tax earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG's financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials and we advise you to refer to the reconciliation to GAAP measures which are included in our earnings release and on our website. We're pleased to report that our third quarter results were substantially better in the same period last year with double-digit growth in revenues and adjusted EPS and EBITDA. On a consolidated basis, third quarter revenues were $204.9 million under the new accounting rules we stopped recognizing revenue this year that is associated with reimbursed expenses. Subtracting $72.1 million and reimbursements from last year's third quarter revenues our third quarter revenue growth was 13% more than doubled the comparable 6% growth in the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, we had third quarter earnings from continuing operations $32.9 million versus a loss of $28.2 million a year ago. On a diluted basis, GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.24 versus a loss of $0.48 per share a year ago. The quarterly mark-to-market revaluation of our liability for warrants issued to Amazon resulted in a $16.8 million after tax gain in the third quarter. The comparable mark-to-market adjustment for the warranty liability in the third quarter last year was negative $33.2 million. The related lease amortization incentive also tied to the Amazon warrants this quarter was $3.3 million or $0.04 a share after tax. Our third quarter share of cost to develop a freighter version of the Airbus A321-200 with precision was a $0.03 a share item after tax this quarter versus $0.01 a year ago. Adjusted for those items our EPS from continuing operations was $0.31 diluted for the third quarter, $0.09 higher than a year ago. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $74.3 million up 13% from third quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 9% in the second quarter. We ended the first nine months of 2018 with $214 million of capital spending slightly behind our 2017 pace. We have spent $149.2 million to buy five 767 300 feedstock aircraft and to fund freighter modifications of those and others in process. We now expect to 2018 CapEx spend of about $280 million for the year. As Joe said, we're very eager to add great assets and capabilities of Omni Air to ATSG. We expect the acquisition to be accretive to ATSG's adjusted EPS starting in 2019. The purchase will be funded through an expansion of our current senior credit facility primarily through a $675 million additional term loan, along with borrowing under our existing revolving credit facility. At close we expect our total debt to annual adjusted EBITDA ratio to be approximately 3.4 times inclusive of Omni Air's EBITDA contribution. Joe had more to say shortly about these significant adjusted EBITDA our existing businesses and Omni are expected to produce next year. The strong cash flows from those combined businesses and air fleets in 2019 will provide us with ample liquidity to continue to invest and attractive growth opportunities. That's the summary of our overall financial results for the quarter. Rich is ready to discuss our segment results and market perspective. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks Quint. The third quarter was challenging on an operating basis, but we still delivered revenue growth across each of our segments and achieved $1.5 million gain in pretax earnings overall on an adjusted basis versus 2017. Our airlines again achieved improved revenues in positive in earnings even with the same number of aircraft they operated last year. In the fourth quarter, ATI will be operating two more 767 300's on an ACMI basis during peak and continuing well into 2019. As we told you last quarter, ATI's pilot received pay increases last March that have increased expenses by $2.2 million per quarter. We continue to negotiate for an amended labor agreement with our ABX pilots as well. Block hours increased to just 2% overall in the July to September period preceding peak. Service performance was strong and continues into the fourth quarter. CAM, our leasing company have seven more aircraft in service at September 30 than the year ago. Pretax earnings were $19 million down marginally from a year ago. Earnings from a larger lease fleet were again offset by increases in the lease incentives to Amazon and lower maintenance support revenues. We had expected to place two 767-300s in service during the third quarter and three in the fourth. Conversion process delays instead push lease and certification arrangements for those two aircraft into the fourth quarter. We still expect to complete deployments of five 767 300's this quarter for total of 10 newly converted 767s. We sold one for a net of nine 767's, but added one more 737 freighter. Two of the added 300s are already in services as dry leases. We will dry lease one more and lease the other two to ATI for ACMI service during peak and beyond. CAM remains in the market for more 767 passenger feedstock to meet 2019 demand. We have secured rights to five 300s for 2019 deployment and that number is likely to increase in the coming months. MRO Services which includes the results of our aircraft maintenance and conversion businesses had earnings of $2.3 million for the quarter down slightly from a year ago. The results were not as strong as we had expected however due to a higher mix of maintenance services for CAM expanding portfolio of external dry leases versus work for outside customers and delays in completing some scheduled maintenance. Specifically two 767 200 were put into AIMs to transition from internal to external dry lease deployment in the fourth quarter. These dry lease preparations took MRO slots that could have been utilized for external customer revenue and profit. The short-term impact of MRO performance creates a benefit for CAM and ATSG through the long-term external dry leases of these assets. Pre-tax earnings from other activities increased through $3.1 million. The gain is attributable to better results from our minority interest in West Atlantic and improving in our postal and gateway operations. As we noted in our release, our contracts to manage store operations at five regional US postal service centers expired in September. Pretax earnings for that business were $2 million in the third quarter. From an operating margin perspective, I'm looking forward to bringing Omni Air's aircraft assets and capabilities into the ATSG family of businesses. We regard their strengths as very complementary to ours including a broader base of government and commercial customers along with the addition of the Boeing 777 platform. We will have more to say about Omni Air and the opportunity it brings after we complete the purchase this month. And with that I'll turn it over to Joe.\nJoe Hete: Thanks Rich. While the third quarter was a good one overall, we feel short in a few years that we were counting on to achieve our adjusted EBITDA target for the year. The principal issues were delayed in getting newly converted and current 767s deployed or redeployed plus lower returns from our MRO segment stemming from a change in the mix of internal and external volume. Those factors plus the expirations in September of our sorting operations for the US Postal Service had a principal reasons we lowered our adjusted EBITDA for 2018. We are now targeting adjusted EBITDA of $80 million to $85 million for the fourth quarter which will likely be a quarterly record for ATSG. Delays in aircraft replacements won't affect our momentum entering 2019 with 70 ATSG cargo aircraft in service plus 13 passenger aircraft that will come to us with Omni Air. On a preliminary basis, we expect to deliver more than $440 million in adjusted EBITDA next year including from those 91 ATSG and Omni aircraft plus our existing businesses. And that does not include contributions from the eight to 10 more 767 300's we expect to deploy next year and we have identified less of these from most of those additional 300's. We will issue a complete picture of our adjusted EBITDA outlook for 2019 when we release our fourth quarter results in late February. We feel fortunate to have been successful bidder last month for Omni Air, a leading provider of contracted passenger airlift services to Department of Defense and other federal agencies. Our conversation with Omni Air's management since the deal was announced in early October give us even more confidence that we're making a right move for ATSG shareholder with this transaction. We hope to close within the next several weeks. We are also pursuing opportunities with secure more ATSG growth and cash returns well beyond 2019. By the time we hold our fourth quarter call in late February I'm sure we'll have more to report about how the long-term shareholders of ATSG will be rewarded for their competence and our ability to deliver superior results over time. That concludes our prepared remarks Nicole. We're ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from line of Kevin Sterling of Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.\nKevin Sterling: Just on the MRO work, you talked about how had a higher level of internal versus external. Was this, what drove this? Was it just higher use of aircraft? Was it internal network? Was it unscheduled maintenance? You may have touched on your prepared remarks. If you did, I'm sorry but just kind of curious as to what drove that level of higher internal work?\nJoe Hete: Kevin thanks for the question. The principal reason was the transition of aircraft from internal operation to external SC and there were four aircraft involved in that. Two of them were actually on maybe certificate and leads the DHO in the US. And DHO made the decision to move those aircraft in the Middle East, so we had to take those out of service, put them in the hangar and generally what you do, is you have to upgrade the navigation equipment for that area of the world and you have to go through a number of things between the records and the repairs on the fuselage that have been done overtime and make sure that you've got clear picture what the records look like for the aviation authority in that region of the world, to review the aircraft and accept it on the certificate. So we had those two aircraft and then we had two other [indiscernible] one in Poland and one then one for West Atlantic that will be delivered this month both aircraft. Those also went into AIMs and the same issue. Those are going into EASA both in Europe and we had to upgrade the navigation equipment for the aircraft and we had to go through a thorough records review. The record review generally some of the things you find in that, if you don't have back to birth records for some of repairs. You may actually have to remove the repair and put it back on the aircraft believe it or not. And so you generally don't know until you review the records how long or what the extent of the work that's going to be required on those aircraft. So if you look at the four slots that were available, if you could have put sea checks in there as an example and you would have driven more revenue into AIMs on top line and you would have driven more profit that would not have been eliminated due to external agreement.\nQuint Turner: A lot of that work Kevin goes on the balance sheet dense into P&L and then gets amortized over the portion of the lease until its heavy chap for example and that's why it doesn't hit the profitability line as well.\nRich Corrado: The good news on that, if you will is that we've now secured five-year lease on one 200 external lease, seven-year lease on another 200 the one's going into Europe and then we're getting. We're working right now with DHO and lease extensions for those aircrafts that are going into the Middle East. So although we've got the short-term dip in the MRO performance it's good for CAM and it's good for ATSG to lock those assets up for long period of time.\nKevin Sterling: Yes, so Richard it sounds like kind of maybe some short-term pain if you will right now for kind of the long-term gain. Is that fair?\nRich Corrado: That's exactly right, Kevin.\nKevin Sterling: Okay, thanks. And I just want to make sure Rich and Joe to that I've got this right. I think last quarter, you said you could place six to 10, 767 300s in 2019 and now you believe its eight to 10, so it looks like you up the bottom end of that range. Am I reading that right? Or do you hear that right?\nJoe Hete: No, you heard it right. As we said in our remarks the majority of those aircraft are pretty much identified as to where they're going. Obviously we don't talk about who customers are until we've got final contracts inked. But we're pretty confident in terms of being able to place eight to 10 airplanes in 2019.\nKevin Sterling: Okay, thanks. And then let me piggyback on that Joe, if you don't mind because I think in your prepared remarks and Rich's, you talked about really strong demand and customer indications of some leased aircraft. Is it a matter of just finding feedstock for you guys to satisfy this demand? Are you still turning away business how should we think about that? Because it sounds like you got a lot of opportunity customer's knock on your door. Customers calling you looking for aircraft, so it's just a matter of getting your hands on additional feedstock. Am I thinking about that right?\nJoe Hete: Yes in terms of feedstock is still pretty tight again. You can always find an airplane it's just a matter of whether [indiscernible] if you're into service price point, that's always a key driver for us. And as far as turning customers away it's not necessarily a function of turning them away as much as just scheduling out in the process in terms of when an aircraft would be available. So as I said, if we're talking eight to 10 airplanes we don't have them all placed at this point in time with identified customers per se, but so we do have a couple there potentially available. It's just a matter of priorities.\nKevin Sterling: Okay and then last question from me. You guys kind of indicated as we think about EBITDA for 2019 with no growth of $440 million and let me ask a CapEx question if you don't mind for 2019 at least directionally. I think you're going to - you talked about CapEx in 2018 of $280 million, can you give us a guide for how we should think about 2019 CapEx similar to 2018 up or down? I'm not asking anything specific but maybe just directionally how should we think about 2019 CapEx if you don't mind.\nQuint Turner: Yes of course we'll have Omni, Kevin on board next year. So if you think about sort of maintenance CapEx, our business not without Omni historically we've kind of said hey, we're sort of in the $60 million to $70 million annual range for maintenance CapEx and I think Omni if you look at them, they're more like $20 million of maintenance CapEx. They have a fleet an existing fleet which you know depending upon growth opportunities we would look at potentially adding to that and we do think there are some growth opportunities for it but their existing fleet has that maintenance CapEx level. So figure you know $80 million of maintenance CapEx and we talk about eight to 10 airplanes and you know at our sort of all-in cost that we target is sort of that $23 million to $25 million for the 300, so depending upon where land on that eight to 10, you get a pretty good sense of where the CapEx might go next year. It could be up from this year a bit, but I think that reflects the growth opportunities we're seeing in the market.\nKevin Sterling: Quint that's very helpful. Thank you. Gentlemen, thanks for your time this morning. Have a nice weekend.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Your line is now open.\nJack Atkins: So just to piggyback a bit on some of the Kevin's questions there. Rich, I guess if I could direct this towards you for a minute. I mean I guess we're seeing some concern in the market overall around just the direction of [indiscernible] go into maybe 2019 obviously trade concerns are top of mindful folks. But your prepared comments would indicate that, your customers are pretty confident about the direction of their businesses. So could you maybe comment just around in general terms obviously sort of what you're hearing from customers in terms of their outlook for their businesses going into next year. How do you think demand for your asset base trends over the next 12 months?\nRich Corrado: Thanks for the question Jack. We're just as bullish on demand for the assets in 2019 as we were in 2017 and 2018. The market is very strong for this asset class and again, now the asset class lies network operations for integrated express carriers and for e-commerce service providers and that market, you look at some of the macro news in terms of China, US trade situation etc. I mean those are lanes that we don't compete in. and the e-commerce business is still growing significantly and the conversion of the retail and the e-tail is still something that's a growing venture and if you look now, I think it's 9% of the global retail spend as an e-commerce so there's a lot of room for growth in that to continue. So when you look at the macro numbers relates to e-commerce which is driving both the integrators and folks like Amazon and the demand for assets that we're hearing across the board is very strong. The deployments that we've done this year. If you look at them, one was in Asia we're moving some aircraft into the Middle East. We're going to put three more into Europe and then we've put I think eight into the US and so the demand right across the board is very strong and the demand that we're seeing going into 2019 is again strong in all areas of the world.\nJack Atkins: Okay, that's really encouraging to hear. And then I guess along the same line just sort of thinking about it conceptually. You've got quite a number of your assets that are under long-term lease and sounds like that mix is growing and then, with the addition of Omni that principally government driven business there. So I would think that would not be as macro sensitive. So I was just being curios to hear you guys kind of talk about the level of cyclicality that you see in your business. I would think that the way you guys have structured things here. If things were to soften up on a macro perspective you may not see it in your business.\nRich Corrado: That's a good point Jack. If you look, I mean we have - it's been our strategy to focus on the dry lease and portion of the business and look at the all the other things we do in terms of whether we're flying or whether we're maintaining aircraft as value added services on the top of lease to increase the returns we get. So from that perspective, I think we'll have already 5% of our assets 767 assets dry lease and then the number of those of course just double lease back to us and we also fly. So that's been the strategy that we've gone through. But even more than that, if you look at the customers that we dry lease to and also the aircrafts that we fly again it's for the integrators and for network operations. Those are the ones that are lot less sensitive to cyclical demand because when you're servicing a network you have to service all those points in the network you can't all of a sudden not service boise billings or buet [ph] you have to go those, you have to provide service to those areas as part of your network. And so for express care is to downsize their network, it would have to be a significantly long-term impact to the economy that would impact the demand for those services.\nJack Atkins: Okay.\nJoe Hete: Jack keep in mind, on those aircrafts like said over 80% of our 767 fleet will be on long-term dry leases by the time we close out the year. If you look at the Omni acquisition 79% of its DOD business and other 15% is government business and then 15% is in play from a commercial perspective. So if you look across the board in terms of macroeconomic impact, we've immunized the lion share of our book of business.\nJack Atkins: Yes that's definitively the way it seems, that's great to hear. Last question and I'll turn it over, but would just be curious to get an update on the A321 conversion joint venture sort of, where does that stand? We're still targeting the first plan into modification maybe late 2019 or I guess the certification of the modification process?\nJoe Hete: Yes the first airplane we've already cut metal on the first aircraft and so now as you start the whole process of putting the pieces back together. It's a complex issue to deal with and of course one of the things you run into, as well as getting past the FAA. And so what the FAA looks at as you're going through the certification process is, what new things are they looking down the road at and since you're opening the airplane up there, they want you to embody some of those things in there like, in the past we never had to deal with 16G seats in freighters for example, but since they're putting those in passenger aircraft. They want us to do that for the super [indiscernible] areas for example in the aircraft. But all that said we're still targeting the end of 2019 for certification of the first aircraft and going into production in 2020.\nJack Atkins: Okay, that's great. Thank you again for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker: Question to follow-up on the last question. How many aircrafts will you be able to manufacture or convert once the whole process with precision is up and running? Well say 2021, 2022 run rate.\nJoe Hete: The basic matters, how many facilities we can make available for setting up production lines and of course big part of that's going to be driven by what the demand is, if you think about in terms of from a turn time perspective and we haven't nailed that down yet, but if you look at 767 for example a turn time on a conversion for one of those is, 120 days. So your worst case scenario you're going to do three or four aircraft with one line and probably better than that, at the end of the day because you don't have quite as much floor structure to replace on the 321 and then it's just a matter of how many different lines do you want to open up certainly from our perspective we're looking out to say okay what can we anything in our existing facilities. Pemco does the 737 conversion process. They most recently flew the 737-700 for the first time. It's in paint now will be heading over to the Bahrain Air Show and then come back for its final certification flights. So we've always got at least one or two base in Tampa that we can utilize whether it's on 737 basis or the 321. If you remember when we did the Pemco acquisition one of the reasons we did that was because they were well versed in the Airbus product which we didn't have a whole lot of experience with here in Wilmington. If you think on a conservative basis, we could probably produce when we're up to full speed 10 to 15 airplanes a year.\nHelane Becker: Okay, great thank you. And then just on the postal service contract. I guess I missed that you I don't know if it's probably on last quarter's 10-Q and I just missed the contract. When it will be renewed? So that's $2 million of pretax earnings per quarter that you're going to be not having is that's the way to understand that?\nQuint Turner: Helane, it's Quint. The fourth quarter was probably the largest quarter in terms of the postal operations. I mean if you look at it and I went back and looked because we've had these contracts for a number of years and I think in the last few 10-Qs we pointed out, these contracts terminate in September unless renewed we hadn't expected to get renewal and said they, I think they went to sort of a new operator in terms of managing this facilities. The EBITDA production that we've gotten out of the postal operations about the best year we had over the last several was about $5 million annually. Now in the fourth quarter typically you saw in third quarter you saw a little better production from that most of that occurred in those quarters. So in terms of scoping this as far as our EBITDA impact probably about $5 million annually was associated with the postal.\nHelane Becker: Okay and then Omni, so I thought I saw earlier this week you received clearance to regulatory approval to do the acquisition and what's left?\nRich Corrado: We did receive the Hart-Scott-Rodino approval which is the Antitrust piece, we have not received the Department of Transportation approval to go forward at this point in time.\nHelane Becker: Okay.\nRich Corrado: We expect to get that within the coming week and right now targeting if everything goes according to schedule, closing this thing out by the end of next week.\nHelane Becker: Okay, so the way we should think about it is what about eight weeks, what is that seven week-ish of revenue from.\nRich Corrado: Yes, six or seven weeks.\nHelane Becker: Of revenue from right, of this for this year and follow on next year.\nRich Corrado: Yes, ma'am.\nHelane Becker: Got it. Thank you. Okay, well I think everybody else asked my questions. I don't need to re-ask them. So thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Ross with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nDavid Ross: I guess with Omni real quick. You mentioned being maybe a little bit more encouraged or incrementally positive after conversations with management. Can you elaborate on anything new that you've learned since announcing the deal and what made you positive after having those conversations?\nJoe Hete: Well I think talking to folks at Omni obviously since they were in the sales process they were little hamstrong [ph] in terms of being able to add assets into the mix. Right now they're saying there's additional opportunities they've had to pass on from a commercial perspective just because of shortage of assets. Now remember part of the rationale for buying them was synergies and one of the key synergies in there was related to the fact that they operate the 767 and it provides a natural feedstock pipeline potentially i.e. buying new aircraft that don't fit our price target for conversion running them through Omni and then at some point in time later, when the value is been depreciated somewhat putting them into the conversion process. So it's really a function of, there's commercial opportunities that they believe are going unfilled. Obviously feedstock as I meant earlier in one of Kevin's question is, it's still little bit tight from our normal conversion price point, but it doesn't preclude us from looking at an asset that normally wouldn't fit that cost profile to be able to run it in through Omni and allow them to operate from a passenger perspective.\nDavid Ross: And there's additional commercial opportunities to be on the passenger side not the cargo side.\nJoe Hete: Yes, passenger side.\nDavid Ross: And then can you talk about the delays in some of the conversions and the 767 schedule back half of this year? When you're doing a conversion with customer and it's getting delayed? What do they do? If the plan was to put something in the service in October and it doesn't come till December, do they just have to wait. Do they charter a plane for couple months? Do you guys do anything for them in terms of providing aircraft?\nRich Corrado: It's Rich. It's kind of a mixed bag. So some of the customers that are waiting for aircraft they have other aircrafts that they have spares for maintenance coverage that they may be able to just use those to cover [indiscernible] routes or what have you. Sometimes folks are timing a new aircraft delivery because of their maintenance schedule. And they can extend their maintenance schedule a little bit and wait for the aircraft we do some swapping around sometimes where if the delivery is late and the customers can move it to another quarter, we can get back on queue with the other customers and so we try to minimize the impact to customers. But it's really variable depending on what they need it to for. Wet to dry scenario where we start and aircraft and we fly wet until the customer wants it to take a dry lease. Northern Air Cargos are great example of that. They took three aircraft from us between the fourth quarter last year and this year. We're still flying a route for them today as they get their crew component up to speed and so that's another scenario where we would continue to fly and put up and asset to support a customer in the event that they're waiting for aircraft.\nDavid Ross: And when you think about the fleet and the 767-200 that are left in there. How much life do you think they have and how closer do you get the scraping some of them altogether?\nRich Corrado: Well we took one aircraft out of service in mid-year of 2018 and we will begin the part out process at this point in time. Right now based on 50,000 cycle limit before you've got to go into a new maintenance program on the aircraft. We have a second aircraft that's coming up against that 50,000 cycle limit and would be in the second quarter of 2019. So we would end up by the end of the second quarter of 2019 with two of the 200s that are out of service at that point.\nDavid Ross: Excellent. Thank you very much. I'll get back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the Steve O'Hara of Sidoti. Your line is now open.\nSteve O'Hara: Just curious, where there cost around the Omni acquisition in the quarter that weren't called out. I didn't, maybe I missed it. But I don't know if it was anything in there.\nQuint Turner: No, not significantly. I think in the fourth quarter certainly we'll have cost and we'll segregate those as we report, but we'll have some significant transaction fees in the fourth quarter that we'll spike out.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay and then just if you look at CAM, I guess I'm just I know there's some delays and some I think maintenance within the quarter. But I guess with seven more aircraft and I guess I'm just a little surprised the pre-tax wasn't up a little more or maybe the revenue wasn't a little higher. And I'm just wondering is that going, maybe the aircraft rate added late in the quarter. I mean you did note it, kind of operationally the tough quarter but I would think that will be on the ACMI side. I guess when do you start to see maybe better pre-tax income growth and relative to aircraft additions. And then looking at ACMI, how far away from the typical range that you've given in the past are we now from that given the higher pilot with ATI and then is that just something that corrects over time, where new contracts are kind of including higher pilot cost, as those contracts come up for renewal. The industry is going up, you guys are going up and that kind of corrects itself. Can you just go through that? Thank you.\nJoe Hete: Sure. Steve of course as we've mentioned in terms of the third quarter we had anticipated I think three leases starting during the quarter and those push into the fourth quarter. So as far as CAM and growth in the CAM results, revenues and margins. Those will occur as we add aircraft into the mix which we'll have five online new ones by the end of the fourth quarter and then of course we've given some guidance about eight to 10 additional tails next year. CAM is also impacted by these lease transitions that Rich mentioned where you have to enter up CAM's revenue flow to pull an aircraft out and ready it for a delivery to a SE, external SE under a long-term lease. He mentioned I think that we've got a couple aircraft that are going to be placed. I think one for five years another for seven years with external SEs, but to do that we pull those out, we have to send those through the MRO and as that short-term pain and long-term gain. I mean we get very, we get attractive returns and we get certain [indiscernible] multi-year deployments by doing that and that can, in a given quarter that can impact how CAM's results look but again it's a long-term, a better scenario. We're still targeting the same kind of returns on our deployments that we always have and I think you're familiar with that in terms of our ROIC that we target for those on a levered basis and so I would continue to expect that as we go forward.\nQuint Turner: ACMI front, obviously as we noted after we got an agreement with the ATI pilots it's about $2.2 million quarter impact this year. The contracts under which the ATI guys fly today and essentially didn't have escalators in there that would allow us to recouped those costs. And so until such time that you get to where you can rebid the contract to cover those additional cost. It's something it's going to come off of our bottom-line that we're going to have to deal with. So when you look at the ACMI results obviously on a year-to-year comparison much better this year than they were last year in spite of the fact that we do have that additional cost and our cost structure for the ATI pilots at this point in time. And of course as we go forward we'll be looking to try to recouped those costs from our customers we'll only go through a rebid process.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay and then maybe just on the pilot situation and then kind of I guess indexing contract. I mean is there more if it is to do that on your side today than maybe it was - there was maybe five to 10 years ago given concerns about pilot shortages and things like that. It seems like the pilot shortages is likely a real thing and eventually it comes home and I think attracting pilots obviously important you guys I think do a good job attracting them and keeping them. But it would seem like part of the cost are bound to go up overtime and I'm wondering if there's more pressure on you guys, where you guys are putting more pressure on customers to kind of create a contract where you don't have this lag between rising cost on the pilot side and then getting the benefit back in the contract.\nJoe Hete: Yes in an ideal world, you would certainly like to see something like that Steve, but from a customer perspective obviously a pushback is going to be something, one something that's more well defined and known going forward because they have to price their business and their customers in the end. So from the standpoint of at least on the ATI side, we know where our cost structure needs to be as we go through rebid processes for the next four years. The AVX contract is still in negotiations, where that falls out when we finally get a contract. Certainly it's not going to be before the end of 2018 and so we'll look for 2019 to get there. But it's just one of those things that you have to deal with in the business and we're not alone in that respect. There are competitors out there either have contracts and had to swallow some of the same cost as we do and or they haven't got us collected bargaining agreement yet and we'll have to deal with that increased cost when it comes.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from [indiscernible]. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just a sort of question, sort of bigger picture question. In terms of your business and I guess that what I would perceive and I'm curios how you perceive the connect between the market and your business and prospects. Your stock as you're probably aware is hovering at a new 52-week low yet the market was little sloppy in October, but it seems to me you guys sort of get grouped into a very cyclical sort of business number one and number two possibly painted with some trade concerns as you generally trade what is viewed to be a comparable that list and I just want to know sort of generally how you feel about that. But putting it in a little bigger context with $455 million in EBITDA if we include the eight to 10 plane that you're incorporating into the incremental mix next year, it looks to me like you've got possibly $300 million in free cash flow I guess before the add of those planes sort of just utilizing maintenance CapEx so it's four and change $5 per share in free cash flow. Do you envision redirect or is it - do you think at some point you get aggressive and you reposition yourself to more so focused on the stock? The shareholder return that would provide and I have one follow-up, after you fill that. Thank you.\nQuint Turner: Thanks Howard. It's Quint. Certainly we're excited about with the addition of Omni, what the cash flow production looks like for next year. And I think recently Joe talked about not only the five aircraft coming out in the fourth quarter but that the eight to 10 next year other than I think Joe mentioned there's a couple they're still available as we always try to have a couple that we can fill customer's quick need for. We have very high confidence level about where those placements are going next year. And so we think that the things look very bright in terms of what we can produce and I think Omni acquisition has been discussed is something that in terms of adding us a nice stable cash flow contributor into the mix and diversifying the revenue stream is also seen as a really good thing. In terms of how we think about capital allocation. You mentioned we get lumped in with other things and certainly the tariff discussion we do get that question a lot and I think you and I have talked about that before, we don't feel that there's an impact with where our assets go that is significant at all for the tariff piece or the trade talks. As you know our mid-sized assets go into the e-commerce driven regional network structure and now many are deployed or will be deployed with VOD. So we feel really good about that and don't feel that will be a real problem for us. As far as capital allocation towards looking at our stock. We're going to first close the transaction with Omni here shortly and for a time as one of our bank provisions there will be some limitation. Our leverage ratio at close is estimated to be around 3.4 times inclusive of Omni's EBITDA contribution and I think we have to be under three times after giving effect to any stock buyback or dividend type capital distribution before we would be free to do that under our current bank deal. So it probably be sometime later in 2019 before that would be an available option, but certainly as we always do we look at what brings most value to our shareholders and depending upon where our stock was trading absolutely that's a viable option for us in the mix, along with our growth opportunities.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. I appreciate that. I hope you'll look at the more aggressively. But the follow-on question I had concerns the to your smaller businesses you and I have spoken offline about sort of the ACMI not being part of the CAM business. I always feel like it's a semi-loss leader and you'll suggest no it's really a standalone, but I'd like to discuss the potential briefly just if could provide some color on both the ACMI and I didn't hear the answer to Helane questions or maybe that was leading but could you give us some color on what sort of potential is for MRO when you get the approval for start dealing with the Airbus fleet and where that can go? Thank you.\nJoe Hete: From a margin perspective both the businesses ACMI and MRO are probably single-digit type margins, but the businesses themselves complement the leasing piece very strong. I mean our two largest lease customers DHL and Amazon also avail themselves of the operating capabilities of our airlines. And of course our airlines are very really have grown up serving the very business that those guys concentrate on which at expedited delivery piece and so that is something that has been worked really well for us. It also gives us the capability most pure leasing companies don't have and that's to take an asset that would otherwise be idle and generate cash flow through having our own affiliate airline operated on an ACMI basis. So from a cash flow perspective they've certainly been contributors and on a margin basis you're looking at a single-digit type margin that we look for in the ACMI piece. On the MRO piece it's very similar, lease transitions that Rich mentioned earlier can be handled seamlessly and both of our largest customers also use our MRO to take care of the assets they lease in terms of their heavy maintenance. So it's really a value added service that just fits well with our leasing business.\nUnidentified Analyst: I'm not asking you to quantify and I'm just trying to get any sort of sense as to what your investment is, what your return can be, where are in particular the MRO can go when you get Airbus approval? I'd like to think that there could be I understand there's single-digit margins, but I don't understand the associated top line that one could get with let's just the say the MRO in particular when you have Airbus, reap benefits 2021 or something.\nJoe Hete: Howard as far as the Airbus goes, we don't have a finished product yet. So I mean first and foremost is going to be what does the finished product look like? Right? How much of that is going to be installation labor which is where the MRO would come in versus the material that it takes to completed the modification carve the cargo door and things of that nature. We're not far enough along the track to be able to give you any kind of number in that regard. And keep in mind at the same time we're limited by the capacity in our hangars. So it's not like you can just stuff a whole bunch of airplanes in there and generate more bottom line dollar because the floor space is limited to a degree. So the MRO piece unless you go out and start investing or leasing new facilities, you're not going to see there's a growth vehicle but certainly it is critical to support of our leasing business as Quint mentioned and there are opportunities in the future both from a conversion standpoint which is nice to have because it's cookie cutter, roll an airplane in, it's a same work, you don't run into any unexpected things. But at the end of the day, you know it's not that the MRO business is not capitalize intensive. It's basically a people oriented business just like anything from a logistic perspective. So when you talk about returns anything you get is a good return because the initial investment is pretty de minimis.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you so much and good luck with the Omni and it sounds like you have a bright future. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris S of Susquehanna Financial.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So just if you could walk us through the procurement process here for the plane? So you've secured the rights for that was in eight to 10 now what you've taken up the low end there. So does this mean that - there's an economic liability for ATSG attached to these or do you wait to put a deposit if you will once you had a formal contract in place with customers.\nJoe Hete: Chris I think we've guide in our release with that fleet summary five aircraft so that will be in process in our waiting conversion at the end of 2018. So let's think about as five of the eight to 10. So that would say, there would be three to five others that we would need to find to round out next year's what we've talked about as fleet additions. Typically until you accept the airplane, there's isn't whole lot of capital that's expended. You may put down a small deposit just to secure the airplane, but any liability or significant outlet of cash doesn't occur until such time as you actually accept physical airplane.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay and of the five, you mentioned here you have formal agreements with customers or you're close.\nJoe Hete: We're close.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: You're close. Okay. And then on the Omni call, was it few weeks back you spoke about the sort of the shift in revenue where DHL and Amazon were around 57% of revenue or about 29% each and now there are 18%, 10% and you said for now. And then in your opening remarks you spoke about additional color on ways to enhance shareholder value back in 2019. In January so, given where we are with the higher leverage constraints which Quint alluded to before, how should we think about capital allocation going forward. Is it - are you suggesting that we could go back kind of looking at more e-commerce leveraged opportunity or you considering a step up in buybacks. Thanks.\nJoe Hete: Well I think Chris we spoke to buybacks earlier. I think what we said was first the board has approved buyback program and while that can be temporarily effected by our covenants in the bank agreement after the Omni acquisition, that's always a viable option for us depending on what the full range of growth opportunities look like. If growth opportunities are out there I we typically do lean that way because if we don't move on them then you lose that opportunity perhaps forever because someone else will take that. You spoke about the Omni impact on a revenue mix as you pointed out. It does and I think when we announced the deal in early October. We had a slide that went with that announcement where we gave first half 2018 revenue mix and a proforma first half revenue mix and it does have significant diversification impact on us. For example, I think in the first half of the year Amazon was 29% of the revenue. DHL was 28%. On a proforma basis, those numbers would go to 19% for Amazon and 18% for DHL with the DOD becoming the largest single piece along with our current 757 Combi's to be about a third of our overall revenue. SO it does do a nice job of diversifying the revenue stream.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay and follow-up [indiscernible] and apologies if you mentioned this before but could you give an update on labor with ABX and if that's any type of markup is included in the preliminary 2019 guidance. Thanks.\nQuint Turner: As far as ABX goes we're still under the auspice of the National Mediation Board. There were meetings held Wednesday and Thursday of this week with the union to discuss further moving the ball down the [indiscernible] field as far as the contract goes no we have not, in terms of talk about the 440, yes we have not put in factored in anything from specifically really to the pilot side of the equation. Obviously there will be a lot of fine tuning in terms of what our guidance will be for 2019 which will elaborate fully on come of the year end results announcements which will be at the end of February.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Ross with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nDavid Ross: I'm all good, questions asked. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions we have for today. I will hand the call back over to Joe Hete for any closing remarks.\nJoe Hete: Thanks Nicole. This year's third quarter was our best ever, even if it feel short of our goals. We've redoubled our efforts to make the fourth quarter a strong one as we complete our Omni Air acquisition and meet our 767 deployment targets. Thanks to everyone for joining us on the call. Have a quality day and don't forget to vote next Tuesday.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Capital Christopher Hillary \u2013 Roubaix Capital\nOperator: Welcome to the Q2 2018 Air Transport Services Group, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Vanessa and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Joe Hete, President and CEO.\nJoe Hete: Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Quint Turner, our Chief Financial Officer and Rich Corrado, our Chief Operating Officer. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It\u2019s on our website, atsginc.com. We will file our Form 10-Q later this week. In the second quarter and first half of 2018, we made steady progress toward our goals for the year. Our revenues for the quarter were up 6%, excluding reimbursables. Earnings per share increased 38% on an adjusted basis, and adjusted EBITDA rose 9%. We\u2019re halfway toward our target of an additional 10 767s modified and placed in service this year, and we\u2019ve secured more feedstock aircraft that will bring us to five 767s for deployment in 2019. Quint is standing by to summarize our financial results for the second quarter. Rich will add a few words on our operations, and I\u2019ll close with some perspective on our outlook. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Joe, and thanks to all of you on the call for joining us this morning. As always, I\u2019ll start, by saying that during the course of this call we will make projections or other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call and Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include but are not limited to, changes in market demand for our assets and services; our operating airline\u2019s ability to maintain on-time service and control costs; the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration; fluctuations in ATSG\u2019s traded share price, which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments; the number, timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers; and other factors as contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-Q we will file this week. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG\u2019s financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials, and we advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website. As Joe said, our second quarter earnings were on track with our targets, led by continued growth at CAM, our leasing business, and at ACMI Services, which was again profitable for the quarter. On a consolidated basis, second quarter revenues were $203 million, which is lower than the prior year only because of our adoption of new revenue recognition standards under Topic 606. Excluding the revenue associated with reimbursed expenses in 2017, our second quarter revenues increased 6%. On a GAAP basis, we have second quarter earnings from continuing operations of $24.5 million versus a loss of $53.9 million a year ago. On a diluted basis, GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.21 versus a loss of $0.91 a year ago. The quarterly mark-to-market revaluation of our liability for warrants issued to Amazon resulted in a $10.4 million after-tax gain in the second quarter as our stock price dipped. The comparable mark-to-market adjustment for the warrant liability in the second quarter of last year was negative $63.4 million, when our stock price increased for the quarter. The related lease amortization incentive, also tied to the Amazon warrants, this quarter was $3.3 million or a $0.05 a share after tax. Our share of cost to develop a freighter version of the Airbus A321-200 with precision was a $1.9 million or $0.03 a share item after tax. We launched the venture a year ago, so there was no comparable item in our second quarter 2017 results. Adjusted for those items, our adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.28 diluted for the second quarter, $0.07 higher than a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA of $69.7 million increased $5.6 million or 9% from second quarter last year. We have generated a $141.6 million in adjusted EBITDA for the first half, 46% of our full year target of $310 million. Joe will cover a few items in his comments about our second half outlook shortly. As we have mentioned before, our GAAP and adjusted earnings this year now include a non-cash charge to interest expense of about $1.6 million, $0.02 per share each quarter. This is associated with the convertible feature of the notes we issued last September. Our adjusted EPS do not excluded because the charge amortizes ratably over the seven-year term of those notes. You may have noted in our release that results for our MRO Services business were down for the quarter. Rich will cover the operating factors, but as was the case in the first quarter, adoption of new revenue recognition rules also had a significant impact on MRO Services competitive results. Starting this year, we now record revenues for bigger projects like heavy maintenance and aircraft modification as tasks are completed. Prior to this year, revenues and related earnings were typically recorded in large amounts when work was completed, and the aircraft was delivered back to the customer. We expect the new revenue recognition rules to lessen volatility in the reported results of our MRO businesses. We ended the first half with $150 million of capital spending, up slightly from a year ago and right at the midpoint of our $300 million projected spend for the full year 2018. We spent $116.6 million to buy four 767-300 passenger aircraft and to fund freighter modification of those and other aircraft. Capitalized heavy maintenance was $19.3 million, and we spent $14.9 million mostly for engines and rotable parts. We still expect the 2018 CapEx spend of about $300 million primarily to acquire and modify more 767s for our growing list of dry-lease customers. Even with our strong fleet development program, we remain considerably leveraged with a high percentage of low cost fixed rate debt, thanks largely to our 108%, $259 million note offering we did last fall. About 80% of our debt principal is effectively at a fixed rate with an average coupon under 3%. Our debt leverage remains near the 2 times trailing adjusted EBITDA mark. Our revolver balance at June 30 was $257 million with a capacity of up to $545 million. That\u2019s the summary of our overall financial results for the quarter. Rich is ready to discuss our segment results and market perspective. Rich?\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint. From an operating perspective, the second quarter was another strong one, as we delivered more aircraft to more customers and both of our airlines showed improved revenues and earnings. We experienced the anticipated decline in flying versus first quarter, as our largest customers again shifted out of peak season mode into the second quarter. CAM, our leasing company, stepped up its deployment pace by leasing four additional 767s and one 737 in the second quarter versus one 767 in the first quarter. Significantly the five leases were with five different customers: Amerijet, Northern Air Cargo, Air Incheon, West Atlantic and CAM\u2019s sister airline ATI. We have prospects in several key geographies around the world that could diversify our customer base even further in the future as well as the demand more aircraft from current customer such as Air Incheon. As Joe said, CAM has commitments from customers eager to lease our 767-300 as they become ready. We will remain in the market for more 767 passenger feedstock to meet 2019 demand. We have thus far secured rights to five 300s for 2019 deployment, but that number is likely to increase in the coming months. CAM had a good quarter with pretax earnings of $15.4 million, 20% better than a year ago. Additional earnings from our larger leased fleet were again offset by increases in the lease incentives to Amazon. ACMI Services on a pretax basis earned $1 million in the second quarter, an improvement of $0.3 million from a year ago. The earnings increase would have been greater apart from the labor agreement amendment ATI computed with its pilots in late March. It yielded pay increases for those pilots, which increased expense by $2.2 million for the quarter. Our airlines operated two more 767s during the quarter than they did last year, and block hours for our ACMI and CMI operations increased 5%. Service performance was strong and continues into the third quarter. We continue to get high marks for positive service performance from our customers across all of our businesses. In the second half, we expect aircraft block hour utilization to ramp up, especially during peak season. MRO services, which includes the results of our aircraft maintenance and conversion businesses, had earnings of $1.3 million for the quarter, a decline from a year ago. Apart from the revenue recognition factors Quint mentioned, we were up against very strong results from our AIMs maintenance and PEMCO conversion businesses in the prior year quarter. AEMS lined up a large contract with good margins from an airline customer a year ago, and PEMCO, our aircraft conversion business, completed three 737 modifications in the second quarter last year versus one this year. We expect better year-over-year performance from those businesses in the second half. Results from other activities, which this year include Gateway ground operations, postal center management services and material handling equipment support, nearly doubled to $2.7 million on pretax earnings basis. Results from our minority investment in West Atlantic were stronger and volumes from our mail sorting and package handling operations were higher than a year ago. As we said in our earnings release, our logistics even has begun serving Amazon\u2019s Gateway needs in Tampa, and could add other locations if the opportunity arises. I\u2019m confident we can accelerate our earnings in the second half and especially during what looks like to be a busy peak season for our air express operators. With that, I will turn it back over to Joe.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Rich. I mentioned at the offset that the customers continue to have strong interest in the 767 converted freighters we are modifying this year, including the five we deployed in the first half plus one 737. We now expect to deliver two more 767 this quarter and the rest in the four. In 2017, we spent about the same amount to acquire, convert and deliver nine 767s and one 737, including four that went to customers other than Amazon. We own all the five remaining 767-300 in mod for deployment later this year. We have customer commitments for three of them and are finalizing agreements with the other two. We told you in May that we are actively pursuing additional feedstock supply to meet 2019 demand, and during the second quarter, we secured three more. Most of you have seen the industry data from ACMG and Boeing that point to midsize freighters as the sweet spot of the industry going forward, as e-commerce market see them as keys to a balanced air network frequency incapacity. More and more airlines here and overseas are interested in the efficiency and reliability the midsize wide-body, the narrow-body freighters offer. Their concerns as we are about the tight supply at a time when they want to provide e-commerce driven express market with service levels that 767s deliver. For now, conversion source lessors and ACMI operators like us for the primary source of dedicated 767 freighters. And we are by far the world\u2019s largest with 63 of them in service today and five more on the way. Our knowledge of the market and our long relationships with the passenger airlines operating in the 767s today, will help us remain number one for some time to come. At the same time, we are pressing ahead with our JV partner precision toward FAA approval for a converted freighter variant of the A321. We will invest to provide A321s to express networks customers that need a narrow-body complement to the 767 with capacity similar to a Boeing 757-200 with operating cost closer to the 737. We intend to stick to our practice of focusing our great service for customers today as we prepare for tomorrow. We are reaffirming that our target remains $310 million in adjusted EBITDA for the year. In the first half of this year, we have delivered about the same percentage of adjusted EBITDA as we did in the same period last year. With the robust air cargo market and stronger economy pointing toward a very busy peak season, we look forward to the challenge, and we will update you on our progress when we meet again in November. That concludes our prepared remarks, Venessa. We are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Hey, good morning guys, thanks for taking my questions here.\nJoe Hete: Good morning, Jack.\nRich Corrado: Good morning.\nJack Atkins: So I guess first question for either Joe or Rich, listening to the prepared comments, reading the press release yesterday, Joe, I\u2019ve picked up on something you said towards the end of your prepared comments. You sort of stay tuned for more feedstock purchases over the next couple of months. I guess, as you guys are thinking about 2019 at this point. I mean, how should we be thinking about the number of planes that you think you can put into service next year, whether you want to think about in terms of feedstock availability and conversion availability or the customer appetite and demand? Can you kind of help us think through the potential as you see it for 2019 deployment at this point?\nJoe Hete: Yes, I think from 2019 perspective, Jack, is I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got five of them already in the queue so to speak. Conversion slots are available for more at this point in time. We continue to pursue other available aircraft from a feedstock perspective to put through the conversion process. So it\u2019s safe to say that somewhere between 6 and 10 airplanes at least into service next year with 767 type.\nJack Atkins: Okay.\nJoe Hete: From a customer perspective, I\u2019ll let Rich pickup that one.\nRich Corrado: The demand is very strong. We\u2019ve got existing customers that have noted that they\u2019re looking at adding increased aircraft next year. We are talking to operators in Europe, South America, Africa, a couple in North America, so \u2013 and existing customers, new airlines. So we\u2019ve got very strong demand for the remainder of the year into 2019.\nJack Atkins: So Rich, just to kind of sum it up, I mean, the demand is there to place to Joe\u2019s point 6 to 10 at least aircraft in service next year. You don\u2019t see any reason that that would that be a problem?\nRich Corrado: No. I mean, if you look at the feedstock question, that\u2019s probably \u2013 as far as the market goes, the pacing item, we\u2019ve got some good feedstock locked up early for next year. We are talking to a couple of different airlines now. As we\u2019ve said many times in these calls, we take a very different approach to feedstock and that were constantly in the market for it. And we have relationships with the airlines that currently run 767 passenger fleets. And so we\u2019ve got a good eye on aircraft coming available in 2019, 2020 and 2021. And so we think that hitting a number \u2013 that 10 number is not going to be that much of a stretch.\nJack Atkins: Okay, that\u2019s really encouraging to hear. Kind of shifting gears to here to another announcement in the press release, which was this Amazon logistic support services in Tampa. Can you kind of walk us through how \u2013 what you\u2019re going to be doing in Tampa is different than what you\u2019re doing for Amazon or some of the other gateway airports across the country? And is that a potential incremental opportunity for you guys with Amazon kind of going forward whether if they are expanding their dots on the map or just opportunity for guys to take more of that business in-house? Can you kind of walk us through that?\nRich Corrado: Yes. So Jack, when we ramped up the network, starting at the end of 2015 going in through today, we managed all of the initial gateways up to the first 12. And the way we handle that as we contracted the ramp work and we contracted the warehouse sorting and breakdown and loading of the aircraft. So we would hire contracted airports, we would negotiate with the airport for ramp space. We would secure the ground service equipment, the loading equipment, et cetera, et cetera. So we\u2019re kind of like a general contractor, if you will, for these gateway operations. Tampa was an opportunity that came up. That was the one that we were managing the contractors for and that was under our cost plus contract as the other gateways are. And due to some quality improvements that Amazon wanted we propose to take that gateway over ourselves, and we had a history with Amazon of operating the hub here in Wilmington, and we \u2013 they view that as a high functioning operation. And so they gave us a short at the Tampa facility, which we\u2019ve been implementing over June and July, and it\u2019s going very well. So that new contract, if you will, is a direct contract with logistics, our service provider. And so it\u2019s no longer a cost plus. We have to operate and hire and train and produce all the equipment, do all the things directly. And so it\u2019s a good opportunity for us to grow the business. As we\u2019ve noted a couple of times with the 606 transition on the accounting basis this year, those cost plus gateways and the revenue was looked out as reimbursable and was netted out from the revenue perspective. And so this also in converting the Tampa from a contracted side to a direct employee and manage side, that full revenue now is growth for us this year.\nJoe Hete: The other side of that Jack is part of our leasing portfolios is the ground-support equipment, so to speak, K loaders, dollies, things of that nature. So do we have a burgeoning business there in terms of being able to lease in the ground-support equipment, whether it\u2019s directly or to one of these third-party providers that we manage today.\nJack Atkins: Okay, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful color. Last question, I\u2019ll turn it over. With the A321 program, at what point should we be thinking about you guys looking to maybe sort of acquiring some feedstock for conversion? I know the certification isn\u2019t expected to be complete until later next year. But is that \u2013 should we be expecting \u2013 if we\u2019re thinking about the CapEx requirements for 2019, should you guys to be looking to maybe acquire some of that feedstock in advance for certification? Or is that really more of an early 2020 event?\nJoe Hete: We may grab a couple of aircraft in the latter part of 2019, Jack. Right now, it\u2019s just a matter of what the higher priority. If you got a customer looking for a 767 and that\u2019s where we need to immediately to deploy our capital, we\u2019ll do that point. But certainly, we\u2019ll keep our eyes peeled for any potential what we would consider to be a good purchase price for A321 feedstock aircraft.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Thanks again for the time this morning, guys.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Jack.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Jack.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.\nHelane Becker: Hi. Thanks, operator. Hi, gentlemen. Thank you for the time. So just a couple of questions. As you think about \u2013 one point of clarification first is, when you talked about the multi-year placements in the press release, can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in that market? Is it multi years for many customers, multi-year for one customer? How should we think about that?\nJoe Hete: Yes. So it\u2019s multi-year for several customers. And we\u2019ve offered customers that are looking for multiple aircraft. In terms of lease rates; those smaller operators, if you will, generally come under higher lease rate, just doing the credit risk versus our largest customers. But it\u2019s really a split. And we\u2019ve got existing customers that are also looking for additional aircraft.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then just with respect to your incentives that you have to pay for Amazon. Are those numbers included in revenue as a net number? Or are they somewhere in the expense line? How should I be thinking about that?\nQuint Turner: They\u2019re recorded as reduction to revenue, Helane. So you can see that in one of the attachments in the earnings release. You can see where we show the revenue and then we show the reduction related to the incentive coming out of that to net.\nHelane Becker: Right. Okay. So, I mean, when you think about those incentives, are they significantly more than you would want to pay in contracts going forward? Or when that contract comes up for renewal, is it something you would want to renew?\nQuint Turner: Well, those are related to the warrants we issued to Amazon. Those are valued based on the number of warrants and there\u2019s a calculation that goes into that. Since all of those are in there, you\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s the same amount each quarter now $4.2 million. And they\u2019re tied specifically to, as you know, the 20 aircraft deal that we did.\nHelane Becker: Okay, thanks. And then just one last question on the pilot. Any progress on the open contract?\nJoe Hete: We\u2019ve \u2013 the teams met last week, Helane, with the federal mediator. And I think they\u2019re scheduled again to meet at latter part of September as well. There was some progress made at the last session, which is a bit different than the prior sessions that we\u2019ve had this year. So things are moving up a bit. We\u2019d like to see it move at a quicker pace, but the reality is you\u2019ve got to do what makes good sense for everybody involved, not just what makes best sense for the crew members themselves, but also for the company and the shareholders.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Those are all my questions. Thank you.\nJoe Hete: All right, thanks, Helane.\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Ross with Stifel.\nDavid Ross: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen.\nJoe Hete: Hi, David.\nRich Corrado: Hi, David.\nDavid Ross: Can you talk a little bit about the 767s that were returned during the quarter? You got a couple back. Where those coming off of lease? And if so, how much notice do you get at the end of the customers lease term, whether they\u2019re going to keep it, renew, turn it back in?\nJoe Hete: Yes. So we had two release returns for the quarter. One is actually in the hangar now being prepped for another customer. So we\u2019ll return that around. Generally when we take aircraft back, depending on whether the operator had a return condition C check that they did or whether they\u2019re relying on our MRO to do it. But we\u2019re flipping that aircraft to another customer in the third quarter. It\u2019s a 767-200. We had another return from a customer that is sitting on the ramp right now, it\u2019s waiting some space in the hangar that we can get it and prep it. And we do have multiple customers interested in the 767. That\u2019s a 767-200 as well. Generally speaking, the customers that have aircraft are coming upon return. Within a year they generally, we get into discussions about whether they\u2019re going to extend or keep. We\u2019ve just extended cargo jets that go 1,200 left. We just extended that through next year, and they\u2019re talking about extending it for another C check cycle after that. We are talking with another 200 customer today about extending their due for return in February, and they\u2019re looking to extend that for another C check cycle, another 18 months. So generally, you \u2013 right about a year before, they\u2019re about to return. You get into some level of discussion. We like a minimum of six months to know we kind of cut it off at that point and figure we\u2019re going to get it back because we can\u2019t let these things hang out until couple of months before the lease deadline and not have a customer ready to go for the aircraft.\nDavid Ross: So I guess, that\u2019s why you\u2019re able to redeploy it so quickly is because you know it was coming back once before it was turned in?\nJoe Hete: Right. Most of the returns that we are seeing now that are on the schedule or 767-200s and there\u2019s really a strong market for the 200. Obviously, it\u2019s lower in cost than the 300. And so we\u2019re seeing a pretty strong market for the 200s at this point. And it\u2019s just a matter of finding the hangar space. Now when we\u2019re releasing those aircraft into a foreign airline \u2013 foreign country aviation authority, you tend to have to do a little bit more to the airframe, make sure the records are correct. And we spend a little bit more time on those. And so it \u2013 when we have a return, generally, we\u2019re going to need a little bit more time than you would otherwise, if you\u2019re going to redeploy it into to the United States.\nDavid Ross: Any other is expected to come back this year?\nJoe Hete: No. None this year, not till February next year.\nDavid Ross: Okay. And then on the ACMI side, margins fell back closer to breakeven again in the second quarter after having a couple of good quarters. We know there was a $3 million headwind from the ATI contract. How should we think about that margin going through the end of this year and into the next year?\nJoe Hete: Well, a lot of it is driven by amount of hours flown. For example, and just as we saw last year, coming off of first quarter transitioning into the second quarter, our largest customer had a rejiggers or schedules, so it\u2019s not \u2013 no longer called a peak season schedule, so we see a reduction in the block hours. So if you look at first quarter to the second quarter, for example, there is about 5% decline in the overall block hours. That will probably tick up a little bit in the third quarter and then, of course, fourth quarter during peak season is going to come on pretty strong. So if you see the results about the slightly better in the third quarter than the second and then the market improvement going into the fourth quarter.\nDavid Ross: Okay. This sounds like aside from any maintenance cost issues. 4Q should be the strongest margin followed by 1Q due to the peak and then 2Q and 3Q are on the lower side.\nJoe Hete: Yes.\nDavid Ross: All right. And then the JV with Precision, the $1.9 million cost that you cited in the quarter; is that in any of the segments looking at the margins for ACMI or CAM?\nRich Corrado: Yes. It\u2019s shown below the line, Dave, as a non-operating entity; and so, no.\nDavid Ross: Okay. Excellent. Thank you.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Dave.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Dave.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kevin Sterling with Seaport Global Securities.\nKevin Sterling: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.\nJoe Hete: Hi, Kevin.\nRich Corrado: Hi, Kevin.\nKevin Sterling: Rich, the five 767s you guys bought in the quarter, were those all bought at once or they separate kind of one-off purchases?\nRich Corrado: They were two separate purchases, so two different operators or three in a two.\nKevin Sterling: Okay. Are you seeing \u2013 you talked a little bit about feedstock and opportunity for 2019. Are you seeing more, I guess, planes bundled together like that? Or is this just more kind of ones, twos, if you will?\nRich Corrado: Well, we always try to find a line of aircraft. The majority of our existing 767-300 fleet is an example is either ex-Qantas or ex-American. And we\u2019ve got a handful of other aircrafts that we have opportunistically acquired. And so we are going forward. We are hoping to get significant lines secured over multiple years, if you will. That\u2019s the most productive way to do it. It\u2019s also the highest quality way. If you look at the aircraft that we produced when we can get a consistent feedstock level than the conversion and the work that we do to the aircraft in terms of upgrading the avionics and some other things, we produce a very consistent quality conversion. When you get aircrafts that are one-off aircraft from different airlines and you try to \u2013 when you put those up, you\u2019re going to get some inconsistencies and you\u2019re going to get some quality differences. So we feel that the way we approach the market, given it\u2019s our core business, is the best way, not only from a cost perspective, but also from a quality perspective in the product that we produce.\nKevin Sterling: Got you. Got you. Okay. And then you also touched on what you guys are doing for Amazon on the logistics side. Did they put out an RFP for that to other potential competitors? Or did they just come to you guys and say, we want to convert from a contracted side to employee side? How did \u2013 or did you guys approached them? Just curious how that went down.\nRich Corrado: Well, generally, I can\u2019t comment what their policies are. But generally, every opportunity that we\u2019ve gotten from them, we\u2019ve had to go through some type of RFP bid. So even when we\u2019re the \u2013 we feel we are the best solution and we are positioned best for it, they still put you in a competitive position, it\u2019s just the way that they approach the market.\nKevin Sterling: Yes, okay. And last question. As you develop your logistics capabilities and your gateway service capabilities, thinking outside of Amazon, could there maybe some more opportunities with other customers potentially kind of to do that will perform those logistics services with other customers\u2026\nRich Corrado: Yes, I mean, it\u2019s a good question, Kevin. I mean, if you look \u2013 just look at our experience with the Postal Service, I mean, we\u2019ve get five operations with them. Three large postal centers we\u2019ve had for over a decade. And so we are experts at this. We\u2019ve maintained that level of expertise from the old airborne days when we \u2013 and initial DHL days, when we were running the large hub here and running 19 regional sort centers. So from a logistic standpoint, we still got a core of very talented management and logistics folks to be able to do that. On top of that, our logistics company, if you will, also has expertise in material handling equipment, in terms of designing sort centers, in terms of understanding how to design flow-through building, whether it\u2019s a tight operation on an airport, or whether it\u2019s a large facility for large sewer process. So we are always in the market for looking for those types of opportunities. They\u2019re not really prevalent. But both in terms of running those facilities, but also in terms of doing the MHE installation, management and maintenance support logistics or logistics company has a good business in that segment.\nKevin Sterling: Okay. Well, that\u2019s all I had this morning. Gentlemen, thanks so much for the free time.\nJoe Hete: Yes. Thanks, Kevin.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve O\u2019Hara with Sidoti & Company.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Hi, good morning.\nJoe Hete: Hi, Steve.\nRich Corrado: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Just on the 767-300\u2019s projected for year-end, it looks like it dropped one from last quarter. And I thought last quarter, there were some \u2013 one that its slipped, the purchasing, it slipped a little bit in terms \u2013 because of the, I guess, the operator was still using it longer than expected. Did another one slipped? Or is that just kind of the common \u2013 something else happened?\nJoe Hete: No, we did have one, Steve. I think we\u2019ve commented on last quarter that Cargojet had an option to purchase the aircraft after the three years through the lease terms and we ended up-selling it to them in the second quarter.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay, okay. And was there gain or loss on that? Or is that\u2026\nRich Corrado: There were small, Steve. It was, I don\u2019t know \u2013 that was not a\u2026\nJoe Hete: Not a driver.\nRich Corrado: Not a driver or anything.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay, that\u2019s fine. And then just on the ACMI charter aircraft, it looks like you\u2019re winding that down a little bit, maybe a little bit more. I guess, you had more in June 30 than you did at March 30 or March 31. What\u2019s your sweet spot there? I mean, how would you like to get that down to? And does that allow you to flex for customer who wants additional aircraft? Or is that more set capacity used elsewhere?\nJoe Hete: So Steve, we look at the ACMI charter business in a couple of ways. Obviously, we\u2019ve got a large CMI business with our two key customers and we have other long-term ACMI customers that we like to get the longer term ACMI contracts. The most important piece of what we do is our Wet2Dry program, and that\u2019s where we initially put up a web lease for a customers, with an eye on and constant discussions towards that customer taking over their own aircraft, it\u2019s starting to build their own fleet. We\u2019ve been very successful for that model, just about all of our customers to date. We were initially flying in an ACMI environment, and then they went to a either or dry lease or dry lease plus the CMI with us. And so we want to maintain a certain amount of aircraft that we have that flexibility to do so we can put up an aircraft and look towards building the leasing business on the back-end of that relationship.\nQuint Turner: Keep in mind Steve, on the ACMI segment, we have the four combis that we fly for the U.S. Military in that number and then we have four 757 freighters that we fly for DHL. But if you look at the 767s, essentially what we tried to focus on is a dry lease and then what additional services we can add to that, whether that includes the CMI flying or just doing maintenance for it. But as we continue to invest our capital, our strong preference is to stay away from the pure ACMI biz and focus more on the lease and then what services we can add to it.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. And then, if I recall in the past, it was kind of you had aircraft that were dry lease and then you had more ACMI. And then now it\u2019s used to be a much more, I guess, favorable mix of A-plus CMI or just dry lease? I mean, versus a few years ago, maybe excluding Amazon and DHL because those are maybe larger customers, but I mean, is more of your business under dry \u2013 more firm dry lease contracts than kind of the old ACMI that\u2019s a little more flexible for the customer?\nJoe Hete: We are projecting by the end of the year to have over 85% of our assets dry lease. And then we\u2019re going to fly two-thirds of those I believe we are also flying. And so we\u2019re getting the dry lease revenue for the aircraft and then we\u2019re getting the additional services as Joe mentioned, CMI services on top of that, and many of those customers also uses for their heavy checks and some also users for other types of maintenance. And so I mean, our business model, if you will, it\u2019s a dry lease aircraft. And then everything else we look at, including the CMI flying, is a supplemental service on top of that lease that drives incremental returns on top of the investment in the airframe.\nSteve O\u2019Hara:\n.:\nJoe Hete: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning everyone. I just want to make sure I understand the fleet plan here. So last quarter you had said that for the 10 new 767s for 2018, seven were committed, eight was closed and two were still being actively marketed. And then on the new 767s for 2019, is this part of the base plan you referenced last quarter of six? And then could you kind of give us some color on some of the carriers that you\u2019re working with? I know you mentioned Qantas and American. But there was an article in the press recently about United potentially retiring, I think 57 767s? And then also perhaps some color on feedstock availability by vintage?\nJoe Hete: Yes. We don\u2019t generally comment on specific customers, unless we\u2019re linking them into some type of announcement. So I can\u2019t really comment on that. In terms of the feedstock question, like I said, we\u2019re talking to multiple airlines. We know about these United Fleet. United Fleet happens to be predominant fly power, which is not the majority of our fleet is GE. But we\u2019re still talking to them, because at the end of the day the market will end up needing those aircraft as well. So \u2013 but I don\u2019t know if I can answer all your questions.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Well, first over the five for next year, you said that you secured the right. So are these \u2013 are you secured the rights? And I guess, the slots are they are now being marketed? Or these locked in with customers?\nJoe Hete: No. They\u2019re being marketed right now. And as I said, they \u2013 we got a lot of interest in them. And we \u2013 I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to have any problem getting them deployed when they come out of conversion.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then with the recent order, I think for the new builds from FedEx, just perhaps some color on lease rates for 767s, where they are today perhaps versus where we came in the year or last year?\nJoe Hete: Yes. So that the lease rates depends upon what the investment was we made in the total buildup of the aircraft in terms of the feedstock price and the conversion cost. And if the younger airplanes going to cost more, etcetera, etcetera, than your lease rates going to spin-off bad. And the only comment I can make about the lease rates is, they are firming up a bit. But again, the aircraft has to be competitive with the type of freight that it\u2019s going going to hold from a cost per kilo basis, because that\u2019s what customers look at when they\u2019re looking to make decisions about whether they\u2019re investing in their own airplane and put it up and fly in. So they are \u2013 and you can\u2019t just look at a scarcity and say, I can charge what I want for this airplane still need to be competitive with what has the.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then last question. I know you guys are pretty much North American-based. But with respect to the U.S., China trade dispute, what are you hearing from your customers like operators, such as a Amerijet, Air Incheon, DHL and then, of course, your European partner, West Atlantic?\nRich Corrado: You see that the majority of our customers are focused on express business. And the express business is a lot less volatile around trade and tariffs, because obviously, they\u2019re flying networks. So when you\u2019re in a network, you can\u2019t really flex whether you\u2019re going to fly to a certain markets and what the size of the aircraft would be. So it\u2019s a little more stable than general cargo, where if a tap is impacting the flow goods from one country to another, then you may decrease your frequency or you may down-gauge your airframe. But in an express environment, you generally don\u2019t have that type of volatile move. As you well know, the express market is being bullied, if you will, by e-commerce business. The e-commerce business is still growing significantly, particularly in the emerging markets in Asia, and that\u2019s still maintaining a good flow of traffic going forward. We have \u2013 I guess, what \u2013 the only thing I can tell you is the airlines that we do business with that may have less express and we are keeping an eye on. I mean, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of news about tariffs and trade. But consumer confidence around the globe is still very high. That speaks very well for the e-commerce business. And we think that we\u2019re in pretty good shape going into 2019.\nJoe Hete: So and keep in mind Chris too over 8% of our 767 fleet is going to be leased. So we\u2019re going to have that steady d of income regardless what the volumes are in the particular aircraft. There is some volatility based on the actual amount of flying we do within these networks. But as Rich said, the network is pretty finite in terms of point you have to touch. And so that have pretty significant drop-off in volume, to say, I don\u2019t need a 767 anymore. I am going to down-gauge my aircraft size. So we\u2019ve kind of immunized the business so to speak from the downside. Obviously, we don\u2019t have the flexibility on the upside potential as you would if you were flying the Trans-Pacific type or else you get a \u2013 you can a real spike during the peak seasons and/or when your economy is really booming. So the impact us from a tariff standpoint is negligible at best.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thanks for the time.\nJoe Hete: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harrison Wreschner with C.F. Capital.\nHarrison Wreschner: Hi, gentlemen.\nJoe Hete: Hi, Harrison, good morning.\nHarrison Wreschner: The plan for 6 to 10 planes next year that should be \u2013 you should be able to fully fund that with cash from operations. Is that fair?\nJoe Hete: Yes. I mean, pretty much.\nQuint Turner: $310 million in EDITDA target.\nHarrison Wreschner: Okay. So that makes sense. And with leverage, kind of with the one handle on it in general and able to kind of self-fund the growth CapEx, what\u2019s kind of the appropriate leverage for this business? And obviously, we get great ROICs on new plans. Should we keep holding back firepower for more feedstock or with stock coming down here, does it makes sense to use some of that firepower in the little one time towards buybacks or dividends, etcetera?\nJoe Hete: I mean, long-term Harrison, we don\u2019t \u2013 we would not expect to be just likely levered. And so it\u2019s not that we are holding necessarily for any reason. It\u2019s that we, of course, looking for in this growth environment the right opportunities to deploy the capital. But I do expect that, whether it\u2019s a continued investment on the growth side or whether we look at share buyback as another option that we won\u2019t be at this leverage long term.\nRich Corrado: You keep in mind, Harrison, as mentioned earlier on the call, the 321 is in our future. I mean, that\u2019s not to say that there\u2019s going to be any fall back in terms of the demand for the 767. So I think our capital requirements long-term based on what we think the success rates going to be for the 321, is going to have increasing demand for reinvesting our capital back into the business.\nHarrison Wreschner: Okay. And the extra one turn of leverage, let\u2019s just call whatever the number is called, mid 300-plus million. Do you think you could put that to work in that program? Or if you were to use it for growth, it\u2019s more of an acquisition opportunity of another\u2026\nRich Corrado: Well, we don\u2019t really talk a lot about the acquisition side. As you know, we\u2019ve done it, and we certainly tried to stay up to speed on opportunities that may come up. But in terms of our being able to digest another turn of leverage without any discernible impact to the financial performance, we absolutely could.\nHarrison Wreschner: Thank you very much.\nRich Corrado: Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question from Christopher Hillary with Roubaix Capital.\nChristopher Hillary: Hi, good morning.\nJoe Hete: Good morning.\nQuint Turner: Good morning.\nChristopher Hillary: I just wanted to ask if all the growth you\u2019ve been experiencing, the logistics business, the change in accounting, can you give us some color on how you expect your margins to evolve in 2019 and beyond if it\u2019s appropriate to comment on it that way?\nJoe Hete: Well, a lot of our margin movement, all else being equal depends upon how we deploy the asset. If we deploy them with the CMI, if you are talking \u2013 as opposed to straight dry leases. As you know, the dry lease margin is quite high as you\u2019re not requiring all the resources you do and revenues associated with those resources that you do in the CMI environment. So it depends on the mix. As Rich said, we have customers that avail themselves as the full suite of services we can provide like our two largest customers do, for example. And then we have others who look to operate aircraft themselves under a dry-leased model. So we\u2019ll depend on the mix. I mean, this year certainly we had the aircraft deployments are almost completely dry lease only. We finished our 20th airplane with Amazon last August. And so that was the other option, which was the full game at CMI Service. So from a margin standpoint, we are getting this year\u2019s deployments being dry-lease only. And of course, the accounting changes, where we netted what something near $300 million annualized between fuel and the Amazon gateway services that we were managing, assisting them with how to our margin as a percentage of revenue to go up on all fronts significantly. Hopefully, the accounting changes to the top line have the big ones have pretty much hit. So I don\u2019t expect that to be a significant factor as we look forward.\nChristopher Hillary: Okay. And then is there a way that you kind of anticipate your mix evolving as we move to 2019 and beyond?\nJoe Hete: I think there will be opportunities on all fronts. So this year was a bit unusual and that it was almost completely dry lease. So we are not surprised to see more opportunities that also involve the operation of the aircraft.\nRich Corrado: Keep in mind, we do things like logistics businesses and maintain something in that nature. You\u2019re talking high-single and low-teen returns there versus what we see on a leased aircraft. So as the revenue \u2013 if the top line gets driven in a big way by the services side of the equation, it\u2019s going to have a negative impact on a margin percentage on the bottom line.\nChristopher Hillary: Okay. Thanks very much.\nJoe Hete: Thank you.\nOperator: And it seems that we have a follow-up question from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Hey guys, thanks for taking my follow-up. So with respect to Amazon, you\u2019ve been fully deployed now, I think this August 4 year. Could you give us some color on how utilization levels have been trending? Is the network running a hub-and-spoke configuration out of CVG or perhaps hybrid hub-and-spoke point-to-point? And then also, are we at a point where there is some visibility utilization where it might make sense to add additional freighters? And then last, has Amazon exercised any other warrants?\nJoe Hete: So we don\u2019t comment on Amazon\u2019s network. It\u2019s their proprietary network. I mean, all we really said is that, their business does ramp up and in peak periods, it ramps down, the second and third quarter. So from an Amazon perspective, it\u2019s \u2013 all the aircraft are flying in the network unless they are maintenance and they haven\u2019t exercised any other warrants today.\nRich Corrado: The other interesting thing about the network is they fly seven days a week, which is different than what our other experiences with express operators.\nOperator: I see we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over to our speakers for closing remarks.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Venessa. ATSG remains a purest way to play the e-commerce forces driving growth in the air cargo industry. We have more dedicated midsize freighters of the workforces of air express networks and unique set of services to support them. We will keep investing as niche growth market expands and knows to support will be well rewarded over time. Thanks for joining us on the call, and have a quality day.\nOperator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our conference for today. We thank you for participating.

And welcome to our first-quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Quint Turner, our Chief Financial Officer and Rich Corrado, our Chief Operating Officer. We issued our earnings release yesterday after the market closed. It is on our website, atsginc.com. We will file our Form 10-Q later this week. I\u2019m very pleased to report that 2018 has begun with a substantial increase in our financial results during a very strong first quarter. Our revenues are up 11%, excluding reimbursables. Both our GAAP and adjusted EPS doubled from a year ago and our adjusted EBITDA rose 26%. Our results stem from our continued success against our strategy to acquire, convert, lease and operate Boeing 767 freighters around the globe. Two more have been leased and deployed so far in 2018 with a third due later this month. We intend to deploy seven others by the end of the year. Quint is standing by to summarize our financial results for the first quarter. Rich will add a few words on our operations and I will close with some perspective on our outlook. Quint?\nQuint Turner: Thanks, Joe and thanks to all of you on the call for joining us this morning. As always, I will start by saying that, during the course of this call, we will make projections or other forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and other future events may differ materially from those we describe here. These forward-looking statements are based on information, plans and estimates as of the date of this call and Air Transport Services Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, new information or other changes. These factors include but are not limited to changes in market demand for our assets and services, our operating airline\u2019s ability to maintain on-time service and control costs, the cost and timing with respect to which we are able to purchase and modify aircraft to a cargo configuration, fluctuations in ATSG\u2019s traded share price, which may result in mark-to-market charges on certain financial instruments., the number, timing and scheduled routes of our aircraft deployments to customers and other factors as contained from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including the Form 10-Q we will file this week. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures from continuing operations, including adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Management believes these metrics are useful to investors in assessing ATSG\u2019s financial position and results. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be a substitute for our GAAP financials and we advise you to refer to the reconciliations to GAAP measures, which are included in our earnings release and on our website. As Joe said, our first-quarter earnings were very strong led by improved results from our airlines. Our ACMI services segment was profitable for the quarter and we saw a year-over-year improvement in all our business units. On a consolidated basis, first-quarter revenues were $220 million, which is lower than the prior year only because of our adoption of new revenue recognition standards under Topic 606. Excluding reimbursement payments included in 2017 revenues, our first-quarter revenues increased 11%. Revenues from each of our three reportable segments \u2013 CAM, ACMI Services and our new segment, MRO Services \u2013 increased compared to the same quarter last year. Revenues from Amazon were approximately 28% of the total for the quarter under the new revenue recognition rules. DHL revenues were also 28% and the military contributed 11%. On a GAAP basis, we had first-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $15.7 million versus $9.8 million a year ago. On a diluted basis, GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.26, twice the $0.13 we earned a year ago. The quarterly mark-to-market reevaluation of our liability for warrants issued to Amazon resulted in a $3 million after-tax loss based on the first-quarter increase in our stock price. The related lease amortization incentive also tied to the Amazon warrants was $3.3 million or $0.06 per share after-tax. Our share of joint venture cost to develop a new freighter version of the Airbus A321-200 launched last summer with Precision was a $2 million or $0.03 per share item after tax under the equity method of accounting for that venture. Adjusted for those items, our adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.35 diluted for the first quarter, more than double the $0.17 we earned a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 26% to $71.9 million, a first-quarter record for us. Just as in 2017, the principal factor in our earnings gains this year has been the improvement at our airlines. ACMI Services on a pretax basis earned $3.9 million in the first quarter, an improvement of $7.5 million from its pretax loss a year ago. ACMI Services operated six more 767s during the first quarter than it did last year. This year, our expense associated with scheduled airframe inspections for the aircraft we operate and premium pay and training costs for pilots were lower. CAM, our leasing business, had a good quarter with pretax earnings of $15.2 million, 16% better than a year ago. Additional earnings from a larger lease fleet were offset by increases in the lease incentives to Amazon, higher depreciation and increased interest expense as CAM\u2019s aircraft portfolio expanded to meet stronger lease demand for its 767s. As we mentioned before, our GAAP and adjusted earnings this year both include a non-cash charge to interest expense of about $2 million per quarter associated with the convertible feature of the notes we issued last September. We are not excluding it from the calculation off our adjusted EPS because the charge amortizes ratably over the seven-year term of the notes. We also revised our reporting format for the first quarter by forming a new reportable segment, MRO Services, which includes the results of our aircraft maintenance and modification businesses. Gateway ground operations, postal center management services and material handling equipment support comprise our other activities line. MRO Services' pretax earnings, including intercompany transactions, rose $1.3 million to $4.5 million on expanded demand for our maintenance operations. The other activities businesses also reported an earnings gain to $2.6 million for the quarter. Volumes and contracted rates for our gateway and sorting services increased. We also had a gain from our minority investment in our European airline affiliate, West Atlantic. These items offset the loss of results from hub services operations in Wilmington for Amazon last May. We spent $79 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, down from $84 million a year ago. That included $64 million to purchase three 767 feedstock aircraft and to modify in-process aircraft. We spent $9 million for required capitalized heavy maintenance and $6 million for other equipment. We still expect a 2018 CapEx spend of about $300 million, mostly to acquire and modify 767s for our growing customer dry lease portfolio. Assuming that target, and given our $310 million adjusted EBITDA outlook, we expect our CapEx program to be self-funded for the year as a whole. About 80% of our debt principal is fixed rate with an average coupon rate under 3%. Our debt leverage remains near the 2 times trailing adjusted EBITDA mark. As a result, we remain well-positioned to pursue new investment opportunities even if interest rates increase later this year. That\u2019s a summary of our financial results for the quarter. Rich is ready to share some operating highlights and our market perspective. Rich.\nRich Corrado: Thanks, Quint. From an operating perspective, we had an excellent first quarter as both of our airlines showed improved earnings resulting from higher utilization and good on-time performance even during the challenging winter months. CAM, our leasing company, transitioned from completing the Amazon commitment of 20 767s in August to delivering more freighter conversions to other customers. CAM has delivered two 767 freighters to lease customers so far this year, one in the first quarter, the Northern Air Cargo and another in the second quarter to Air Incheon. A third is slated to go to Amerijet later this month. We also began leasing one 737 to West Atlantic in April. CAM is on pace to meet the 2018 target of 10 more 767s for lease customers this year and is negotiating for the purchase of additional feedstock 767s for deployment in 2019. All of the ATSG family of companies performed well in the first quarter. Most air cargo operators wind down operations as volumes fall after peak, but that is less true of us. We cover express network routes that are less volume-sensitive, which means meeting strict on-time demands during winter months that stretch our ground and line maintenance crews. I am pleased to say that we delivered great service throughout the quarter. We are especially pleased to report that the pilot group at ATI ratified a market competitive amendment to their collective-bargaining agreement in March 2018 that sets compensation levels for four years from that date. While it will significantly raise our wage and benefit costs at ATI, it provides a stable platform for growth. We are eager to resolve our discussions with our ABX pilot group as well. Any such deal, however, will have to keep ABX a competitive choice for our airline customers. Before turning it back to Joe, I would like to note the addition of Mike Berger to the ATSG team as Chief Commercial Officer. Mike has a significant record of achievement for business development in the air express industry, offshore international experience and knows our customers well. I am confident Mike will further strengthen ATSG\u2019s market leadership in providing flexible, innovative solutions to our customers' freighter aircraft and air cargo needs. Joe.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Rich. We surprised some people last year when we announced a $300 million CapEx budget for 2017 just as we were nearing the finish line with the 20 767\u2019s we promised Amazon. During the Amazon dedicated fleet buildup, we said that other potential 767 lease customers should expect delays of at least a year. We were eager to serve that latent demand when the market opened up. Under the CapEx plan last year, CAM delivered nine 767s and one 737, including the four 767s to customers other than Amazon. Under roughly the same size plan this year, we expect to deliver 10 767s, plus the 737 we leased to West Atlantic in April. We have customer commitments for seven newly converted 767s this year, including one we delivered in January, all of which will be straight dry leases. An agreement for an eighth is being finalized. We have both single and multi-aircraft interest for the remaining two. As we build our 767 lease base, we are pressing ahead with our partner, Precision, to gain FAA approval for a converted freighter variant of the A321. Once our prototype earns its supplemental type certificate, we intend to make investments of our own to provide A321s to express network customers that need a narrowbody complement to the 767 with capacity similar to a Boeing 757-200 with operating costs more like the 737-400. As we announced in February, our Board has approved a $59 million increase in our authorized share repurchase limit to $150 million. We purchased 157,000 shares during the first quarter for $3.6 million and will continue to monitor opportunities to purchase more consistent with our capital allocation strategy. We will remain focused on growth and generating cash flow that we can invest to maximize shareholder returns. We hear from many investors about 2019 growth considering a tight market for 767 freighter feedstock. We are in negotiations for additional feedstock that would be available for customers in 2019. It has always been our practice to forecast one year at a time; although we see no evidence that the rewards our business model can generate will diminish anytime soon. We hope you remember that we have been buying, converting and deploying 767s for decades starting when we, and the major integrators, were the only ones convinced of its value as a regional express network tool. We are the very best at what we do and we are confident we can continue to grow at good margins for years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks, Vanessa. We are ready for the first question.\nOperator: And thank you. We will now take questions [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Good morning, guys and congratulations on a great first quarter.\nJoe Hete: Thanks Jack. Good morning Jack.\nJack Atkins: So I guess let me start off with a question for Joe or Rich. Just kind of going back to both of your prepared comments around CAM currently being in negotiations for additional 767 aircraft for deployment next year. Is there a way for you to help us sort of think about \u2013 my guess is you are not going to want to say how many you are in negotiations for, but is there a way for us to think about your appetite for aircraft next year and how many aircraft you think you guys could place into service next year in terms of being able to get through the modification process? Sort of what is the right range to think about for potential aircraft deployment for 2019?\nJoe Hete: Jack, in terms of feedstock that we would add, you can think about it in terms of probably on average at least six additional tails on an annual basis. So service costs considered roughly $150 million a year and of course, if the demand is there for more aircraft, we obviously will try and source those, but I think if you just want to assume a base run rate, that is probably a good number to target. Rich, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to that.\nRich Corrado: No, that would be our base plan and of course, if demand continues to be strong, we would look for alternatives. Keep in mind that when we look for feedstock, we look for a good run from a specific airline and a lot of times that comes out over time. For example our 767-300 fleet is predominantly sourced from Qantas and American and we took those aircraft from Qantas over a 2.5 year period and from American over a two-year period. So a lot of times, Jack, we will get into an agreement with getting some feedstock where we will get a run and it will go over separate years. If we can accelerate that, if demand picks up, we try to do that. Sometimes the source feedstock customer wants to slow it down because they may want to hang onto them a little bit longer. But in looking for feedstock in that way, it represents the most efficient way to get feedstock and also when we are looking to lease them to customers that want more than one aircraft, they like the fact that they are going to get converted freighters that are similar in their heritage in other parts of the airplane.\nJack Atkins: Okay, okay, that\u2019s helpful, Rich. I think that\u2019s good to know sort of how you guys are thinking about the future deployment growth. So Rich, if I could get you too just to expand on your comments for a minute. I always think it\u2019s helpful to hear you talk about the types of customers that are inquiring about potential 767 freighters. Have you seen any change there whether it\u2019s with regard to sort of geographic interest or just types of customers? If you could just sort of help us think through sort of where geographies that want this plane and sort of what types of customers are looking for this plane.\nRich Corrado: Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Jack. We\u2019ve seen a significant change, in fact, in the demand profile pattern over the past three years. We were predominantly a North American lessor up until about three years ago and then we got into Europe with West Atlantic. West Atlantic, by the end of this year, will have six aircraft from ATSG. We will have six aircraft in the Middle East by the end of this year, so we are adding two to the portfolio there and we added a new lessee in Air Incheon to South Korea. They will take two aircraft this year. We already have one lessee in the Far East with Rhya that\u2019s out of Malaysia and we continue to expand our business with Cargojet in Canada and then we added another new lessee this year, Northern Air Cargo and we are expanding our business with Amerijet. One of the things that most of these customers have in common is they either have their own network or they are supporting the networks of an integrator or a global customer that is looking to penetrate a market. You look at \u2013 Cargojet is a good example. They have got a significant network \u2013 they are the only significant network in Canada, but their growth has been so strong that they have actually been looking for more assets to branch out of Canada and do international routes. So the demand profile, a lot of it is express and integrator-oriented, but even the integrators are looking to supplement their networks with other carriers and that is where a lot of our customers are coming from.\nJack Atkins: Okay, okay, Rich, thank you for that. Last question and I will turn it over, but just in terms of the improved profitability on a year-over-year basis in the ACMI segment, can you kind of walk us through what\u2019s driving that specifically because obviously that\u2019s a business that can I think over time it generate some improved profitability versus what you saw in 2017. It\u2019s probably happening a little bit quicker than we would have expected. Could you kind of talk us through that and sort of \u2013 I know you\u2019ve got the ATI wage increase for your pilots there. Just kind of help us think through how you are seeing the profitability of that business through the rest of the year as well.\nRich Corrado: Yes, sure, Jack, this is Quint. Well, we certainly have benefited from better utilization as we have reached the buildout of the Amazon network in August of last year. So comparing first quarter to first quarter of 2017, you\u2019ve got that fleet fully in place. You are no longer carrying any kind of ramp for that. I think in the first quarter of last year, we had a bit of a leftover of the sort of the premium pay issues of 2016 that were still there. So year-over-year that was a tailwind. The increase in labor costs associated with the ratification of the ATI amendment really didn\u2019t kick in until very late March. So essentially there wasn\u2019t any impact of that in the first quarter of this year. That will start, of course, as we move forward through the balance of the year and be a bit of a headwind on that on a year-over-year basis given the higher cost of that contract. We also had maintenance in first quarter be a little bit better than last year\u2019s first quarter, which was a tailwind, but certainly we have seen and began to see that last year improved profitability out of the segment. We expect for the full year that the segment will again be a profitable segment for us. We have baked into our guidance the ATI ratification. The guidance that we have given for EBITDA does not include anything associated with the other airline reaching an amendment to its contract. That could happen, but it was our best view at the time we gave our guidance and continues to be that it likely won\u2019t happen until next year.\nJack Atkins: Okay, great. Thank you again for the time.\nRich Corrado: Thanks Jack.\nOperator: And our next question comes form David Ross with Stifel.\nDavid Ross: Yes, good morning, gentlemen.\nRich Corrado: Good morning, David.\nDavid Ross: Just following up on the ATI deal, why I guess just go for a three-year contract after being in negotiations for about four years? I noticed the deal becomes amendable again in 2021.\nJoe Hete: Well, one of the things we want to look at, Dave, as we go through that is try and dovetail those more closely with our existing agreements with our customers for operating those aircraft. If you remember, the Amazon agreement runs through 2021. The majority of their flying is done by the ATI guys. On the ABX side, the current ABX agreements run through March of 2019 and of course, as you know, we are still in negotiations at this point in time. So when you think about where we are at today, there is a disconnect between what we bid when we did the Amazon work versus where our labor costs are today and so what we tried to do is get those more closely aligned. Obviously what we\u2019d like to do is go out 8 or 10 years, but you are never going to get the labor side to agree to something that long of a duration.\nDavid Ross: At least not anything that you are happy with.\nJoe Hete: No.\nDavid Ross: And keeping on the pilots, can you talk about any changes there to either recruiting or retention? Has it been more challenging, less challenging, stable?\nRich Corrado: We have not had a problem attracting crews and staffing classes. ATI has folks in training right now in different levels. They have got some classes started and they have also got some folks in simulators, so we are anticipating having enough crews to support the demand, including the growth that we expect during peak from our larger customers.\nJoe Hete: When you think about the ATI side, Dave, one of the things that \u2013 we have got guys that have been here two years that are in the left seat of a 767, so the upgrade potential there is pretty quick. The recent contract negotiations aside, the largest increase a pilot ever gets is moving from the right seat to the left seat.\nDavid Ross: That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess a follow-up to an earlier question around 2019, I guess putting it a different way, how early do you need to make decisions around planes that customers might want for next year in terms of timing to find the feedstock and get the conversion slot? So if a customer says I want three planes next spring, by when do you need to have those planes and how early do you need to reserve those conversion slots?\nJoe Hete: Yes, that\u2019s a good question, Dave. Really kind of our 2019 view, and we are already working on that, so we\u2019ve already done the groundwork with the conversion house in terms of laying out some option slots for our growth there and like I said, we\u2019ve already \u2013 we are already in discussions for aircraft that we\u2019ll fold into the portfolio for conversion and delivery and deployment in 2019. If we started in 2019, we\u2019d have to be looking at 2020. So you need to be well ahead of the curve in this business.\nDavid Ross: That makes sense. And then lastly just a clarification question. When you were talking about a base case or the potential for six additional tails and you mentioned something I think, Joe, about $150 million a year. I wasn\u2019t sure the $150 million was tied to the six tails, if that was another CapEx number excluding the six tails.\nJoe Hete: No, that would be for the six tails because, as you will recall, we always talk about that we try to get the aircraft into service for somewhere between $23 million and $25 million a copy. So if we just baseline it at six tails a year, that\u2019s your $150 million.\nDavid Ross: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much and good afternoon. Hi, how are you?\nJoe Hete: Good, how are you?\nHelane Becker: Just a couple of questions. With respect to more aircraft for Amazon, as we think about the outlook for them, after this year, they have no growth aircraft. So have they approached you? Are they concerned at all about the fact that you are placing aircraft with other customers that aren\u2019t them because maybe they are slow to decide on aircraft or there is no \u2013 or do they just not have the demand for it that you see? Because I would think they would want more aircraft pretty rapidly for 2019 to say 2022.\nJoe Hete: Well, Helane, we can\u2019t obviously talk about potential future business with our customers, but I think if you would just look at it from a logical perspective, they will have the 40th aircraft and the current commits in place by the end of this year if everything goes according to schedule and with their growth rate, is it reasonable to expect that they wouldn\u2019t want to continue to expand the fleet and the answer is probably know if you apply logic to it. And then dovetail that with the fact that when they talked about their hub operation they are going to build in CVG, having parking for 100 aircraft, et cetera. So I think there is growth in the future, but nothing that we are going to talk about today.\nHelane Becker: Got you. And then my other question, I heard \u2013 I mean stock price has been really lagging the group over the last maybe year to date and I am not sure if I understand why because I think we had talked about and you guys have said that the 767-300 freighters are kind of coming into service more valuable, so to speak, at higher rates than the 200 freighters, and I would think that that would translate into higher earnings and they did in the first quarter and that would continue and then it would translate into a higher stock price and I am not sure I understand why that\u2019s not happening. And then the other thing, and as part of \u2013 that\u2019s like \u2013 the question there is A. And then B, a little question is I have heard that Amazon is actually looking at having you not do some of the things like deicing at Cincinnati, which intuitively doesn\u2019t make sense to me, but I\u2019m wondering if you could set me straight on that.\nJoe Hete: Well, I will take the last one first because it\u2019s the easiest. We don\u2019t do any deicing at CVG today for Amazon. DHL handles all of their ramp operations down there. We just fly the airplanes in and out and of course, we do the maintenance on our aircraft in CVG. So that part has \u2013 and nothing has changed in that respect. As far as where the stock price is, we are a little bit perplexed ourselves as to why it has taken the dip that it has since the first of the year. As you saw with the results, everything is humming on all cylinders at this point in time. We haven\u2019t changed our guidance at this point. We are still guiding to 310, but there are things like \u2013 if you go back to last year, for example, we saw block hours basically take a little bit of a dip after the first quarter and we are seeing the same in terms of a flat line schedule this year, but again we have got all 20 aircraft for them in place and the DHL network is a pretty stable one overall. But everything else, nothing has changed in our go-forward plan. We think we have got continued opportunities in 2019. We obviously are working on the feedstock side. We have got the slots available and there is still pent-up customer demand out there. So can\u2019t tell you why the stock has dropped. I thought maybe you could tell us.\nHelane Becker: Yes, I am at a loss myself given everything that I know you guys have been doing and have said. Like I just said, it makes no sense either. Okay, well, thanks. Those were my 2.5 or three questions.\nJoe Hete: Thanks Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Ritzer with Pressprich and Company.\nAdam Ritzer: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Just a few housekeeping things. I know you mentioned in your comments you are going to have a reduction in your federal tax rate, but I assume that\u2019s just for accounting purposes since you are not paying any taxes. Is that correct?\nQuint Turner: Correct.\nAdam Ritzer: Okay. Can you remind me \u2013 I know it has been a while now. How many \u2013 what is the total amount of warrants Amazon has to get from you guys and what is this average strike price on it?\nQuint Turner: Yes, currently, they have 14.4 million warrants. There was a tranche in March that was issued, about 1.59 million that brought them to that total and then in September of 2020, there is \u2013 under the terms that we executed with them in 2016, there\u2019s sort of a true-up to 19.9% at that point. We currently don\u2019t expect that to result in many additional warrants, perhaps 300,000 or so warrants to get them to maybe a total of around 14.7 million or 14.8 million warrants. \nJoe Hete: Or less if we do some buybacks in between.\nQuint Turner: Right.\nAdam Ritzer: Okay, and what\u2019s the \u2013 and the average strike is what, $9, $10? Is that correct?\nQuint Turner: $9.73 a warrant would be the exercise price if they exercise the warrants.\nAdam Ritzer: Got it. So obviously, your share count would go up, but you would get in $150 million of cash, which you could immediately pay down debt, so your debt would go down as well.\nQuint Turner: Right. On the cash piece, but on the share count, we currently \u2013 when we give an unadjusted share count with our earnings release, and you will see a table back there, there is an adjustment for the warrants and we assume the treasury stock method when we apply that against the additional warrants based upon the current share price. In other words, if we get that cash that you are referring to for the exercise and apply that cash to buy back stock at the current price that would reduce the additional warrants in the denominator. So right now, we are showing about 69 million shares when actually the current number out there is only about 59 million. So that factors in the additional warrants already in our adjusted EPS that we provide.\nAdam Ritzer: Can you tell me what you think your maintenance CapEx would be now? I know the fleet keeps growing every year. I just wanted to update my numbers on what you think the maintenance CapEx will be with 70 planes this year and what it would be with 80 planes next year.\nQuint Turner: That\u2019s a great question. And one of the things that is inherent with leases typically is the lessee is responsible for the heavy maintenance during the term of the lease. And so actually as we grow CAM\u2019s leasing portfolio with additional 767-300 leases, the typical lease arrangement won\u2019t result in additional maintenance CapEx for us because the lessee will fund that during the life of the lease and then return the airplane in sort of a like-for-like maintenance condition at the end of the lease. So I don\u2019t necessarily see that growing as we expand our portfolio, but the current level of CapEx maintenance spend, and it varies from year to year depending upon the timing of the visits, but it\u2019s somewhere call it $60 million to $70 million annually.\nAdam Ritzer: Got it, okay. And I know you give your guidance, you gave $300 million of guidance, but what would you think all in with 80, 81 planes your EBITDA would be? \nQuint Turner: Are you referring to an exit run rate kind of \u2013?\nAdam Ritzer: Sure. An exit run rate, let\u2019s say, and I\u2019m just trying to say, okay, look, in Q4, you are going to do, based on your guidance, you are going to do at least $80 million. But if you got to 80, 81 planes and added nothing, how much your exit run rate or however \u2013 I think you understand the question.\nQuint Turner: We have said that on a per tail basis, and maybe that\u2019s the right way to sort of frame this, a 767-300 generally is going to provide somewhere, call it, $3.6 million to $4 million annually of EBITDA and so again, it depends on how many additional services, the value- added services that we sell with the lease, maintenance for the airplane or full-on operating providing crews, etc., but just the asset piece will add that incrementally. So you sort of look at us this year, we are adding 10 767-300s throughout the year to CAM\u2019s portfolio. So you can sort of multiply that out and get an incremental addition to the run rate.\nAdam Ritzer: Got it. So if I take the Q1, annualize that, add another $35 million, $40 million to your additional $10 million at the $3.6 million to $4 million that pretty much gets me to what I am asking.\nQuint Turner: Pretty close.\nAdam Ritzer: Okay. So my next question, I\u2019m sorry to ask so many questions, but if you take your maintenance minus your interest expense, you have no taxes, you are generating somewhere around $240 million, $250 million of free cash, which you\u2019ve just reinvested in your fleet. There\u2019s 10 planes this year, you are talking six next year. You are almost adding another Amazon every two to three years without Amazon. So you are going to keep growing and I think the non-Amazon planes have better margins and you are diversifying, so that is all a good thing. But if you stopped, what would you do with all that cash? Are you going to be under any leverage commitments, would you just take that and buy back stock? What would you do with all that cash if you weren\u2019t to continue to grow?\nQuint Turner: Well, the good news there, Adam, is that there are a lot of options to create value for the shareholder and certainly we have shown that we will use any or all of those based upon what we view as the relative benefit. We have done a significant share buyback.  We have, of course, as you say, invested in growth aggressively and at times we\u2019ve even looked to grow inorganically if we found something that was a great synergistic thing to slide under our holding company structure. So M&A is also a potential use of cash to create value. But good news is, as you say, there is \u2013 the model funds significant growth already. The balance sheet has a lot of liquidity in it and there is a lot of great options for us in this growth environment we are in right now.\nAdam Ritzer: Yes, I agree. I mean just reiterating Helane\u2019s question about the stock lagging, it seems to me the way I look at or on a free cash basis with no growth, you guys will generate well over $3 a share of free cash flow, which is a 15% yield seems pretty good. So I think you guys are doing a great job and thanks for answering my questions.\nJoe Hete: Hey, Adam, just one last thing is don\u2019t forget the A321 program we are into as well that we will be looking to make investments in that aircraft type once we receive the certification for a passenger freighter. So as you look out beyond, in the latter part of 2019 and into 2021 and beyond, that is going to become a part of our lease portfolio as well.\nAdam Ritzer: Right, you have that, you have your investment in West Atlantic, which that was a great deal for you guys. I appreciate all your comments. Thanks a lot.\nJoe Hete: Thanks Adam.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve O\u2019Hara with from Sidoti & Company.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Yes, not to maybe rain on the parade a little bit, but just I mean in terms of the aircraft that you were acquiring, and I mean it sounds like you have good demand for the 10; you have two left to sign up I guess. One kind of sounds like it\u2019s close. I mean how many do you kind of want, need and maybe what\u2019s the limit there in terms of how many you have or how many you acquire without firm customer commitment? I mean it seems like the economy is improving, airfreight seems to be pretty strong, but obviously things run in cycles and I\u2019m just wondering how you think about that with purchasing aircraft.\nRich Corrado: Steve, I think Joe answered that earlier kind of from a planning standpoint from a base of six because you need to plan in advance, because you need to be a year to two years ahead of where the market is going to be and then depending on what we see as real-time demand, we can flex up or \u2013 I mean the only way to flex back is to not convert and just hang onto the feedstock. We haven\u2019t had to do that, but it is an option if the market slows down and we have got feedstock in queue. So that\u2019s kind of the way we look at it. We have had very strong demand over the past \u2013 really over the past four years and it has been noted, but I think by the end of this year, we will deliver 14 aircraft post the Amazon 20. So in about a year and a quarter. So I think that speaks for the strength of the market and the fact that although we were fulfilling an order from a great customer, we still had our eye on what was going to be after that and I think we planned on the fact that given they were getting 20 from another operator and that would have pulled a lot of feedstock and conversion space out of the market, at that time, we were still negotiating feedstock, we were still tying up slots because we knew we would have a pretty good run in the market when that opened up.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay, so I mean it sounds like maybe the most you think you would kind of go over if the cycle did turn without warning maybe you\u2019d go over by six and you would kind of fly those internally for a while or just not convert them or something like that and then when the cycle kind of turned around again, you would either convert those, then place those with customers and then start afresh. Is that kind of how you are thinking about it?\nRich Corrado: I mean that\u2019s probably the worst case\u2026\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Yeah, right\u2026\nRich Corrado: Convert and fly all six that we were planning on, but we do have that option and that opportunity that if we don\u2019t have an external lessor that we can fly them in charter, fly them in ACMI and it is one of the unique things about our value proposition is that we do have that flexibility and most of our lessees were actually ACMI customers under our wet to dry program. So that is usually a good solid use of the assets in the event that we aren\u2019t able to execute. Our first desire would be to dry lease the aircraft, but other than that, we certainly would be able to execute and drive revenue and returns off those assets. \nJoe Hete: The other thing, Steve, is the 767-200 s, we have 36 of those today. Somewhere down the road, we will have to look to start replacing those aircraft and so the idea that we would get stuck with a couple of airplanes because we overbought so to speak, we can throw the 300s in place of 300 s, which actually generates revenue growth at the same time because the 300 leases for more than 200. So we have got a lot of flexibility in that respect in terms of avoiding having just a bunch of idle assets sitting around. And of course, the last piece of it is the first tranche is finding the feedstock, which is very difficult to put your hands on these days because a lot of people that operate the 767, and we\u2019re going to replace it with the 787 have run into issues with some engine problems that are keeping \u2013 that are forcing them to hold onto the tails. But then the largest chunk of the spend on an aircraft is the actual conversion and placing it into service. So we have got flexibility in terms of once we make a commitment for a feedstock aircraft in terms of what we do with it once we have made that acquisition.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay, okay, thank you. And then just on the \u2013 there was something about the 737; it sounded like it could be a new mod that you are working on and I am just wondering is that more of a hedge to the 321 program or is that something that\u2019s kind of unrelated to that, the continuation of the 73 conversion that you have going on.\nRich Corrado: Steve, this is Rich. When we acquired Pemco, Pemco had a heritage and a very strong reputation in converting 737 classics, 737-300s and 400s. The 700 FlexCombi program, which is a combi that can flex all the way up to a full freighter, is more or less a new generation for the 737-300. I think we mentioned on other calls that Pemco has over 70% marketshare in China and those classics are getting old so we could have a solid run of replacement opportunity with the 737-700. We are also evaluating the potential for the 737-800, but we firmly believe that the A321 is going to be really the only choice in that large narrowbody space when the STC is approved and we start delivering aircraft.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Hey, guys. Thanks for the quick follow up here. Quint, I guess I had a question on the seasonality of the MRO Services and the other segment in terms of how that revenue should flow just because those are sort of new breakouts. Could you kind of help us think through conceptually about the seasonality of those revenue lines?\nQuint Turner: Yes, on the MRO side, most folks want the greatest availability of aircraft during the fourth quarter. So typically if there is I guess hangar space to market, it\u2019s in the fourth quarter. It doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t of course be successful in fully selling that space, but that is typically for them the quarter in which if there is any additional capacity. Otherwise, for the most part, our hangar space is utilized. We are booked both here in Wilmington and Tampa, as Rich was discussing with the -700 mods and so forth. It\u2019s a combination of heavy checks and cargo modification work and various other mods that customers have. We have talked about Pemco focusing a lot on the Airbus products and having \u2013 for example, Frontier is a large customer of theirs and Wilmington, a little bit more on the Boeing products, but really it should be fairly steady other than that fourth-quarter period for the MRO side. And when you mentioned the other segment, you might be talking about the other activities line. Is that \u2013?\nJack Atkins: Yes, exactly, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s where your Postal Service sortation work is, so that\u2019s pretty seasonally strong in the fourth quarter, correct?\nQuint Turner: Yes, you will see a nice uptick there in terms of \u2013 sometimes there is even an additional facility space that they will open temporarily for that.\nJack Atkins: That\u2019s helpful, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next questions from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: ood morning. So my question is around the additional feedstock opportunities for 2019. The first question \u2013 are these with existing customers or new ones? And then what\u2019s the sensitivity in terms of passenger demand? Meaning are the partner airlines, and I think you mentioned Qantas, going to phase out these aircraft regardless of passenger demand due to the average age of the aircraft?\nRich Corrado: As far as Qantas goes, they are done; they are out of airplanes. And Joe had indicated that one of the drivers for 767 availability is 787 deliveries that will free up the 767 because it\u2019s roughly in the same category in terms of seat size and range and markets to deploy. And so there has been a little bit of a hiccup from combination carriers and from pure packs carriers that have 767s in terms of releasing them in that the 787 engine problem has forced them to maybe slow down their deployment or in some cases look for alternative lift to cover for a 787 that has been put down. Generally speaking, the newer 767s are not available so we talked to \u2013 particularly in Asia we talked to a lot of customers that want an aircraft that\u2019s younger than 20 years because of their aviation authority. And that is a unicorn right now. But aircraft that are in the early 1990s to mid 1990s are out there and like I said, there is always one or two that you can take a bid on. We don\u2019t normally look for those types of opportunities and we look for runs. So we have got open dialogue with a number of 767 operators and they know what our need is. We also have a very good reputation because we have got a strong balance sheet and they know if we say we are going to take 10 airplanes over three years and we can afford it, which is different than some of the other people that are competing for these 767s, which may be second- tier PAX operators or small cargo operators that may not be as well-capitalized as we are and therefore, we go to the head of the line with a lot of these folks.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then a follow-up in regards to the U.S. China trade dispute. Could you help put some perspective on what percent of your fleet could be potentially impacted and then also if the dispute does escalate, are you concerned that it might impact certain conversion costs such as materials? Thanks.\nRich Corrado: Yes, so in terms of existing customers operating in and out of China, we don\u2019t have any. The 767 from a TransPac operational standpoint is not the best alternative. Larger aircraft have better economics for customers choosing to move aircraft between those points. And so we don\u2019t really support customers that compete in those markets. We are very happy to have Air Incheon as a customer in that region. The flying they have talked about initially with the first two aircraft they are putting on does not include China; although I am sure in the future they will probably include that in an expanding network version. So right now as far as the leasing and the flying standpoint, we don\u2019t think it is going to have an impact that we can see on our business. In terms of materials and things like that, our cargo conversion supplier is in Israel, IAI, and so I don\u2019t think a dispute between the U.S. and China as an example is going to impact their ability to get their supply chain executed out of China.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then one more if I could. The update on the JV in China, I don\u2019t think you have given us some color here with regards to Okay Airways for some time. Thanks.\nRich Corrado: I think we have talked about it a few times. We had some strong regulatory delays over the course of late 2016 and into 2017 and during that time, the JV partners looked at some alternatives in terms of doing some different things while we were delayed, but since that time, we\u2019ve taken a step back and we are looking at our entire China strategy right now. So we\u2019ve suspended the joint venture as it relates to forming a new AOC, a new airline within China to fly cargo. There hasn\u2019t been a lot of cargo airlines started in China. There is one or two. I think there is an HNA subsidiary that started last year. And so \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t \u2013 one of the reasons we have taken a step back on it is from a leasing standpoint into China, you have got \u2013 you mentioned the tariff situation and there is some play in that environment. And then when you look at our strategy as it relates to Pemco and the Chinese conversions, it\u2019s really provided us with some new relationships with some existing airlines within China that are opening up some strategic opportunities on a number of different fronts across our portfolio of companies that we are looking to hopefully build on from there. So it didn\u2019t seem to be wise, if you will, to continue starting a brand-new airline in China given some of the headwinds that we were facing and some of the significant opportunities that are already existing with existing potential partners.\nJoe Hete: And remember, Chris, the focus for getting into the JV to begin with was just to give us a more preferred seat at the table for leasing aircraft in if we were partnered to an actual airline. But at the end of the day, it was really more about deploying capital through leasing of aircraft into the Chinese market, which you don\u2019t have to have a JV structure to do that.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay, all right, thanks for the time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jamie Yackow with Moab Partners.\nJamie Yackow: Hey, guys. Good morning, good quarter. So just a couple quick ones from me. There has been some rumblings that West Atlantic has been involved flying some aircraft for Amazon out in Europe. And I know you guys don\u2019t comment on customers specifically, but if there is any truth to this, would there be meaningful upside to lease more aircraft over to them?\nJoe Hete: We are not aware of West Atlantic flying for Amazon at this point. So that is the extent of what we can comment on it.\nJamie Yackow: Do you see opportunities to lease more aircraft over to them at this point in time?\nJoe Hete: Yes, we do. In fact, we\u2019ve just delivered our second 737-400 to them and we are in the process of prepping or will be in the process of prepping a lease return we are getting and we are turning that around and going to be leasing it to them. So they will have four 767-200s and two 737-400 s from us by the end of the year. So they will have added one in the fourth quarter of 2017 and two during 2018. So their growth is looking very good. They were the launch customer for the 737-800, Boeing converted 737-800 and they have a contract, a significant contract for three additional aircraft on top of that 737-800s with one of the larger integrators. So West Atlantic\u2019s well-positioned in the market on a number of different fronts. They have some great customers and we have been fortunate enough that that investment has allowed us to execute on our strategy, which is to lease airplanes into Europe.\nJamie Yackow: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Just a comment from me, just to kind of echo what some of the other callers have been saying. I mean we kind of in our analysis if you just run rate kind of a replacement CapEx for your existing fleet, you guys are still generating, and add in your regular maintenance, you guys are still generating a double-digit free cash flow yield and given the stability of cash flows and the growth outlook, I think we would be strong advocates for you guys to consider expediting some of the share buybacks at this point.\nQuint Turner: Duly noted.\nJamie Yackow: All right. Well, keep up the good work, guys.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to our speakers for closing remarks.\nJoe Hete: Thanks, Vanessa. I want to say thanks in advance to all shareholders who will be present in person or by proxy at our 2018 annual meeting tomorrow at the Roberts Centre here in Wilmington. We have plenty of room there, so come join us if you can. And last but not least make sure you remember your mother this Sunday on Mother\u2019s Day. Thanks and have a quality day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}]
