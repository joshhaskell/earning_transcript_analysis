I will now turn the call over to Ted Christie, Spirit's President and CEO.\nTed Christie: Thanks, Viv, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. I want to start by saying thank you to our entire Spirit team and our business partners for their commitment and dedication and caring for our guests and minimizing the negative impact from the rash of thunderstorms that have plagued us here in the Fort Lauderdale area and across much of our network in recent months. And while our reported DOT operating metrics for the quarter were negatively impacted by all the weather events, and a plethora of air traffic control initiatives. Our controllable completion factor for the quarter was very good, coming in at 99.7%. Turning to our second quarter 2023 financial performance. Operating margin was 3.3%, about 2 points below our initial guide. Total RASM for the quarter was strong and well above pre-COVID historical averages. However, demand for the peak summer travel period has not built as we expected, resulting in lower fare levels. We are comparing to a period of exceptionally strong domestic and near-field international demand in 2022, while at the same time, seeing a dramatic demand shift away from these regions towards long-haul international. Inclement weather and ATC disruptions in the peak part of June also contributed to the lower TRASM. These demand and pricing trends and difficult weather continued throughout July and are expected to continue into the fall. However, once the international summer travel season ends and kids go back to school, we expect demand will shift back towards domestic. This should mean a more normal pricing and demand environment for the peak holiday travel periods in the fourth quarter. Before Matt and Scott share further details about our second quarter performance and forward outlook, I want to update you on our issues with the GTF engine that powers our neo fleet. Last week, RTX shared that Pratt & Whitney had recently discovered a quality control issue during the manufacturer of a disc on neo engines produced primarily between Q4 2015 and Q3 2021. Out of an abundance of caution, Pratt has identified an initial 200 engines for accelerated inspection, and we were told that we had up to 13 engines in this group. The current plan is to begin pulling these engines from service after Labor Day, which will result in seven neo aircraft being removed from scheduled service. This is above and beyond the current set of aircraft on ground or AOG as we refer to them, which as of today sits at seven aircraft. For planning purposes, we are assuming these seven additional aircraft will be out of service post Labor Day through the end of the year. Matt will discuss this impact in more detail, but the close-in nature of the schedule reduction does have a significant impact on revenue for September. It is worth noting that Spirit is the largest operator of GTF-powered neos in the United States with the highest number of engines produced during the 2015 to 2021 period. Exposure to this issue is very unique and material for us and is having an impact on our margin. We should know by mid to late September, how many of the additional 1,000 engines Pratt has identified for inspection are ones we operate. Timing for the engine inspections on the next 1,000 is not yet known, but we believe it likely the inspections will need to be performed before the end of September 2024. Pratt has indicated that some of the 1,000 engines may already be scheduled for removal in 2024. So the net incremental impact may be smaller. However, we will learn more in September. We are still managing through a significant number of unscheduled neo engine removals due to an assortment of issues previously disclosed and discussed. Throughout the second quarter, we had six and currently have seven aircraft out of service and have assumed the same for the fourth quarter. That said, our maintenance planning team is gaining confidence by the end of the year, we should see discount reduce at least temporarily to about four aircraft. And while unscheduled removals should ease as we enter 2024, unfortunately, next year, we have a large spike in the number of scheduled neo engine checks as a result of a short time life-limited part, which means that we will have the equivalent of at least 10 aircraft out of service during most of 2024. This, of course, doesn't include any additional aircraft we will have to ground as a result of the latest engine issue. This new issue is yet another frustrating and disappointing development. RTX has promised to make the airlines affected by this new neo engine issue hole. And for now, we intend to take them at their word and use that assumption in our planning. The details and timings of those reimbursements are unknown as of yet. We'll keep you posted as we get further updates. Matt, over to you.\nMatthew Klein: Thanks, Ted, and a special thanks to all our team members. We carried a record number of guests and everyone involved continues to do a great job managing the high volumes while navigating the numerous weather and ATC challenges. I'll start with a brief overview of our second quarter revenue performance and provide some color on the demand environment for the third quarter. Total revenue for the second quarter was $1.43 billion, up 4.8% year-over-year. Total RASM was $10.03, a decrease of 10.7% on a capacity increase of 17%. Load factor was 82.9%, down 3.1 points year-over-year. Compared to Q2 2019, total RASM was up 9.6% on a capacity increase of nearly 30%, a strong result, but short of our expectations. On a per segment basis, passenger revenue per segment decreased 20% year-over-year to $57.86. Non-ticket trends remain strong, and on a per segment basis increased 2.9% or about $2 year-over-year to a second quarter record of over $70. Based on trends we were seeing earlier in the year, coupled with the knowledge of what performed exceedingly well in the summer of 2022, we made the intentional move to increase the number of longer stage flights heading into the peak summer travel period. In the second quarter, in aggregate, these routes performed in line with pre-COVID historical averages. However, we were anticipating they would outperform those averages and have results similar to what we had experienced in the recent past. In addition, demand did not build into the peak summer period as we had anticipated, leading to lower fares across the network. When we look at our second quarter revenue guide compared to flow in results, approximately 25% of the revenue miss was associated with elevated cancellations in the quarter and the balance of the revenue variance was split between longer haul domestic performance, as I just described above, along with a general regional demand impact. Ted mentioned earlier that we had to make a significant change to our September schedule due to issues regarding the GTF engines for Pratt & Whitney. We received the update on the last day before we put our September scheduled event. This update required us to remove seven available aircraft from the fleet on less than 24 hours' notice. Under normal circumstances, we would select a flying that is expected to have the lowest contribution to the network. However, in this situation, we had to remove flying that our already built lines of flying could offer up relatively easily since we didn't have time to build out an entirely new schedule. This results in an operating schedule that isn't exactly as commercially effective as we would otherwise set out for sale. We did remove nearly 5% of planned September capacity due to this specific engine removal issue, and we expect this new AOG issue will penalize revenue production in Q3 by approximately 1.5%, which is on top of the lost revenue for the original neo AOG issue, which we estimate reduces revenue by nearly 6%. So we do expect to smooth out our schedule in October, but the impact to top line revenue will continue until these issues are resolved. Turning now to third quarter guidance. We expect the demand trends in the domestic U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean to continue to be weaker than normal throughout the third quarter as a result of the carry forward of demand shifting to long-haul international and very difficult operations throughout the peak due to weather and ATC. Taking this into account as well as adjusting for the additional out-of-service aircraft, we estimate total revenue for the third quarter 2023 will range between $1.3 billion and $1.32 billion down 3.2% to down 1.7%, with capacity increasing 13.7% year-over-year. This equates to unit revenue being down 13.6% to 14.9% year-over-year in the third quarter. And with that, I will now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Haralson: Thanks, Matt. After briefly discussing our Q2 results and Q3 guidance, I'll share a few details about our recent fleet changes. Our second quarter operating costs were $1.39 billion. Nonfuel operating expenses came in at the better end of our expectations at $994.5 million. Fuel expense was in line with our guide. Fuel gallons were modestly lower, but average fuel price was higher than estimated. Compared to when we gave our guide in late April, crude oil prices improved crack spreads widened across the board, driving a fuel price per gallon for the second quarter of $2.62, slightly higher than estimated guide of $2.60 per gallon. On a year-over-year basis, lower fuel expense driven by a 39.1% decrease in average fuel prices, offset increases driven by more flight volume, additional aircraft rent and inflationary wage pressures. Total nonoperating expense came in better than we estimated, primarily due to a noncash benefit related to the mark-to-market valuation of the derivative liability associated with the 2026 convertible notes. As a reminder, when we give our non-op guidance, it excludes any potential change in the mark-to-market adjustment. Liquidity at the end of the second quarter was $1.5 million, which includes unrestricted cash and cash equivalents short-term investments and the $300 million of capacity under our revolving credit facility. During the second quarter, we retired three A319neos, took delivery of five A320neos and delivery of our first A321neo aircraft, ending the quarter with 198 aircraft in the fleet. We currently estimate that total capital expenditures for the full year of 2023 will be about $255 million. Looking ahead to the third and fourth quarters, the development of the new neo disc issue, together with our other remaining neo engine availability issues, drive lower overall capacity production that harms our efficiency. However, on a positive note, our pilot attrition has reduced and assuming this lower level of attrition continues for the remainder of the year we would have been at full fleet utilization by Q4. The recent frat news results in even less aircraft in our fleet being available for operations. And this means we will likely be overstaffed and carry more pilots than required for Q4 and into early 2024. With pilot attrition no longer being a drag on our utilization by the fourth quarter, we can now isolate the AOG issues and look at the core airline. The core airline that is excluding AOGs, should be back to full utilization by Q4 and is expected to be closer to run rate margin in CASM ex production. The drag on margin caused by the AOG aircraft should be viewed as neutralized due to RTX make-whole commitment. Now let me discuss some of the recent changes to the Airbus order book. Early this year, we were given delayed aircraft delivery dates for 2023 and part of 2024, piling up deliveries in 2024. In addition, it has been widely expected that these delays would continue beyond 2024. We also had some decisions regarding a few of our A319neo orders and option aircraft that needed to be made. Airbus has also been clear to us about their own production limitations and backlog of orders that will likely push new order deliveries into 2030 and beyond. Also, in the near-term, we need a general slowdown of growth to de-risk the business and give ourselves a chance to digest the previous few years of growth. Given all of these things and the fact that our original orders only extended into 2027, we started discussing a broader reevaluation of our future aircraft deliveries. At the end of the day, we agreed to make the following changes without changing the total number of commitments. One, we reduced 2024 deliveries by 11 and smooth the remaining deliveries between 2025 and 2029. Together with our direct lease commitments and the retiring of our A319, these changes slower growth in the near-term and provide us a consistent level of deliveries for the back half of the decade. Number two, we up gauged all of our A319neo orders to A321neos to be delivered between 2025 and 2029. And three, we moved the timing of our option aircraft decision by one year and smooth the timing of those options. A lot of moving parts here, all of which we believe are positive to both Spirit and Airbus. And we appreciate Airbus partnering with us together to make a meaningful agreement giving us a stable and predictable order book for the aircraft mix we view as most beneficial to Spirit. At the time we made these decisions, we estimated these fleet changes would produce the 2024 growth rate in the high teens. However, that was before learning about the latest neo engine issue. It will be a few more months before we fully understand what the impact may be on our 2024 capacity plans. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we estimate our operating margin will range between negative 5.5% to negative 7.5%. We estimate fuel cost per gallon will average $2.80 with total operating expenses ranging between $1.39 billion and $1.40 billion. Our third quarter guidance metrics are included in our investor update published today, a copy of which can be found on our website at ir.spirit.com. Before I hand it back to Ted, I do want to recognize our operators. The past few months have been a difficult weather and ATC environment and our crews, our airport staff, the operations control center staff and the other operation support personnel have been the ultimate professionals, and I wanted to give them a quick shout out. So now I'll turn it back over to Ted for closing remarks.\nTed Christie: Thanks, Scott. Although we made progress on improving our operating margin in the second quarter of 2023, we are clearly still underperforming our potential and face a challenging Q3. We acknowledge that some of this is due to decisions we made coming out of the pandemic. In hindsight, slower growth would have been more ideal during and coming out of the pandemic. This was largely impossible for us due to the pace of our contracted deliveries. That, coupled with high pilot attrition issues have been contributing factors and are struggled to return to full fleet utilization. It is possible that we are being overly conservative with how tight we are willing to run the network with the intention of supporting operational reliability but at the cost of penalizing utilization. Labor, weather and infrastructure issues have been volatile and unpredictable. But we are optimistic that some of our learnings over the past few years will help productivity in the back part of 2023 and full year 2024. Pilot attrition rates in June, July and indications for August are trending better than we expected, which is great. It also means that for Q3, we could have flown more hours on the peak days than we scheduled and has resulted in a missed opportunity. Nonetheless, assuming our pilot attrition rates stay where they are or improve further, our growth is no longer constrained by pilots, which bodes well for our core fleet, achieving full utilization in peak Q4. In fact, if we weren't burdened with aircraft being pulled from service due to GTF issues, we believe we could achieve full utilization on our entire fleet by year-end. We believe we missed out on some passenger volume in June and July holding out for higher yields that did not materialize, and we have revised our approach for the fall. Not surprisingly, accurately predicting the new normal demand levels post pandemic has been challenging. We are making tactical changes to our network post the Labor Day holiday, including more variation between peak and nonpeak day of week flying, which in this demand environment, we believe is the revenue and margin maximizing answer. The fleet decisions we have made, including the early retirement of the A319s, revising the pace of our aircraft deliveries beginning in 2024 through 2029 and up gauging more deliveries to the A321 variant should all drive fuel and other cost efficiency benefits in 2024 and beyond and allow us to deliver growth more in line with expected demand growth. In conclusion, the dynamics of the airline business are constant. One thing that I have learned over my two plus decade career is that things in the airline industry can change quickly and often. Sometimes the answer is to pivot and sometimes the better answer is to stay the course. The current setup is simply not favorable to a domestic-focused airline, especially while still operating with some lack of efficiency and productivity. I believe these things will change in our favor, and we are taking steps now to be positioned to capitalize on. Frustrations aside, our team is doing a great job adjusting as necessary, and I strongly believe our expected 3Q performance is an anomaly. Most important for us, as we trend towards a normalized utilization rate. We expect our cost structure to return to industry leading levels and provide us margin tailwinds and a considerable advantage against the rest of the industry. And now back to Vivien to begin the Q&A session.\nVivian Taveras: Thank you, Ted. We are now ready to take questions from the analysts. We ask that you limit yourself to one question with one related follow-up. Adam we are ready to begin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nConor Cunningham: Ted just comment of shifting day of week, it's been a big theme this -- just ignoring the potential fair impact. But just -- when you think about operational stress on the system, when you add more [Technical Difficulty].\nTed Christie: Hey, Conor, you're -- sorry, Conor, you're cutting in and out, but I think you asked about day and week variation and the operational effect of that, is that right?\nConor Cunningham: Yes. Sorry about that part.\nTed Christie: Okay. No problem. So you're right. I mean one of the things that we implemented as a result of our learnings from 2021 here was that we started to smooth the airline out a little bit more, because it is easier for particularly airport ops to understand and schedule the airline. But that is only one of the many things that we've implemented as part of our operational enhancement package. And I alluded to that in my comments that we have quite a few things that we've done to make our operation run, and I think it's been having a nice effect. And so as part of the learnings from that, we're looking at things that are most effective and some of the things that we did that weren't having as much of an impact. And so we believe that while we're not going to stress the airline too much going from peak to off peak. There is some opportunity for us to drive some of that, which will help unit revenue, and we think it helps the margin at the end of the day, particularly in the off-peak period.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then on the GTF issue, you mentioned that perhaps talking about making a whole. I'm just -- I know you expect that to play out. Is that -- I mean I think Alliance talked about maintenance credits? Just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.\nTed Christie: No problem. Yes, it's still early. This all developed quite quickly on us. As we said, we had to make quick changes to September, which is not favorable at all. But one thing I will say about Pratt, we're a long-standing customer. This is a storied institution in the United States, one of the biggest industrials in the history of the United States, and we've had a long-standing partnership with them, and they've always stood by their customers, and they've always honored their commitments. And so we expect that to be true. They've intended to make us whole on this issue, and that is our expectations. But coming to the details of what that will look like and how it will take form, it's still too early to tell.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, good morning. Thanks. Ted, your comment about holding out for yield was kind of interesting. I think there was a line in the press release about an acute reduction in demand. Can you talk about when you first saw that kind of acute reduction in demand? Is it sort of the other side of the coin of maybe holding out for yields? So I assume it was kind of late in the quarter issue? And any color on the markets where that was kind of felt most acutely, maybe Caribbean, et cetera?\nTed Christie: Sure, Duane. Thanks. I'll give just a brief intro, but I'm going to let Matt coloring around the edges. I think some of the points you made, and we used the words intentionally drive home as we saw was very acute. We feel like it's isolated and noticeable and ties nicely with what we've witnessed and now heard people talk about rapid and distinct shift away from domestic and near-field international, which was very strong last year to long-haul international, which is obviously considerably outperforming this year. And our strategy around handling yield clearly was patterned off of what we were seeing over the last 12-plus months, and that did not play out well towards the end of June. But Matt, what would you add about geography and that sort of thing?\nMatthew Klein: Sure, Duane. I can -- one perfect example, I think, as you touched and talked about Caribbean there for a second, is Cancun would be an example of some of the abruptness that occurred during the quarter for us is April, within the same quarter, April, we saw incredible demand strength, pricing power and sold out flights basically every day. And then less than two months later, we saw in June, which is still a very strong time for Cancun reverse with unit revenues, in some cases, down very high double-digit numbers percent change year-over-year. And that's all happening within the same quarter, and that's how abruptly things kind of moved. And we have a couple of other examples like that, but that's probably the biggest example. And having said that, our capacity is up a little bit in Cancun. So some of that could be explainable, but not to the level that we actually saw. And the industry has added some extra capacity there, too. So it's always about supply and demand. But in this case, the demand just fell off. And as we talk about yield and think about June, but then also into the third -- end of June, and then into the third quarter. We took a position that we had been seeing really for the last 15, 16, 17 months of the demand will be there and will come in and the yields will be impressive. And that just stopped relatively quickly. It's not that it went completely away. It's just that it stopped at the same pace that we had seen. And really, we just -- we held out a little bit too long expecting to see those yields come in. Once you make an adjustment to that, then you are sacrificing yield for volume, and then you need to see the volumes come in. So we are anticipating and starting to see the volumes come in. They're just at lower yields than what we'd like to normally see for third quarter. We have described this as an acute situation, and we are expecting to see demand trends here in the domestic U.S., but also near-field international as well as U.S. territories bounce back. And look more normal as we get out of the summer into the fall, and then especially at the peak periods in the fourth quarter.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Any themes on the originating city aspect to that demand change? Or did you see sort of variation depending upon what region of the country you're originating from?\nMatthew Klein: No, not really, Duane. It feels like it's spread. I mean being heavily East Coast oriented, has an effect on some of the demand where that demand decides to go, because as you would expect, Transatlantic, Europe is not too far away from the East Coast, relatively speaking. So there was an impact with that. But in general, we saw impacts, but East Coast really took it probably the most.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's great. I really appreciate that color. And then just on the engine issue, and this may be impossible at this point in time. But of this kind of negative 6%, negative 7% margin outlook for the third quarter. How many margin points do you think these specific engine issues are costing you? And to the extent that there's reimbursement sometime down the road, how would you size that headwind as of today?\nTed Christie: Sure. So we think the easiest way to think about the margin impact of this issue is really driven by our utilization and productivity. And given where we are right now with fleet utilization, which takes into account all the aircraft on ground that we have today, we're probably missing 7-plus margin points as a result of that, broadly speaking. Now some of that can be attributed to some of our own restrictions, which we alluded to before about how we're running the airline. But the vast majority of it is because we have AOGs. And so we're going to be obviously in discussions about what the impact it's having on us. And it is unfortunately for us, in the United States, we're really to stand out here. And so it will be an important discussion that we have with the folks at Pratt and RTX. But as I said earlier, we've got a very strong partnership with them. They've always stood by us, and they've always honored their commitments. And we have no reason to expect that would change here.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. So I know there's a lot of talk about the shift international in days of week. But if I take a step back, is it just possible that we've now finally surpassed pre-pandemic domestic capacity. At the same time, corporate demand is somewhat diminished from where it was and legacies are forced to just be a little bit more focused on leisure. So there's just too much supply relative demand for some of the smaller carriers, and we just sort of reached that inflection point to possible that's what's just happening right now?\nTed Christie: Yes, good morning, Scott. So look, I mean, the nuances of establishing what impacts demand are difficult to arrive at as you would expect. But given what we experienced in the latter part of Q2 and what we're seeing here in Q3, we wouldn't describe it that way. We would describe it as clearly a shift in demand geographically. And so we think that that move probably costs us 400 basis points on the margin this quarter. And we don't expect that that will repeat next summer or in the fourth quarter more closely in. And so I wouldn't say nothing that we're seeing right now says that we have a noticeable supply demand imbalance. In fact, if you look at what's been happening over the course of the recovery from the pandemic, unit revenues across the Board are up. And admittedly, we're considerably larger, but the industry is only modestly larger, and it would tell you that there's, there's plenty of demand out there. So I don't know that we see data yet. I mean your supposition would say, is it possible? I suppose anything is possible, right? But it's entirely possible that right now, there's an artificial lid on demand, because corporate travel hasn't returned and because people are fatigued with the operations that we've all been dealing with over the last year and a half. And it becomes exhausting when you sit at an airport and you're delayed six hours because of air traffic control initiatives and ground delay programs. So I mean, there's just as much as there's always possibilities that there's changes happening in the demand profile. I think there's just as many that say it's possible that we're seeing some things that are artificially living demand. So again, we're more focused on what we saw in the second quarter and what we're expecting here in the third, and we think that that's what's driving the disconnect in our performance.\nScott Group: Okay. That makes sense. And then just given the merger and I guess the uncertainty of the merger, how do you plan for capacity growth next year? What are your initial thoughts? And I guess, how much capacity growth you need to have a shot of getting CASM down next year?\nTed Christie: Well, the good news is, and Scott can jump in here after I'm done, is that the primary driver of getting the CASM where we wanted to be is getting the productivity of the existing assets to where we want it to be. So that's not necessarily about -- I mean, obviously, that drives growth because utilization will in fact drive growth. But as Scott said, we feel that we would be at that in the fourth quarter, excluding the AOGs with Pratt. That will help us get to our expected more expected kind of CASM trajectory, and that should be a tailwind for us. So looking at 2024, it's a little cloudy right now, because we originally thought we had a pretty good beat on what was happening with the fleet. We made the necessary adjustments, which I think were smart. And then, of course, we just received information two weeks ago that kind of changes that. So what would you add to that?\nScott Haralson: I think that's right. So Scott, I think it's about utilization first and foremost for us. I mean we've been running a pill for the last few years trying to catch up to the amount of aircraft we've been delivering. And with the changes in the Airbus delivery stream that we negotiated, I think, put us in a pretty good spot to try to navigate all of the different variables that are moving and let us feel comfortable that we're able to generate margins that will tell us that we should be growing again. I mean we got to earn that right to grow the airline. So we got a return utilization, return margin and cash reduction. And then we can start to lean forward. But I think we want to make sure we can digest the capacity. We've taken over the last few years, get utilization to where it is, and kind of get our skis underneath us, and then we'll move forward.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for the color on pilot attrition. Just wondering if you have any year-on-year numbers that you could share. Also, is the new contract having the desired effect of increasing applications or is it merely slowing attrition? Either way, it's obviously positive?\nTed Christie: Yes, it is positive. And the attrition numbers are stabilizing in ranges that versus where we were at peaks. And you'll recall on our Q1 earnings call in April, we alerted that we were seeing some alarming attrition levels. And as a result, we pulled some capacity from the summer. Those ended up being the anomaly. So we're now at levels that are much more akin to what we were experiencing in the early part of this year as a result of the deal and give us confidence that as we move forward, we've reached some stability. Now, I think obviously, a new contract does create stickiness for existing pilots. Our recruiting team is doing a fantastic job at navigating the environment and we're having great success at attracting new pilots as well, full classes every time. And the engagement there is really strong. And as a one anecdote. We -- like I said, we've noticed that there have been pilots leaving us and a number of other lower-cost airlines going to the majors. We've now experienced numbers of what we're calling boomerang pilots, where they've left us, gone to another airline and are coming back. And I think it has to do with a mix of, obviously, the contract itself. The quality of life that we offer and the combination of those work life balance, benefits, pay and the word of mouth is spreading. So I'm encouraged by all of that. We can't rest on our laurels. We've established new programs that give our pilots much more touch time and concierge type feel, and it's working. And so for now, that gives us some confidence that it will no longer be the limiter. And it really comes down now to fleet. And that's how we work to solve this problem with Pratt.\nJamie Baker: Got it. Thank you. And that leads into my second question, and this is probably one of the most theoretical questions that I've asked you over the years. But if you could choose between the GTF issues completely disappearing tomorrow, gone, or having corporate demand immediately recover for the big three and not just to 2019, but back to where it should have been in 2023, which of those would you choose? Can't have both and have one or the other?\nTed Christie: I can't have both. Okay. Well, I think my answer would be to have the Pratt issue resolved. It's localized to us. It makes us stand out. We don't like it, neither do they by the way. And it's crimping what drives this business, which is productivity and low cost. So you're right that having another demand funnel open up would be good for the broader industry. And I couldn't argue that, that wouldn't help the whole industry a little bit. But when thinking first specifically about us, I would feel better about having our house in order and our fleet where we want it.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you everybody.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Trent with Citi. Your line is open.\nStephen Trent: Good morning everybody. And thanks for taking my questions. Just quickly, I was wondering, I was intrigued by what you said about Cancun. On your Mexico flow, have you actually seen over the last year or so, any tailwinds in terms of cross-border demand considering that the FAA has not restored Mexico's Category 1 aviation safety rating and [indiscernible] not linked up yet, et cetera. Just wondering if that's created any opportunities for you? Thank you.\nMatthew Klein: Hey, Stephen, it's Matt. So we have added a little bit more in Mexico overall. We haven't really seen a lot of the cross-border sales benefit that you're discussing or, I guess, asked about. Almost all of our Mexico demand is point of origin in United States. And believe me, well, I'd tell you that I wish we saw more coming out of Mexico. It's the vast, vast, vast majority for us is a point of origin U.S.\nStephen Trent: Great. I appreciate that, Matt. And just very quickly, when you look at the challenges, I mean, not just you guys, everybody with air traffic control and the other issues out there were storms. Any high level view with respect to longer-term strategy of maybe doing more with crew bases in certain regions versus today? Thank you.\nTed Christie: Sure, Stephen. So you're right. I mean the whole industry has been very vocal about the challenges we face, and I know weather is a driver of that. And it's certainly appears to be noticeable that there has been a shift in the weather patterns. But we don't believe that the weather patterns really fully account for the changes and what we're experiencing from a level of disruption, delay in cancellation. And let me give you like an interesting data point. So pre-pandemic, in the second quarter of 2019, Spirit canceled about 700 flights for weather. And if you'll recall, which you may not, but in the very early part of this -- of the second quarter of 2019, we had a very difficult Easter period because of a storm pattern that moved through Florida. It was very noticeable and it turns out it was the first indication of some of the challenges that the JAK Center control center was having. So we're about 30% bigger today than we were in 2019. So we should have expected to see around 900 to 1,000 cancellations in the second quarter of this year. Instead, we canceled 1,700 flights. So weather alone doesn't describe what's happening. What's happening is that the staffing shortages at the variety of different control centers throughout the U.S., which has been widely publicized are limiting their ability to navigate the airlines around the challenges, and it's putting us into a real bind. So what we're trying to do and what we've done over the course of the last couple of years is we've done exactly what you suggested. We've put significantly more investment into things that previously were just easier to run. So adding crew bases has turned out to be one of the bigger wins for us, in fact. And we've added -- since 2019, I think we've added maybe four or five crew bases. So it's been a noticeable shift, and that's helped the scheduling team create a little bit more ease of recovery. And that's just one example of a variety of different things that we've done to insert buffer to create recoverability. We've reduced the average line days for our crews, they used to go out on average around four days and now they go on average around two days, and that makes it easier to recover there. All of this is intended to make the operation easier to recover and more reliable, but it doesn't come for free. And so we, like the other airlines are doing our best to lobby with the Department of Transportation and the FAA to put the necessary infrastructure in place in the air traffic control system so we can start to run more efficiently, which will drive lower cost and lower fares, which is really the best answer for the country.\nStephen Trent: That's very helpful. Really appreciate the color. And thanks for the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nThomas Fitzgerald: Hi, this is Tom Fitzgerald on for Helane. Thanks so much for the time. First question looks like you're growing a lot in the third quarter in Phoenix, Charlotte and Los Angeles. I just wanted to get -- just curious if you had any color on those markets in particular. And then just as a follow-up, just a quick modeling question. I know the base case assumption seems to be that the regional shift in -- the regional demand mix will shift back to something more normal in the fourth quarter. Are you pre-COVID, you'd usually -- 4Q revenue would decline a little bit sequentially versus the third. Last year was up. Is it just from a high level, would you expect it to feel like last year it would be slightly up versus the third quarter or still down a little bit. I just appreciate any color there. Thanks so much.\nMatthew Klein: Hey Tom, it's Matt. So your first question regarding Phoenix, Charlotte and Los Angeles. We have seen pretty good success in these cities which is why you're seeing the growth there. We did pick up an extra gate in Charlotte, and we've also picked up extra gates in Los Angeles, and we're utilizing them. That's what we do. And we've seen growth -- our own growth in Los Angeles has been very effective for us. It's helped build out our presence out on the West Coast a little bit more. It makes us more relevant in general in Los Angeles, which then helps the overall Los Angeles revenue generation and brand awareness out there. And Phoenix is just another leisure destination in the country that it's time for us to start doing a little bit more work there, really. And then in terms of Q4 versus Q3, the answer would be, generally, yes, we'd expect to see trends that you mentioned kind of continue out there. So we would expect to see that kind of growth in Q4.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good morning everyone. Two questions here. I just -- I want to go back to maybe Scott and Jamie's question just about the big three and the fact that corporate is down and they've been allocating more assets into leisure markets. And I'm really curious though, like how much of the capacity or markets that you're in where you've seen other low-fare carriers adding capacity and whether or not you sort of have a sense of sort of versus 2019, how much in your markets low-fare competition or capacity is up because it does seem like when you look at a lot of the different route changes that have made of late, it does seem like a lot of the low fare carriers are all targeting the same markets and in many cases, they are going after the same customer. How much of that is a factor or maybe it's not, maybe it's not much of a factor. I'm just curious about your take on that? Thanks.\nMatthew Klein: Sure, Mike. It's Matt. I'll try to tackle that one. So we have seen from pre-COVID really until now. Our overlap has generally been the same across the industry with a couple of exceptions. One is, as you just noted, our nonstop overlaps with Frontier have increased a bit. But with Southwest, we've gone down. So kind of a trade-off there amongst, I guess, you'd say, low fare carriers. And overall, we -- generally speaking, we of course, when we decide where to fly and how we pick roots and pick new cities, we're evaluating the overall landscape, and we're evaluating what's going on in general, and we do take into account who is already operating in certain routes because as we put together our forecast, we have a lot of history in understanding how we think the routes will perform and the competitive dynamics, while different city to city generally can help us predict what we think outcomes will be. So having said all that, in a normal environment, routes that we can target domestically not to sound a little bit arrogant about it, but a lot of times, it doesn't matter who's already there if our forecast play out and we think that we're going to grow markets, which is what we do. It generally doesn't turn into a big issue. The issue that we're seeing right now is with this move towards international long-haul traffic. Some of the competition right now inside the U.S. is competing for what might be lower demand profile than what we were all probably anticipating, at least we were anticipating a different demand profile this summer. So generally, I think to answer your question is even though we do see competition and we are growing on top of other people and just like they are on top of us from time to time, generally hasn't been an issue for us. This summer, we feel is incredibly unique that we're seeing some of these impacts. And as we noted, we expect this to flip back as we get into the Fall and the peak holiday periods when just in general, customers just take shorter trips and they're looking to stay more state side. And we expect that will then turn back into the normal demand patterns that we're used to all seeing.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Great. Good answer. And then just thanks for that. And then just second, more of a modeling question. You obviously, a lot of moving parts here with the GTF issue. How should we think about 4Q capacity, your sort of revised capacity number for 2023 and then what does that mean for 2024, especially since you've cut back your deliveries for next year, just rough numbers since I know it's early? Thank you.\nScott Haralson: Yes hey Mike, this is Scott. I'll take a stab and then Matt can opine too. So looking at sort of the move between second, third and fourth with the reductions that we've had from the GTF, the new GTF issues, probably looking at -- you probably have a slight reduction in Q3. But with the increase in utilization, we would expect Q4 to be a good bit higher than Q3. We haven't finalized the exact capacity schedule for Q4, but I would expect somewhat material move north in capacity. And thinking about '24, I mean, obviously, the news is fresh on the additional GTF issues. So it's hard to predict where 2024 will look like. But I did mention in the prepared remarks that with the moves we made with Airbus, we expect it to be in the high teens. So the expectation is a lot of that growth will be muted by the engine issues. Hard to know if we're going to be in the single-digits or flat or low teens, hard to tell at this point, but my guess would be somewhere in the single-digits for '24.\nTed Christie: And one other point that I'll make, Mike for the fourth quarter, and I said it in my prepared remarks, Pratt had indicated that we were going to see up to 13 engines in this initial allotment. And given the tight time frame and that it was effective, the inspections would be effective in September, we pulled seven aircraft out of service for the month. However, they're continuing to refine the universe of engines, and it's entirely possible that we may see some benefit associated with that, which means that our exposure in the initial allotment of 200 could go down. And if that's true that would give us more opportunity in October, November and December with productive airplanes. And given that what we've just talked about with pilots, we definitely have those available ready to fly. So we don't know yet. It's all kind of in the soup, and we're just going to have to update you as we learn more over the course of the next month.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, very good. Thanks gentlemen.\nVivian Taveras: Adam, do we have any other calls or questions?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Your line is open.\nDaniel McKenzie: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Picking up on that last point, the uncertainty around 2024 is pretty understandable. But going back to the script and the need to slow down growth and de-risk the business, has your thoughts about growth beyond 2024, also they've also moderated. How should we think about growth longer-term?\nTed Christie: Well, I can start. And Scott alluded to some of these changes in the script. We still see a sizable opportunity. So that hasn't changed. I think what we're alluding to as far as the near-term is that we continue to grow pretty notably on a fleet basis throughout the course of the pandemic and haven't been able to use them. We just haven't been able to get the utilization where we wanted it to be. So taking a chance to digest those airplanes and get them up in the air and efficient will help the unit cost story, which helps the margin story. So the work that Scott and the treasury team did with Airbus was a cooperative effort between ourselves and the manufacturer to smooth out deliveries, give us more certainty into the latter part of this decade where airplanes are going to be very, very difficult to get your hands on and allow us to use the lessor community to supplement that one and if we feel like it's necessary. So there's a lot of moving parts in our fleet as is true for every airline. We're retiring 319s right now. We're going to get pretty close over the next five or six years to the oldest 320s, believe it or not in our fleet and starting to have to think about what happens with those and whether or not we keep those around. So there's ups and downs that we'll deal with, but the opportunity itself still hasn't changed for us. So it's just a question of pacing and that sort of thing.\nScott Haralson: No, I think that's right. I think we smoothed out the delivery stream. So prior to this adjustment, we were having some peaks and troughs that were pretty material. So this allowed us to smooth it out, give us a predictable base and allow us to, as I mentioned earlier, to sort of earn our way into the growth profile again. And we'll use the lessor community like Ted said, give us some flexibility, we have some ability to extend and or retire early additional aircraft. So this gives us a good base to maneuver with as we think about going forward. I think the long-term story is still the same. We think there is opportunity for us to continue to grow. And so what was the best fleet mix and platform for us to do that. And I think we set ourselves up well for that.\nDaniel McKenzie: Okay. I guess just in terms of an actual growth rate, are we thinking that longer-term target -- that growth target is still, call it, low double-digits? Or does it mid-double-digits? Any sort of perspective around that?\nTed Christie: Well, if you just, I think mathematically roll out the airplanes, it's less than that now. Certainly, as you get bigger, into the future. And that's why I say, I think we're evaluating the pace of things. Scott said it earlier, I think it was a great point. We have to earn our right to deliver the capacity and getting back to full efficiency and starting to deliver the margins we believe that we can is our first step. So this was a good idea to kind of for a lot of reasons, to smooth things out for ourselves and gives us a chance to kind of prove all of that, and we have the right team here to execute to it, but we need to get the job done. And I think that's what this kind of recent modification allows us to do.\nScott Haralson: Yes. I think the point there too is that the growth is not an isolated objective, right? We need the returns to be able to justify it. And so while we think that will be the case, we do need to make sure that we're doing that before we deploy the capital. And so I think that's just prudent management for us to sort of see the game plan first.\nTed Christie: And we haven't commented a lot on the pending transaction with JetBlue. But as you can see from the results that have happened across the industry really here, the dominant oligarchs are outperforming the rest of the industry and that's not an accident. When you control that much capacity, it's very difficult to compete, especially with the diversity of revenue sources, the strength of their loyalty programs, the strength of their credit card programs. We do our best to fight that every day with low cost and low fares, but you can just see from the numbers. And we think the best answer for competition is to create a fifth alternative. And clearly, with that engine, there's going to be unique growth opportunities. And that's the case we intend to make -- and I think that's going to be the best answer. If it doesn't work and we're stand-alone, we still feel good about our prospects. But it's not to say that the recent experience hasn't shown that there are some challenges out there. And I think we're just doing what we would -- you would expect us to do as management, which is to be a little bit prudent, make sure we're pursuing the growth in the right way.\nDaniel McKenzie: Yes. Perfect. Second question here, this idea of an artificial lid on demand that you shared due to ATC issues. Is the thought that, that will persist until 2025 when the ATC is expected to be fully staffed? Or I guess, is it just more temporary just sort of tied to some issues today because it's so severely understaffed?\nTed Christie: Well, admittedly, I'm speaking purely on speculation and anecdote, but I've experienced it. So having flown -- I fly a lot, and it can be frustrating when you're stuck at an airport for three, four, five, six hours because of ground delays and all the things happening. And I think that may be making people make different buying decisions. And so I don't know how long that persists. Clearly, during the summer, it's at its peak. We don't anticipate that during the fall or the winter where actually it's a little bit easier to operate, we're going to see that type of frustration. I think it happens a lot during this period, which is when everyone is traveling and the weather is bad. But I think it's just a theoretical impact that I can tell you that first person experience, I've witnessed, and it's very -- you can understand how people might say, \"You know what, I may not add that third trip to go see my family because I just can't afford to spend nine hours back and forth waiting\".\nDaniel McKenzie: Yes, makes sense. Thanks so much for the time guys.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good morning everyone. Just bit of a follow-up in terms of your thinking of 2024, but more so from how much of that pre-GDS, like when you were thinking of high teens, how much of that growth was going to come from utilization? I'm just trying to think about as you're exiting this year and going into next year, you might not need as many kind of training and hiring costs and your utilization improves. So that should be a pretty good tailwind, but I'm trying to just quantify that a little bit more.\nScott Haralson: Yes, hey Savi, this is Scott. Yes, I think you're spot on with some of that. As we thought about the high teens, it's really made up of really three things. And they're both probably in the five to seven points worth of move. But we'll probably grow the fleet above five points in '24, you have utilization move year-over-year, which is probably five to seven points worth of impact. And we have average seats for everyone. And that's probably another five-plus points. And so that gets you in the high teens. And so your point is right, really two of those are less impacted by pilots. But I think we're -- we feel good about our pipeline. We've talked about that before, no longer pilot constrained. So now this is just getting the airline humming again. So I think we're in a good spot. Unfortunately, we do have to deal with the next batch of GTF issues, but we feel comfortable about the core part of the airline.\nSavanthi Syth: Regarding the GTF and like if you do get settled with the Maple, how does that flow through the P&L? Is that a special item and it helps your cash? Or how does that kind of flow through?\nScott Haralson: Yes, Savi, we're early in the discussions around what that might look like. So difficult to say. It could take a few different forms over different lengths of time. So we would have to figure out what the accounting would be based on the vehicle. But we'll let you know when that materializes.\nSavanthi Syth: Thank you.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Vivian Taveras for closing remarks.\nVivian Taveras: Thank you all for joining us and for your participation today.

I will now turn the call over to Ted Christie, Spirit's President and CEO.\nTed Christie:\nViv: Regarding our merger with JetBlue. As expected, in early March, the DOJ sued to block the transaction. The trial date has been set for October 16, 2023. The creation of a fifth challenger to the big four with both low cost and low fares seems to us to be 100% aligned with the government's views on a competitive industry. So while we are disappointed with the DOJ's decision, we are confident that we can successfully illustrate to the court the significant benefits to both consumers and employees of the JetBlue Spirit merger. Turning now to our first quarter 2023 performance. Our adjusted operating margin came in better than expected at negative 6.8%, helped by lower fuel on a strong total RASM performance. Operationally, numerous weather events during the first quarter made for a challenging operating environment and it was exacerbated by the continued understaffing at various air traffic control centers throughout the country. Lately, we've seen Las Vegas, where we are now the number two carrier emerged as the newest hotspot as runway construction has driven unprecedented approach and departure configuration changes and ground delay programs, creating significant delays and cancellations. That said, our team has done an excellent job minimizing the impact to our network and solving for problems within our control. In our mid-March update, we shared that we pulled about 0.5 percentage point of capacity from the first quarter due to an increase in the number of unscheduled engine removals. Pratt is a long-term partner and is working closely with us to help solve these engine availability issues. Unfortunately, there is no quick fix, but we do expect to see some improvement as we move throughout the year. Before I turn it over to Matt, I want to give some extra kudos to our entire Spirit team. In mid-April, the Fort Lauderdale area experienced severe flash flooding referred to by meteorologists as a 1,000 year event, requiring a 40-hour closure of the Fort Lauderdale airport, where we are the number one carrier. As a result of this weather event, Spirit canceled nearly 600 flights and diverted many others, disrupting travel plans for a substantial number of our guests and driving numerous complications for our crews. Despite the significant and outsized disruption to our network, our team was primed and ready to go on Friday morning once the airport reopened. The quick recovery is a testament to the diligent efforts of our entire team as well as the innovative changes we have put in place to help accelerate recovery operations. I also want to thank the Broward County Aviation Department, and the FAA for their assistance in getting the airport up and running as quickly as possible. Matt, over to you.\nMatthew Klein: Thanks, Ted. I also want to thank the Spirit team members for their contributions during the quarter. Load factors on the peak days were quite high, and our team did a terrific job caring for our guests. Turning now to our first quarter revenue performance. Compared to the first quarter last year, Total revenue was $1.35 billion, up 39.5% and total RASM was $10.22, up nearly 24% on a capacity increase of 13%. This was a great outcome and continues a trend of strong top-line revenue production. Load factor increased 3.6 percentage points versus the same period last year. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2022, we were dealing with fallout from the Omicron variant, which had an adverse impact on flow and load factors. So while load factor for the first quarter 2023 was up year-over-year, it was a bit lower than historic norms for the period. As noted previously, we have been flying more on off-peak days and we have had less variability in the number of flights operated by day of week since the summer last year. However, given the technology investments we have made together with network changes, and changing how we flow our aircraft as well as opening additional crew bases, we are comfortable that we can begin to have a more varied day a week schedule again, while maintaining good operational performance. Beginning in June, we will start to introduce a more varied day a week schedule again, which should fuel improve the load factors and benefit unit revenue as well. On a per segment basis, total revenue per passenger increased to over $127, a 12% increase compared to the first quarter 2022. Passenger revenue per segment increased about 17% to over $57 and non-ticket per segment increased over 8% to a first quarter record of $70. Important to note for the second quarter of 2023 on a year-over-year basis, we will begin to compare our results to a period of unusually robust TRASM performance on a year-over-year basis. In other words, the comparison to last year is not a true reflection of the underlying demand strength we continue to see. It feels like we are returning to a more normalized seasonality period much like we saw prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of our network structure, we had reduced our Latin American and Caribbean footprint to under 20% of our capacity for an interim period of time, while we were dealing with a fluctuating fleet plan due to issues that Ted previously mentioned. We are now ahead of that curve again from a planning perspective, and that has allowed us to resume our growth in this region. Starting next month, we are back to having at least 20% of our capacity in Latin America and the Caribbean on a monthly basis. Taking all this into account, we estimate total revenue for the second quarter 2023 will range between $1.46 billion and $1.48 billion, up about 6.5% to 8% on a capacity increase of 17.7% compared to the second quarter 2022. This equates to a total RASM estimate of down 8% to 9.3% year-over-year. As a reminder, second quarter last year benefited greatly from pent-up travel demand. So while total RASM is down year-over-year, the demand environment does remain very strong. If you were to compare this expectation to the second quarter of 2019, it equates to total RASM being up 11.5% to 13% on a capacity increase of nearly 30%, which is an excellent result. And with that, I will now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Haralson: Thanks, Matt. I will start by covering our Q1 results and some Q2 guidance updates, and then I want to outline a few things happening in our business today. Our first quarter operating costs were $1.44 billion, with both fuel and non-fuel expenses coming in better than expected. Fuel price per gallon was still up significantly, up 16% year-over-year. The good news is that we have seen fuel prices decline over the past couple of months with correct spreads coming down over that period. The current curve implies that WTI will remain roughly flat, so a tote that crack spreads will continue its downward trend. Total non-operating expense came in higher than estimated due to the periodic valuation of the derivative liability associated with the 2026 convertible notes, driving about $2 million of additional non-cash expense in the quarter. Liquidity at the end of the first quarter was $1.7 billion, which includes unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and the $300 million of undrawn capacity under our revolving credit facility. During the first quarter, we took delivery of five A320neo aircraft and retired four A319ceo aircraft, ending the period with 195 aircraft in the fleet. We are taking delivery of our first A321neo aircraft over the next week with seven more expected before year end. We are excited to be introducing this larger fuel efficient variant of the A320neo family of aircraft into our fleet. Our first A320neo aircraft and interservice scheduled service in June. We disclosed in our investor update last night that total capital expenditures would be about $360 million, with $75 million of that coming from net PDPs. We received updated delivery dates from Airbus recently, and that number is now reduced to $20 million. We will modify the investor update today. So total capital expenditures will be approximately $305 million, of which $20 million of this is related to net predelivery deposits and about $150 million is related to our new headquarter facility in Dania Beach, with the remainder primarily related to engines and spare parts. We are on track to begin phasing in the occupancy of the new facilities in the first quarter of 2024. Looking ahead to the second quarter, there are a couple of items to highlight that are included in our second quarter 2023 guidance. We estimate the flood in Fort Lauderdale earlier this month cost us about $8.5 million of operating income or about 50 basis points on the margin, primarily from lost revenue. And in mid-April, we reached an amended collective bargaining agreement with our flight attendants represented by the AFA, which adds an estimated $9 million of cost to 2Q and $24 million for the full-year of 2023. Taking these items into consideration, for the second quarter of 2023, we estimate our operating margin will range between 4.5% to 6.5%. And this, along with a few other guidance metrics are noted in the investor update furnished in our Form 8-K filing with the SEC, a copy of which can be found on our website at ir.spirit.com. I mentioned this specifically because we are now providing our guidance in a separate investor update rather than in the body of our earnings release. So with all that said, for clarity, I want to highlight five overall key takeaways. Number one, our utilization has been and will continue to be hampered by NEO engine availability and pilot attrition, both of which should gradually improve throughout the rest of the year. We signed a new pilot contract at the end of last year that put our rates towards the top of the industry, but we have yet to see attrition rates improve to the levels we are expecting. We are disappointed, but we are assuming attrition levels will improve as the year progresses. Number two, growth during this period of inefficiency has not been as productive as it would be in a normal environment. It is a challenge to improve profitability and recover a lost utilization on simultaneously growing with more aircraft. We know that and it will remain true in the short run. However the growth opportunities are significant. And once our constraints are remedied, we expect to return to accretive and efficient growth. Number three, operations are solid and investments in the operation and changes in our infrastructure and network are paying off. Our ability to handle disruptive activity is much improved as evidenced by our fast recovery after the sudden airport closure in early April. In the past, this would have been a much more impactful event. Number four, we estimate our full-year CASM ex-fuel will be about $0.07. CASM ex-fuel should decline throughout the year as NEO engine availability and pilot attrition improves and we estimate our CASM ex-fuel exit rate for the year will be in the high 6's. And number five, we are still on track to be profitable in each of the remaining quarters this year and anticipate we will be profitable for the full-year. Given the external constraints on our business, our capacity is heading towards the lower end of our full-year 2023 guide of 18% to 20%. Not being able to operate the airline we want to right now is obviously frustrating and this demand environment and with declining fuel prices, if we were operating at full utilization, the business should be producing double-digit operating margins for the second quarter. We are, however, running a great airline, and I'm proud of the way our team members are taking care of our guests and committed to handling all of the unique curve balls that are being thrown our way. So a big thank you to all of the hard-working Spirit team members. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks, Scott. The outlook for peak summer leisure demand remain strong, both domestically and internationally. Non-ticket revenue per passenger segment is robust. and we anticipate seeing a sequential improvement from the first quarter, and the setup is favorable to have a new record performance throughout the year. With our 235 seat A321neo deliveries beginning this month, and the A319 retirements well underway, we will be gradually increasing our average gauge, which will drive efficiencies that will benefit our unit cost and fuel burn. Pilot attrition is still too high, but our new deal coupled with the unique benefits to our team members associated with the combination with JetBlue and an improving pipeline in new certificated pilots will we expect, provide some relief in the coming years. In conclusion, while we are facing several headwinds related to staffing and fleet and have continued to grow our business in what has proven to be a particularly challenging environment, our team is doing a great job managing the volatility and making tactical adjustments to our plan and although it may take as much as another year to get to normalize profitability, double-digit op margins are insight, which will provide a base from which we can continue to refine and improve. And with that, Bailey, back to you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you, Ted. We are now ready to take questions from the analysts. We ask that you limit yourself to one question with one related follow-up. Bailey, we are ready to begin.\nOperator: [Operator Instruction]. And we will take our first question from Duane Pfennigwerth. Duane your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on the attrition, Ted, I wonder if you might put some numbers to it. I don't know if you can talk about kind of a monthly attrition rate and what improvement you've seen and versus what improvement you were hoping for and what your line of sight is for stabilization there?\nTed Christie: Sure. Thanks, Duane. So when we signed our deal, we did anticipate that attrition would begin to mitigate, although we knew it would take some time. And we were pleasantly surprised with the results January, February and March. We saw sort of an anomaly in April, which put it back into the levels we saw last year. And that's kind of made us be a little bit more conservative in our view, but we don't know if that's a one data point or not. So we're certainly not, we're still very optimistic that the results will come in the way we hope. And I think all you're hearing from us is it's still an issue. And over the course of this year, we expect it to continue to mitigate and go down. We haven't disclosed the actual rates, but I can tell you, just like we said before, it's definitely elevated. We are successfully recruiting the number of pilots we need right now to make the airline run, but you can imagine there's quite a bit of infrastructure and training involved in handling that that as this improves, will be a tailwind to costs.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then maybe one for Matt. Just with respect to the trade-off between load factor and yield. I wonder if you could backtrack a little bit on the first quarter. Is this an outcome that you anticipated from a load factor perspective, maybe sitting in the beginning of March? Or did you see some resistance in the month of March to high fares. And then I guess the punchline is looking forward, I appreciate your comments about day a week getting more refined on the schedule out into June. But are we taking more of a kind of load factor active approach here into the second quarter given the experience of the first? Thanks for taking the questions.\nMatthew Klein: Yes, sure, Duane. Thanks for the question. Let me just start off by saying just as a general statement, the demand remains strong out there. The off-peak period in Q1 performed as we had suggested on our last quarterly call, we talked about this. So this was not a surprise to us at all and what we saw in Q1. And I think it's important to add the spring break was very strong. It's continuing the trend of peak periods showing both load factor and yield strength. For the rest of Q2, we expect the next month here to be a relatively normal, what we would call shorter period, but then we'll ramp up, which we expect will lead to a strong Memorial Day holiday and strong June in general. Just for some added detail on that, we are anticipating through normal seasonality, we could see around one week of shorter period demand in early June between the holiday ending and schools getting out for the summer across the system. As we all know, schools getting out generally then kicks off the peak summer travel season. I would add though that by comparison in 2022, that early June shorter period that normally happens, it didn't really happen last year. And summer really started a couple of weeks early last year from a realized results perspective, a little bit unusual last year, but everything was a little bit unusual probably last year. I'd say the takeaway with all that is that normal seasonality continues to return to the Americas, which is where we're operating with one caveat. The off-peak periods we're a little bit off normal trends and the peaks are performing so much stronger than normal trends. We expect that to continue the win through Q2 and Q3. And I give you all that detail because this is the level that we think about this. When you talk about fare versus load factor trade-offs, we're thinking about and targeting what we know to be shorter periods, you don't really have a true off-peak per se in Q2. And as you know, Q3 doesn't really hit anything like that until you get after Labor Day. So we are targeting periods that we think need more volume. We will target those with lower fares if we need to. The Tuesday and Wednesday situation for us even like post-Easter in May, we would normally have a little bit of Tuesday, Wednesday pull downs in those shorter periods. So a little bit of a headwind for us there. All of that will be tailwinds in the future, especially once we get past Labor Day, presuming that we'll be able to hold up with these new operating trends that we like to see. So long answer to your question, but the reality is we are still seeing some periods that need low fares. We're doing that when we need to, but we expect the peaks to be very strong. We expect the yields there to be relatively healthy as well. Last year was very, very strong. So we'll see if we can catch last year. But in general, the strength is still there. We expect to realize that.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And then just maybe one minor follow-up there. I guess just on load specifically. Longer-term, to the extent there is a longer-term for Spirit, what is the target load factor that you're driving towards or that you're solving for? And again thanks to you both for taking the questions.\nMatthew Klein: Yes, sure, Duane. I wouldn't say there's exactly a target load factor that we're shooting for. Clearly, for us, volume because of our non-ticket and the model in general, with non-ticket revenue strength, higher loads does obviously help us to some extent. But what we're not going to do is just sell low fares for the sake of selling low fares. We're looking at total revenue production, and we always have that in our calculus. When we have off-peak periods, we will definitely drive more demand with low fares, but it can be very, very yield dilutive to try to get one more point of load factor in an already a peak period that can have pretty detrimental effect. So we're thinking about all of that when we think about total revenue generation.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nMatthew Klein: All right.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Jamie Baker. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning everybody. Actually, just one for me today. So the takeaway feels like many of your current challenges are considered transitory. And I'm sure some of them are. I mean, globally, discount airlines still appear to have the upper hand. But the longer it takes for Spirit's challenges to get sorted out, during that period, the more SkyMiles members get signed up, the more big three credit cards get issued, the stronger the big three international margins become. I'm confident, Spirit can do better and perhaps the merger solves for this, but simply doing better doesn't mean that you restore the pre-COVID margin superiority that you used to enjoy. So I guess I can see a path towards improvement, but not a restoration of consistently superior margins to those of the industry. What am I missing?\nTed Christie: Thanks, Jamie. Plenty of loaded questions in there. Look, and thanks for your expression and confidence. We agree with you that while it is a challenging environment right now, we do have line of sight to addressing the issues that get us back to the margin production we expect. And it's hard to say what the future will be from a normalized perspective when you compare a more legacy product against a low-cost product. You really don't know right now what will happen with the macro economy? What will happen with capacity? What history has told us is that in times, a very strong premium demand out large legacy carriers do relatively outperform, and then in down cycles, low-cost carriers tend to outperform. But the good news is that low-cost carriers when they're operating at peak efficiency are the most resilient models in the business. And that's really what we're pushing towards. I mentioned that double-digit op margins are well within sight at this point. That's still not where we would target ourselves, we're usually looking at a number that's more towards the mid-teens level on the upside. And so it's incumbent upon the management team to start to refine the way we get there once we kind of cross the hurdle of getting into the double-digit territory. And I think we have ways to do that. I've mentioned a couple of them on this call and prior that as our airline matures through this phase, we're going to start picking up real margin points in our fuel burn effectivity. We're moving more and more towards NEO aircraft faster than any of the big four, which relatively will pick up absolute margin points, probably based on our calculation somewhere between one and two relative to where everyone else is today. You couple that with the unit efficiency of the larger gauge airplane in this demand environment, where it is basically untapped demand. We should see relative efficiency in the way that our more fixed costs are spread the cost of the airplane, the cost of the crew on board the airplane, the way that our fixed costs at airports are charged. And all of those things create margin efficiency, which we expect we will claw back incremental points that way as well. And so we will be and are tackling those to get us back to the kind of target way we think about things. Will that be the best margin in the business? Don't know. I think that, as I said earlier, I think it's a pretty good season right now to be a legacy carrier, but that's not always true. And so we'll just have to do what we do best, which we will do and see how the rest of the industry shakes out.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Thanks for that. I'll yield the floor. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Savanthi Syth. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Matt on for Savi. First question, maybe if you could just talk about how you're expecting utilization to trend throughout the year, particularly what rates are embedded into that 4Q exit rate in the high 6's?\nTedChristie: I can start. This is Ted. And Scott, feel free to jump in. So we've been saying all along, we're on a steady march here to a more normalized fleet utilization, which would be total aircraft divided by block hours. And or excuse me, total block hours about a total aircraft. And right now, that fleet number is artificially penalized with the number of aircraft on ground we have in the NEO fleet, because of the engine issues, which we expect to start to move in the right direction, but won't be fully remedied by the end of the year based on our current expectations from Pratt. So full utilization in the fourth quarter for Spirit, used to be lower than average utilization for the year. It's a lower utilization quarter. But it's somewhere in -- on a fleet basis in the high 11's. So 11.6, 11.7, 11.8 hours per day, 11.8 hours per day. We're still sort of moving in that direction and expect to get pretty close to that number by the end of this year. But that's artificially limited by the number of aircraft we have on the ground right now. And we're expecting in there to continue to see crew attrition mitigate that will help us catch back up. So next year, we'll still have some recovery in it, but we're definitely moving in the right direction. Scott, do you want to add anything?\nScott Haralson: Yes, that's exactly right. Q4 is typically lower, just seasonality is the point there. But like that said, we won't be back to full capacity in Q4. Even if we do reach historical Q4 levels, which are generally lower, we won't be at -- what we would call full capacity. So we would expect that to happen as we enter 2024, but Q4 will be close to historical utilization levels.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you, both. And maybe if you could just on the operational front, maybe provide an update what you're seeing in Florida in terms of ATC there. And then also, any additional color on Vegas, how long you expect that to persist? Thanks again.\nTed Christie: Sure. Thanks. So the good news is we are seeing some progress in Florida. And that's excellent news for Spirit, given the exposure we have here and how important Florida is to us. In fact, based on the FAA's own data, delay minutes in the first two months of this year versus the first two months of last year, actually down in both the Jacksonville Center and the Miami Center, the two most important routing centers in Florida, which is a positive trend. I suspect some of that is related to gently improving staffing, although not fully staffed in those centers, but also the airlines have reacted by having less capacity. So it's beginning to have the effect. So that's the good news. The bad news, however is that in the Northeast, we're going to have a very challenging setup. This summer, and we've seen the FAA voluntarily or asked the airlines to volunteer to not operate slot positions in the slot-controlled airports, and I know some of the larger airlines who operate there are partaking in that, we will have a very small presence of doing the same because we're relatively small in that area. But that's going to be a challenge. And I believe I heard JetBlue mention that staffing there is nearly half of what they expected to be or what it was even in 2015. So that's not a good set up. And then in Las Vegas, when we look at the same data compared to the first two months of 2022 versus 2023, delay minutes are up 1,600%. That's not 160%. That's not 16%. That's 1600% which is driving real problems for the larger airlines in and out of Vegas. And while Vegas, we are the #2 airline in Vegas, it represents about 25% of our domestic capacity. So there's runway construction there, which will move through the summer. And once that's done, we hope that, that's a step in the right direction, but we're going to see challenges in and out of Vegas probably through the remainder of the summer. And that kind of leads me to a thought, which is over the last decade or so that I've been at Spirit, and I imagine even prior to that, and I know most airlines have been doing this, we have been actively lobbying the government for significant investment in the air traffic control system. To take the United States back into a premier position and increase efficiency across the network, which is good for the environment because it will reduce fuel burn, it will improve the utilization of slot-controlled airports today. There is room at airports in the slot controlled areas. It's just that they're restricted because there's not enough airspace, but an improved air traffic control system will improve that. And what that does is free up capacity for low-cost carriers, which will stimulate competition. All those things are very much aligned with what they say they're doing, but they're not doing that yet. And so we as a carrier, we're advocating for that. And we said, well, if we can't get better competitive hold on the industry that way, then help us in real estate constrained airports. These large legacy hub airports where the incumbent carrier is very inefficient in the use of their real estate, and we're the opposite of that. And we're saying to the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation, hey, help us figure out a way to free up some of that real estate so we can enhance competition that way and we've routinely been told, no. We can't do anything there. So then we go to our third option, which is, well, I guess we need to get bigger because scale is the best way for us to compete with these dominant airlines that control 80% of the capacity in the United States. So we've been getting bigger over that decade, obviously, dramatically so, but it's not having fast enough. They continue to use their -- the power of their networks to stifle our growth and our effectivity and it's something that we try to tackle every day. So instead, we did the next best thing, which was we decided we're going to merge with another airline and they're saying they're going to object to that, too. It's quite frustrating for us around here where we say, we're trying to stimulate competition, and we've come up with real ideas and it's not happening yet. So as I said in my prepared comments, I think we have a really good path towards a stronger fifth competitor, which will still be half the size of the fourth competitor, but one that can actually start to create competitive balance in the industry. And I think we'll lay out a very successful case. But in the meantime, we will be looking for the government to find ways to improve the air traffic control system and to provide more access for low-cost carriers in constrained airports.\nUnidentified Analyst: Very valid points. Thank you, Ted.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephen Trent. Your line is open.\nStephen Trent: Yes, good morning everybody and thanks very much for taking my questions. Just one or two for you, actually. So the first, you mentioned that 20-some-odd percent of your capacity should be back to Latin America and the Caribbean, I believe. And any high-level view on how the weighting of that deployment may have changed versus where you guys were in 2019?\nMatthew Klein: Yes, Stephen, it's Matt. Yes, so a lot of our growth from, say, '18, '19 into today, we had our very successful Fort Lauderdale franchise heading to South America, Latin America and the Caribbean out of Fort Lauderdale. Late '18 into '19, we started to grow Orlando South as well. So a lot of the growth initially started in Orlando and then throughout the last few years, we've really seen a relatively large increase for ourselves. And what you call -- some of it's sort of tourist leisure like Cancun and other growth has been in what we would call VFR traffic, which to some extent, you can call Puerto Rico, both tourist and VFR. So we've really grown a lot in Puerto Rico as well, and we're continuing that growth with some new routes actually starting next month and into the summer as well. So we're excited about all that. The advanced bookings look strong there for us as well. And it really continues along where we do well, and our model works great. Low-cost lead the low fares and it's great, especially for VFR traffic, so we can create travel opportunities for people that may otherwise not have them.\nStephen Trent: I appreciate that, Matt. And really also appreciate your guys' comments on the regulatory situation. I'm just curious, in that regard, I know you reached an agreement with the pilots you're still seeing some attrition. Do you think that it's going to be necessary for regulatory-related steps to help use the situation. I know there was kind of a proposal out there to raise the retirement age of pilots and this kind of thing. And anything else you think that the regulatory side could help in terms of pilot supply? Thank you.\nTed Christie: Sure, Stephen. This is Ted. Yes. So on that front, obviously, the airlines have been advocating for some changes there. And I think you mentioned one of them, which is move in the retirement age, which would really act as a short-term buffer as retirements in the industry are going to be peaky here for the next two or three years. But the other has to do with the way the training and experience is gained for pilots. And there's some discussion about the minimum of 1,500 hours, how you achieve those 1,500 hours, are certain hours' worth more than other hours. So if you spend time in a dual engine airplane, for example, you spend time in a simulator or you're doing things. Are those hours potentially worth more than if you're flying a single engine airplane. Those types of debates are out there and going on. And I think that we're certainly supportive of that kind of thing because we see that there is tremendous demand for people who want to be professional pilots. I think that, that is absolutely happening. The career is a very attractive career and there are now considerably more avenues for private individuals, not members of the military because we are seeing considerably less pilots come out of the military than we used to have for private individuals to gain their certification and become a certificated commercial pilot, but it still takes a while and it's expensive. And so there are ways for the government to ease that, either in the speed at which they gain their certification or allowing the application of 529 Programs for pilots who want to use that to gain their experience. There's a number of things that we believe and are being advanced at the government level will help the industry because, again, at the end of the day, what we're really talking about is competitive fares for travelers. We, as an industry are limited today on how much capacity we're deploying. You're seeing it in small communities where regional providers are actively cutting capacity because there are no pilots to serve. And so getting more pilots will be good for the consumer, be good for fare levels. And it would be great for us because we can continue to expand and probably expand into those markets that are now vacated, which is a tremendous opportunity going forward.\nStephen Trent: That's super helpful. Really appreciate that, Ted.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Conor Cunningham. Your line is open.\nConor Cunningham: Everyone thank you for the time, just around your growth as we think about next year, a lot of these constraints feel a bit stickier. I know that some of them are a bit of a onetime item. But just maybe it would be helpful if you could provide some context on how fast you plan to be growing as you exit 2022. I mean, again, like when I think about your original capacity plan in August of last year, basically half the size of what you wanted to grow so you lost a fair bit. So just trying to understand your growth algorithm as we think about 2024 and beyond. Thank you.\nTed Christie: Sure, Conor. I'll start. Scott, you can correct me where I'm wrong. So I disagree with you that the constraints are sticky. I think the horizon by which you consider them maybe the debate but over time, our fleet will get remedied. We will have a full utilization of the fleet, probably over the next year. And when we do, that fleet will be the most fuel-efficient and the youngest fleet in -- amongst the youngest fleet in the world, which will provide us with a significant benefit on the maintenance side and the reliability side. So I do think that, that's obviously an active constraint right now. It's one that's very frustrating for us, but I think that, that does get remedy because that's purely engineering and throughput in that side of the business and those guys are experts in solving that problem. The secondary constraint is labor. And clearly, we've all learned that the pandemic was a generational disruption in that regard. And I don't think any of us did a good job at forecasting the impact of that. And we're all reaping the benefits of choices that had to be made during to preserve the vast majority of jobs to keep the industry healthy to have capacity available for people who wanted to travel when there was limited or no demand. All of those things are now bearing fruit, and it's working its way through the system. Supply and demand will eventually intersect. There is a considerable number of people who want to be professional pilots. We see it in the number of people who are filing for their licenses. They need to work their way through the system, which will take some time. We have a lot of pilots retiring, they're reaching the maximum age, which is a downward pressure on that. But again, that will rectify. And once it does, those two constraints are lifted. Don't know exactly when they happen, but I don't think they're sticky.\nScott Haralson: Yes. Maybe a third component of that, Conor, is supply chain and really in regards to aircraft. Obviously, we've talked about delays in deliveries and they've been relatively small. I mean we're talking over the '22 to '24 period, about 10 aircraft get moved out of that period. So it does help smooth deliveries a bit. I mean we'll take 24 deliveries this year and plan for 37 deliveries next year, of which 23, 24 of those will be A321. So we'll still see significant capacity growth next year in terms of fleet size and a return to utilization. So the numbers we haven't given yet, but it will be considerable as we think about next year. But supply chain will help smooth deliveries and that will kind of give us a little bit of a reduction as we think about next year, smoothing into '25 and '26. But all those three things together, a return to full utilization or whatever we call full utilization at that time and the return or at least a predictable supply chain of aircraft will be a component as well as we talked about the 319 retirements, those will also be in our calculus as we think about capacity growth. But all of that sort of yields a capacity growth of some significant number next year.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, that's helpful. And then I'm still -- this is to Matt. I'm still a little surprised on the implied unit revenue guide for the second quarter. I mean I totally get the comp this year. That makes a lot of sense. But relative to some of your peers, you're underperforming a bit. So I was just curious if you could unpack that a little bit more, Duane talked about the load factor or seal. But is there anything else within the network that we should be aware of that is kind of impacting the second quarter specifically? Thank you.\nMatthew Klein: Yes. I think -- no, I think I touched on it earlier. Really, it's -- these shorter periods are a little bit weaker than we've seen in the past. The peaks have been very strong. So we're comfortable with all that. We recognize that our guide is a little bit below what others are talking about. Some of that is still the way that we have the network set up by day of week. So there is still a little bit of a drag in there for that. Last quarter, for example, in the first quarter, some of the drags we had out there, we had predicted to be about 1.5 points of TRASM drag and it actually came out to be just about right on top of that number, we calculate. And that has to do with some of the things Ted mentioned too, with the Jacksonville center constraints that we've seen in there, day of week flying is still not exactly where we would like it to be. These will all become tailwinds for us as we think they will be by the time we get to the end of this year into next year. So we're still dealing with that a little bit, overall demand just remains strong. And really, last year, part of what we're looking at here is we're comping our own incredible strength last year as well. So we took a very large step-up in unit revenue production as well as capacity growth last year. So we are comping a period that is incredibly strong. I'm not 100% updated for other airlines that reported this morning, but our top line growth versus second quarter of '19 is going to be up 45% versus second quarter '19. So we are growing the revenues there. It looks -- and there's one metric, it looks like we're behind the industry year-over-year. But if you go back to pre-COVID to today, we're performing very well.\nTed Christie: I think that last point -- this is Ted. That last point that Matt made is one of the most important ones. It's difficult to precisely calculate. But coming out of the Omicron variant which really depressed Q1 last year. Q2 screened and where did it screen Florida because nobody was going international yet? And where are we biggest, Florida, and I think we reaped the benefits of that, which we're thrilled about, by the way. So New York, the Northeast, those things didn't do very well last year in the second quarter, and they're probably going to do better. So I think that what you're seeing is the abnormalities of the exit of COVID starting to work its way into normal seasonality, which is why you got to smooth it a little more than just year-over-year.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Helane Becker. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hey everybody. Thanks for the time, team. Can you say how much of this is for Matt, how much of second quarter is already booked?\nMatthew Klein: Helane, we don't comment on that. We never have historically, and we're not going to start today as well. Sorry about that.\nHelane Becker: No, that's quite all right. So my second question then is if you can talk about the number of aircraft that were grounded during the quarter because of engine issues. And if you get the sense that Pat says, we'll just give you an engine this week and kind of to keep you quiet. And then when you complain loudly, again, they give you another one as opposed to really having a plan for delivering as they're supposed to do.\nScott Haralson: Yes, Helane. Good question. So it's been volatile through the quarter and to date in the second quarter. It's bounced around from sort of three aircraft to six aircraft and we work with Pratt on forecasting the slide forward to see what engines we expect. Obviously, we have our own VOD issues occasionally that may drive something and turn times of engines that are in the shop, those are exiting. So all those variables create volatility in the number. But we're probably going to be looking at five, six aircraft as we think about heading into the summer, we'll see what happens after the second quarter. But it's going to be something that's not a quick fix, as we mentioned in the prepared comments. It's going to continue through the summer into the Fall and the end of the year. So we'll probably be dealing with this for the next sort of seven, eight, nine, 10 months. And we'll have to see where both throughput of shop visits and production from Pratt ends up, and we'll have to see where we end up.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Thank you very much. And since I got shut down to my first question, can I ask about the new corporate headquarters and how we should think about the spending for that, where that shows up? Is that included in the numbers you've already given us? And what percent is it is complete?\nScott Haralson: Yes. So Helane, from a CapEx perspective, we'll spend about $150 million or so and we're probably -- sorry, this year in CapEx to clarify. And we're probably 60% spent and developed on the property. We'll spend in total, including what we've already spent, which is we bought land in 2019 of $40-something million and we'll spend some this year as well. So we're probably in the sort of $200 million-ish probably a little more than that actually, and we'll spend some that will spill over into 2024. But the total cost is probably in the $275, $280 million range, and we spent 60%, 70% of that to date. And we're probably on a completion of the facility in a similar number.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg. Your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg: Good morning everyone. Hey, Matt, I have a question just on distribution through Google Flights, the price guarantee program. I did see that you're one of the few airlines that seems to be testing it out, I guess. Any early reads and I guess maybe just a bigger question here is that we are seeing a lot of different alternative forms of being able to sell tickets. And it's -- given your low cost, it does seem like these platforms that are out there maybe lower cost than anything except, I guess, other than direct. What are your thoughts on it and just maybe the evolution here, any color would be great?\nMatthew Klein: Yes, sure, Mike. So just to be clear, the product you're referring to on Google with their guarantee, that's something that Google is doing on their own through their own algorithms and their own analytics. So we are not specifically participating in that guarantee. That is something that Google is doing on their own. But it leads into your second part of your question there, which is about having this NDC, new distribution capability, distribution of our product and our content, and partners like Google are very good partners in that, and then they're ingesting our content, and they're not the only ones. There's a lot of progress that we've made on this topic. This has been something that's been going on for seven, eight years of a journey and a lot of other airlines are starting to talk about this in terms of progress that they've made recently. We made all this progress really before COVID and through COVID. So we're very comfortable with understanding how this new distribution capability works. And it's great for us because it gets more of our product out in front of our customers further in advance of travel. So whether the customer wants to say, for example, add that big front seat to their itinerary upfront, it's not necessarily that they add it right away, but the fact that they're introduced to it or that they see it more often leads to better take rates later on, better take rates will then lead to better blended rates as we call it, or the price of the service charge down the line. So more engagement leads to more volume, which should lead to better yields, which leads to overall better revenue production. That's the idea and we think it's great that other airlines are starting to catch up on that because the more ubiquitous this becomes for the industry, just the better distribution is overall for customers.\nMichael Linenberg: That it's sort of along those lines, if I were to go back, I don't know, 15, 20 years it would seem that the majority of what was purchased at the first point, 90%, 100%, maybe you bought a soda on an airplane and a bag of chips. For you guys today, like what percent of your revenue is actually purchased maybe in that second or third or fourth transaction. Is -- that's got to be moving away from that initial not just ancillary, but I'm thinking things like car rental, hotel, et cetera, that's got to be shifting to the right, right?\nMatthew Klein: Well, yes Mike, it is. We don't talk about the metrics publicly that you just brought up, you bring up a great point and you're following on to it perfectly. That's exactly how we think about distribution and the more engagement -- look, this is why we're not the only ones. This is why apps are important. The more engagement you have with your airline specific app, just the more that you're introducing product and to the customer. And that's why we've spent a decent amount of investment in getting our technology up to speed and really improving from where we were, say, five, six years ago, to today from a technology perspective for guest-facing technology is night and day from where it was. And we do think it's important and we do expect there to be a lot more improvement on that front as we move forward. We have -- we still -- as great as our progress has been, we still have a lot of opportunity to still capture there.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, thanks. Thanks for answering my questions.\nOperator: And the final question will come from Dan McKenzie. Your line is open.\nDaniel McKenzie: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. My last two questions -- my two questions really sort of put a fine point on some of the ones that were asked before. And just going back to the release and the outlook for improving margins throughout the year. Is it really just utilization and cost driven? Or is there some network normalization that can contribute to RASM and margin improvement as well. And I guess in the past, you shared that the network this summer was going to be suboptimal just given the air traffic control understaffing in Florida. You guys have addressed that. You talked about Latin America, but I guess just higher level. I'm wondering if the -- where the overall network stands -- what kind of revenue penalty, if any, is embedded in the second quarter outlook? And if the network evolves to get planes where you want them, if that's going to help you drive better unit revenue later this year?\nTed Christie: Sure, Dan. This is Ted. I can kick off. Matt, you feel free to offer anything. But I think you're right, we're definitely seeing improvement in at least as it relates to Florida. And we're getting closer on a percentage basis to pre-pandemic network percentages in and out of Florida. However, given the demand strength and forward, we probably want to do more. And so we still are artificially limiting ourselves in and out of floor. It's probably another point on the margin right now, by the way. And so it won't get better immediately because we're going to watch how things operate throughout the course of the summer in the peak. And then we head into the Fall. And if we have good signs, that will allow the network team to start to relax a little bit more in and out of Florida. So there's definitely still room to go there. You heard Matt mention about Latin America. We are excited about opportunities that continue to evolve there and that will be a tailwind to us as well. So to the first part of your question, margins improving throughout the course of the year, which is our current view. It is a mix of utilization, improving the overall marginal throughput of the business because you're getting just a better spread on unit cost and unit revenue. And that's some of it. But the rest of it is continued optimization of all the things that kind of hammered us during COVID, which was throttling the network in certain geographies and inserting a lot of buffer in the system to make sure that we had the ability to recover while we were deploying new technology and new processes in our scheduled planning process. So a lot of block pad and a lot of turn pad and a lot of buffer in and out of tougher geographies that, again, as we learn more and deploy the right systems and processes, which appear to be working, we can start to relax some of that and you gain more efficiency that way. So it's sort of all in there. We think utilization is amongst the biggest lever, but those other things are meaningful, too.\nMatthew Klein: And Dan, one thing I would add to that, too, is in order to try to run even more efficiently, especially maneuvering through some of the air traffic control issues this summer where we took an approach to extend our stage. Our stage had kind of shrunk in a little bit for about six months or so, and we're pushing that stage back out so we can produce the capacity, produce the available seat miles unless departures should help us overall from navigating through air traffic control a little bit better. So that's an example of something that we don't talk about that much, but that's an example of trying to find more creative solutions to some of the constraints that are hampering us and hampering the industry for that matter.\nDaniel McKenzie: Yes. Very helpful. And staying on that point here of double-digit margins in the path back there, you guys have done a great job today detailing the transitory issues in a resolution. But yes, just going back to an earlier question, is it possible to put some loose brackets around how transitory they are three to six months transitory, one to two years, and are the pieces there to get you to your double-digit margins next year?\nTed Christie: So we don't know for sure. And that's part of the frustration because they are somewhat outside of our control, most notably on the fleet side. But we are encouraged by what our partners are doing to remedy the issue. Although as Scott mentioned earlier, we expect the fleet to continue to have penalty throughout the course of the summer at the levels we're seeing right now, and it really won't start to improve until probably the third or fourth quarter. But the reason for that delay is that we are seeing significantly more engines input into the shop. And those should start to spit out in the Fall and winter of this year, which assuming all of that executes well, then we can start to gain in some confidence and probably do a better job at bracketing it for you. But based on the current plan, we should expect improvement through this year and into 2024 on that side. On the pilot side of things or the broader staffing side of things, we're just going to have to digest a little bit more Intel before we can call it, for sure. We've only had our new deal in place here for about 3.5 months. And we do have a looming transaction with JetBlue, which we think will be highly accretive to all constituents, our team members, the consumer group and our shareholders. And when that actually that uncertainty is removed, I think that's going to be a natural stimulus for any staffing challenges we face. And so there's probably some of that in there as well. So I wish I could put exact terms to it, but it does feel like it's over the next year or so as we call our way back.\nDaniel McKenzie: Perfect, thanks so much for the time guys.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time.

My name is Abby and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Spirit Airlines Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I will now turn the conference over to DeAnne Gabel, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, Abby and welcome, everyone to Spirit Airlines\u2019 fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast.

And with that, I will now turn the call over to Ted Christie, Spirit\u2019s Chief Executive Officer.\nTed Christie: Thanks, DeAnne and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today and a special thanks to everyone on the Spirit team. Together, we overcame many challenges throughout the year and thanks to our team members\u2019 dedication, we made excellent progress on the steps necessary to return Spirit to sustained profitability. Demand was robust during 2022 and our team did a great job maximizing revenue production, including achieving another record for non-ticket revenue per segment. Operationally, the team delivered solid results with an overall mid-pack performance from both DOT on-time performance and completion factor despite our network being impacted by multiple weather events and infrastructure bottlenecks. We are positioned well to build upon our 2022 successes and I will share more about our 2023 goals before we get to Q&A. Before discussing our fourth quarter results just a quick update about the pending merger with JetBlue. We announced in December 2022 that Spirit and JetBlue had certified substantial compliance with the DOJ\u2019s second request and are now waiting to see whether the DOJ filed suit to block the deal or allows us to proceed. We anticipate hearing from the DOJ in the next 30 days or so and that\u2019s really all we have to say on that topic for now. Turning now to our fourth quarter 2022 performance, operationally, the quarter started off with the tail end of Hurricane Ian impacting our operations, followed by tropical storm Nicole and then by severe winter weather across the U.S. during the peak holidays. As a result of these weather events, we canceled over 1.5 percentage points of our anticipated fourth quarter capacity. The good news is that our team did a great job mitigating the down-line impact from these events and took excellent care of our guests. I am grateful for their efforts and I am honored to be part of the team. The revenue environment in the fourth quarter remained strong and total RASM for the quarter was up 17% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 on 22.7% more capacity, this was even stronger than we had anticipated. In fact, adjusting for capacity increases, our unit revenue performance was amongst the best in the industry compared to 2019. Costs also came in better than expected. And as a result, our adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $57.6 million, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 4.1%. While our fourth quarter results were better than expected, we continue to face headwinds in returning to normalized margins and full utilization. As you may have seen in our release yesterday, we have once again trimmed our capacity expectations for 2023. Over the last 6 months, the GTF neo engine has experienced diminished service availability, an issue that has been steadily increasing over this period. This is not just a Spirit issue. Pratt & Whitney continues to struggle to support its worldwide fleet of neo aircraft as MRO capacity remains constrained and turnaround times for engines in the shop have been nearly 3x longer than the historical averages for CO engines. To put this in perspective, within a 2-week period, we went from having 2 A320neo aircraft parts without operable engines to having 7 A320neo aircraft sidelines due to these issues. When operating, the neo engine performance and fuel efficiency is great, but the engine\u2019s time-on-wing performance has once again declined. We are working with Pratt & Whitney on finding a solution that will increase time on wing performance, but it is frustrating that this has become an issue again. In addition, we have been notified by Airbus that a number of our expected 2023 deliveries will be delayed until 2024, which may cascade some aircraft into 2025, all reducing the number of aircraft delivered from Airbus and our lessor partners by 7 shelves in 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we made the decision to accelerate the retirement of our A319 fleet, which Scott will share more details about. We have had some good news. Florida operational constraints have been gradually improving. However, we will remain methodical and deliberate in building back Florida and relaxing the crew buffers that we have been forced to add until we have more confidence in the infrastructure that supports the airline industry. With that, I will hand it over to Matt and Scott to share additional details about our fourth quarter performance as well as some color around our first quarter outlook before I close with some thoughts on full year 2023. Matt, over to you.\nMatt Klein: Thanks Ted. I also want to thank our Spirit family members for their contributions. Our Spirit family members are our greatest assets and thanks to their dedication and professionalism, Spirit is able to deliver the best value in the sky. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we will once again compare our results to 2019. But going forward into 2023, we will return to year-over-year comparisons. Turning now to our fourth quarter revenue performance, total revenue was $1.39 billion, up 43.5% compared to the fourth quarter 2019, the largest top line growth of the major U.S. carriers that have reported results thus far. Total RASM for the quarter was $0.1081, up 17% versus 2019, while we simultaneously increased our capacity nearly 23%. Demand was strong throughout the quarter, especially over the peak Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day holiday period, which helped mitigate the revenue impact from weather-related flight cancellations during that time. Load factor was down 3.8 percentage points versus the fourth quarter of 2019. But as we explained last quarter, this is primarily because we are flying more on off-peak days and have less variability in the number of flights day-to-day at any given airport. We believe this better supports our operational reliability and is more likely to maximize earnings in this environment. On a per segment basis, total revenue per passenger increased to $136, a 23% increase compared to the fourth quarter 2019. Passenger revenue per segment increased 22% to $64 and non-ticket revenue per segment increased 23% to over $71. This was more than a $4 sequential increase in non-ticket revenue per passenger segment from the third quarter 2022 driven by strong take rates for ancillary services combined with the ongoing benefits of our revenue management initiatives. Looking ahead to first quarter 2023, January started off very strong due to the shift in peak holiday return traffic. However, demand over the Doctor Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend was a bit soft compared to historical periods. This softness was not surprising given that many schools had just gone back into session. President\u2019s Day holiday weekend is shaping up very nicely and we are expecting to see continued strong demand trends over the spring break period. Our self-imposed constraints on Florida volume continue to carry a unit revenue penalty, but again, we are being purposely conservative when it comes to removing some buffers and restrictions that limit our level of operations there. We acknowledge that this strategy may have a slight downward pressure on load factor and unit revenue, but we are comfortable it is the right earnings decision in current circumstances. Taking all of this into account, we estimate total RASM for the first quarter of 2023 will be up 23% to 24.5% compared to the first quarter of 2022 on a capacity increase of 13.2%. As Ted commented, we have reduced our 2023 capacity plan. We now expect 2023 capacity to be up 19% to 22% compared to the full year 2022. And with that, I will now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Haralson: Thanks, Matt. I will start with a brief overview of our fourth quarter financial performance and then spend some time explaining how we are thinking about the outlook for 2023. Our fourth quarter non-fuel operating costs came in better than expected, primarily due to lower airport rents and landing fees driven by favorable signatory adjustments. We had anticipated that as volume at airport stabilized, we would see a reversal of this pandemic-related increases in airport rents and landing fees due to share shifts. This anticipated reversal came largely in the form of billing true-ups or adjustments as opposed to reduced future rates. Fuel costs were up more than 100% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 on about 20% more volume due to a 69% increase in the average fuel price per gallon, fuel prices have remained stubbornly high driven in large part by historically high refining margins, but the current curve does suggest jet fuel prices will move lower as we progress through the year. For the fourth quarter, we saw good improvement in adjusted operating income quarter-to-quarter, but operating margin was still well below what we believe our normalized operating margin will be once we reach full utilization. Total non-operating expense came in higher than previously estimated due to the periodic valuation of the derivative liability associated with the 2026 convertible notes being valued $4 million higher than it was on September 30, 2022. During the fourth quarter, we completed a private add-on offering of $600 million to the company\u2019s 8% senior secured notes due 2025, bringing the aggregate principal amount of these senior secured notes outstanding to $1.1 billion. During the quarter, we also increased our commitment under our senior secured revolving credit facility by $60 million, bringing the total amount available under the facility to $300 million, none of which is drawn today. Liquidity at the end of 2022 was $1.8 billion, which includes unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and the $300 million of undrawn capacity under the revolving credit facility. We took delivery of 10 A320neo aircraft during the quarter, ending the period with 194 aircraft in the fleet. As announced last month, we signed an agreement to sell 29 of our unencumbered A319ceo aircraft. We expect to remove 14 of these aircraft from our operating fleet in 2023, with the remainder expected to be removed in 2024. We took an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of $334 million and the expected proceeds of the transaction over the next 2 years will be between $150 million and $200 million. Over the last year or so, we have been assessing our long-term plans for this A319ceo fleet, our oldest, least-efficient vintage of our A320 family aircraft. In the fourth quarter, we made the decision to accelerate the retirement of these aircraft. In our previous 2023 capacity guide, we had included some reduction in A319 flying so the impact of the 14 scheduled A319 removals in 2023 has a smaller impact than would otherwise be expected. We continue to view 2023 as a transition year. The objective of returning to full utilization is still primary. We have made the necessary internal investments to reach this objective. However, for all the reasons Ted listed, we are forced to be more conservative with our schedule planning than we otherwise would be. Given the modest buildup for the first half of 2023 will likely underutilize the fleet by about 10% that should improve to around 5% in Q3 and back to what we consider normal utilization levels in Q4. Matt mentioned the capacity plan for 2023 being up 19% to 22% versus 2022. This is about a 450 to 550 basis point reduction versus our previous plan. We estimate about 40% of this reduction is related to the diminished neo engine performance coupled with no or limited spare engine availability. We estimate about 30% is related to the Airbus delivery delays and about 20% driven by the accelerated retirement of our A319 aircraft. The remaining reduction is related to the continued buffers we have in place to support the operation due to continued industry infrastructure constraints. For 2023, we estimate total capital expenditures will be about $360 million. For some highlights here, approximately $150 million of this is related to the building of our new headquarter facility in Dania Beach, which we will occupy in the first quarter of 2024. $75 million is related to net pre-delivery deposits and about $30 million is related to the purchase of spare engines. Last month, our pilots ratified and amended collective bargaining agreement that provides significant pay increases and other enhanced benefits. We estimate the new rates and benefits drive an additional $180 million of wages, salaries and benefits expense for the full year of 2023 or about $40 million to $45 million a quarter with an additional onetime expense in the first quarter of about $10 million related to the revaluation of bank sick and vacation time. In total, we estimate the new contract adds about 4.5% increase to our 2023 CASM ex. For the first quarter 2023, we estimate our operating margin will range between negative 2% to negative 4%. This assumes total operating expenses of $1.39 billion to $1.4 billion and a fuel price per gallon assumption of $3.20. For the full year 2023, given expected utilization levels and the new pilot contract, we now expect our CASM actual will be in the high 6s. We also do expect to be profitable in all of the first quarter and profitable for the full year. Before I close, I want to thank the entire Spirit team. 2022 was a challenging year on many fronts for our team persevered and continued to set us up well for 2023. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ted for closing remarks.\nTed Christie: Okay, Scott. Thanks for that brief overview. Now that 2022 is wrapped, we are excited to turn our attention to leveraging our strengths to make marked financial improvement in 2023. We are in a strong liquidity position to have minimal non-aircraft CapEx. We expect to produce solid EBITDA for full year 2023. In addition, we have the option to finance our new headquarters campus in Dania Beach, should we decide to do so. We are steadily building back to full utilization. And despite some unexpected setbacks with engine availability issues, we are on track to reach normalized utilization by the end of the year. However, our progress will be measured and intentional so we don\u2019t overstress the surrounding infrastructure. As we move through the year, if we gain confidence in the surrounding infrastructure, we have the assets to move the needle on utilization a bit faster. While our new pilot contract does add unit cost and margin pressure, we do expect the new contract to have a favorable impact on our attrition rates. We take our first A321neo in the first quarter and a total of 10 in 2023, which over time will gradually increase our average gauge and naturally drive productivity. Adding A321neos and retiring the A319ceos will also improve fuel CASM, we estimate that, on average, an A321neo will produce 113 ASMs per gallon, while the retiring 319s on average produced 73 ASMs per gallon. We won\u2019t get into the full benefit of these changes in 2023 as we are only retiring a portion of the 319 fleet in 2023 and are taking only a handful of A321neos this year, but fuel efficiency should steadily improve as we move through 2023. With utilization levels returning and fleet-related benefits on unit cost and fuel burn, we expect CASM and CASM ex will be lower in 2024 and than it will be in 2023. Demand for our product has remained strong. Our team continues to explore new ancillary opportunities, and we anticipate we will set another non-ticket revenue per segment record in 2023. With that, back to DeAnne.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you. We are now ready to take questions from the analysts. We ask you limit yourself to one question with one related follow-up. Abby, we are ready to begin.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, I guess a quick one and a quick follow-up here. I guess to Matt, as you think about retiring these A319s, does it preclude you \u2013 and I guess \u2013 I appreciate the fuel efficiency, Ted that you spelled out comparing the A319s versus the A320neos. But does it preclude you from flying certain markets, whether they are experimental or maybe smaller or medium-sized markets with the bigger shelves, are you sort of pigeon hold into flying some of the biggest routes? Like what\u2019s the loss there from your ability to develop new markets with no longer having the A319s? And did you ever consider maybe an A319neo?\nMatt Klein: Hey, Mike, good morning. Yes, in terms of where we deploy the aircraft. Having the 319ceos retire does not stop our ability to grow or expand in any given route, even experimentally if we choose to do that. Really, what\u2019s become easier and better to do over time with larger aircraft. As you can go in sort of day of week to certain places and test things out that way and then continue to grow off of that. And that\u2019s not really brand new for us. We have done that in the past, and we would continue to do that. If we thought there are opportunities out there, that maybe can\u2019t support daily right out of the gate, we would go on with day a week and then develop out from there, making sure that we\u2019re still right in that decision.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. That\u2019s helpful.\nScott Haralson: Hey, Mike, I\u2019ll add another pile on to Matt\u2019s comment. As we\u2019ve been playing the fleet over the last sort of 5 to 10 years, we knew that the A320neo and its range capabilities would replace a good bit of the need for the 19ceo, given that, that was our long-haul fleet. And so as we\u2019ve gotten bigger and bigger in our A320neos, we knew that would be a long-haul replacement for us, and the operating costs are pretty similar. So that was always going to be the case. So I think that\u2019s where Matt and the network guys utilizing the neo where it should be placed.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. And then just on sort of related, as we think about the 19% to 22% growth in 2023, how much of that is actually gauge related versus maybe new markets? Or are you just filling in the frequency to drive to that higher utilization to get back to normalcy by year-end?\nMatt Klein: Yes, most of the growth there is going to be coming as we look to continue to add frequencies in places where we\u2019re already strong, the makeup of that growth is going to be less so from new routes and more likely going to be really continuing to a trend that we\u2019ve had for the last few years, which is where we\u2019re strong. We\u2019re going to continue to accentuate those strengths, and we will continue to test out new places for us moving forward. Gauge does continue to slightly increase, as I think Ted said in his remarks. So we will see a little bit of gauge increase throughout the year. And then in terms of a lot of when the deliveries are coming, they are coming throughout the year. There are a bunch using that technical term, a bunch are coming near the end of the year. So a lot of deliveries come in the fourth quarter, and you\u2019ll see a lot of that deployed into 2024, more so than 2023. So that\u2019s a bit of the change in the capacity profile as well.\nTed Christie: I\u2019d say \u2013 this is Ted and the last add-on to that is, obviously, utilization is increasing throughout the year. So that\u2019s adding to the 19% to 22%. I would agree with Matt, gauge is the smallest component of it. I think it\u2019s more of the aircraft deliveries and the utilization improvement that\u2019s driving the capacity move.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Great. Thanks, everyone. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. Quick one on pilots. As I recall, the contract had richer increases for first officers than for captains, which kind of seems sensible given the industry challenges right now. I know it\u2019s very early, but have you seen any changes yet in the cadence of applications? And is the tempered 2023 growth rate have any specific assumptions in this regard, like an uptick in applicants? Or is the tempered growth solely a function of the aircraft issues that you spoke about?\nTed Christie: Good morning, Jamie. So as to the first question, it is too early to call it one way or the other. I mean, our pilots ratified this contract less than a month ago. So I think initial signs are positive, however, both as it relates to attrition and our continued throughput on new hires. So we feel like that will produce the kind of results we see. To the second question, the more muted growth rate has almost entirely everything to do with the fleet moves that Scott and both the neo issue, the Airbus delivery delays. Admittedly, the 319 retirement was different than our planned assumption, but that was going to happen eventually. So I think it\u2019s more of that. I think we have adequate staffing and throughput to staff a bigger airline, which is why I said in my comments that if we start to feel more comfortable that ATC problems are getting resolved quicker, that we\u2019re not seeing as much as many issues with catering trucks and fueling trucks and stuff like that, we could probably tick the growth up a little bit more, but we will wait to see that first.\nJamie Baker: Got it. And second question, just because it\u2019s generated some headlines, and I\u2019m getting questions here. The estimate or your comment that you expect to hear from the DOJ in the next 30 days, is that a well-informed estimate on your part or something that specifically justice has guided you to?\nTed Christie: Not to guess on my part, just based on where we\u2019ve seen the process goes. So I wouldn\u2019t or so. I said or so because I mean it could be longer than that. But we\u2019re into the process right now and have been working with the DOJ on making sure we satisfy the request and that sort of thing. So as we\u2019ve laid out, I guess, JetBlue has been more specific in laying out the process. I think it\u2019s consistent with their view on where things will go and still in line with what the timing estimates were that were given early on.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Look forward to seeing you next month at our conference. Take care.\nTed Christie: Thanks.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, good morning.\nTed Christie: Hey, Duane, okay?\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes. I am good. Thanks for the time. You talked about time on wing, lower time on wing, that is a phrase you used at least 2 or 3x on the call. Can you speak a little bit more specifically what was the expectation in your planning in terms of cycles or years? And what is it that you\u2019re realizing and who bears the higher cost there?\nTed Christie: So I\u2019ll do my best to summarize I don\u2019t have the specific data at hand. But when we purchased this engine and went through the RFP process to determine what the power plant was going to be on the neo. We made assumptions about time on wing between major shop visits and reliability, generally speaking, for unscheduled removals that were consistent assumptions with what we\u2019ve experienced with our CO power. So with the V2500, what has been experienced with the other engine manufacturers kind of legacy power, that sort of thing. It\u2019s fair to say that the teething issues have gone longer and deeper than any operator anticipated. I think that\u2019s fair for the two manufacturers as well. So rather than it being 6 or 7 or 8 years between removals and shop visits, we\u2019re seeing a considerable higher uptick in frequency. Just last year, I believe we removed 30-plus engines. And we\u2019ve been operating this aircraft for about 6 years, of which the vast majority of them have delivered over the last two. So we\u2019re still working through it. And obviously, there is warranty on the engines that\u2019s part of our purchase agreement and that is \u2013 we\u2019re satisfied with the cover there. And in constant discussions with proud on the best way to kind of like mitigate these problems and come up with a better solution. And they have been a willing partner. It\u2019s just \u2013 I know it\u2019s frustrating for both of us that we\u2019re still here right now.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So it sounds more like an aircraft availability issue than a cost issue?\nTed Christie: That\u2019s right. Right now, it is largely that. I mentioned that in a 2-week period, what happened to us right now, we just \u2013 we didn\u2019t anticipate having that many aircraft without engines available, either spare engines or returns from the shop. And so we had to take utilization down as a result because those are impactful to fleet utilization.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Got it. Got it. And then just on the Airbus delivery delays, can you speak to any penalties or credits related to that?\nScott Haralson: Hey, Duane, this is Scott. So no, there are no penalties at this point. These are sort of excused delays with the supply chain issues that are happening around the world. Airbus is not immune. So at this point, no financial components associated.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you. Look forward to speaking more soon.\nTed Christie: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Your line is open.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks. Going back to the script and the headwinds to normalized margins and the more conservative approach to schedules this year. With respect to the downward pressure on revenue that you referenced, how much downward pressure is reversed as you get back to normalized network planning and utilization? And I guess what\u2019s the best way for investors to get comfortable with continued revenue execution?\nMatt Klein: Hey, Dan, it\u2019s Matt. I\u2019ll take that. There is a couple of components that flow into that. One is, we continue to have on purpose. We\u2019re still a little smaller fly into Florida than we would otherwise be. And then another thing, and this is the same trend that we saw in our schedule last quarter as well, which is just flying more off-peak days of week as well. And the reason why we\u2019re doing that is largely to make sure we can maintain a reliable operation at our airports and for all of our crew and team members out there. So those two components combined add up to about 1.5 points in the first quarter is our expectation that we\u2019re taking when we talk about unit revenue penalty. So last quarter, it was more than that. So as we move through the spring towards the summer, we should start to see some of that relax naturally as we would fly more off-peak days of the week, normally as we head towards the peak. And then the question will be is, as we operate through the spring and the summer, then we will know how things are going towards the fall. So it\u2019s a little early for us to talk about the fall post summer to think about these kinds of impacts to get revenue in the network. But we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re building up. Ted mentioned our operation last year was Mid-Pac in both on-time performance and completion factor. We\u2019re good with that. And as long as we can continue to maintain that, we will be able to keep loosening up these restrictions as the year progresses.\nDan McKenzie: I see. And then second question here. The normalized operations in the fourth quarter later this year, does that assume that Pratt & Whitney issues are resolved by then? And I guess just more broadly, if you could address SAVE\u2019s cost structure today and to what extent the cost structure is a margin headwind in the next cycle? And with that, if it is \u2013 if it\u2019s not, can pre-tax margins get back to where they have been historically or at least how should investors think about what a normalized margin should look like for Spirit?\nTed Christie: Hey Dan. So, as for the first half \u2013 this is Ted. We do make an assumption that we are going to be collectively with Pratt resolving the availability issue on the neo throughout the remainder of this year, such that by the time we hit the fourth quarter, we are able to support full utilization, which would include aircraft that are currently unable to be operated. So, there is an assumption in there, which obviously could change if we don\u2019t get the mitigation efforts and the improvement that we are hoping for. But we will keep you posted on that throughout the year. And maybe, Scott, do you want to comment on CASM and margins?\nScott Haralson: Yes. So, quickly on unit cost and maybe go forward views on unit cost margin, obviously the three components that we have talked about a lot and every airline has, which is aircraft \u2013 sorry, airport cost and labor costs, which make the majority of our move. And the biggest is obviously, labor. Labor accounts for probably north of 60% of our unit cost increase versus 2019. And the other is how we are sort of thinking about aircraft financing, which could be temporary or at least in this window has been primarily sale-leaseback financing and operating leases which is probably a 10-point to 15-point headwind on unit cost by itself. So, it\u2019s aircraft rent, it\u2019s labor, it\u2019s airport costs, which has been the big mover for us. And so going forward, it\u2019s about getting efficiency in the other parts of the business, getting back to full utilization or very close to it. But there are going to be other operating parameters that are going to be difficult for the industry. And we have talked about it, every airline has talked about the parameters operating today are different than what they were pre-COVID. So, it\u2019s going to take a little more infrastructure to do that than it did in 2029, but we have put those investments in place. So, we expect full utilization to be a product that we will get to by the end of the year and into 2024. But I think the fundamental component about our margin production is still sort of mid-teens margins. We think that as the supply/demand impact is back to an equilibrium, fuel goes back to where it\u2019s sort of been as an average, we expect us to produce mid-teens margins. So, I think that\u2019s where we are thinking about the growth of the airline and all the components with it. So, I hope that helps.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi everybody. Thank you. So, my first question is with respect to your ancillaries. How are you thinking about I guess increasing them, I mean where do you \u2013 maybe that\u2019s not the right question. Maybe it\u2019s more like where do you think they can go? They seem pretty high now, but how high do you think they can go?\nMatt Klein: Hey Helane, it\u2019s Matt.\nHelane Becker: Hello.\nMatt Klein: Good morning. We \u2013 in terms of ancillaries, we are not going to plan to flag today and give a target as to where we think it can go specifically. I can tell you, as Ted mentioned, we expect to have another record this year. We continue to expect it to march upwards. We do continue to improve in terms of the way that we merchandise products, and making sure that everything continues to improve from a guest experience perspective in terms of getting through the purchase process. That\u2019s not just on our website, but on our app as well. We also have what we believe to be, if not the largest, one of the largest reaches to third-parties in terms of selling our ancillary products now as well. So, that\u2019s been beneficial from a distribution perspective. And even if guests aren\u2019t purchasing ancillaries on their first contact with us, we do know that the more often that they see the products, if they are not frequent Spirit travelers, it leads to better take rates down the line for them as well before they get to the airport or before they board the aircraft. So, it\u2019s about merchandising, distribution and also just continuing our ongoing improvements in revenue management strategy and the technologies that we are building to put in place to help us manage the products. Similar to the traditional revenue management of just the ticket in general, we continue to make strides with revenue management of the ancillaries as well.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s hugely helpful. And then just for my follow-up question, it\u2019s really just a clarification. On ASMs, I think you said \u2013 I am not sure who you or Scott said that they were mostly second half, right, weighted. You are seeing capacity increases in the second half of the year. So, are you assuming that the engine relief will be there by the summer months, or how should we think about that?\nTed Christie: Helane, this is Ted. Yes, we do have a back-end SKU delivery schedule with Airbus, which I think is what you are referring to, which affects ASM production, but doesn\u2019t affect utilization because the airplanes aren\u2019t there. What\u2019s more impactful utilization is that the aircraft that have already been delivered and are not being operated because they are sitting on ground. Those are the engine issues. We do expect that by the fourth quarter, that will have a resolution to it. And we are working with Pratt on ways to mitigate the impacts throughout the course of the year. Obviously, if we are right, then we should land exactly where we expect. If we are wrong, then there will be potential utilization penalty in the fourth quarter. But right now, that\u2019s our base case.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Alright. That\u2019s hugely helpful. Thanks everybody.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good morning. A couple of follow-up questions actually on the capacity growth. Wondering if you could kind of talk about stage versus departure, it seems like your stage length has come down quite a bit. I am just curious what\u2019s driving that and if we should see this as a new level or how you can expect that to progress in 2023?\nMatt Klein: Hey Savi, it\u2019s Matt. So, in terms of stage, our stage is coming in slightly from where it had been. And really, without getting into all of the technical reasons behind that, just to know that some of the delays that we have seen, as Ted and Scott has mentioned, with not just deliveries, but some of the on-wing \u2013 time on wing engine issues with the neo has caused us to make some very, I would call it, close-in network changes that we weren\u2019t anticipating. And without getting into all of the specifics about it, what\u2019s ended up happening is we have ended up pulling some of the longer haul, which is making the stage look shorter than really we had initially intended it to be. So, we are taking all this into account. We now have a better view on what\u2019s going on with the engine issues and the fleet plan overall, which has been moving a little bit over the last, say, six weeks to eight weeks or so. So, now they have a better handle on that. We will be able to think about the network more fully as we move through this year. All of that wrapped up to say we are aware of the stage number and where it\u2019s at, and we anticipate it will lengthen out from here, but you will see that as we move through the year with the way that we think about the network. That will just get published as the schedules come out.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s helpful. And if I might ask just on the peak versus off-peak demand trends, like \u2013 it seemed like in the fourth quarter, the off-peaks maybe were a bit stronger than you have seen in the past, and is that right? And are you seeing that trend continuing? And just as you kind of look at February, March, how does the off-peak and peak trends compared to what you saw in the fourth quarter?\nMatt Klein: Yes. So, the off-peak in the fourth quarter was probably a little bit stronger than we are seeing here in the first quarter, but I am not talking that up to anything really other than some holiday shift things were dramatic. The Christmas and New Year\u2019s period shifted by an entire week, which is not insignificant, and it just changes the way that everyone kind of thinks about off-peak travel after you come out of a peak. So, I am \u2013 definitely, the off-peaks are a little bit weaker right now than they were in the fourth quarter, but it\u2019s not unexpected based on the holiday shifts, is the way I would say it. And the peaks that we are seeing as we move through the first quarter are strong. Every time we flowed out a little bit more inventory, if we see any kind of opportunity to drive some lower-yield demand, we are seeing that inventory gets snapped up right away. So, demand is strong. We anticipate this will not just push through spring break, but really head through the shoulder period in Q2 and really move into the summer well. We are not seeing any indications of any kind of falloff of demand. And this a little bit of off-peak happening right now is really a blip and not anything that I am concerned about.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Klein: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Stephen Trent with Citi. Your line is open.\nStephen Trent: Hi. Good morning everybody and thanks for taking my question. Several of mine have been answered, but I did want to follow-up on the improvements you guys mentioned with extra crew and you mentioned you have got some infrastructure help those whether they are runway stuff is out of the way. And when I think about how well you guys handle the December storm. Could you kind of give us any color regarding what other strategies you may have employed such as maybe investments in flight op software or something along those lines?\nTed Christie: Sure, Stephen. So, over the course of last year, we did discuss a number of the initiatives that the company had launched since 2021 to improve reliability across the network. And obviously, some of those are notably our crew-related reliability items. We opened three new crew bases last year, which is a pretty significant move for us and has had the expected effect. We are more targeted with the buffers we use around the network, both crew-related buffers as well as aircraft time-related buffers. Matt mentioned that the network is more stable throughout the course of the week and throughout the course of the month. That is a reliability enhancer also. Most of our flying today comes from our lands and a crew base, which is a change in the network. And then we have deployed a number of initiatives around crew services that help our crew scheduling team react to and deal with interruption when it happens and our crews have noticed. They are able to get their issues resolved much faster, and that helps our crew scheduling team repair the network faster. So, those are all kind of like the lessons \u2013 we are not done, by the way. There is still quite a bit of work to be done to finalize where we want to land. But I would tell you that it was not a seamless operating fourth quarter. We had the late hurricane activity, the Winter Storm Elliott, it was messy. And we saw that across the industry, but I am proud of the way our network responded and our group responded. And I think that just gets further enhanced from here.\nStephen Trent: Super. Appreciate that. And as my follow-up, just very quickly, when I think about you are soft on international flying, over the last 3 years to 4 years, Mexico\u2019s practically hasn\u2019t slowed down at all, never shutdown with the pandemic. Are you seeing any sort of shifts in terms of maybe one market growth moderating as it hits harder comps and other places starting to open up, or is it still about the same as it\u2019s been in the last several quarters? Thank you.\nMatt Klein: Yes. Stephen, it\u2019s Matt. Our Latin America and Caribbean network continues to build well, continues to see strength. We have had \u2013 like any part of the network, there is always a route here or there that needs to be adjusted or re-timed. Generally speaking, I would tell you that some of the issues that we saw in the early part of last year, when it had to do with some of the international VFR routes. They have all recovered well. We had a strong holiday period. And we are anticipating, and expect to see a strong spring, spring break here as well as we head towards the summer. I don\u2019t know specifically that I want to talk about headwinds that we may see on year-over-year comps. Right now, we are really focused on just the absolute and maximizing what we see out there. And when we talk about ancillary products and services, the take rates and the rates that we are seeing are \u2013 continue to do well and perform there. So, nothing that I would say is slowing down at this point.\nStephen Trent: Okay. Very helpful Matt, and thanks for taking up the time.\nMatt Klein: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Your comment about being profitable for the year, can you just talk about the fuel and RASM assumptions you are assuming to get there?\nScott Haralson: Hey Scott, so this is Scott. I will start on the fuel side. So, obviously, we pulled the fuel curve generally about a week or so in advance of the call. And so that \u2013 at that point, fuel was sitting in around, it was obviously higher in January, but the first quarter will be around $3.20, and it will decline through the year. Probably for the full year, we will be around $3 based on the fuel curve. So, that\u2019s the basic assumption. I don\u2019t know, Matt, do you want to talk about unit revenue for the year, but not really given the guide full year\u2026\nMatt Klein: Yes. We are not going to talk about the guide, Scott, for full year unit revenue or I am sure leave it at that.\nScott Group: Okay. And then just \u2013 I think you had a comment that you think CASM will be lower in \u201824 if we take a step back, right, capacity is up 40% versus \u201819, CASM is up 25% or so, like \u2013 so what changes in \u201824 to sort of get the model working better again the way you would expect where there should be some sort of unit cost operating leverage?\nScott Haralson: Yes. Scott, this is Scott again. So, I think the biggest lever is utilization. We are going to be increasing that through the year, and we will exit at about normal utilization levels, obviously, depending on where the engine reliability issue sets, but that\u2019s the expectation. And if we do that for the full year, that alone mathematically will give us a push down. And we are obviously managing the P&L. So, we feel pretty optimistic about where sort of 2024 and beyond full run rate CASM ex will sit.\nScott Group: Okay. Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to DeAnne Gabel for closing remarks.\nDeAnne Gabel: No, Abby, I think we are done. But thank you so much everyone for joining us today and we will catch you all next time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call, and we thank you for your participation.

And with that, I turn the call over to Ted Christie.\nTed Christie: Thanks DeAnne. Thanks everyone for joining us today and thanks to everyone on the Spirit team. The daily demands of operating an airline are complex and often come with unexpected challenges. And I want to thank our team for being committed to bringing their best day in and day out and delivering excellent service to our guests. Before discussing our third quarter results, just a quick update about the merger agreement with JetBlue. On October 19th, our stockholders voted to approve the transaction. This is an important step forward on our path to closing a combination that will create a compelling low fair challenger to the dominant U.S. carriers. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approval. JetBlue is taking the lead on this. We are committed to assisting them in whatever way we can.  Turning now to our third quarter results. The business performed well against the set of negative headwinds, including much higher fuel costs, Hurricane Ian and Florida capacity constraints. Strong demand and sound revenue management, coupled with excellent operational reliability, which led to good cost execution, help mitigate the impacts of these headwinds. We achieved a breakeven adjusted pretax margin and $3.6 million of adjusted net income or a profit of $0.03 per share. Leisure demand remained strong throughout the entire quarter, leading to total revenue increasing 35.4% compared to the third quarter of 2019 on 13.5% more capacity.  Operationally, we are running great. Despite challenging operating conditions during the quarter with hurricanes in Florida and the Caribbean, Spirit achieved the best third quarter DOT on time performance in our company's history. Our team did a fantastic job planning for and reacting to Hurricane Ian as it developed and changed course, minimizing the impact to our guests and on the operation. The crew scheduling and network changes we made earlier in the year also contributed to these record results. There are still many in our home state of Florida that are dealing with the devastating impacts from Hurricane Ian and our heartfelt thoughts are with them. While our third quarter2022 results were in line with our expectations, we continue to face infrastructure constraints that are impeding our return to normalized margins and full utilization. One of the primary limitations is the constraint on flight volume to and from Florida. There has been some improvement since the issue first arose, and we continue to work closely with the FAA on alternative options to increase throughput, but this will likely be a multi-year headwind limiting our network optimization. Our network team has plenty of other growth opportunities. A growing service in our home hometown state of Florida is key to our return to normalized operating margins. We are also facing high rates of labor inflation. Increasing productivity will help mitigate this, which is in part tied to the pace at which we can hire and train pilots. Attrition rates remain elevated, which means we've had to build a bigger schoolhouse and increased resources to train the number of pilots needed to support our growth and to cover the higher attrition. Additionally, attracting new pilot talent has been more challenging as regional airlines and major airlines have announced new pay structures. However, in September we began negotiations to amend the current collective bargaining agreement with ALPA, the union representing our pilots. Both parties are working towards an agreement which may in part address the higher attrition rates. We are very pleased with how smoothly the operation is running and we are encouraged with the strength we are seeing in demand trends as we head into the fourth quarter. And now I'll hand it over to Matt and Scott to share additional details about our third quarter performance, as well as some color around our fourth quarter outlook. Matt, over to you.\nMatthew Klein: Thanks Ted. I also want to thank the Spirit team members for the resiliency in the face of challenging circumstances and for making Spirit a great place to work. Turning now to our third quarter 2022 revenue performance. Total revenue was $1.34 billion, up 35.4% compared to the third quarter 2019. Total RASM for the quarter was $0.1107 up, 19.3% versus 2019, an excellent result in any environment, but especially impressive in conjunction with our increased capacity footprint. The load is strong throughout the entire quarter to include holding up particularly well in September, although September load factor was 2.2 points below that of September, 2019. On 26% more capacity, the percent change in total RASM was up nearly 20%. We are not seeing any signs of leisure demand slowing down as one might assume given the overall economic environment. On a per segment basis, again, compared to the third quarter 2019, total revenue for passenger increased 22% to over $134. Passenger revenue per segment increased 23% to $67.52 and non-ticket per segment increased 21% to $67.07. Our array of dynamically priced ancillary items allow our guests to customize their itinerary and flight experience that works best for their budget, and we continue to see guests respond favorably to the options we provide them.  Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2022, we are anticipating strong revenue results even with the continued constraints on Florida flight volume, which carries a RASM penalty for the quarter, especially during what is typically the beginning of Florida's peak season. This constraint also limits our connectivity options in Fort Lauderdale, which has effects on how we flow the rest of the network. Rather than get too much into the weeds discussing network scheduling, I'll summarize by saying that we believe having less variability and the number of flights day-to-day at any given airport better supports our operational reliability and is more likely to maximize earnings in this environment. Our fourth quarter schedules were built with this in mind. This strategy may have a slight downward impact on load factor and total RASM, but we are comfortable is the right decision and this particular set of circumstances. Taking all of this into account, we estimate total RASM for the fourth quarter will be up between 15% to 16.5% versus fourth quarter 2019 on a capacity increase of 24.5%. The implied revenue range based on these inputs is between $1.39 billion and $1.41 billion. As we look ahead to 2023, we plan to continue to take a pragmatic approach to how we deploy our assets. Given the various infrastructure constraints on our network, anticipated Airbus delivery delays and engine supply chain issues, for planning purposes, we are now targeting 60 billion to 62 billion available seat miles for 2023 or up 23% to 27% compared to full year 2022. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.\nScott Haralson: Thanks Matt. During the quarter, we added three destinations to the network, opened two new crew bases and carried a new Spirit record of almost 10 million passengers and hired and trained over 800 new crew members and did it all while setting in new on time performance record for a third quarter, even with a hurricane dripping through a large part of our network. I want to acknowledge our entire team and congratulate them on a job well done. Turning to our third quarter cost performance. Non-fuel operating costs came in better than expected. In addition to good cost management, the benefits of running a great operation drove better than expected results throughout the P&L. On the other hand, fuel cost per gallon was $3.82, about $0.15 higher than we had initially expected, driving approximately $27 million of additional fuel expense. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $11.3 million. We estimate the direct impact of Hurricane Ian on third quarter operating income was approximately $5 million and will be about $5 million in the fourth quarter as well. In addition, we saw some softness in bookings to Florida destinations and to Myrtle Beach in early October immediately following the hurricane and estimate this will negatively impact fourth quarter 2022 revenue by another $3 million to $5 million. Liquidity at the end of the third quarter was $1.3 billion, which includes unrestricted cash and cash equivalence, short-term investments, and $240 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. We took delivery of four A320neo aircraft during the third quarter ending the period with 184 aircraft on our fleet. All of these aircraft were delivered under sale leaseback transactions. Year-to-date through September 30th, we've made debt payments including principal interest and fees of $232 million and have incurred capital expenditures including net purchase deposits of $190 million. For the full year of 2022, we estimate our capital expenditures, including net purchase deposits, will be approximately $260 million. For 2023, we estimate gross CapEx will be about $350 million. About $150 million of this is related to the building of our new headquarters facility in Dania Beach. This estimate also includes $10 million of net PDP payments and five spare engines. Aircraft utilization for the third quarter was 10.6 hours, down 15.2% compared to the same period in 2019. Looking ahead, we have 13 aircrafts scheduled for delivery during the fourth quarter. Even with the large number of Q4 deliveries, we expect to see sequential quarter-to-quarter improvement in utilization. As mentioned on prior calls, we plan to gradually improve fleet utilization reaching overturn to full utilization around the middle of 2023. We estimate our operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2022 will range between 1% to 3%. This assumes total operating expenses of $1.365 billion to $1.375 billion, and the fuel price per gallon assumption of $3.55. One housekeeping item that I want to mention is to explain why we changed our guidance from pretext margin to operating margin. There is one unique accounting item related to a change in the accounting for our 2026 convertibles. Due to a change in how the notes are to be settled under the merger agreement, we are now required to bifurcate the equity component of the 2026 convertible notes. The fair value of the derivative liability will be mark-to-market every quarter. This quarter the mark-to-market credit was sizeable and resulted in a credit to interest expense of approximately $15 million. It is difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the impact of the mark-to-market exercise each quarter. Therefore, we will guide to operating margin going forward. We did provide an estimate for a total non-operating expense for the fourth quarter of 2022, $22 million, so this does not include any potential change in the mark-to-market adjustment related to the derivative portion of the convertible notes. With that, I'll hand it back to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks Scott. I'll close with an update on our near-term initiatives. One, network reliability enhancements and growth. Despite the impact of Hurricane Ian and the Florida operational constraints, we capped off one of our most reliable summers on record. We have seen improvement in Florida operations since the spring, but we are going to be very disciplined and pragmatic about building back to our normalized peak. Regarding network, we are the largest airline in Fort Lauderdale and second largest in Las Vegas and Orlando, and have opportunistically grown in Los Angeles and Newark, such that both cities are now in our top 10 markets. Second, utilization and profitability. Our target is to achieve normalized utilization by mid 2023. Utilization in Q4 of this year is on track to show the progress we expected, which reinforces our confidence in achieving this target. Third, record non-ticket performance. While non-ticket results continue to be the shining star of our revenue results and it's not an official target, $70 per passenger segment is now within reach, and the improvement in non-ticket per segment does not appear to be diluted to ticket revenue per segment. And fourth, costs. Ex-fuel CASM is still high with labor costs, the primary pressure across the business, but it will mitigate as utilization returns. Fuel price is driving significant margin pressure today, but our burn will continue to improve as fleet mix favors larger neo aircraft. Spirit is a group of passionate aviation professionals who want to deliver for our guests and stockholders. So, our current financial results are disappointing. However, we believe it is prudent for us to build back the network more methodically, which will allow our team to digest the growth and learn from our experience. 2023 will be a big year for all of us, and I look forward to delivering on our objectives. With that, back to DeAnne.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you. We are now ready to take questions from the analysts. We ask that you limit yourself to one question with one related follow up. Operator, we are ready to begin.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Gable. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question this morning from Michael Linenberg at Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, everybody. Good morning. I guess two questions here. This is probably to Matt or Ted. When I look at your current schedule, it doesn't look like that you at least at this point have included the 16 runway timings that you were awarded by the DOT. Is that just subject to some sort of final sign off, or is that something that shows up in 2023? When do you start doing those eight round trips?\nMatthew Klein: Hey, Mike, it's Matt. I'll take that.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, Matt.\nMatthew Klein: Hey, good morning. So, we have deployed the use of those peak times in Newark. We were able to take advantage for a while of some of the waivers that were in Newark due to some of the international slots not being used. So, we were already scheduling a lot of that flying.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay.\nMatthew Klein: What the -- yeah, what the award did was allow us to make that flying permanent and then allow us, as we utilize our gates fully in Newark to add back in some of the off peak times to fully utilize those assets up there.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. That makes sense. And as I recall, those runway timings were sort of peak time slot, so, that's good. Okay. So that makes sense. Just the second question on -- when we think about next year CapEx and sort of -- it's a big year for growth, how many aircraft are you taking delivery of in 2023? And when we think about -- in the past you've resorted for many of your aircraft sale leasebacks, should we assume that most of them -- those airplanes are going to be leased and do -- have you locked down that financing, or is that still to be determined on at least a portion of the airplanes for next year? Thanks for taking my question.\nScott Haralson: Hey, Mike. This is Scott. Yeah. You're \u2026\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, Scott.\nScott Haralson: Hey, good to see you again. We do take 33 aircraft next year, 17 of which are direct order from our order book, 16 are additional leases from lessor and 13 of those are A321neos that we take as well. But we do have financing lined up for those. We're in the final innings of signing the documents on that. But we do have committed financing for all those. So, we're in a good spot there.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. Great to hear.\nScott Haralson: And to your point around the deliveries from Airbus, it is also leaseback financing, so that we'll be no debt associated.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Duane Pfennigwerth at Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, you did such a good job in your initial defense. It's a little bit hard for us to forget about some of the risk factors that you flagged. I just wanted to ask you about attrition, and hiring since the merger announcement and trends there. And what, if anything, that you've implemented to create change there or to stem the bleeding, for lack of a better word.\nTed Christie: Hey, Duane. Thanks. And I assume you're referring specifically to our defense of our original merge agreement and then where we sit today with \u2026\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Exactly.\nTed Christie: Yeah. So, part of the primary structuring of our agreement with JetBlue was to give us comfort that we were putting ourselves in the best position regardless of the outcome. We're, of course, supportive of and optimistic that we will be granted authority to merge with them and create a real viable fifth competitor to the big four, which is the primary objective. But we put in place structures, be they, economic or commitment otherwise that actually have reassured a good deal of our team members that they will be part of the go forward business. JetBlue has made verbal commitments as such as well. So when you're talking about the kind of general and administrative folks, there is quite a bit of effort there to reassure them that, this is just a much bigger airline that will require all of their efforts. And I think they've largely digested that and understand that and feel good about that.  When you look at the bigger part of the organization, which is all of our folks who operate the airline every day, our pilots, our flight attendants, our technicians, the people working at our airports, our contracts and service providers, the good news there is, this is broadly an accretive transaction for them. They're going to be part of a much larger business. They're going to have greater opportunities of new places to fly, new bases to live in, opportunities for growth. Both airlines are growth airlines and they've been told that story and they understand it. Setting that aside -- so I don't think that that's incremental to any of the -- either attrition risks that we're seeing or any change in that regard. If anything, we view it as a positive because it is something that they can look forward to be part of a bigger business. Nonetheless, we are experiencing attrition. I think we've talked about that for the better part of a year now, and it's elevated. It's still elevated. It hasn't really moved off of the level we've seen, which is, I guess in some respects good that we can forecast it, but nonetheless, it's still too high. And that would be across all work groups. And I think that that's a product of more the labor market than it is anything else. But we are looking at ways to address it. I refer to in my prepared comments, specifically our pilots, but we have other things that we talk about at airports and with our technicians and with our flight attendants as well. And we keep plugging away. I mean, there is a bit -- it is definitely one of the limiting factors for us today, is attrition on the back end and attracting and hiring on the front end. But we've addressed that with the schoolhouse and making ourselves a good landing spot for our team members. And we'll continue to hammer away at it.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Ted, I appreciate that very direct answer, and I don't want to put you on the spot. But could we put numbers to pilots? So kind of where are we today? And what do you need to hire to hit the growth plan or the capacity guidance that you've outlined there? Is this simply a function of getting folks that you've already hired through the schoolhouse, or is this about net new hiring? And thank you for taking the questions.\nTed Christie: Sure. So, it's both Duane. It's -- obviously, we have and I think we talked about this over the last few calls. We have ramped up the size of our flight operations schoolhouse, and our in flight schoolhouse, both our flight attendants and our pilots considerably. Like, we've more than doubled the size of that throughput in either case, and have been successful at attracting new candidates, and moving them through that process. But that requires us to not only hire to address the deficit in utilization that we have today. Because remember, we're flying about two hours per aircraft, less than we want to fly today, but we're delivering new airplanes as well. And as we attrite off the backend, we have to make up for that. So it's quite a bit of effort. The team has done a great job in a very abbreviated amount of time at building that infrastructure to make that happen, which I'm very proud of them of being able to do. It's a daily activity. But I would say that the numbers to think about, and I think Scott even mentioned that in the quarter we hired 800 people. We're onboarding a significant number of new pilots every day. The class sizes are, like I said, more than double what they used to be. And I'd say that's true for flight attendants as well. And that will remain the case for the foreseeable future as we both address attrition and hopefully it starts to wane and we chew into our utilization deficit in the additional airplanes.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks for the thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you. We take our next question now from Chris Stathoulopoulos at Susquehanna.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Good Morning. Ted, I was wondering if you could give us some color on what you're seeing around peak versus non-peak travel and seasonality. And whether any of those trends are perhaps signaling what you think might be a shift with respect to leisure travel due to hybrid work. So meaning our sort of any anomalies showing up there that perhaps non-peaks are less non-peak, if you will, and seasonality is not behaving the way it normally would, which you believe you could attribute to this hybrid work. Thank you.\nTed Christie: Sure, Chris. I'm actually going to let Matt jump in and give some thoughts on that. Matt?\nMatthew Klein: Yeah. Sure thing.\nTed Christie: Yeah. Chris, so some of the language we've heard out, out there in the industry in terms of how passengers have shifted around by day a week is something that we're seeing as well. We've seen that all through COVID, and all of a sudden Thursday became the peak day of the week and Monday became the peak day of the week, more so than Friday and Sunday. And we're seeing similar patterns with that. As we moved out of the summer into the fall with school back in session, it's not as pronounced as we have seen in prior years in terms of day, week shift, but we still see some of that, which is good. It stretches the days of the week out, and it lends to more flying in general, more trips are happening in general, which is why when we talk about the ULCC model in general and the growth of travel, there's more travel opportunities being opened up now than there ever has been before. And we believe part of that is hybrid work allows for more trips, shorter trips, and more trips to fill in some of those off peak, previously known as off peak days of the week. Now, having said that, we are still seeing differences in yields and load factors on off peak days of the week. Tuesdays and Wednesdays for us are still Tuesdays and Wednesdays in terms of their demand relative to those days of the week. But overall, they definitely are closer to the median as to where they were pre-COVID. I would also add in that, we are seeing some shift not just by day a week, but also by time of year. We're definitely seeing, as we mentioned in my prepared remarks, even in September while load factor was down a little bit versus 2019, overall demand is strong and the yields were especially impressive coming out of the summer into the fall period. So, I guess in summary, you could say, yes, we are seeing some shift. We saw throughout COVID. It's still there, not as pronounced as it was during COVID, but it's definitely still there. And I'd say part of the best part is that we are seeing people move into off peak times of month, which over time will be very beneficial for overall earning production.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And my follow-up question. So, Ted, you spoke about in your prepared remarks about this multi-year headwind to the network as it relates to Florida, but at the same time, you're targeting a full return to utilization by mid 2023. So, is -- if we put those together as well as perhaps some of this shift here in travels to this hybrid phenomena, if you will, is low $0.06 CASM X still the plan for next year? Thank you.\nTed Christie: Sure. So, let me make a couple of comments. I'll let Scott jump into as it relates specifically how we're thinking about CASM. So, yes. FLORIDA is a constraint. We're still going to get back to utilization. It's just from a revenue production perspective. It's not going to be the optimal answer. So we'll fly to non-Florida places where we have opportunities, but Florida is a big earnings generator for us. Fort Lauderdale is a big powerful spot for us. We're now the second largest airline in Orlando. And those are both a big piece of our network. So, we would prefer to have more flying in Florida from a revenue perspective, but the utilization will come in other places, which are still good opportunities for us. And that'll drive by the middle part of next year, middle to late part of summer utilization sort of more normalized. But the pressures I referenced before are still pressures on CASM X. So Scott, what would you add on?\nScott Haralson: Yeah. No, I think that's right. I mean, I think it's around. We're going to fly the capacity, we can fly where we fly it, is partially dictated by some of the stuff happening in Florida and what we'll have to reallocate the network. But from a cost perspective, and really all we've talked about is 2023. And Matt alluded to a slightly lower level of capacity. And look, we're still trying to figure out what fleet deliveries will look like. We have insights really into the first half of 2023, and we're going to make some assumptions around how that carries forward the rest of the year. And we'll continue to work with our partners on figuring out delivery dates. But right now, we're sitting at something slightly lower than what we thought about, so we're probably going to see a little pressure on CASM X. We had talked about low sixes. So it's probably in the low to mid sixes given the reduced level of capacity. But we'll refine that as we get through the planning process and get definitive dates on deliveries. But capacity is going to be the biggest driver here as we think about 2023 CASM.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Conor Cunningham at Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: Hey, everyone. Thank you for the time. I was just wondering if you could just speak to the strategy on both ancillary and base fairs. One of your, you alluded this a little bit in the prepared remarks, but one of your competitors is clearly prioritizing ancillary over base, and you guys are coming at a much more balanced approach. I'm just curious on why you would go that way versus first pushing ancillary, any thoughts would be helpful. Thank you.\nMatthew Klein: Sure. Conor, it's Matt. Generally speaking, I understand your question. We are in the game of producing total RASM. So, the way that we see our network and the way that we see our long-term production, we think a balanced approach is the right way to go moving forward. We're not sure, if we were to see a reduction in economic activity, what would happen to non-ticket. So, we know it's stickier, and it's proven to be sticky, but at some point you might get to a level where you can't maintain a number that moves too high, too fast relative to the more traditional method base fair. So, that's the approach that we're taking right now. We're trying to be very measured and pragmatic in our movements. We're definitely trying to maximize both metrics, so it's not -- we're not trying to minimize one as it relates to the other. I don't know if, if our competitors are thinking of it the same way or not, but I know for us, we are actively trying to not trade between the two buckets. We're trying to make sure that we maximize both on the way up. We think that's a better long-term approach to driving revenue.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then on the 2023 capacity adjustment that you're making, can you just flush out a little bit of the puts and takes, like from gauge, new markets that frequency, that type of thing. Because what I'm trying to really understand is just like what a new normal is for utilization. We talk about normalized utilization all the time, but if that number's the same, that it was pre-pandemic. So, just any thoughts on the actual makeup of the capacity in 2023? I think that would be helpful. Thank you again.\nTed Christie: I guess I can offer -- this Ted. I can offer a couple comments and Matt, if you want to jump in as well. But at the highest level, fleet utilization prior to the pandemic here at Spirit was in the low 12 hours range somewhere, 12, 12.25, maybe plus or minus a little bit more than that, depending on how we felt about the season. Today we're 10.6, so we're well underneath that. I think getting back to a 12 plus number is the objective. And that's still the objective. We updated or gave a view on ASM production next year at 60 billion to 62 billion ASMs, which was less than where we were before and alluded to a few inputs, but direct -- putting it directly, we are seeing supply chain related issues on aircraft deliveries and supply chain related issues on engine manufacturing and engine overhaul, which is forcing us to take aircraft out of service. So, we're losing active airplanes, which is the primary driver of the reduction in ASMs, which is not the best answer to be honest. But nonetheless, that -- those are the facts. We'll continue to optimize around that as best we can. We have airplanes that can work a little harder. We have some that we are evaluating, eventually retiring and we got to make decisions on that. So, there's still refinements coming, but that's probably the primary reason that we're seeing ASM kind of like come down a little bit in the year, the mix applying. I would turn over to Matt, see if he has any view on that.\nMatthew Klein: Yeah. Geographically, we are still a little bit constrained as we talked about in Florida and we'll learn a lot as we move through the winter here in spring for Florida and how just sort of industry traffic including general aviation plays a role in running through the air traffic control system. So, what we'll learn a lot. We'll continue to learn more. What we will do is, what you'll see us doing like we're doing in the fourth quarter now as well, is just continue to run a little bit more during the off peaks in order to generate as many ASMs as we can. As we said in the prepared remarks, running more on off peaks may have an impact on some metrics like RASM, but we believe at the end of the day in the environment we're in today, it's better to have the most efficient crew network we possibly can. And to have the most efficient crew network we can, it requires us to do some things like run a little bit more off peaks, but that ultimately drives earnings, because we're generating more capacity and we're not having an issue filling that capacity with good yields at this time.\nConor Cunningham: Appreciate the big thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Scott Group at Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just want to talk about utilization near term. So, it's been sort of trending slightly lower throughout 2022. It sounds like you think it gets better in Q4. I guess what's the target for utilization Q4 within the guidance and then what's the driver of that inflection higher in Q4?\nTed Christie: Hey, Scott. I'll let our Scott jump in too, but yes, utilization did trend down. We were very vocal about the fact that we had to pull flying from the third quarter because of Florida ATC constraints and that was a direct impact utilization. It was not the answer we wanted. But that's where we landed. You are correct though that as we turned the corner heading into the fourth quarter, we are going to see an uptick in utilization. It's not dramatic. So, if we landed about 10.5 hours in the third quarter be more like 10.75 hours, but that's right on the line of our expected return to normalization as we move between now and the middle part of next year. So, feeling good that that's exactly where we want to be. Scott, what would you \u2026\nScott Haralson: That's exactly right. Look, I mean, we took or will take a large number of aircraft in Q4, which will, you can say mathematically pressure that number in the quarter. But the plan has always been to methodically move utilization from here until the middle of 2023. And we're doing that. We feel good about where capacity and utilization sit for Q4, where it looks for Q1 and Q2 and Q3 of next year. And so, I think that that's what we're doing is we're balancing the hiring, operational reliability and the economic production of the business. So, it's happening along the plan that we had always sort of thought. We knew this was not going to be a snap your fingers over the night fixed. And we've said that for probably a year now, that it's going to take some time. Obviously, the attrition that happened in the crew network has slowed that down a bit, but we're still targeting the middle of next year. So, I think, we're still moving in that direction.\nScott Group: Okay. That's helpful. And then just want to follow-up on the CASM commentary for next year. So, one of the other airlines, they talked about first half next year, flat to up first half 2023 versuu 2022, and then down year-over-year second half versus 2023 versus 2022. Directionally, is that how you'd be thinking about CASM for you guys as well, still up in first half and then down in second half?\nTed Christie: We haven't talked about any quarter or sort of 2023 distribution of how CASM looks. But CASM will be down year-over-year. As we get production back in the business, we will see an annual reduction in unit costs. We do see sometimes the first quarter will be slightly higher just due to a handful of timing components. But in the year we do expect CASM to be down as we get utilization back in the airline. But we haven't given any detail to the quarterly breakout.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you guys. Appreciate.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Jamie Baker of JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning everybody. Most of my questions have been addressed, so I'll try to ask something from left field. A question on pilots. The deal you struck back in 2018 had a preferential bidding system. I know that transitioning to a PBS is time consuming. There's some calibration along the way. Just curious if the current results, your current financials fully reflect that benefit and assuming that it does -- the benefit square with what your expectations were back in the day?\nTed Christie: Hey, Jamie. It's Ted. Thanks for the left field question. So, yes. We did put PBS in as part of our 2018 contract. It took us about a year to get that implemented. So we got about a year of pre-COVID experience with it. And I'd say that it behaved exactly as the way both parties had agreed, so both the union and ourselves, so that we did get the benefit and they got what they needed out of it. Of course, COVID has disrupted all that, so I wouldn't say anything's included in the way production works today, but yes, it's working the way we anticipated and -- which is a good sign.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Good. And then a more conventional follow up, the aforementioned shifts in travel patterns that you know, you and everybody is -- everyone's discussing these days. How does that flow through to scheduling and maintenance? I would've thought it would've been trickier if you have a more consistent schedule. I would think peaks and valleys would make maintenance easier, but that's not the case, that Frontier cited. So, I'm just kind of curious about how you're flying the airline any differently as a result of these travel patterns.\nTed Christie: Well, at the highest level, operators want consistency. They want level stuff, right? And airline, commercial people push you into peaks and valleys because they want to maximize revenue. And that tug, that push pool is what's going on at any business today. And so, what you address, you said you would've thought that that peaks and valleys would make maintenance easier. What it does is it pushes all the maintenance into the valley, right? And so you may think that that was like optimized, but I don't think the maintenance people would tell you they want to do that, right? They want a plan, and they want something that's -- because they can staff easier to it, they can order easier to it, they can hanger easier to it. It's just -- the logistics of it end up being a lot smoother. So, again, the push pull is still there today. It's just that we've taken learnings away from the way we operated in the summer of last year. And one of the things that we're doing is smoothing the schedule out because it does make it easier on the airports, it makes it easier on tech ops and it makes it easier on staffing.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Perfect answer. Thanks for squeezing me in. Take care.\nTed Christie: Yeah.\nOperator: We go next now to Quinn Wasko of Cowen.\nQuinn Wasko: Hi, this is Quinn on for Helane. So last call you talked about having 30% more pilots than pre-pandemic. I know part of that is due to aircraft deliveries. Part of it is positioning for higher attrition, but as you've seen airport infrastructure improve, your Florida market, are confident enough in your own operational performance that you'd be willing to scale back the excess of -- levels of pilots you guys are managing as you add back capacity.\nTed Christie: Let me kick off. And then, Scott, you feel free to update if we have. But you're right. What's been happening over the course of our recovery here as we build back is that we've been adding in infrastructure that's pilots, flight attendants, airplanes, staffing, broadly speaking ahead of the actual ASM production. In addition to the fact that you have the larger schoolhouses across the business, which really has the additional people and expense in it that are not producing anything. Those are just bigger cost rags today than they were before. And so, they're ahead of where overall growth and ASM production it would normally be. So yes, that gives us confidence that we will hit our ASM targets. But it is one of the things that makes CASM look higher than it should be. And what are you going to \u2026\nScott Haralson: Yeah. So the only thing I would add there, Quinn, is obviously when there's volatility in the staffing components of the airline call it the crew, right? We have higher attrition. We have bigger numbers that we have to hit. We have moving utilization, growing fleet, all those things. So, that has given us a bit of caution to make sure we have enough, I'll call it slack in the system to feel comfortable in predicting where the numbers need to be and actually hitting those. So, as volatility in the ranks reduces, we'll feel more comfortable reducing some of the slack. And over time that sort of means returning back to traditional reserve levels and we're doing things to the network that make it slightly easier to operate. And so, as we put all those puzzle pieces back together, it's growing the airline and also gaining efficiency as we do it. So, all these things will sort of combine over time. But yeah, I think once we get levels that we can predict, we get comfortable at how they operate, then we'll be ready to remove some of the slack and that includes reserves.\nQuinn Wasko: Got it. That makes sense. Thank you. And second question, so load factors took a bit of a hit in 3Q, yields remain strong though. I'm just wondering, in September month, were you getting any sort of pushback on -- far as you seeing any sort of ceiling there?\nMatthew Klein: Hey, Quinn. This is Matt. Actually, what we started to see happen throughout September was some efforts, because we had mentioned about our off peak day of week and some of the increases we've done in off peak days of the week. What we found is that the traffic ended up being relatively sticky compared to the fairs. What I mean by that is trying to drive a little bit more load factor on those off peak days a week wasn't necessarily generating the revenue outcome that we thought was maximizing for the company. So, we actually found that the fair levels themselves were at the right price points to maximize TRASM, reducing the fair did not drive higher TRASM, which is why we went back to the -- sort of our going rates, so to speak. They were still off peak. They were still September, but they weren't as low as they'd been in prior years. And that actually drove the best revenue outcome for us. And on top of that, if I can drive higher TRASM with a little bit less activity at the airport, that's better for everybody involved. So, that's actually worked out pretty well for us that we learned last month.\nQuinn Wasko: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for the time.\nMatthew Klein: Sure.\nOperator: And we'll go next now to Stephen Trent of Citi.\nStephen Trent: Good morning everybody, and thanks very much for squeezing me in. Just a quick one for you. I appreciate the comments on the Florida capacity constraints. When you think about the growth opportunities in some of the other markets, any high level views on how you're seeing maybe a westbound flow or Mexico cross border Tribune Basin, sort of any high level views on the growth opportunities you're seeing other markets. Thank you.\nMatthew Klein: True. Steven, it's Matt. I would tell you that I think we mentioned this on the last call, we were seeing a little bit of a slowdown in traffic to some of our international VFR markets. We saw a little bit of that in Central America, a little bit in South America. The good news is while we did see some of that slowing down earlier this year, it came back, it's almost all the way back to where it was before. And this is speculation, we don't know if it was because of just economic slowdown. Was it the end of COVID activity? Was it inflation? Was it currency related issues? We're not entirely sure. Take your pick. It might have been all of them. But the good news is that we are seeing that bounce back as well. So where we did see some slow down geographically in our international VFR that's come back to where we would like to see that. And what we've been able to do is continue to grow a little bit more out on the west coast and in the middle of the country. So, Los Angeles has been a spot that we've been seeing great profitable growth in, Las Vegas continues to grow for us as well. So, while we are seeing the constraints on our Florida network, we are able to reallocate that to other parts of the country. And we're comfortable with the unit revenue production there. It will serve us well in the future because we're establishing more predictability in our future network now in some of the growth opportunities that we saw for the future. So, we're doing those growth opportunities now. And as we in the industry feel more comfortable with throughput into Florida, and I say the industry, I'm talking about air traffic control throughput, we'll be able to then grow back into Florida, which is a major strength for us today. So, it's worked out right. We are taking somewhat of a RASM penalty because of the network construction right now, but for the long-term, it should work out quite fine as we ramp back up into our strengths.\nStephen Trent: Really appreciate that Matt. Nice to be [indiscernible] on you guys. Thank you.\nMatthew Klein: Thanks David.\nTed Christie: Thanks David. \nOperator: Thank you. We go next now Savanthi Syth at Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good morning. I was curious with the peak, off peak changes you're seeing, is there a change in kind of ancillary revenue, the way where people are purchasing ancillary revenue items? And along with that just what's driving some of the ancillary revenue growth currently and into next year. What would you see as kind of being the big drivers?\nMatthew Klein: Sure. Savi, it's Matt again. I'll take that one. In terms of the timing as to when our guests are adding ancillaries onto their itineraries, we're not seeing a real difference in advanced purchase of those ancillaries. What I would tell you, and we don't talk about this very often, but I do think it's important for Spirit and our business model is the use of new technology that is referred to as NDC, which is a new distribution capability technology, that is in conjunction with IATA. It's been out for a long time. It continues to improve and we've really adopted that across the board for our -- it's called our third-party distribution. And what that allows us to do is basically treat third-party pricing and display. What we provide to those parties is going to be very similar, if not the same as to what they see at spirit.com and our app. And what that means is it allows us, as we dynamically price more and more of our ancillaries, we're able to push that pricing out to those third parties and those third parties are displaying and selling those products for us, that's a change from pre-COVID to today. And that's a big deal. As we continue to move forward, that gives more, more access to the optional services that our guests like and what they want to add to their itineraries. So, it just gives us another channel to have more reach. And I think that's important. So, I don't think that's exactly the question you were asking, but I think that's the color -- that's important to understand is where we're collecting our ancillaries from is change, not necessarily when we collect them.\nSavanthi Syth: Okay. And in terms of drivers for next year.\nMatthew Klein: Sure. In terms of drivers for next year, well, we're continuing to build out our bundled services offerings. Those are continuing to get more fine tuned. Some of our growth in our non-ticket rate that we've throughout this year has been due to those offerings. And in conjunction with all of that, we're still seeing nice growth. The trajectory is now really moving more vertically for us, which is great in terms of our COBRA and credit card partnership, that we have out there. We relaunched the program about 18, 19 months ago now, continues to grow. One of our largest distribution channels is when we offer the card on our flights themselves. And our flight attendant group, our in-flight group has been fantastic with that. We were pre-COVID, we had a little bit of a lull during COVID for what I think would be obvious reasons. And now coming out of COVID, we've seen a great adoption once again and it's been a great partnership throughout the entire company. So, I think that is another option for us to keep growing as we get into next year as well.\nSavanthi Syth: Okay. That's helpful. And if I might just real quickly on the margin side, is it real -- what's really going to get you back to historical margins? Is it -- can I -- is just getting back to utilization sufficient or do you need to be able to start kind of growing in Florida again? What are the kind of the key triggers to build back that margin?\nTed Christie: Yeah. Savi, it\u2019s Ted. Thanks for asking the question. I was going to ask for that clarity on an earlier question and I kind of got timed out. But I think, it's a valid point because we've been talking a lot about what Florida means, where we are with utilization, why is our margin where it is. And I think if you -- we've done some math on this. If we were at peak utilization today, you could probably add about four points to the margin. And if we were flying Florida the way we wanted to fly Florida and network, the way we wanted to fly network, we'd probably be another three to four points. So, in today's fuel environment with utilization the way we want it to be, we'd be a double-digit kind of op margin business. Not -- again, not where we wanted to be long-term, but closer. And I think that that's -- those are the building blocks, right? Is getting the utilization back up and allowing the network to be where it optimally wants to be. And that's why we've sort of -- and we've said this a few times, we've words like methodical and pragmatic and all that other kind of stuff. We're -- we've drawn our guidance line as to when we think we can get back to that type of operation. And we're on that line today. And so, admittedly it's not where we would prefer to be today, but we understand where it is and we're confident that we will get there by the middle part of next year.\nSavanthi Syth: That's helpful. Thank you.\nDeAnne Gabel: So, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Gabel. And we'll take that question this morning from Andrew Didora of Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Most of my questions have been answered. Just maybe a random one for Ted. Obviously, a lot has transpired over the course of this year. The lengthy kind of regulatory process coming up. Where are you and the team spending your time today? And can you focus as much around the day to day as you did say, kind of pre February of this year? Thanks.\nTed Christie: Sure. Well, yeah, it was a distracting period for a select number of senior management as we worked through the various ups and downs throughout the course of this M&A drama. But that's all behind us now. We are running the business like we would run the business any other day. And I speak for everyone from the ramper all the way up. So, a hundred percent time being focused on achieving those objectives that I lay it out for you and kind of hitting the points that I just laid out to Savi, which is getting us back to where we want to be, both on the margin and on utilization.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you.\nEnd of Q&A:\nDeAnne Gabel: Great. That's it for this call folks. We'll catch you next quarter. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you Ms. Gable. Again, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude Spirit Airlines' third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We'd like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great remainder of your day."}, {"symbol": "SAVE", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-08-10 11:53:20", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Erica, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to DeAnne Gabel, Senior Director, Investor Relations.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, Erica, and welcome, everyone, to Spirit Airlines' second quarter earnings call. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call will be archived on our website for 60 days. Presenting on today's call are Ted Christie, Spirit's Chief Executive Officer; Matt Klein, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Scott Haralson, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are other members of our senior leadership team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our second quarter 2022 earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures. With that, I turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks, DeAnne. Good morning. Thanks to everyone for joining us today. It's been a very busy summer with robust demand for leisure travel, resulting in crowded airports and full planes. In addition, we at Spirit have had a few other things on our plate, and I want to offer my sincere gratitude to our team members being focused on supporting each other and delivering high-quality service to our guests. Before discussing our second quarter results, on July 28, we entered into a definitive merger agreement, under which JetBlue will acquire Spirit for $33.50 per share in cash, including a prepayment of $2.50 per share in cash upon Spirit's stockholders' approval of the transaction and a ticking fee of $0.10 per month starting in January 2023 up to a maximum amount of $34.15 per share. As you know, we previously signed a merger agreement with Frontier Airlines, which we terminated on July 27. Thanks to our Board's robust and diligent process, shortly following that termination, we were able to enter into a very favorable deal with JetBlue that delivers significant immediate value to our stockholders. The merger agreement with JetBlue provides meaningful protection for our stockholders against an adverse regulatory outcome and a significant cash premium upon closing the deal. Until then, though, it's business as usual. So with that, let's move on to our second quarter results. For the second quarter of 2022, we reported an adjusted net loss of $32.2 million or a loss of $0.30 per share. Our adjusted pretax margin was negative 2.8%, which exceeded the better end of our guidance. Demand was strong and our revenue production was robust with total revenue increasing 34.9% compared to the second quarter of 2019 on 9.9% more capacity. Our operational improvements drove a much more reliable airline and, therefore, more predictable costs, excluding fuel. As we've discussed before, we are still operating at suboptimal productivity levels with total fleet utilization around 2 hours per airplane less than our 2019 levels. We've built an efficiency-based franchise that maximizes earnings with optimized utilization of assets and labor. The carrying cost of underutilized assets, human capital and lack of capacity production are delaying our return to run rate profitability levels. However, once we reach a more traditional utilization level, we're confident in our ability to deliver normal operating margins. The expected time line to achieve that goal will, in part, depend on the infrastructure that supports the aviation industry, most notably the ability to fully deploy our schedule to and from Florida. Operationally, by June, we had our first glimpse as to how the changes we've made to date are improving operational reliability. These changes include adding new crew bases, changing how we flow aircraft and how we approach crew scheduling. We finished the quarter on a strong note with a 98.8% completion factor for June. July's completion factor rose to 99.7%, including 15 days with 100% completion, an excellent result from the investments made. And now I'll hand it over to Matt and Scott to share some additional details about our second quarter performance as well as some color around our third quarter outlook. Matt, over to you.\nMatt Klein: Thanks, Ted. I also want to thank the Spirit team. Travel demand has been strong. Load factors and passenger counts are back to pre-COVID levels in most locations, and we've seen packed airports with lots of guests excited to resume their summer travel plans. I thank our team for maintaining their dedication and professionalism during these busy times and for providing a high-value travel experience for our guests. Turning now to our second quarter 2022 revenue performance. For the second quarter, our revenue was $1.37 billion up 34.9% compared to the second quarter 2019. Total RASM for the quarter was $0.1154 up 22.8% versus 2019. This is quite a remarkable achievement considering we saw capacity increase by nearly 10% while also lengthening stage by 2%. Additionally, this is the first quarter since prior to the pandemic where we achieved double-digit absolute total unit revenue results in all 3 months of the quarter. On a per segment basis, again, compared to the second quarter 2019, total revenue per passenger increased 24.3% to $140.61. Passenger revenue per segment increased 25.7% to over $72 and non-ticket per segment increased 22.8% to a record $68.20. This is another new record for non-ticket per segment production and was 5.7% higher than the prior quarterly record of $64.53 that we just achieved in the first quarter 2022. Bag and seat revenue continued to improve from an already record level, and we also are continuing to recognize impressive per-segment revenue increases from our bundled services offerings. One more note about Q2 before we talk about guidance for Q3. We saw a year-over-3-year improvement in TRASM every month in Q2, including a peak result of 30% TRASM growth in June 2022 versus June 2019 driven by large increases in both fair and non-ticket metrics. Our strategy is to continue to drive increases in both metrics, and we are pleased to see that we are not trading between the 2 revenue buckets. Now moving to third quarter 2022 total unit revenue guidance. The first half of the quarter has already seen flown TRASM achieve better than 20% growth versus 2019. And as we head into the back half of the third quarter, demand continues to remain strong. On an absolute basis, we are seeing what we hope to see, which is normal average fare seasonality for the off-peak period relative to peak summer results, and this is good news as it sets us up to see strong unit revenue growth results versus 2019. Given these inputs, we estimate our third quarter revenue will range between $1.33 billion to $1.37 billion with TRASM up 18% to 21% versus third quarter 2019, and we expect to achieve these results on approximately 14% more capacity than we produced in third quarter 2019 while also growing stage by around 1.5%. Regarding the network changes Ted referenced, while we are seeing good revenue results from the network changes we've made, we are still constrained on the number of flights we can operate to the Jacksonville Air Traffic Control Center. To put this in context, Florida to the Continental U.S. accounts for about 40% of our network. If this constraint did not exist, Florida to the Continental U.S. would likely be closer to 50% of our network. Additionally and importantly, to help maintain operational reliability and recoverability, we will continue to take a pragmatic approach towards capacity deployment from now through the first half of 2023. Given that, we now estimate fourth quarter capacity will increase approximately 25% versus 2019. For full year 2023, even with capacity moderated in the first half of next year, we are still targeting our previously stated range of 62 billion to 65 billion available seat miles. However, if the industry infrastructure doesn't improve enough to support a higher growth rate as the year progresses, we will likely be towards the lower end of the range for the full year. In closing, we are pleased with our second quarter revenue results. We are excited about the continued prospects of nonticket production development. Load factors and yields continue to be strong as we grow capacity and stage length, and the third quarter continues to build nicely even as we head into the off-peak period. This is a total team and company effort, and the revenue results really do speak for themselves. And now here's Scott.\nScott Haralson: Thanks, Matt. I'll provide a few additional details about our second quarter results and share when we are planning to get back to full utilization. Good cost management and benefits from improved reliability resulted in better-than-expected nonfuel costs for the second quarter, mitigating the majority of the impact from higher-than-expected fuel prices. On a unit cost basis, lower utilization remains a headwind. Fleet utilization for the quarter was about 15% lower than our desired levels. We built a business that is capable of producing a much higher level of capacity. To help put this in perspective, since the start of the pandemic in the spring of 2020, we've added about 20% more aircraft, 30% more pilots and 17% more flight attendance yet are only producing 8.5% more capacity. The industry infrastructure is still unstable, but we are not yet comfortable that it can reliably support higher levels of utilization. By industry infrastructure, I'm primarily referring to the labor challenges across various support functions of the industry, including suppliers, business partners and the ATC and TSA, an issue impacting all U.S. airlines. We are seeing progress. It's just not happening as rapidly as we had anticipated. In addition, higher crew attrition is also limiting our ability to ramp up utilization as fast as we would like. We will continue to balance our desire to get back to full utilization with our commitment to run a reliable operation. From a liquidity perspective, we remain in a strong position. We ended the second quarter with $1.5 billion in liquidity, which includes unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and our $240 million of available capacity from our revolving credit facility. Year-to-date through June 30, we made debt payments, including principal, interest and fees of $135 million and had capital expenditures, including net purchase deposits, of around $114 million. For the full year 2022, we estimate our capital expenditures, again, including net purchase deposits, will be approximately $270 million. Regarding the fleet, during the second quarter, we took delivery of 4 A320neo aircraft, ending the quarter with 180 aircraft. We expect to take an additional 17 aircraft throughout the remainder of the year, ending the year with 197 aircraft. Our 2022 deliveries are fully financed, and we are in the process of finalizing documents for the sale leaseback financing for our 2023 deliveries from Airbus. Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2022, we estimate our pretax margin will range between negative 1% to positive 1%. This assumes total operating expenses of $1.32 billion to $1.33 billion or a CASM ex fuel of $0.069 to $0.07 and the fuel price per gallon assumption of $3.55 and to $3.60. When our capacity constraints ease and we are back to optimal utilization levels, we anticipate a baseline run rate CASM ex fuel in the low $0.06 range. This does not take into account any new labor deals with our unionized work groups. As we begin to frame our 2023 plan, we are assuming we can achieve normalized utilization levels by midyear 2023 and net fuel price per gallon will be about $3.40. Together with a reasonably strong demand backdrop, this should produce a mid-single-digit op margin for 2023. Before I turn it back to Ted, I do want to thank the Spirit team for their incredible efforts during what has been an ever-changing environment over the past couple of years. Kudos to the entire team. With that, I'll hand it back to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks, Scott. Last quarter, I outlined our objectives for the next year or 2. Here they are, again, along with an update. Number one, network reliability enhancements and growth. In June, we delivered very strong operational results, and we had one of our best operational July's on record, 3 new crew bases, crew services automation and optimized buffer in and out of Florida were the big wins. . Network growth achievements were capped with fantastic news of the DOT's decision to grant Spirit all 16 available takeoff and landing allocations at Newark Airport, which when fully utilized, gives us up to 45 departures from the New York Metropolitan area. Two, return to peak utilization and profitability. For utilization, our expectation was to deliver this by year-end 2022. But after experiencing how the ATC has operated this summer, coupled with our new crew planning strategies, it seems more prudent to target the summer of 2023. Full restoration of profit margins will, as we indicated, return once this target is achieved. Three, record non-ticket performance. Current quarter non-ticket of $68 is another all-time record. And as we continue to refine our pricing and product mix, we expect this number will continue to climb over time; and four, widening the unit cost gap. We have maintained a wide gap to the industry, which we believe will widen over time. However, until we get back to full utilization and optimize our network, this is a work in progress. There is much to do throughout 2023. With the distraction and uncertainty of the past 6 months behind us now, I'm excited to see this group of talented and motivated aviation professionals show the industry what a fantastic company we have become. And with that, back to DeAnne.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, Ted. We are now ready to take questions from the analysts. [Operator Instructions] Erica, we are ready to begin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nJay Gunning: This is Jay Gunning on for Duane. Could you mark-to-market how caught up on pilot hiring and training you are? And then given your flight plan through the end of 2023, how many more pilots will you need?\nTed Christie: This is Ted. So I think as Scott indicated, we've been actively hiring pilots and adding them to our baseline. If you look back at the pre-pandemic levels, we have about 30% more pilots today than we had at the time. However, attrition is significantly higher than it was then, too. So we're going through a little bit of that right now. We are -- we've been ramping up our school house over the past 6 months, 6 or 8 months to the point where we're nearly doubling the size of that school house and still very successful in getting the necessary powers we need to fill each individual class and have a good backlog of resumes in place for additional pilots. So we're on target to hit what we need from a staffing perspective. That includes pilots and flight attendants and technicians across the board as well as supporting our business partners at all the airports to make sure that we have appropriate staffing at all the airports. We're on target to get back to full utilization as we indicated in the middle part of next year.\nJay Gunning: And then just as a follow-up, do you have any estimate on how much it would cost and how long it would take to reconfigure your planes to the JetBlue configuration?\nTed Christie: No, we don't. I think that's probably a better question for JetBlue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nShannon Doherty: This is actually Shannon Doherty on for Mike. So the first one, can you guys dig a bit deeper into the efforts that you made on the cost management side in the June quarter?\nScott Haralson: Yes. Look, this is Scott. I think the majority of the benefit comes from efficient production. Running a good airline, as we've mentioned before, has ripple effects through the P&L and then that production of ASMs on the unit cost side. And so we're continuing to build back the airline, so building the infrastructure for us to continue to hire and train pilots to make sure we have the real estate in place to run a fully utilized airline. There are going to be headwinds, but on the unit cost side, it's primarily going to be fisher production of ASMs.\nShannon Doherty: And my second question, aside from the overall industry infrastructure issues that we're facing, what would you guys say is the biggest risk to your return to sustained and meaningful profitability? And should we expect to see this happen by summer of 2023?\nTed Christie: Sure. So as we've stated in our comments, I just answered some questions. Obviously, the bigger inputs to return profitability are full utilization of the assets, and the inputs to getting there require labor and infrastructure support from our team members, our business partners as well as the various government and nongovernment entities that support the airline business. And so I would view those as the primary things that would drive one way or the other. What I can tell you is those things that we control, which is our staffing, our hiring, our training, are on track and on target in some respects ahead. And we feel good about our ability to get there. There are some things beyond our control as well that have inputs, but we have received comfort from various support entities, business partners as well as the FAA that they are also making the necessary adjustments to get us already to have much bigger airline business as we head into 2023. So I would say those are the inputs, the puts and takes. Obviously, input costs matter a lot to this business. Fuel has moved dramatically since the beginning of the pandemic and throughout the course of the pandemic. I think Scott mentioned that we're looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of 340 or 350 a gallon next year, which is historically amongst the highest fuel prices we've ever seen in this business. So that will have an input into kind of short-term profitability, but the long-term view is still that capacity will necessarily adjust to those input costs, and we'll have the appropriate level of production to drive the margins we want to get. So I feel like we're making the necessary changes to our network and doing the things we need to do to get ourselves back. We're not there yet. And we are collectively, I think, frustrated with the progress to date but still feeling optimistic about our targets for next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So how does the JetBlue merger and the regulatory uncertainty impact your capacity plans in terms of how much? And then also where? And then if you get to the low end of that ASM guidance for next year, that's about 27% capacity growth. What would you think CASM ex does with that much capacity growth?\nTed Christie: Scott, this is Ted. I'll take the first half. Scott can jump in after that. So as to what does the process, the merger process with JetBlue have an impact, the answer is none. We are active competitors today, and that will remain true until there is final approval on the deal from the regulatory authorities, which is down the road quite a bit. So we're continuing to deploy the same way we would without a deal. And our expectation is that JetBlue is doing the same. So no impact there. Scott, how would you?\nScott Haralson: Yes. On the capacity guide of 62 billion to 65 billion ASMs, we talked about a sort of CASM ex view in the low 6s. I think even with the low end of that guide or around 62%, we would still be in the low 6 range. So I think that's where we would target at this point.\nScott Group: And then as you think about next year, I think you talked about mid-single-digit operating margins. I guess 2 questions. What are you assuming in terms of unit revenue? And then with all the capacity growth, are you comfortable or confident that you can take on all these new planes and also get the utilization back to where you want? Is it difficult to get both in the same year?\nTed Christie: Well, so there's a lot there. I'll give some thoughts. I'd let Matt as well to jump in on unit revenue. We are confident that with our delivery schedule that we've got the right trajectory to get ourselves back to full utilization, as I indicated before. It doesn't come without effort. And we're in the midst of that right now. We're doing quite a bit of hiring and training for crew, as we indicated with some of our numbers, and that will continue. And so there's a lot of work to do. But as I said before, I think we're confident in our ability to execute to it. I can tell you one thought before I turn it over to Matt. As it relates to unit revenue production, we're assuming that the demand environment that we see today continues. But if we had a lot more flying today, I'm not sure the unit revenue number would be anything different. In fact, it might be higher because of the way we've throttled the network and where we throttled it. So there's still a lot of ULCC Spirit opportunities in our network. We just haven't hit them. So Matt, what -- would you dig in further on that?\nMatt Klein: Yes, that's right. And so Scott, when we think about the network and some of the network changes we've made this summer, we are expecting them to roll through the fall into -- probably into spring break next year as well. So we will have a little bit of a network sort of impact there to revenue. But the way we view that is that's opportunity coming for the future that we're not capturing today. So your question is a good one about capacity and deployment. But as Ted mentioned, right now, anyway, we feel like more capacity would have actually led to the same unit revenue, possibly even better unit revenues because we'd be flying more to where we really would like the network to be lining up right now. One more thing to note on that, though, as we look for other places in the network to continue to grow, these are all opportunities that we knew we'd be going after here as we move into the future. So maybe a couple of being pulled forward a little bit early. Not that big a deal from our perspective, we were going to be there anyway. But the bigger thing is where we see -- where we already are strong and want to continue to grow. We're just going to continue to be smart and thoughtful about how much we grow in any given month or period in some of those stations. So just making sure that we're setting ourselves up for success and making sure we set the operation up for success. Ultimately, that will help revenue production as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: So Ted, Matt, can you speak a bit more about what you're seeing in demand as we head into the fall here? It does seem like the real pent-up demand from early in the summer is gone and the industry seems to be normalizing a bit here. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you're seeing? And I guess kind of a follow-up to that question. some other airlines earlier in earnings season spoke about seeing maybe some peak pricing around leisure fares. Just curious if you feel like you're seeing the same thing.\nMatt Klein: Sure, Andrew. So as we move from summer to September and into October, we are seeing what we would call normal seasonality, which, as I said in my scripted remarks, we view as very good news. So for us, the question was going to be where the summer -- was the summer demand unusual to the extent that it would just fall off a cliff after we hit Labor Day and beyond. And we're not seeing that right now. So in fact, we're continuing to be pretty impressed with the volumes that are coming through. We're happy with the way that we have a revenue management plan set up, and we're continuing to see the volume flow through there. Now what I would say is we definitely saw a little bit of pricing movement coming out of the summer into the fall. But what's different this year compared to prior years is that we're continuing to see longer advanced purchase restrictions on fares that are published in the marketplace. So some of the levels are a little bit lower than we saw over the summer, but we're continuing to see pretty good, for lack of a better term, yield fences on the fair rules in place. So that should be good news moving through the off-peak period and then as we head towards the peaker part of Q4 as well. So that's the way that we're seeing things right now. Obviously, that can change. But as of right now, we're pretty confident and we feel pretty good about the setup.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Just want to dig into this, Matt, your comments on normal average fare seasonality. How much of your inventory for 3Q and 4Q is currently sold? And how does that compare to pre-pandemic levels?\nMatt Klein: Chris, thanks for the question. So we're not going to get into the exact details of how much is already booked versus what we expect to come. I would tell you that sort of echoing what I just said on Andrew's question is as we move out of the summer into the fall, the pricing is a little bit lower, but that would be normal as we move from the summer into the fall. And what I mean about how it's acting normal is we're still seeing and we expect to see unit revenue improvements in every month here in the quarter and moving into the fall, and it's staying at relatively consistent unit revenue growth numbers in each month. So is it different by month? Yes. Are we expecting it to be a little bit different by month? Yes. The peaker periods definitely, we expect will continue to outperform even better than the off-peak periods, but the all-period are continuing to book well. And I don't want anyone to over-rotate on this and think that it's stronger than it is. It's definitely seasonal. But the good news for us is that we're continuing to see our leisure routes and our leisure network continue to take volume that we would hope to see coming out of the summer into the fall. Hope that helps.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: And a follow-up here, Ted or Matt, you just -- can you help us think about or at least how you view the stickiness of your non-ticket fare revenue into a cyclical slowdown?\nTed Christie: Sure. I'll take that one as well. So as we move cyclically through the seasons, through the year and into next year, we are very happy with what we've seen, what we continue to see book. It gives us confidence that the stickiness is there and will be there I think the question will be what ultimately happens to ticket yields will likely have more of an impact than what happens on non-ticket yields. And as we just sort of got done saying, we're pretty confident that what we're seeing on the ticket side is holding its own relatively well. So if that holds, that gives us a lot more ability to do things on the non-ticket side as well. It gives us more confidence on the nonticket side to continue to do more things and invest in how we think about the products we offer and especially the way that we offer our bundled services offering continues to develop, how we think about depending on the destination that guests are traveling to. We may have different offerings in place now than we had in the past. And all of that is because dooring COVID, we continue to invest properly in what we knew was going to be opportunity coming out of COVID. And we're pleased with what we've seen, and there's definitely more opportunity to come.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: If I might just quickly return to the utilization question. I was kind of curious, it sounds like you're getting confidence that the training capacity is going to be large enough to kind of address the current attrition levels so that you can get there. I think the other component of that -- let me know if that's correct. And the other component of that is these buffers that you've built, and you need those to kind of come off to reach that utilization. So could you talk about like what you need to see to kind of remove those buffers? So what gives you the confidence that those buffers can come off in mid-2022? Or maybe you don't need the buffers to come off? Maybe you'd get it all through training. Just kind of curious if you could address that a little bit more.\nTed Christie: Sure, Savi. The training issue, you are correct. We have adjusted -- we started adjusting it in the latter part of last year as a result of the attrition change attrition has kind of like stabilized at this point. It's still elevated from what we like and what we want to see, but we have adjusted to it. So absent there being some other sort of step change one way or the other, we feel like we've made the necessary adjustments, and we have seen enough history here over the last 6 or 7 operating months, so we have at least some idea. So I feel like we've made the necessary adjustments there. As to the second half of your question, I think it's a sure point, we have put in place a lot of buffer in the system to run well because we have the time, but also to adjust to the practical realities of the operating system, the North American aerospace. So you heard us talk about Florida a lot, well \u2013 pre-pandemic and into the early parts of -- and in the part of last year, we were 50%, 60% of our flying in Florida. And so it does have an impact when things aren't running well down here. And being able to analyze those changes, be it buffer or block performance or the way we crew schedule, the way we base our crews, what we call the pairing mix, which means how long are our crews away from base before they come back and refresh, all of that are under -- the analysis of all of it is underway and trying to isolate as best you can, which of those things is having the greater impact and which isn't. We've already made some conclusions about that, by the way, and have some early returns on the things that we can start to, to your point, either remove the buffer or layer in more flying as a result of the change. And those experiments will start in the coming quarters, which is why we're being a little bit more prudent about the build back into next year. And so nothing is perfect ever in this business. We still have to adapt quite a bit to changing environment. But I think taking this approach is going to put Spirit in a better position for the long term and, for that reason, gives us confidence that we can do it because we're learning as we go.\nSavi Syth: And then if I might follow up on the ancillary question. Clearly, ancillary has been stronger than I think even what you envisioned pre-pandemic. And just curious, I know you mentioned, Matt, that you're going to try and you invested in things and you'll be experimenting different things. Do you have a sense of how much more that you can push the ancillary fare here?\nMatt Klein: Savi, you're right. We definitely thought that we would get to these ancillary numbers but not just quickly coming out of COVID. So it's hard to know exactly where the top end of this is. One thing that I think is worth also mentioning is that we have started to see -- we're not -- it's not all the way where we want it to be yet, but we're starting to see the take rates push up well on our loyalty program as well as our credit card partner program, and that's moving well. It actually was a little slower than we would have liked to have seen, which we kind of just think COVID had a big impact on that overall for us. But the good news with this is that the trajectory has now not only caught up, but the slope of the line steeper than where we had initially thought it would be. So we're at the place we want to be with a better trajectory moving forward. . So we're pleased about that. We don't talk about it that often, but I think that's something, for example that will continue to add to our non-ticket production that really isn't there and hasn't been where we wanted it to be the last few years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJames Kirby: This is James on for Jamie. I guess since the town hall is an employee interaction since the JetBlue announcement. I'm just wondering what feedback has been? Has there any key topics that employees have bought up? And just any general feedback there?\nTed Christie: Sure. So look, this is a pretty stout and resilient group that has been put through much like every airline over the past 2 years quite a bit but specifically for us a lot over the last 6 to 8 months, and they were looking for an answer. They were looking for a little bit of clarity, and we were able to deliver that. And I think now they've begun to turn their attention back to what's critical for us, which is continuing to build a really nice franchise. And they're always going to be specific .\nJames Kirby: Yes, sorry. That's where I thought you were continuing. Just on the same question. Airbus came out with the announcement, I think, 2 weeks ago that is delaying its ramp to 8 320. Just wondering, do they send your revised schedule? Or is that really up to Airbus to just determine in your kind of that well there? And does that impact 2023 scheduling at all if it gets delayed?\nScott Haralson: James, this is Scott. Yes, we're in constant communication with Airbus around delivery dates, and there have been some delays. That doesn't impact our capacity deployment at this point primarily because we're not fully optimized at this point so we can manage through some temporary delays in terms of a month or 2, not dramatic at this point. But we continue to monitor and talk to all of our vendors, including Pratt and Airbus, around the number of products that impact our ability to deploy that capacity. So we are carefully watching it, but at this point, no real impact.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions.\nDeAnne Gabel: Great. Well, thanks all for joining us today, and we'll catch you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference.

All participants will be in listen-only mode until Q&A. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, De Anne Gabel, Senior Director, Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDe Anne Gabel: Thank you, Suzanne, and welcome, everyone, to Spirit Airlines' First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call will be archived on our website for 60 days. Presenting on today's call are Ted Christie, Spirit's Chief Executive Officer; Matt Klein, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Scott Haralson, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us in the room are other members of our senior leadership team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on file with the SEC and the consummation of the merger with Frontier Group Holdings, pursuant to the merger agreement entered into on February 5, 2022. The merger is expected to close in the second half of 2022, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including completion of the regulatory review process and approval by Spirit stockholders. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our first quarter 2022 earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. And with that, I turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks, De Anne. Thanks to everyone for joining us today. We were very pleased with the strength and demand we saw build throughout the quarter from mid-February on. March saw exceptional strength with total revenue per passenger segment up nearly 10%, compared to March 2019, and the improvement in April versus 2019 was even stronger. As we head into the peak summer period, we are very excited by the robust demand strength we are seeing. We estimate our second quarter TRASM will be up between 18% and 21% compared to the second quarter 2019, which translates into a TRASM that is the highest we've seen since 2014. Very encouraging. Before Matt and Scott share the details of our first quarter performance, I want to personally thank all of our Spirit team members for their contributions, patience and service to our guests and each other. The last couple of months have been an exceptionally difficult operating environment for carriers that operate in Florida and air traffic control has told us that we should expect these challenges to continue this summer until they can address their staffing issues. We participated in an industry meeting this week with the FAA and it appears that some adjustments are coming. But until we see them contribute, we felt the need to adjust the summer to provide more buffer for our crews, while our other network enhancements take shape. It is clearly frustrating given our large Florida presence, but we will address it head-on and make sure we are appropriately balanced. In the meantime, while our attrition rates have been elevated, we have had no issue sourcing pilots. Our pilot hiring and training is on track and we don't see a staffing concern. While our Q2 performance is disappointing, we expect profits in Q3, Q4 and beyond as this demand recovery takes hold. Our business is focused on a few very specific and strategic things: one, network reliability enhancements and growth; two, return to peak utilization and profitability; three, record non-ticket performance; four, widening the unit cost gap; and five, closing the merger with Frontier. All corporate operational and financial goals are intentionally tied to these items and we believe all are achievable in the next 12 months. And now, I'll hand it over to Matt and Scott to discuss our first quarter performance and the second quarter outlook. Matt, over to you.\nMatt Klein: Thanks, Ted. I joined Ted in thanking the Spirit team. Their dedication and commitment to care for our guests is unmatched. Turning now to our first quarter 2022 revenue performance. Compared to the first quarter 2019, total revenue was up 13% to $967.3 million and total RASM was down 5.3%. However, midway through the quarter, we saw a dramatic improvement in loads and yields such that March TRASM this year was higher than March 2019 and this was accomplished while simultaneously growing capacity 17.1%. On a per segment basis, compared to the first quarter of 2019, total revenue per passenger segment increased 3.9%. The passenger revenue per segment component decreased 7.6%, but non-ticket per segment increased 14.8% to a record high of $64.53. Our team has done a great job leveraging the benefits of merchandising and dynamically pricing our ancillary products. And there is still non-ticket upside left to capture and we are on-track to beat that record in the second quarter of 2022. And given the dramatic improvement in the demand environment, it is anticipated that ticket revenue per segment will significantly outperform what was achieved in the second quarter of 2019. We don't carry a lot of large corporate business traffic, but we do carry a sizable amount of small business and conference traffic, and that's the piece of the recovery that has been missing until now. Regarding the network changes Ted referenced, we are changing our approach to how we flow our aircraft, we are adding bases to the network and we are modifying our approach to crew planning, which will build more network resiliency and aid in operational recovery. We also have enough critical mass in more cities in our network to schedule a lot more out and back flying, which we did with our schedule change that took effect on April 20. It's only been a couple of weeks, but we are confident these moves should begin to make it easier to isolate impacts when we have regional disruptions like we saw in Florida over Spring break. Looking ahead for the second quarter, we estimate our capacity will be up approximately 10.5% versus second quarter 2019. For the full year 2022, we expect to fly about 50 billion ASMs. Our second quarter revenue is estimated to range between $1.32 billion to $1.35 billion, which implies total RASM will be up 18% to 21% compared to the same period in 2019. In closing, from a revenue perspective, we like our positioning as we head into the peak summer period and while this environment is quite favorable, there will be another leg up when international testing requirements are abolished and regional jurisdictions ease. And now here's Scott.\nScott Haralson: Thanks, Matt. I also want to start by saying thanks to our entire Spirit team. Even in these challenging periods, our team members have maintained their professionalism and are delivering a great experience for our guests. I've never been prouder to be a part of the Spirit family. Now turning to our first quarter 2022 financial performance. We reported an adjusted net loss of $173.5 million or a loss of $1.60 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was negative 11.2%, in-line with our expectations. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, total operating costs increased 50.3% on 19.2% more capacity and 32% more aircraft in our fleet. We continue to experience labor cost inflation throughout much of the organization. As a result of the omicron variant's impact on the company's staffing levels in early January, we offered various incentive paid programs to minimize flight cancellations, leading to additional wage pressures. These incentive pay programs, together with additional passenger re-accommodation expense drove about $20 million of cost in the quarter. Fuel price was the primary source of the increased operating cost in the quarter. Fuel price per gallon was 41.1% higher than the same period in 2019. From a liquidity perspective, we remain in a strong position. We ended the first quarter with $1.6 billion in liquidity, which includes unrestricted cash, short-term investments and $240 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. During the first quarter, we made debt principal payments of $44.3 million and had capital expenditures, including net purchase deposits of $53.2 million. For the full year of 2022, we estimate our capital expenditures, including net purchase deposits, will be approximately $250 million, which includes $100 million related to the construction of our new headquarters and training facility in Dania Beach, just south of the Fort Lauderdale Airport here in South Florida. Turning to our fleet. During the first quarter, we took delivery of three A320neo aircraft, ending the quarter with 176 aircraft in our fleet. We expect to take delivery of 21 additional A320neos before year-end. For the second quarter of 2022, we estimate our pretax margin will range between negative 3% to negative 5%. This assumes total operating expenses of $1.35 billion to $1.37 billion, with a fuel price per gallon assumption of $3.85 to $3.90. The impact of the ATC issues and the corresponding reduction of capacity in the quarter will cost us about 3 to 4 points on the margin. Our fleet utilization for the second quarter will be about 83% of our pre-COVID second quarter levels. We believe we could have been profitable with about 90% of our pre-COVID second quarter utilization. Maintaining our unit cost advantage over the industry is an important pillar of our model. Even though we have had outsized impacts to our labor costs when compared to some of the other carriers in the industry, we still had the lowest CASM ex-fuel plus interest in the industry in the first quarter. In fact, our absolute CASM ex-fuel difference has grown larger versus the industry compared to the first quarter of 2019. As we ramp the airline back to full utilization, we expect to maintain or even grow this gap. With our robust pilot pipeline, the operational infrastructure investments we are making and the network improvements being implemented to go along with the strong demand environment and non-ticket production, we feel confident about our ability to get the airline back to full utilization and a return to pre-COVID profit level in the near future. In closing, while the close-in ATC challenges have caused us to react with lower utilization in the short term, over time, the network changes that Matt discussed, along with the corresponding changes in our crude planning process and crude bases will give us the necessary resiliency and confidence to hit our end-of-year utilization rates that are around 95% of our pre-COVID levels and then back to full capacity just after the turn of the new year. With that, I'll hand it back to Ted. \nTed Christie: Thanks, Scott. As we gear up for the busy summer season, we are committed to deliver operational excellence and high value to our guests. Now, I'd like to address the status of our pending merger with Frontier Airlines and our Board's decision to reject JetBlue's proposal. I'll walk you through a slide deck we posted on our IR site earlier today. On Slide 2, we hit the high points. To start, after a very thorough review, our Board of Directors unanimously determined that the unsolicited proposal we received from JetBlue Airways does not constitute a 'superior proposal' because the transaction proposed by JetBlue is not reasonably capable of being consummated. First, let me clarify. The definition of a superior proposal under the Frontier merger agreement is a two-pronged decision, the first of which is whether it is reasonably capable of being consummated and the second of which is whether it is economically superior. Because our Board's evaluation could not clear the first hurdle, the Board did not evaluate whether the price offered by JetBlue standing alone provided greater value than our deal with Frontier. As part of the review process, we talk constructively with JetBlue, including providing a well-populated virtual data room and engaging in discussions, the number one gating determination we needed to make was, could this proposal be reasonably capable of being consummated? In particular, would it be approved by regulators? After receiving advice from our legal and economic advisers, which was informed by extensive discussions with JetBlue and its advisers, our Board's determination was no. The reality is that regulators are already suing JetBlue over its Northeast alliance with American and it's unlikely the DOJ or report will be persuaded that JetBlue should be allowed to form an anti-competitive alliance that aligns its interest with a legacy carrier and then also undertake an acquisition that would eliminate the largest ULCC carrier. JetBlue's acquisition of Spirit would eliminate a key competitor and a vocal public opponent of JetBlue's anti-competitive NEA deal. And if you take a step back, at its core, the JetBlue proposal is a high-cost, high-fare airline trying to buy a low-cost, low-fare airline. A JetBlue-Spirit merger would likely eliminate Spirit as a ULCC and half the expected synergies would come from reduced capacity and increased fares to consumers. In contrast, the Frontier deal creates a stronger combined ULCC and a much more formidable competitor against the Big 4 and JetBlue as well. You don't need to be an antitrust attorney to see the issues here. JetBlue talks about the 'JetBlue effect', as their way of putting pressure on the Big 4, but we believe that claim is based on economic modeling that has significant defects and overstates the impact of JetBlue on legacy carriers. So, if you turn to Slide 3, Spirit and our advisers undertook a thorough careful review of JetBlue's proposal. This included retaining prominent, economic consultants and an experienced aviation economist as well as extensive dialogue between Spirit and JetBlue's antitrust councils over a four-week period. At the end of that investigation, our Board determined that JetBlue's proposal represented an unsatisfactorily high degree of completion risk with inadequate protections for our shareholders. So, on April 25, we went back to JetBlue to outline how we would propose strengthening the regulatory provisions to reduce completion risk. We proposed a strong covenant requiring JetBlue to take any action required to obtain regulatory clearance, including abandoning the NEA at closing and a substantial reverse termination fee. However, JetBlue rejected those proposals and instead made it clear their number one priority was preserving the NEA with American. As I said, we believe a JetBlue deal is unlikely to be approved so long as JetBlue's NEA with American Airlines remains in existence. The DOJ and Attorney's General in six states and the District of Columbia have sued to block the NEA and you'll see on Slide 4, the DOJ's strong public commentary in opposition to the NEA. Spirit and many other airline and air travel constituencies have also publicly opposed the NEA on the grounds that it is competitive. It stretches any sort of common sense to believe that an acquisition of Spirit by JetBlue would be approved by the DOJ while it is suing to block the NEA. So, I'll have you skip now to Slide 7. As observers have pointed out, JetBlue shareholders aren't supportive of this deal either, based on the company's stock performance. However, despite clear concern from JetBlue's shareholders, JetBlue has continued to pursue disruption to the Spirit-Frontier combination. I have wondered whether blocking our deal with Frontier is, in fact, their goal. Over the last month, we've seen a lot of third parties comment on the deal. You'll see on Slide 8, there has been a consistent and vocal commentary from informed market participants such as you all, arguing that a JetBlue and Spirit combination faces significant regulatory scrutiny and substantial completion risk. This is in stark contrast to third-party agreement that a Frontier-Spirit merger delivers greater closing certainty, driven by great competition in the U.S. industry on Slide 9. So with that now understood, the Board determined that the JetBlue proposal was not superior, which means we return our focus to the Frontier transaction, which we believe delivers on all fronts. Looking at Slide 10, clearly, a combination of Spirit and Frontier is a winning formula, and it continues to be a superior transaction for Spirit guests, team members and shareholders. For consumers and communities, it will deliver $1 billion in annual consumer savings and bring more ultra-low fares to more travelers and more destinations across the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean, including major cities as well as underserved communities. The stronger financial profile of the combined company will empower it to accelerate investment in innovation and growth and to compete even more aggressively, especially against the dominant Big 4 airlines and JetBlue. We also expect our team members will have better career opportunities and more stability as a result of our transaction with Frontier. In fact, by 2026, Frontier and Spirit expect to add 10,000 direct jobs and thousands of additional jobs at the company's business partners. And shareholders of both Spirit and Frontier have the opportunity to participate in the upside potential of the combined airline. As I mentioned, the price per share in the JetBlue proposal is illusory because of the completion risk. That said, I want to touch for a minute on the economics. JetBlue's all-cash offer is opportunistically timed to take advantage of pandemic-induced lows in the airline profitability. It's important that shareholders understand that in the unlikely event that the JetBlue transaction could close, it could be up to two years before Spirit shareholders receive the offer consideration due to an extended regulatory process. Over that time, the airline sector recovery will continue. So, our proposed merger with Frontier, which includes stock consideration, gives Spirit shareholders the ability to benefit from pandemic recovery and the upside from unlocking $500 million in annual run rate operating synergies. So in terms of next steps, we continue to advance towards completing the combination with Frontier and inspect the transaction to close in the second half of 2022, consistent with what we have said when the merger was first announced in February. With all that, I'll turn it back to De Anne.\nDe Anne Gabel: Thank you, Ted. We are now ready to take questions from the analysts. We ask that you limit yourself to one question with one related follow-up. If there is time remaining, you are welcome to requeue for another question. Suzanne, we're ready to begin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth. Your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, good morning. You obviously covered some of this in your comments and in the slide deck, but can you expand on why you think the NEA is such an important piece of the puzzle. If we read your rejection at face value, it sounds like if the NEA wasn't on the table, that this is something maybe you'd be more comfortable with approval odds. So, can you just talk about the process you went through, what you learned over the last few weeks and why you think the NEA is such an important puzzle piece?\nTed Christie: Sure, Duane. So, I think there's actually three important puzzle pieces. So clearly, when we have a suitor that is being actively sued by the Department of Justice for a stated anti-competitive transaction and admittedly, we are a vocal opponent of that transaction and we expect we might be a witness in that particular lawsuit, it strikes us as odd that they think they can actually close on a transaction with us during that period of time. That is puzzle piece number one. I would say, second to that, as I mentioned in our comments, at its core, JetBlue is a higher-cost, higher-fare airline and they've stated to us that their plan is to acquire us, again, a ULCC, a lower-cost, lower-fare airline. They intend to remove seats, which is capacity-constraint and the synergy benefit of that deal would come through fare increases. And given the stated objectives at the department's level, we view that as extremely challenging -- an extremely challenging strategy. The third is that during the course of that proposed regulatory review process, given that we expect that not only would the department impose this transaction, but they would actually file suit to stop it, we expect that that process could take 18, 24 months or longer and during that period of time, given the state of objectives of JetBlue, we have concern about our own business risk here. We have worries about flight of quality and attrition and all of that. And so, in order to make sure that we felt we were being compensated for that, we asked for a substantial reverse termination fee and admittedly, we don't know whether or not it is even adequate to cover the risk or to compensate us for that risk during that period, but that's how we look to address it. So to repeat, we said to JetBlue, we believe you're going to need to commit to do anything in your power to get this approved by regulators, which is called a hell-or-high water provision. And as an adjunct to that, also include that you would have to acknowledge that you would abandon the NEA. In addition to that, you need to commit to a substantial reverse termination fee and they said no to all three of those things. And so, our Board was left with the decision that we believe it to be an inferior proposal, and for that reason, we've moved on. So yes, the NEA is clearly problematic, but so is the overall strategy and the rest of the discussion and the risk that we would need to take and our shareholders would bear all of that risk.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, Ted. Thanks for the detail. Can you maybe just talk about process from here? When would you expect a shareholder vote and what other kind of milestones should investors be watching for?\nTed Christie: Sure. So the good news is during the course of this period, we have also been working simultaneously on advancing the Frontier transaction, which is really tied to soliciting approval from two groups-- the first is our shareholders and as has been publicly reported and you can see it in our SEC filings, we've been back and forth with the SEC on the S-4 and the merger proxy document, which during the SEC comment period, we've resolved, we believe all of those comments. So, we think we're at the very tail end of that process right now. So, that moved along maybe a little bit quicker than we anticipated. And the way that SEC rules work is once that merger document is finalized and it goes effective, then you can schedule a shareholders meeting and solicit a vote from your shareholders, which can happen probably within 30 and 45 days after the effective date of the merger proxy. So, we anticipate that probably happening sometime in June. And then the second approval body that we need to solicit approval from is obviously the Department of Justice. We had filed early in March. Our initial filing on that, the HSR filings and submitted with them the forms that we needed with regard to that. As we expected, we received a second request as it's referred to for more information and we've been working with the department to satisfy all of those, everything they need and answer their questions. And then we will work with them to resolve the issues. And we're optimistic that we have a fantastic story to tell here, that we think we have a very pro-competitive deal and as we stated back in February, we're optimistic we can get that resolved and closed sometime in the second half of this year. So those are probably the next two gating items to look out for. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the thoughts, Ted.\nTed Christie: You got it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nTed Christie: Good morning.\nSavi Syth: Just curious on the capacity plan that you've laid out. What gives you comfort in really accelerating your capacity growth from the third quarter to fourth quarter, given kind of the constraints you're addressing over the summer? And along those lines, just how should we think about 2023 capacity? Does it kind of grow off of a lower base? Or similar to Q4, you're able to just kind of play catch-up to the level that you were planning to grow anyway? \nTed Christie: Sure, Savi. So, if we look back to where the airline industry was at the second half of last year, there was a lot of discussion about ramping up pilot hiring, training, doing all of that work and we adapted to that early on by making sure that we had established enough infrastructure and throughput to get ourselves in a position to be able to meet our growth objectives throughout the course of 2022 and beyond and actually feel very comfortable that those things are in place and working well. So absent any interruption that we saw earlier this year with regard to how aerospace was being managed in Florida, we would have flown our original schedule. So, I think it's fair to say that the slope that you see from the second, and third, and fourth quarters is probably artificially restrained versus what we would otherwise fly. In fact, you can see from our publicly filed schedules when we made the adjustment, we pulled somewhere around 5% to 7% out of the core summer months, which is pretty notable, especially during a very profitable period for our business. So, I think looking at it that way probably gives you a little bit more comfort that the glide slope is probably a little more rational heading into the second half of the year. So, what do we expect of the things that will take hold? Clearly, our pilot and flight attendant and other necessary staffing initiatives are well underway and working exactly as we anticipated, so we don't see that as being a limiting factor. Secondarily, as Matt mentioned, we've been making as a debrief and a learnings exercise from last summer. We've been making a number of network and crew network enhancements throughout our network that we believe and as Matt mentioned, start taking effect really here in April. But in core, a lot of the change is beginning more in the core part of summer. Those things we are extremely optimistic will be very valuable in enhancing reliability for the business, which gives us, again will give us additional confidence that we can hit our growth targets. Admittedly, we want to see a little game film. We want to see it kind of work and all that, but based on our experience and what we've investigated around with experts and looked at how other airlines tackle similar issues, we think these are going to be very effective changes for us. And then the third is how we have reacted to when we anticipate for management of the airspace in Florida specifically. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there was a very productive meeting this week between the FAA, ATC and all the operators. So, every airline was represented there and they acknowledged that they definitely had some issues here in Jacksonville Center and perhaps in other stations throughout their system, but they were working quickly to resolve those staffing-related concerns and also proactively working with airlines on finding alternative ways to resolve where they might otherwise have been much more binary in the way they approach the airspace. So, giving us more options to work around it. And we're going to continue to engage with them. We think now we have a good understanding between the two sides of the actual problem and what needs to be addressed. And so while we can't face all of our planning assumptions on them, making sure that it looks exactly like it used to look, we are confident to the mix of all those things that I just described will give us the ability to kind of grow into the fourth quarter this year. Now looking into the next year, the way we're thinking about growth is, as Scott has mentioned numerous times, is really utilization-based. How do we get ourselves back to the way we ran our airline pre-COVID, which is on a fleet utilization daily hours per aircraft basis. Because we've been delivering aircrafts throughout the course of the pandemic and I think Scott even made reference to it in his comments that we may be growing ASMs 15% to 20%, but we've grown aircraft 30-plus percent, which is obviously burdening the fixed cost of the business. So getting back to full utilization is key and all of these things that I talked about, we believe translates that as we cross the new year and head into the first quarter of next year. That will help you arrive at what you think our growth rate will be. It will definitely be skewed on a year-over-year basis in the early part of the year because we're under flying what we should fly today, but it will start to look more normal as we lap that. \nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And if I might follow up on that, just given you've mentioned kind of the network changes that you're making to kind of improve the operational reliability, how does that impact productivity or even utilization? Does that change the makeup versus pre-crisis where maybe less productive or greater utilization, less utilization? How does that kind of the network changes impact kind of the makeup of the rest of the kind of utilization aspect of it?\nTed Christie: It's a great question, Savi, and thanks for leading the witness because we want to tackle this head-on. There would be an assumption that you would make that the changes that we described, which would include adding some crew bases, for example, changing the way crew pairings or the trips themselves, how long they are away from their base makes the airline easier to repair, easier to reserve during times of interruption, those types of changes. You may lead to the conclusion that that actually might be lower productivity or cost-punitive. The truth of the matter is, today, in our cost structure, we band-aid that through other ways. We have higher reserves, we have higher sparing ratios and we have more buffer in the form of block and crude buffer in our systems today and as part of our cost structure today intended to address the issue. With this change, you're really at a minimum, perhaps changing the distribution of the existing cost in ways that will enhance reliability or we're actually somewhat optimistic it may produce cost savings on the net. And utilization will remain the same because all you do is really reposition the way the aircraft flow in ways that you maintain your utilization, which means you may, in some instances, have to stretch the day a little bit, so you start your origination flights a little earlier than you otherwise might. But there are plenty of ways for the network team to kind of piece things together to maintain fleet utilization and then overall crude productivity, we view as probably neutral at a minimum, perhaps probably better.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. Thank you.\nTed Christie: You got it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone. I might just stay on the cost topic. On prior calls, you've spoken to getting to sub-$0.06 [ph] CASM at pre-pandemic utilization. Has that changed at all just given the inflation we're seeing across the industry and the economy at large? And then also just taking into account the retention bonuses you're paying due to the proposed merger? And then, can you just give us some color on the cost structure impact of those trench in bonuses we should think about going forward? Thanks.\nScott Haralson: Hey, Katy, it's Scott. Thanks for the question. Since our last discussion on the projected sub-$0.06 CASM ex, labor rates have continued to move up. The labor rate moves, are going to make it difficult for us to achieve that level of CASM ex. I think the industry is seeing it, but we may be a little bit outsized on the impact of that. So I think with those moves, we're probably looking at a low $0.06 CASM number to be a little bit of a reasonable estimate for run rate CASM ex today. With 2019 CASM ex of around 5.55, we're probably looking at around 45 to call it, say, 65 points of cost pressure. So, I think the next sort of logical question becomes, how does that affect sort of a return to pre-COVID margin levels? And so to do that, we need additional revenue to offset the inflationary cost pressures. And that's where non-ticket comes in. We're about $11 higher in Q1 on non-ticket than in 2019 and that number will likely grow throughout the year. And we think there's a good portion of that increase that's sticky, that will remain even if fares decline. So, if we keep say, 75% of that increase, let's say, $8 a passenger and $8 a passenger of non-ticket offsets about 65 points of CASM inflation. So, if fuel and fares return to sort of 2019 equilibrium and we would have been similar, if not slightly improved margins from pre-COVID period. So while we had always hoped that non-ticket increases were going to work and be a bit margin accretive for us, the pandemic has taken its total on unit cost. But the good news is that we're at least looking at a real path to a return to pre-COVID margin levels and obviously, we're going to do everything we can to minimize unit cost inflation. But the good news, too, is that the absolute CASM ex gap is growing versus the industry. If that provides any platform for improved fare levels, then the margin expansion idea becomes a real possibility.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thanks. That's really helpful. And then maybe just for my second, a follow-up to Savi's question on the contents in your capacity plans. You noted earlier in the call, your attrition had picked up, but that you're having success in hiring. I guess are you hiring ahead of plans that you can backfill that elevated attrition? And then I guess if that's true, shouldn't there be a training delay getting those new pilots filling vacant spots? Just trying to think to the moving pieces of the hiring picture just to hit that year-end utilization target. Thanks so much for the time.\nTed Christie: Sure, Katy. It's Ted. What you said there at the end is exactly correct. So, we saw the issues associated with increased attrition and particularly at the pilot ranks and flight attendant ranks, and we made adjustments to it, and those adjustments work. So, you're right in assuming that it does create a lag. There is incremental training that we have to do to get things going. There's incremental things that we have to add. We need more trainers, we needed more simulators, we needed more flight training devices. We need to do all those things and we did them earlier on this year, which meant that we had appropriately adapted and while attrition is at elevated levels, it has leveled off. And we're seeing a much more stable number and in fact, slight declines in attrition over the course of the first and second quarter here in this year. So, our adjustments to that worked. It's disappointing, obviously. We want to keep everyone here and make sure we retain and there are ways for us to tackle that over the long term. But in the meantime, we fixed the schoolhouse in a way that we were comfortable, that we've adapted to the system. So again, supply constraint for us heading into the summer had nothing to do with our ability to fly our admittedly changed schedule from last summer because of what we saw from a staffing issue. We were well on-track to hit those numbers. It's more about making sure that we created enough floor to buffer.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham from MKM Partners.\nConor Cunningham: Hey, everyone, thank you for the time. Just going back to the NEA for a second. Even when you move forward with Frontier, it seems you're likely to be against the NEA regardless. So, can you just speak to your biggest concern with that alliance? And if there were additional access to slots in Newark [ph], would that be something that you're interested? Interested in just given like the cost inflation we're seeing at airports and just how you price your product in general. Any help would be great.\nTed Christie: Sure. I have made a number of comments on the NEA with its anti-competitive [ph]. We've been in public opposition to that. There is a pending lawsuit between the DOJ and JetBlue and American on that issue. As I said earlier, it's entirely likely that we may be a witness to that. So, I hesitate to comment more than what I've already said. It's fair to say that the alliance itself is more than just a traditional code share. There are a number of elements in it that actually make it more akin to a joint venture or even a merger and we wanted to make sure that it received the adequate attention, and I believe the DOJ is now doing that. To the extent, however, that there are divestitures in slot-controlled or restricted airports, we're always going to be in interest in that. In fact, as you've seen of us late, we've been very public about our desire to take over the surrendered positions in Newark by Southwest. Despite the DOT's initial approach to that, which we had to, in fact, start a litigation on and we won and we believe those positions will be eventually awarded to a low-cost carrier, and we believe we're the right one. So I think it's been pretty clear that in any event, no matter what the reason or outcome is, if there are available positions in constrained airports, we believe Spirit should be the number one place to go.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, great. And just on the pilots, I mean, I know your contracts are up until next year, but the industry is, I mean, as everyone knows, is a bot go through another reset. And I realize you said you're comfortable with your pilot pool right now. But when we think about the long-term implications of just the shortage, why shouldn't we just assume that there's compression on pay rates over the long term? Like why wouldn't Spirit be closer to the network carriers over the long term than not. I mean, again, the appeal seems to be that you could grow very quickly with Spirit and maybe that's not necessarily the case in the near term as a -- so any additional color. I'm not asking you to negotiate in public, but any additional color, I think, could be call for that for everyone. Thank you.\nTed Christie: I appreciate that. Yes. So look, history would tell you that there is a way that pilot contracts have shaken out over time. And the argument that you make is that given where we are from a pilot demand perspective and all of that, that perhaps that, that could change versus what history would tell you. And the answer is I don't know, I wouldn't necessarily lead to that conclusion. But I can tell you this, I've heard a few airlines, most notably United Airlines, commenting on what they believe to be the current supply of pilots in the marketplace and the demand for pilots in the marketplace, and there being a significant disconnect between the supply of pilots in the marketplace and the demand for PASI. I heard numbers like 5,000 pilots a year and demand for 130-or-so thousand pilots a year.  And I looked back at the data on how many pilots actually received ATP licenses over the last 10 years. And for a majority of those years, the number was actually closer to 10,000 pilots a year. Now admittedly, post the implementation of FAR 117, there was a dip because they did put in place a longer training period. And I think that forced pilots to get more experience before they can apply for their license. But post that dip, the lines were all trending up. There were more people applying to get private licenses, more people applying to get instructor licenses and more people asking for and being awarded ATP licenses, that line getting closer and closer to the historical average of closer to 10,000 pilots a year. Unfortunately, the COVID pandemic interrupted that again, and it did flatten off, mostly because none of us were hiring pilots in 2020. So now there is demand again. And I think those lines all trending in that direction, give us good confidence that macroeconomics work. This is a good profession. People who want to be pilots are now coming back to the world saying I want to be pilots, and we anticipate that you could interpret that data to suggest that actually once we achieve more normalized rates, it will probably be closer to what you've experienced in the past, which might be like 10,000 or more pilots a year.  And so supply and demand will work itself out over that period of time, and that will help inform how pilot rate and compression or the lack thereof might be impacted by the business broadly speaking of our hours. But I remind you that we still maintain a unit cost advantage no matter what. Our pilots, our flight attendants, our ground personnel, our dispatchers, our technicians, all of us, our overhead are more efficient than they are at the majors because we push more units, more seats per aircraft. And I think that's important to remember. And the second point is to the extent that you're right. And there is compression in pay, that happens at the lowest end as well, which is where regional pilots today are getting paid. And that benefit of that arbitrage that the majors enjoy today from a B scale perspective will be eliminated under that scenario, which would be very cost prohibited to the majors. So, I guess there's probably a number of inputs to consider before you jump to conclusions.\nConor Cunningham: Thank you, Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning. I have 2 here. I guess one to 1 and Matt, as it relates to your biggest airplanes, the A321 Neos have -- given the fact that I -- were we talking about 229 or 239 seats and the fact that with some of the irregular operations and the re-accommodation costs, the fact is these are expensive airplanes. And when you think about sort of off-peak, off-peak scheduling and the like. Any thoughts on possibly sort of rethinking the mix and focusing on sort of maybe A320 Neos as being the right airplane. I'm just curious with -- given the disruption in some of the issues that you faced, if the thinking is as enticing as these airplanes are with that many seats and what it does on a unit cost basis that maybe the happy medium for Spirit is the kind of focus on a core A320 sort of Neo-type airplane. I'm just thinking about how things have evolved and how much that airplane actually features in your fleet going forward? \nTed Christie: Hey, Mike, it's Ted. I'll start, and then I'll let Matt add any comments you'd like as it relates to how he sees evolving the network. But the reason we love that airplane is because there's just tons of demand right now. There's a ton of demand for low fare travel. There's never been a question in our mind at least, that there's untapped and considerable demand for low fare travel. And if anything, the last 6 months have reinforced that. And over the course of pandemic, of course, that was true that low-fare leisure travel was the most resilient part. So that airplane is critical, quite frankly, in large markets where there is facility constraint on either side. you can add capacity in a place like New York City, absent us, of course, securing additional slots and which we're hopeful we can do at any time is to add more seats to the airplane. It just becomes more efficient. And there is -- we're under flying the demand in that market today, no matter what we do.  Now, the core of our airline is the 320. It's going to be -- it's always going to be the bigger part of the fleet. But the 321 Neo is a game changer. That's going to be an extremely powerful airplane with more range, a better carbon footprint, and we're going to be able to put more seats on the 321 Neo version than we have on our 321 Ceo. So today, we operate the 321 Ceo with 228 seats because of the door configuration on the 321 Neo, we actually can add more seats to it without changing the overall comfort level or pitch. So it's going to be a better airplane. It's going to be more efficient, and we're really excited about what it's going to do. So Matt, anything you want to add to that? \nMatt Klein: I would only add, Mike, that when we do have some kind of small disruption, we've been dealing with this. We've had the 321 in the fleet for a long time. So our airports are very well prepared for if we do have to do a downgrade of some sort to a 320 from a 321. We have an place. Everything is pretty normal there for us. If we do have a larger, say, weather event, the size of the aircraft sort of doesn't matter like think of a hurricane or something is coming, then we're going to end up doing an -- we'll put an operational procedure in place anyway that will likely take some cancels and then put the airline back together in a day or two. So that's not the size of the aircraft isn't going to matter too much in those events as well. \nMike Linenberg: Okay. That's a good answer. And then just I wanted to just go back to on some of the comments that you guys made in the slide deck, which is helpful that you put that out. Just with respect to the JetBlue effect and I think the concerns that you have with that. The point there is that it is in the public record, whether it's DOJ documents recently with the NII and even some of the DOJ stuff, where in the past, JetBlue has been anointed as an industry Maverick, right, disruptor, if you will. And so to the point that they've called out some of the benefits of this JetBlue effect or the fact that ChepBlue has had a difference in markets. What -- like with respect to urinalysis versus, say, the conclusions that the DOJ and DOT have arrived at with respect to JetBlue, where do you differ? Because you do say that you talk about overstating the impact of JetBlue on legacy carriers. But there are a lot of passenger segments that they participate in that you guys don't. I know you mentioned small medium enterprises or SMBs of having some of that business. But as we move sort of further up the food chain, there are areas where JetBlue plays and can have a meaningful effect on the big guys, where you don't even play in that space. So I'm just -- I'm curious, and I realize it probably has to go off call, but maybe you have some numbers or any color on that. Thanks, I appreciate it. \nTed Christie: Sure. So look, I won't bore you with all the analysis that was done because there was extensive analysis, and then we hired independent economists to dig into it for us. As I referenced in my comments and the summary is that a lot of their analysis has quite a few clause in it. The JetBlue -- first of all, they use their -- the coverage period at deriving the JetBlue effect. They're going back into the earliest part of the last decade as their starting point, which was a completely different industry than exists today. And while you are acknowledging that in markets where JetBlue competes with a legacy carrier, they have a lower cost structure than that legacy carrier and perhaps they have a lower fare structure as well, and they can have an impact. What we're talking about is what happens versus the ULCC effect when they compete with legacy carriers or quite frankly, with JetBlue and the allegation that the JetBlue effect would somehow be larger than the effect that we have is the comparison point because remember, their strategy is to remove us as a ULCC and take seats out of the market. And it's our assertion that our effect is significantly larger. So that's really what we're talking about. \nMike Linenberg: Okay, thanks for that. Thanks, everyone. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Good morning, everyone. I'll try to be quick. The second half profit guide, we can obviously back into some revenue assumptions there. But what's the fuel and axial CASM at the root of that guide? \nScott Haralson: Well, we gave -- Jamie, this is Scott. We gave op expenses and capacity assumptions. So we aren't giving a full CASM ex guide. But I think you can sort of do the math that sort of gets us to -- we pulled some capacity out in the second quarter and will likely be under flying a little bit in the third. So I think what you're going to see is a bit of a CASM escalator in the second and third, and then we'll benefit from a return to mostly pre-covid utilization in the fourth and then back to sort of, I'll call it low 6s in the first and second of next year. So that's sort of linear extrapolation probably works there. \nJamie Baker: Sure. And then on the merger, and maybe this is sort of the direction that Duane was going earlier in the call. But if we set the Northeast alliance aside and ignore the fact that there's a frontier offer on the table. And I realize those are just for illustrative purposes and those are big caveats. But did your review of Spirit JetBlue raise any meaningful red flags when viewed through the more typical lenses that Justice has used for previous deals. So if you didn't have an argument -- if the NEA wasn't an issue and if there was no frontier offer on the table, again, just an illustrative question. I'm not saying that's where we're going to end up. But were there other red flags when you just kind of analyzed it when your lawyers analyze it the way that Justice ordinarily has looked at mergers at least in the past. \nTed Christie: Sure, Jamie. Thanks. And the answer to the question is yes. So even setting -- that's what I'm trying to make clear in both the prepared and my answer to Duane, setting aside the NEA, which we view as problematic, very problematic. Remember that at its core, this is a higher fare, higher cost airline buying a lower fare, lower-cost airline, removing capacity and raising fares. And given this administration and this DOJ, which has a new approach, admittedly than perhaps prior administrations, they've made it clear that their number 1 objective is to enhance competition. So we view that as problematic. By the way, also, they made it clear that traditional approaches to resolving issues on mergers such as divestitures will not be considered. So yes, there were a number of red flags across -- which is why we had so much concern and why when we went back to Jeff on April 25, we had such a strong covenant that we believe we needed for our shareholders. Remember, there's tremendous risk throughout the course of this regulatory process and who bears that risk, the Spirit shareholder. And we were not comfortable with that risk.\nJamie Baker: Yes, okay. All right, thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen.\nTom McCaffrey: This is Tom McCaffrey on for Helane. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Just another quick question on the merger. Did you -- as part of your analysis in your review, do you anticipate a lot of customers staying with the combined entity if JetBlue did acquire you and the deal was approved? And do you think those customers can be -- the typical spare customers will be more likely to pivot to other -- because silicon legion or another low-cost carrier or sun country? \nMatt Klein: Well, I think what we've learned over the years and what we've talked about, the very core of our airline and the core of our product is that people like low fares. And our expansion and our growth over the last decade, remember, we've grown 5 or 6 fold over that period of time is predicated on maintaining a low fare structure and offering alternative stimulated activity. And JetBlue offers their product, which is a different product from ours, but it is a higher fare product. And so simple economics would assume that less people will travel. And so, I don't believe that there -- I mean, again, travelers that travel on Spirit oftentimes travel on United or American or JetBlue or Alaska or whatever. They may travel on all the airlines. It's not about specific people. It's about -- the reason that they're traveling, which again, is leisure and who's paying for it, which again is out of your own pocket, and where you're going? Are you going to leisure destinations? Are you going to visit friends and relatives. Those types of things affect your buying decision. So I think what happens is less people travel. \nTom McCaffrey: Thanks, Matt. And if I could squeeze one more in. Would you mind just providing any color on some of the trends you've seen in customer demand since President Day maybe anything that surprised you or any data on like maybe demographics. Thanks for the color.\nMatt Klein: Yes, this is Matt. So yes, demand has really come on strong. It was almost like a light switch was flipped as we went through February. And we saw close in demand, we saw demand starting to build further out. It's one of those things where it becomes a challenge for the revenue management team because they're always tracking trends or tracking short-term trends, medium-term trends and then longer trends as well. And when things change, either up or down, you have to make adjustments quickly to those. So, we adapted. We adjusted quickly to that. Very comfortable with the demand trends that we're seeing today, what's been great along the way here is that our non-ticket production continues to improve and continues to really, quite frankly, get to a place that we knew we would get to, but we got there faster than we had anticipated. Part of that is just some of the things that we've changed internally from processes and analytics. Just came online and the learning curve on that was a lot quicker than what we had anticipated, which is great news for revenue production. It also tells us that the non-ticket production is extremely sticky because a lot of it's been -- yes, demand is stronger, but it's also been improving based on the processes and analytics that we put in place. So that's been great. And then one thing also I'd like to add just about some of the regions that we have in the network today is that the international -- some of our international flying to Central and South America has been a bit depressed compared to where it has been normally. So the results there are having somewhat -- I don't want to over-rotate on it, but it's definitely having something of a revenue panel being a drag on production. We expect that to go away as we move through the summer and get into the more peak periods. But what we've seen in the last few months has been a little bit under in terms of production for some of the Central and South America parts of our network.\nDe Anne Gabel: Suzanne, ready for the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Kenzie from Seaport Global.\nDaniel McKenzie: Hey, thanks. Good morning, you guys. Thanks for all the commentary. It's really helpful. Prior to the merger announcement, the messaging, Scott and CASM ex of sub-$0.06 was really clear and I hear you today on low $0.6s in the first half of 2023. Have you started to look at what emerged CASM ex outlook might look like with Frontier? Is low $0.06 CASM ex still reasonable or possibly something higher?\nTed Christie: Yes. We haven't talked about any sort of combined unit cost translation. But I think you can talk about some of the things that Frontier and Spirit do today and then we know there's cost synergies in place. So, I think you could extrapolate from the inputs, but we haven't given a formal view on what the combined unit costs would look like.\nScott Haralson: I think it's fair to say, Dan, that we've been public about it, we expect there to be around $100 million of cost synergies between the business. And those are direct ways that the combined business can offset the pressures that the industry is seeing and they're unique compared to what the rest of the industry has available to it in its toolkit. So there's nothing else that would create pressure to combine two ULCCs. If anything, there are ways to create efficiency and I think that's the best way to think about it.\nDaniel McKenzie: I see. Matt, going back to the script, more upside on the ancillary side of the business to come. Can you elaborate on that? And related to this, another ULCC last night concluded that premium revenue is a really good way to go. Is that something that you're taking a second look at or willing to take another look at?\nMatt Klein: Sure. So I can start with the second piece in terms of premium revenue on board. So, we do have our big front seat product. It's something that we've had for a long time as part of our product and since we've been a ULCC, it's been there on the aircraft and it's something that we know that customers want. That's why we still have it on the aircraft. We go through frequent reviews to make sure that it's still the right decision when we think about total profitability because if we didn't have that product on board, we'd have a couple more seats on the aircraft, which can drive unit cost benefit and it depends on how you view the revenue production on the aircraft. Obviously, we have the product on the aircraft because we like it. We think it's the right thing for us to do and as long as we do our job properly from a revenue management perspective, it definitely is accretive to the bottom line, which is why the product is on the aircraft overall. In terms of non-ticket and where we think there's more to come, we've talked about this for a little while and we're starting to see traction happen now with our sort of relaunched, revamped loyalty program. Our partnership with our co-branded credit card partner, Bank of America and a couple of other partners that we have there is working very well. We're starting to see traction take place there on our new program. So we think there's benefits there and we also know that as we just continue to get better and better at our ability to analyze the data and think more real time, we're just getting continuously better at our revenue management processes and our merchandising of the products just continues to improve online. So, that's where we have the confidence to see it and what we're seeing happen in the second quarter gives us a lot of confidence we're going to beat the record we just set in Q1 and then we'll see where we go from there.\nDaniel McKenzie: Very good, yes. I actually have purchased that big front seat a number of times. That's a great product. I guess, what I was wondering now with the premium revenue is if you'd look at expanding that.\nMatt Klein: That is all part of what we do today. And Dan, what you just said is an exact example of why we have the product because whether you were going on your trips for leisure or for business, that's why that product is there, is to make sure that we can capture a premium revenue when that premium revenue wants to fly on Spirit.\nDaniel McKenzie: Okay.\nDe Anne Gabel: Thank you, Dan. Suzanne, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna International.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting me on here. So, I'll keep it to one question. So, Ted or Scott, you and peers have had two or so years here to look at your cost would say, a microscope, which I'm guessing also included a deep dive look at your network operations. Given that, what have you learned with respect to your ability to get ahead of situations that may stress your network perhaps more than planned? And I guess, perhaps said another way, is there a plan in place to structurally address the stress points in the network and related costs? And can you do that? Or would changing your approach to utilization effectively change the DNA of how your airline operates? Thanks.\nTed Christie: Sure, Chris. So, I'll start, Scott can add a little bit. But I think the point you make is a good one, which is why we've tackled the issue the way we have. The way that we're thinking about the problem, which is as the network expands and the airline gets bigger, the best way to create resiliency is to structure it in a way that actually makes it more replaceable and recoverable in the event of disruption. Disruption happens all the time. There will be weather in Texas, there might be weather in the Midwest. Obviously, Florida has had its issues more recently. But being able to adapt to it and recover from it is the challenge that we face. And so the solution is to make the airline more out and back. That means airplanes leave from where they depart and they eventually return to that same city within a flight or two. Once you do that and you enhance the network with more crew [ph] bases, crews actually naturally start to follow that same pattern. They start to follow much more out and backs. So when you have an isolated issue in Florida, you're able to kind of remove the Florida flying without disrupting the rest of the Midwest and the Northeast and the West Coast. And we, of course, have been making those changes over the last decade and learning from them. But obviously, these enhancements will continue to move through the system. So, we're optimistic, as I said before, that they're going to work extremely well. They'll do it in ways where we're just maintaining the cost that's in the infrastructure today, just redistributing where we spend it and making the business more resilient. That's kind of the problem we tackled. So, Scott? \nScott Haralson: Yes. And the only other thing I would add, Chris, is really as we mature as a company, historically, we would drive the lowest cost we could and that would be sort of one singular outcome. I think the advancement of our thought process really drives a fourth dimension to that, which is a range of outcomes or the risk to the outcomes. So, what Ted's talking about becomes more a predictability of that outcome and a resiliency in the business. So, that sort of fourth dimension is what we've added over time and we feel good about where the network sits, our ability to predict to recovery and those things. So, I think that's an important element, that stability of the cost structure that we've added over the near term.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Great. Thanks for the time.\nDe Anne Gabel: Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we will talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

My name is James and I'll be your Operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And I'd now like to turn the call over to DeAnne Gabel, Senior Director of Investor Relations. DeAnne, you may begin.\nDe Anne Gabel : Thank you, James, and welcome everyone to Spirit Airlines Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded in simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call will be archived on our website for 60 days. Presenting on today's call our Ted Christie, our Chief Executive Officer. Matt Klein, our Chief Commercial Officer, and Scott Haralson, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us in the room today are other members of our senior leadership team. following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for sell-side analysts. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the Company's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance.  There could be significant risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our third quarter 2021 earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. With that, I turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Christie : Thanks, DeAnne. Thanks to everyone for joining us today. Over the past 18 months, our Spirit team members have proven time and time again that they are the best in the business. Third quarter 2021 started off very strong with July being solidly profitable. Unfortunately, our own irregular operation in August together with a surge of Delta variant cases led to a third quarter loss of $74.6 million. Higher fuel prices, continued travel restrictions, and near-term staffing issues have all played their part in delaying our return to sustained profitability. The direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic have lasted longer than anyone could have predicted. It may take some time for the industry to adjust to the near-term challenges.  But nothing about the current environment changes our long-term view for Spirit. As we've indicated previously, one of our challenges has been staffing levels at our airports, with the most notable being at Fort Lauderdale Airport. I'm pleased to announce that earlier this month, we reached a tentative agreement with our ramp service agents in Fort Lauderdale, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which includes competitive wages and benefits. And following ratification of that agreement, we look forward to resuming appropriate staffing levels and over time, adding back capacity to one of our guests' favorite leisure destinations.  I'm also pleased to say that we recently published our inaugural sustainability report. The report showcases our commitment to meaningful advancements of our ESG initiatives. Before I turn it over to Matt and Scott to discuss more details of our quarterly performance, I want to say how proud I am of the Spirit team. Operationally, it was an unusually challenging summer and their Spirit pride and dedication shined even on the most challenging days and helped us recover the operation and take care of our guests. And now over to Matt.\nMatt Klein : Thanks, Ted. I echo the special shout-out of appreciation to our team members and thank them for their perseverance in delivering quality service to our guests, regardless of the circumstances. Turning now to our third quarter revenue performance. As a reminder, I'll be comparing this year's results to the same period in 2019. Total operating revenues declined 7% compared to the third quarter 2019 in line with our revised guide given in mid-August. On a per-segment basis, compared to the same period in 2019, total revenue per passenger segment increased 0.7%. The passenger revenue per segment component declined 7.6%, but we once again saw very strong non-ticket revenue results, with non-ticket revenue per segment increasing nearly $5, compared to the same quarter in 2019, an 8.9% increase.  This non-ticket result is yet another record for Spirit. We remain extremely pleased with how well our investments and enhanced product offerings improved customer facing merchandizing, and revenue management initiatives are paying off. Turning to the passenger ticket side of the equation, load factors were very strong during the peak summer demand period. However, average load factors were a bit softer than expected for the second half of the quarter, driven in part by our own operational issues and the rise of COVID-19 variant cases. As we have communicated previously, given the constrained staffing resources, we are currently a good bit smaller in Fort Lauderdale than we would like to be.  And that will have a negative impact on our fourth quarter results as Fort Lauderdale is one of our best performing markets, especially at this time of the year. Nevertheless, it is the right decision until we can achieve the appropriate staffing levels to support our desired level of operation there. In the meantime, the team has done a great job managing through the changes. Elsewhere in the network, we have in growing our leisure and VFR routes. In the third quarter, we started service to [Indiscernible] Mexico. We also announced new service to [Indiscernible] Honduras. And in early October, we brought Spirit to Miami with our launch of service to nine non-stop destinations, which will soon grow to 31 destinations.  We are very excited to be growing our network, bringing our low fares to more guests in more places. And we have an exciting lineup planned for next year, as well as we continue to expand our network footprint. For the fourth quarter, 2021, we now estimate our capacity will be up 11.2% versus the fourth quarter 2019. This is more than 10 percentage points lower than our initial expectation with half of that related to targeted reductions at Fort Lauderdale, with the other half spread throughout the network. Moving ahead to the fourth quarter revenue outlook, we are extremely encouraged by the search trends we're seeing for the holiday periods. And all indications are that yields and loads for the peak holiday travel periods for the peak holiday travel periods will be quite healthy. Taking all of this into account, the revenue range implied by our EBITDA guide is $938 to $975 million or about flat compared to fourth quarter 2019. And now here's Scott.\nScott Haralson : Thanks, Matt. Also want to start by saying things to our entire Spirit team. Over the summer period, many of them worked extra shifts or performed duties outside their usual jobs to support the operation and they did so with the utmost professionalism and dedication. Now, turning to our third quarter 2021 financial performance, adjusted EBITDA margin was positive 1.0%. This was better than expected due to lower costs compared to our expectations shared in mid-August, cost came in lower due to a little less flight volume, a slower-than-expected pace of hiring, and airport rents and landing fees improving at a faster rate than anticipated.  Compared to the third quarter 2019, total operating costs increased 15.1% primarily due to higher crew member headcount, increased flight volume, a greater mix of aircraft financed under operating leases, higher depreciation and amortization, and additional costs incurred as a result of our irregular operations in the period. Our cash balance remains strong. We ended the third quarter with 1.9 billion in liquidity, which includes unrestricted cash, short-term investments, and $240 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Turning to our fleet, during the third quarter, we took delivery of 4 A320neo aircraft, ending the quarter with 168 aircrafts in our fleet. We also completed sale leaseback transactions for our Airbus deliveries through 2022.  With these transactions, we have financing in place for all our aircrafts scheduled for delivery now through the end of 2022. In addition, we completed direct operating lease transactions to secure additional aircraft to help meet our targeted capacity growth through 2024. In addition, we announced earlier this week that we executed an agreement with IAE for Pratt & Whitney GTF Engines to power the aircraft associated with our fleet order placed with Airbus in December 2019. The agreement coverage engines for the firm 100 aircraft ordered, as well as options for another 50 aircraft. In addition to the engine order, we entered into a comprehensive long-term maintenance agreement to service all our Neo engines. We already operate one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets in the industry.  And this order for the latest GTF engines, combined with our existing pipeline of new aircraft, will ensure we continue to be a leader on fuel efficiency. Increasing fuel efficiency is part of our ESG goals, but it's also helpful to the P&L, especially in high fuel price environments like we are currently facing today. Higher fuel prices impact all airlines. But because we have greater seat density than most of our competitors, and our fleet is fuel efficient, our per passenger fare would need to move up less than other competitors to more fully offset the rising cost of fuel. For the fourth quarter, we estimate our ASMs per gallon will be about 5.5% better than the fourth quarter of 2019. Said differently at today's fuel prices, that's equivalent to about $18 million in savings.  Regarding capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a total of about $290 million of capex for the full-year of 2021, including net pre -delivery deposits of about a $120 million. To recap the forward-looking guidance we provided in our earnings release, we estimate our EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter will range between negative 5 to break even. This assumes total operating expenses of 1 billion $50 million to $1 billion 60 million. We are assuming a fuel price per gallon of $2.54, and D&A of about 75 million. Regarding 2022, we previously shared we expected to hit full fleet utilization by mid-2022.  However, uncertainties about staffing resources have led us to slow the pace of returning to full utilization. And we now expect to produce 53 to 55 billion ASMs. We're still targeting sub $0.06 CASM ex-fuel once we reach full utilization. The timeline to achieve this target has stretched out till later in 2022 or early 2023 due to our slower pace of growth and increase inflationary pressures, particularly labor and airport costs. So again, we're still targeting unit cost ex-fuel below $0.06, but it's likely closer to 6 than we originally anticipated. In closing, the resiliency and strength of our business model has allowed us to deliver the -- among the best financial performance throughout the pandemic, and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the challenges ahead, and what has proven to be a prolonged recovery period. When the recovery has fully taken hold, we are confident that we will still be among the best margin producers in the business, while remaining the low-cost leader. With that, I'll hand it back to Ted.\nTed Christie : Thanks, Scott. Before we move to Q&A, I know many of you may have questions about lessons learned from the IROP in August. We do believe the disruption was caused by a confluence of factors exacerbated by staffing issues, primarily in Fort Lauderdale. As the IROP unfolded, we experienced many crew dislocations, which stressed our ability to recover. We are never going to be able to perfectly solve for all variables to avoid every disruption. No airline can, but we believe we can get better at recovering more quickly when it does happen. The main takeaways from our review are that in addition to airport staffing, there are several other areas we're adding a few additional positions could be beneficial in helping us to recover when IROPs occur. Our current recovery process is heavily reliant on manual innovation.  We've automated a few processes over the last several years that have been helpful. And we are exploring if there are opportunities to do even more. Given our scale, we have also been considering if it is time to add a few more crew [indiscernible] We're making some changes, but we don't believe any of them will have a significant effect on our cost structure. As a high-growth carrier, it is a continuous exercise to review how our network flows and we make small changes all the time. We are not pleased with our operational performance in this instance. But the fact is we have a proven record of reliable operations.  That was evident in 2020 when we flexed the network dramatically to adjust the schedule due to the quickly changing demand environment throughout the pandemic. This put tremendous stress on our resources. Yet we finished third in on-time performance and first in completion factor in 2020. The targeted schedule reductions in the fourth quarter of this year are working as intended, our operations have stabilized and we believe that operational and crew network changes that we are planning for in 2022 will enhance reliability without sacrificing efficiency and utilization. We continue to believe we will be able to produce operating margins in 2023 that are inline, or better, than what we achieved in 2019.  In the near term, our priorities include: increasing staffing to support higher growth while maintaining reliable operations, and making network moves that position us for the post-pandemic environment. An environment in which Spirit will remain the low-cost leader with ample opportunities for continued growth, and among the best margins in the business. With that back to DeAnne.\nDe Anne Gabel : Thank you. We are now ready to take questions from the analysts. We ask that you limit yourself to one question with one related follow-up. If you have additional questions, do feel free to put yourself back in the queue, if you'd like. James, we are ready to begin.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. Ted, I guess I want to follow up with your closing remarks there. For better or worse, investors have viewed Spirit as maybe off-track on being the lowest cost generator. And Scott even said it like, you guys are still targeting sub-6 CASM, but closer to 6 than where you were. But then you say, look, we weren't some lessons operationally. The things that we're going to change aren't adding a lot of costs. I guess, how do you square those two comments that, hey, CASM actually is coming up a little bit from where we thought it would be, but we can still generate profitability to levels where you were even better?\nTed Christie : Well, as it relates to the CASM being maybe it's still sub-six. It's within the range of what we thought about. I think the inflationary pressures that we've been experiencing are real, probably a little more severe than more pronounced than we originally anticipated. Principally on labor, but airports are always a concern that was true before as well. So I think it's more to do with that than it has to do with our analysis and reaction to the Company's operational performance this summer. So as we evaluated what we experienced throughout the course this summer, we're now looking at ways that we can enhance reliability and still deliver the same efficiency with the units, which is what's most important.  I have to say that while it's a very -- it was an exhausting summer for the Spirit team, I'm very excited about and interested about the output that's coming out of that work. And I think we're going to be able to make both network design changes, in both the way the airplane network flows, and more importantly, the way the crew network flows. That will help us create a more reliable network. And as I indicated in my comments, we're probably going to come up with ways that are going to speed recovery when we run into bumps.  Those will always happen. There'll be weather. We live in Florida, there's going to be hurricanes and that sort of thing. So I think that we'll have some ways that probably are going to make us even a little bit better in that regard. So cost benefit being a part of that. So I would echo what Scott said. I think we're very encouraged about the cost structure inflation aside. Inflation\u2019s face -- every airlines facing inflation today, it's almost like taxes and we're going to continue to be the low-cost leader.\nBrandon Oglenski : I appreciate that response. At what point do you hold yourself from the Company accountable to achieving sustainable profitability, even if you keep pushing back the full utilization target? Because some of that's just, built-in with your fleet delivery schedules. What levers can you pull to get sustainably in the black?\nTed Christie : Well first, we always are 100% accountable to the profitability of the business, so that's always been true. And that will remain true going forward. And the levers we can pull, are the same levers we would've looked at prior to the pandemic. We're going to evaluate individual route performance. We're going to make sure that our growth is delivering the ROIC that we had intended. We will adjust if that's not true. But the market opportunities that we're looking at today are as rich, or perhaps richer than they were 2 years ago. And that is why we've committed to the growth rate that we're committing to.  If we're wrong, which we don't anticipate that being true. And by the way, wrong could be in either direction. But if we're wrong, we'll adjust. And we believe we have the necessary levers to do that, both for fleets being larger, as well as smaller. And I think we'll show that we've been prudent managers. Look, over the course of the Company's public existence, we've consistently delivered mid-teens are better operating margins. And I think I hope there's some credibility there that we'll continue to do so going forward.\nBrandon Oglenski : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question from Helane Becker of Cowen Securities.\nHelane Becker : Thanks very much, James. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the time. So as you guys think about 2022, I guess the implication is it's going to be another transition year. So #1, is that a correct assumption? And then #2, Ted, as you think about the operations and staffing and so on, how you get ahead of this issues. I hear what you're saying about weather and stuff happening. We all understand that. It's the airline industry. But on the other hand, you want to be in a position where you can recover quicker or prevent stuff from happening so that you don't have the unfortunate incidences where people don't like you. Don't like the Airline. Maybe not you personally. Anyway that's my bad attempt at a question.\nTed Christie : Well as for the first part, viewing 2022 as a transition year. I don't know what the right label is. We're viewing it as a recovery year. We believe that the pandemic is moving in the right direction despite the Delta variant impact of the summer, the line is still going up. We're still flying more capacity. We're delivering better margins than we were at the same time last year, and we expect that to continue in the next year. So we expect it to be a recovery year. It's not going to be all the way back probably to where we want it to be. But we're going to do our best to move that along as quickly as we can, which leads in to the second you raised, which is, how do we get ahead of this issue that we've all faced?  And I think I would have unanimous agreement on the phone call on in the room that the past 18 months have had broad and wide-ranging impacts that have been difficult for people to forecast. It is a different environment today than it was prior to the pandemic. And so we've been actively learning from that. The way we recruit, the way we hire, the way we staff. All of those things we have learned from. And getting ahead of it was our objective going into this summer, and without doubt we missed it.  So part of the reason that we're looking at taking our foot a little bit off the gas here for a little bit of period of time is so that we can do exactly what you're suggesting, which is let's see the hiring come in. Let's build the base to get ready for the summer of next year, for example. And we'll layer the capacity in as necessary. So it's been a tough labor market. We're adapting to that. I mentioned some specific moves here in Fort Lauderdale, but that's been true throughout our system. And I do believe that as the economy begins to recover and people start to feel more normal about their lives and the virus starts to subside again, that will also move more normal. The labor market will become more normal and we're going to be ready for that.\nHelane Becker : Got you. Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Ted.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg : Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, just one question here. Scott, the comment that you made and, Ted, you can chime in on this. Just the comment about being among the best margin producers in the business, while remaining the low-cost leader when the recovery has fully taken hold. I'm taking it from the release. When I sort of think about your model, at least historically, let's move the September quarter aside because the irregular operations, that was just extreme. But when I think about your model historically, you would be the best margin producer and also among the low-cost leaders as we went through downturns. That's usually when the ULCC, LCC model really thrived and you would outperform.  And it just feels like based on the statement here that maybe things have changed a bit and maybe it's that this labor inflation is going to be with us a little bit longer. And I realize that historically for the ULCCs LCCs, labor has been maybe a larger area from a cost advantage perspective vis-a-vis the big carriers and the legacies. So I'm just -- I'm curious if there's kind of a shift in philosophy here, or maybe you're just sort of hedging your bets, maybe being conservative, maybe this downturn that we went through is like no other and we can't really comp it against the GFC or 9-11. I mean, just your thoughts on that. Thank you.\nTed Christie : Hey Mike, I'll go first and Scott can jump in. But thanks for the leading question because you've set me up perfectly. When you have performed in good and bad times and throughout the course of the pandemic. If you look at margin performance when things started to actually come back, so we can't look at the April period of last year. We've been amongst the best margins in the business. And if you give me the credit, for now, the benefit of removing the IROP in the September quarter that remained true then too. So if anything, that statement is a revalidation of what has always been true and a confirmation of what we expect to be true in the future. So Scott what would you --\nScott Haralson : That's exactly what I would say. I think you go back and look at the pandemic over the last year, we were in the top 2 or 3 margin producers in all of the quarters. Again, outside of the quarter when we were flying 5% of the airline, but I think everybody was figuring their way out of that point. But I think you saw it over the last decade, and you saw it over the last 18 months. And we're predicting that to be the case in the future.\nMike Linenberg : Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nScott Haralson : Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question is from Conor Cunningham of MKM Partners.\nConor Cunningham : Hey, everyone. Thank you. So you mentioned changes to potentially increasing staffing, potentially new crew bases, network changes, and also inflationary pressures. That's a lot. So why do you have confidence that you are going to be able to adjust to that and maintain your cost advantage to your peers. United for example, has plans to put lead on costs and drive costs back down to 2019 levels. If that plays out, they are compressing to you on a CASM perspective. I get that you said there's some automation and other adjustments, but just what else are you doing that leads you to maintain your cost advantage to everyone else.\nScott Haralson : There are a few things in there and [Indiscernible] to try to get them one at a time. So you mentioned some of the things that we talked about, our crew bases and hiring. We do that every year. We've been growing at double-digit rates for a while. And that means you reinvent the airline every year or two in doing that. So crew bases and hiring, that's all-normal operations for us, so we do it all the time. This is a little bit of a unique environment. This is interesting times, a lot moving around at this point.  We're usually really good at forecasting the business [Indiscernible] over the last decade, we've been pretty accurate and it's been somewhat more simplified historically, but right now, it's definitely just more difficult to forecast. We have labor rate volatility, labor behavior, very difficult right now to really forecast airport rates at this point. We will have a lot of movement in that area. So that variability does cause some heartburn, right? It does impact our confidence just because of the range of possible outcomes. But the good news is that most of these things affect the entire industry. So labor and airports, it's everybody's problem.  One unique thing for us is that we are financing the aircraft a little differently today than we did in the past. That's something unique to us. But for the most part, this affects the entire industry. The good news is that while we're going to have to digest all of these, so as everyone else, our relative cost advantage should be maintained.\nScott Haralson : And your quote on United, I mean, they're what 2 plus times our unit costs. So I'm not expecting them to come to the levels that we are. And everybody has their own unique components around costs, but I think once things settle out, you're going to see our unit cost advantage continue to widen.\nConor Cunningham : Okay. I appreciate it. And then with non-fuel unit costs rampant throughout the industry, higher fuel in general as well, driven in part by a better economy, just -- how has your thought process changed towards base fares in general, for example, McDonald's discussed the other day about how they historically higher average pricing to offset a lot of the labor increases. Starbucks just now just raised base pay for for all hourly employees with the assumption of offsetting with higher pricing. Why wouldn't that be the case for you guys in general? It just seems like there's an ability to push fares now than there's ever been before given all the cost pressures that are out there in general. I appreciate the time. Thank you.\nMatt Klein : Sure, Conor. This is Matt. I'll take that question. So generally speaking, fares will move based on supply and demand. As demand continues to improve I would anticipate that we would see upward yield movement. I can give you an example that's happening right now. So while recurring off of a low base and a base of which we are not satisfied with, we are seeing yields starting to firm, especially if you look at traffic, say, inside 7 days from departure, we don't carry a lot of that traffic. We carry our fair share of that kind of traffic and we are seeing that traffic start to improve and we're also seeing those yields start to form.  So to me that's an indication, while we're coming off of a low base, that we have been and we're starting to be successful in pushing yield increases through the network. Another thing I would mention too in terms of fairs in general and what we're seeing happen from a demand perspective is, and this is a little bit counterintuitive, but I will tell you that our conversion rate is actually well quite strong and starting to fall just a little bit over Thanksgiving and Christmas. Well, what that means actually, is that as the fares are continuing to improve over Thanksgiving and Christmas, our customers are taking a little more time to shop around, and that is an indication of in fact that we're going to see yields that we expect to be a little bit higher.  Instead of customers seeing fares and just snapping them up, they're shopping around a little bit more, which is actually good news and why we have some confidence here that fares will continue to move up. Those are more short-term in nature; I think you're talking more longer term. And as always, if the supply versus demand balance and we're comfortable and confident in our network. And that what we're building -- we're moving to moving forward will deliver the RASM s and deliver the margins that we expect to see from our network long-term.\nConor Cunningham : Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nMatt Klein : Sure thing.\nOperator: Our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about targets. I'm sure in the early innings, post this most recent meltdown, the focus was on settling down the operation in fighting fires and attribution and things of that sort. But I wonder if you'd be willing to share with us, if the nature of your conversations with the Board has changed? Has there been any discussion about fundamentally what you're trying to solve for? For example, is there any discussion about an absolute profit or absolute margin goal for 2022? And should an absolute profit goal drive capital allocation, which would include a fleet plan from arm's length, right, from arm's length it's easy from [indiscernible] It feels like the organization is solving for a pre -pandemic fleet plan.\nTed Christie : Hey, Duane, it's Ted. So obviously the Board is very much aware of the Company's 5-year objectives. We are a long-term planning cycle business with long-term assets. We view the, as I said earlier, the route opportunity and market opportunity to be large in our market. They are also well aware of the Company's margin objectives, which we've shared with you guys and I think it's consistent. So they expect us to deliver on those things much like you do, and I believe we can. So to your comment about whether or not it's a pre -pandemic or post-pandemic fleet plan.  Again, it is our belief today that the market opportunity is as large or perhaps even larger than it was prior to the pandemic. And we believe with our cost structure and our current network presence, we're the best suited to explore that at the lowest fare and lowest cost level. And I know there's variety of other different products out there and different airlines can serve those segments. But that's what's important to us and important to our board.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I appreciate the thoughts, Ted. And then maybe just a hypothetical question a little bit out of that field. But this year over to framework that we've been stuck in from a capacity, from a cost structure, from a margin perspective. Is there any thought on putting out targets for 2022 on a year-over-year basis, where you're talking about capacity and margins and hopefully RASM, not just CASM. But hopefully RASM on a year-over-year basis? And thanks for your thoughts.\nTed Christie : Yeah. We're considering the right way to present it. I get your point. And at some point you start going year-over-three-year. But we'll make sure we presented the most the clearest way and the most digestible way.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question from Hunter Keay of Wolfe [indiscernible]\nHunter Keay : [Indiscernible]. Hey, good morning, everybody. Scott, in the budget right now, are you expecting profits next year?\nScott Haralson : Well, we have a number of scenarios. Obviously, we've -- still in that process today. I think we are looking at sort of a middle ground scenario where we do generate a little bit of a profit. Hard to say at this point, we're still trying to figure out what unit revenue looks like for Q4, much less for 2022. So we have a number of scenarios at this [indiscernible].\nHunter Keay : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then another one for you, Scott, how do you -- how much do you spend each year on overhead? And how do you measure it?\nScott Haralson : On overhead? It's sort of a generic term. I mean, it -- I guess you're really getting at fixed and variable components, and those change over time really depending on how close you get to departure. What overhead really in -- the corporate overhead component is really primarily people. And that's a big component of the expense. But I would say you are talking about -- we've talked about 50-50 variable and fixed. And that's the way I would sort of think about overhead, it's that 50% of our expense component.\nHunter Keay : Okay. All right, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question from Stephen Trent of Citi.\nStephen Trent : Good morning, everybody. And thanks very much for taking my question. Just two quick one\u2019s for you. 1, I noticed that you launched some service to Puerto Vallarta when you think about the FAA downgrading Mexican Aviation, [Indiscernible] that ostensibly give s some advantage to U.S. carriers flying southbound versus Mexican carriers launching new north bound. Do you see any more of those type of opportunities in the pipeline? And the second question just really quickly, to what extent over the long term, could you envision Spirit participating in M&A, either as a buyer or a target? Thank you.\nMatt Klein : Hey, Stephen, it's Matt. I'll take your first question. I think Ted will take your second question. In terms of Mexico in general, we see, we see lots of opportunities in Mexico. We've been flying there for quite some time, and there's always opportunities there for leisure traffic here. And I think over time, we'll be thinking about VFR traffic and seeing how we can best develop the network there. For VFR traffic as well. And then I will turn it over to Ted.\nTed Christie : Yeah, Stephen, as it relates to M&A, I think the answer is going to be consistent with what we've said before. One thing I'll reiterate, we're extremely excited about the organic opportunity here. We think it's pretty big. And we believe we have the resources to go and explore that. However, it's in our best interest to always be looking around at ways that we can best deliver return to our shareholders. Today, we are the largest ULCC on the Space and so we want to figure out the best way to capitalize upon that. So we're always thoughtful, but at the same time very interested in excited about organically what we can do.\nStephen Trent : Okay. Very helpful color guys. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question, Chris Stathoulopoulos of Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, your prepared remarks sound that the response to what happened in August is more structural in a good way versus what your response was. We look back at some of the press releases and transcripts in 2015 and 2019. So curious if you could rank order the top 3 initiatives that you've put in place to address this. Is there an IROP committee or what gives investors the confidence that when demand plus weather plus canes in say, reservation system or shortages of FTEs at critical parts and the network where Spirit can now get in front of this.  And I'm not saying that can completely avoid it, but that we have confidence that the magnitude of breakdown, that we won't see a similar magnitude of breakdown. And also, is there anything -- I haven't looked at the proxy, but is there anything now that's going to be tied to KPIs for executives around this? And I guess, the third part is, should we expect, as you come into 2022 and 2023 with these changes that we would see a higher OTP scores. Thanks.\nTed Christie : Okay. I'll try to address those, Chris. First, the reaction in this current period versus what we experienced in 2015. So we took learning's from 2015, actually deployed them into the network, and they were successful. And I think that was measured by the Company's reliability in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. What's different is, as Scott indicated earlier, is the Company grows 15% a year. And while we're pretty good at forecasting what that looks like, and adapting the network to it, and making necessary design changes to enhance reliability, clearly this summer we didn't get enough in front of it.  Now I'm willing to -- if you give me a little bit of credit to say this was a weird period for airlines from a planning perspective. But despite that, we should have done better. We should had done better by our team; we should have done better by our guests. So it starts with the network design, that's both the aircraft network and the crew network. And basically, we tear it back apart again and make sure we've got the right constructs, both in the form of basis and in the way that aircraft flow. And I think we're going to have some real wins come out of that, which I'm excited to see. And then to the extent that we do have an irregular operation, which like you said, an acknowledged earlier, will happen, how do we recover faster?  So putting in place a more robust plan about how we react to it, and more importantly, how do we predict it's happening? What are the leading indicators for us? As our network gets bigger, it gets a little bit more complex. And so we're evaluating multiple inputs, which is probably what led us to our issues in early August. And what are the right ways for us from a green, yellow, red perspective to evaluate each one of those inputs? And I think there's going to be some very exciting takeaways from that as well by using data and automation to help the team make good decisions. Then we can recover faster.  And I think that's what's really important is, yes, we will not avoid them all together, but then we want them to become smaller and more non-events, because I understand your concern that investors may have and I would like to assuage that concern, because I do believe that we're a unique set of circumstances. We have been growing relatively rapidly and we are reacting to that. But I think we can be more proactive. And that's what this process is teaching us. Now as it relates to KPIs. and how that is measured. We are already measured in our short-term incentive on the Company's operational performance.  Measured by on-time performance, and it's not an insignificant portion of our short-term incentive. And that has played out well for us over the last four or five years because we've been a pretty good producer of on-time performance. So I think our board is focused on it. The management team is focused on it, because we want to deliver the best experience for our guests and we did not do that this summer. But we believe it's an isolated incident that we can move past. So looking forward into 2022, you're going to see similar KPIs that will be measured. And we will be held to that standard going forward.\nChris Stathoulopoulos : Okay, appreciate the depth of the response. And just the follow-up here. So the closer to $0.06 CASM x, if fuel moves lower and you feel better about the environment and unlocking more capacity, could that closer to $0.06 get back to a high fives or lower the -- that you outlined back in July. Is that at all being contemplated in your planning for 2022 at this point? Thank you.\nScott Haralson : Thanks, Chris. I think the part that's key here is capacity. We've talked about before getting back to full utilization. And we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're going to slow the pace of that a bit so that we make sure we get the hiring in place in order to run the schedule that we want than supposed to getting out in front of it a little bit. Now, our plan all along is to hire enough to run a full airline a little quicker than maybe we hope. And if those things happen, it is very possible that we're able to get to full utilization a little bit quicker than maybe we're talking about here in our guidance.  That's possible. But we're not going to get ahead of that too soon. So it is possible that we get to full utilization by late summer. It is possible, but it all depends on hiring. And we'll just see how that goes next year. What -- Look, I think it's -- Our goal all along is to get to full utilization as quick as we can, balancing the operational components that we always do. Even more so today with the IROP and the changing landscape underneath us. So we're going to be patient and we may be a little bit conservative, but our hope is that we can get there a little bit sooner.\nTed Christie : And I'll just add to Scott's comments, which are all correct. We're obviously a part of the environment. We recognize that supply and demand have an impact and we've always been managers of that, to the extent that there is a more robust recovery or a lower fuel environment that can stimulate additional activity, we would be responsive to that. And we believe we can have levers to pull in that regard because utilization on our fleet is meaningful. And so, yes, there are ways for us in a faster running economy to perhaps lean in a little more and that would have an appropriate impact on CASM ex as well. So yeah, we would take that into account also.\nChris Stathoulopoulos : Appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavi Syth : Good morning, everyone. I realize you've answered some of this in different spots but -- and then I also realized that unlike some of your non ULCC competitors, there isn't a lot of efficiency and productivity and juniority savings to be rung out relative to 2019. And maybe for Scott, could you perhaps walk through the major cost line items and on a per ASM basis, just how much of inflationary pressure we might be seeing or some range that we might be seeing relative to 2019 once you're back to pre -crisis utilization?\nScott Haralson : Yes, Savi. We will try to hit on some of those. And I think they're all going to be the ones that we've talked about before. Labor right now is a moving target on the rates. And hopefully we stabilize behavior over time. But labor rates are moving north. Hard to predict where they will stop, but that's a moving target. Airports right now are very difficult to predict where they're going to rationalize that. But our hope is that throughout 2022, as throughput of Airport starts to become more predictive those rates are easier for airports to predict and it stabilizes how we forecast the business.  But it's going to be labor, which is going to be throughout the spectrum, we talked about it at the [indiscernible] and gate agent level, but we're seeing it throughout the organization, I think as most companies are, and it's going to be at airports. Those are the two largest and we also talked about financing aircraft. So aircraft rent on a [indiscernible] basis is going up. Those three areas account for probably more than 90% of the move in unit costs. So that's the vast majority of the [Indiscernible].\nSavi Syth : [Indiscernible] airports, you should return to normal once the traffic levels return to normal, right?\nScott Haralson : Well, I wouldn't say normal. The way I would describe it would be it has elevated. Upwards of 50% on a per departure basis for us. And we think that it will probably stabilize at somewhere around 20% higher. But that's a predictive guests at this point, and I don't expect it to go all the way down to the per passenger per departure basis that we had pre -COVID and I do not expect that to happen.\nSavi Syth : Next [Indiscernible]. Just a follow-up on just capacity and bring it back up. It sounds like -- is it solely bringing Fort Lauderdale backup, for example? Is it solely on making sure the staffing levels are right? And what's the likely cadence as you go through 2022? Is it a little bit more back-half-weighted or is it pretty fairly consistent uptick in capacity?\nMatt Klein : Hey Savi it's Matt, I'll start and then Scott can come in after me here. So a piece of this definitely is Fort Lauderdale staffing and we want to make sure that we're being smart with the schedule and making sure that we're looking and how to add that back in. Of course, we would like to get that back to full utilization of Fort Lauderdale as soon as possible. But as Scott mentioned and Ted mentioned, we're going to be smart in how we do that to make sure that we have the right guest experience and not cause other kinds of disruptions for our guests along the way. It's not just Fort Lauderdale per se.  That's where the biggest issue is. We do see some pressures in some other airports. But generally speaking, it is Fort Lauderdale. We'll continue to ramp up through the first quarter into the second quarter. And although we're not anticipating, as Scott mentioned, that we'll be back at full utilization by early summer, we'll be getting pretty close to that. And that's where we think we'll be able to flex back up by the summer again. Not quite the full utilization, but approaching that number. Scott?\nScott Haralson : Yeah, I would agree. I think you covered it.\nSavi Syth : Okay. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Our next question from Jamie Baker at JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker : Hey, good morning, everybody. I actually liked Mike 's question a lot and I wanted to expand on that by asking a slightly different variant. If you had known in March or April of 2020 that the government was going to allocate something around $75 billion of aid to the industry. Would you have behaved any differently? And do you think that your 2023 margin commentary today would be any different?\nTed Christie : If -- so Mike, it's \u2013 I [indiscernible] Jamie, it's Ted. So you mean if we had known about it but it was still going to happen, would we have behaved any differently?\nJamie Baker : Yes. Yes.\nTed Christie : I don't think so. I think we reacted early on in the pandemic knowing that we had to solve our own problems. So we anticipated that we were going to do that regardless. And I think we would behave exactly the same coming out. I can't speak for everyone else. And we probably had a slightly different view on that program than maybe some of our larger competitors. But I would tell you that we -- I believe that we did everything exactly according to what I would've anticipated. In fact, I think the group executed extremely well throughout the course of 2020. And now, as we look forward into 2023, we see the opportunity, and thankfully, we did make those moves, because I feel good about the Company's Balance Sheet, I feel good about the Company's order book, and our ability to tackle that opportunity, assuming I'm right.\nJamie Baker : Okay. Interesting, and thank you. And the second question, just on fuel efficiency, if we look at ASMs per gallon, the metrics steadily rose during the crisis, it peaked in the fourth quarter of last year. It's been coming down ever since as as you rebuild the network. But the guide for this quarter does suggest a sequential increase again. Just wondering on the revised 2022 capacity forecast, the 53 to 55 billion, how should we be thinking about the various moving network pieces that would allow us to better model fuel efficiency relative to 2019 baselines? Thanks.\nScott Haralson : Yeah. Hey, Jamie. We haven't done a forecast on 2022 ASMs per gallon, but I'll talk to you some of the moving parts here. The movement primarily in 2020 and 2021 on that metric has really been driven around mix around the flying of the Neos versus our oldest aircraft, the 319s. So if you think about that production, we're going to fly most likely the A320neo s first and then it trickles down. So as capacity gets flexed up and down, your mix of Neo versus [Indiscernible]. Changes that metric. So that's the primary driver of the change. Now we have been building our Neo fleet over this period and we'll continue to do that next year, so that is the tailwind to the metric. But we will incorporate more of the aircraft into the fleet next year as well, so that's going to be a headwind. As those things sort of play out, hard to really tell, but those are the puts and takes. We don't have a final number yet, but that's where the things that are going to move closer.\nJamie Baker : Okay. I very much appreciate the color. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: And the next question from Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey. Good morning, Ron, thanks for the time. So there's been a lot of industry focus on flying to Florida and some other leisure markets over the last 18 months because of the recovery, of course, then led by leisure demand. I guess, in the schedules for early next year, are you starting to see that additional capacity decline at all or too early to tell?\nTed Christie : Hey, Katie, it's Ted. So first, you're right and we've noted that. So we're largely -- we're not only a Florida headquartered airline, but 50% to 60% of our airline touches the state. And so we're very aware of and sensitive to [indiscernible] moves within the state. And it's been interesting to see how it's -- what's happened over the course of the pandemic. And in fact, for the fourth quarter domestic capacity in the United States is down still around 6%, but Florida is up like 8. So despite competitive pressures in our home state, we're still outperforming the industry and have so -- have been doing so because of our competitive position here and we're sizing the right places and we intend to expand that.  Now, looking ahead, it's anyone's guess, but I would tell you that if -- assuming that, and we agree, by the way, with the broader commentary that international traffic will return, corporate traffic will return. Timing of that is in question, but we tend to agree with that commentary. Assuming that happens, that capacity that has been moved into domestic leisure will in all likelihood move to other places better suited. Which is probably going to be beneficial to low-cost carriers. And so don't know exactly when that happens and the forward schedules are still in flux. But we anticipate it will.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. And then just drilling a bit more into the labor inflation you called out as one of the main drivers to not getting as far below $0.06 CASM as you previously thought. There is, of course, very well-documented labor inflation everywhere in the economy. But with 80% of your labor under union contracts, is it that other 20% that drives the inflation? Or if not, are you expecting to see rates increase and new contracts cycles within a couple of years? Is it changing staffing levels permanently to improve the recoverability you guys have been talking about over the call? Or maybe as your labor force getting more senior? I know I gave you options there, but just trying to get a sense of what is changing your longer-term expectations versus what's transitory. Thanks.\nScott Haralson : Yes, thanks. All those are moving around. So in -- and we talked about the Airport staffing, which has been above and below wind of which we are unionized in Fort Lauderdale. But the other airports in our system are all outsourced. So while the labor costs of those are not in our umbrella, it does influence our cost structure so we -- that labor component, when we talk about labor, it's all of that. It's the ground handling component for our outsourced providers as well as those internal. But we're seeing it throughout the spectrum. The biggest percentage increase is happening at the airports.  We spend -- we'll probably spend upwards of $300 million next year in Airport labor expenses. So it's a big number for us, but the union component is a little bit fixed in the short run, but the other stuff we are seeing a good bit inflation throughout the spectrum. So that is happening. But as you mentioned too, there is a component of the labor increase even for the unionized folks internally, that is happening on a rate basis and average rates. So we spent the last, call it, year or 18 months, the earlier parts of COVID without hiring any additional crew members. So that changed the average rate structure within the business. Over time as we start to hire those again, and we did that starting back in January and February, that will have a dilute effect to our average rate, but the overall expense for labor is going to be significantly higher, period.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thank you [indiscernible].\nDe Anne Gabel : And with that, I think that's a wrap for this call. Thank you all very much for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

My name is James and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to DeAnne Gabel, Senior Director of Investor Relations. DeAnne, you may begin.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, James, and welcome, everyone, to Spirit Airlines' second quarter earnings call. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call will be archived on our website for 60 days. Presenting on today's call are Ted Christie, Spirit's Chief Executive Officer; Matt Klein, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Scott Haralson, our Chief Financial Officer.

Thanks to everyone for joining us today. Now nearly 18 months into the pandemic, I grow ever more proud and impressed by the dedication of our Spirit team members. Throughout the course of the crisis, we abandoned together to come up with innovative solutions to secure our future, save jobs and take care of our guests. This summer has proven to be operationally challenging and very busy with full aircraft and airports. I'm eternally grateful for all the hard work as we move ahead through the recovery. Turning to our second quarter financial results. Solid operational and network execution, together with an improved demand backdrop contributed to our reporting among the best financial results in the industry. While we recorded a net loss of $36.3 million for the second quarter, in June, we recorded our first month of profitability since the onset of the pandemic. Based on current booking trends, we anticipate we will be profitable in both the third and fourth quarters of 2021. Operationally, the team delivered strong results despite numerous weather systems across our network and elevated congestion at airports due to the volume of industry capacity. Our DOT on-time performance for the quarter was 78.3%, and our completion factor was 99.3%. The Spirit team is doing an excellent job managing through the recovery. We are once again growing our network and playing to the strengths of our business model. The team continues to innovate and grow non-ticket revenue, and they are doing a great job managing costs. And as we ramp to full utilization, we will see further efficiency gains. There is still much to be done to attain sustained profitability and deliver high returns to our shareholders, but the stage is set, and we like how we are positioned. With that, I'll turn it over to Matt and Scott to discuss more details of our quarterly performance.\nMatt Klein: Thanks, Ted. Second quarter turned out even better than we anticipated. Flights are full and airports are very busy. I want to thank the entire Spirit team for taking excellent care of our guests and each other during this busy travel season. In discussing results today, I'll be comparing results to the second quarter 2019, but I'll also explain second quarter revenue trends on a sequential first to second quarter basis as doing so helps to illustrate the trajectory of our improvement. Turning now to our second quarter revenue results. Total operating revenue was down 15% compared to the second quarter 2019 on 5% less capacity. This result was much better than our initial expectations. Demand trends in our domestic and international markets saw significant improvement as the second quarter progressed, such that June 2021 operating yields were nearly flat compared to June 2019 on similar capacity. Compared to the first quarter 2021, improvement in operating yields as well as higher load factors, helped drive an 86.3% sequential improvement in total revenues compared to a much smaller 28% sequential capacity increase. So on a per segment basis, compared to the same period in 2019, total revenue per passenger segment declined 9.4%. The passenger revenue per segment component did decline 23.5%, but we saw a very strong non-ticket revenue per segment performance. Our non-ticket revenue per segment increased $2.85 compared to the same quarter in 2019, a 5.1% increase. This non-ticket result is a record for Spirit, and we expect to break that record again this quarter. We said we'd continue the upward march on non-ticket performance. We're doing that through enhanced product offerings, improved customer-facing merchandising and realize benefits from our revenue management initiatives. The investments in these areas are paying off, we are moving even closer to $60 of non-ticket revenue per segment on a quarterly basis, and I couldn't be prouder of the teams working across the entire company to achieve this result. The revenue management and e-commerce teams continue to lead these efforts, but our fantastic airport services team deserves a lot of credit as well. Thank you to each and every one of you for driving this incredible result while we're still battling through the pandemic. Turning to the passenger ticket side of the equation, load factors have largely recovered and the yields we've seen around peak travel have been impressive and have largely caught up to 2019. The opportunity to push up yields during off-peak periods will likely continue to be a challenge and our focus for a little while. However, as the recovery in leisure as well as business travel progresses, we expect to further close the gap to 2019 passenger revenue per segment. Additionally, while the improving demand trend certainly helps, our network and deployment of assets is the largest driver of our revenue performance. We have a strong track record of picking markets that allow us to profitably offer low fares, stimulate demand and provide high value to our guests. This has been and continues to be the recipe of our success. We remain very well positioned to capture market demand in addition to reinstating nearly the entirety of our route network to prepandemic levels, we've been very busy adding new cities to our schedule. Over the past few months, we commenced service from our new cities of Louisville, Kentucky, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Pensacola, Florida; Portovaarta, Mexico and St. Louis, Missouri. We added 28 new routes in the second quarter and reinstated 11 routes, which had been previously suspended. Some examples of our new routes include service from LaGuardia Airport to Los Angeles, Nashville and San Juan. We also started new international service from Los Angeles to Los Cabos. And some other examples feature new leisure routes from origination cities like Kansas City and Columbus. Also during the second quarter, Spirit announced new service to Manchester, New Hampshire and Miami, Florida, which will both begin operations in October. And just yesterday, the President of Honduras joined us in announcing service to the new airport into GusaGalpa, which will start operations just before Thanksgiving later this year. While in general, we are pleased to be growing again, we are being very deliberate with our route deployment to ensure that we continue to build a sustainable network for the long term. For the third quarter, we estimate capacity will be up 10.6% versus the third quarter 2019. And for fourth quarter, we estimate capacity to be up about 23% versus fourth quarter 2019. The -- Moving ahead to the third quarter revenue outlook. July yields and load factors have been strong. Our booking trends indicate August through early September will also be strong. The post Labor Day period typically books closer in, therefore, our visibility is somewhat limited, which is normal for this time of year. But at this point, we aren't seeing anything to suggest the seasonality trade in September will be different from normal. The revenue range implied by our EBITDA guide is $1.03 billion to $1.1 billion or up 3.5% to 11% compared to third quarter 2019 on 10.6% more capacity. And now here's Scott.\nScott Haralson: Thanks, Matt. I also want to thank our team members for their continued commitment and dedication. In my travels around the system, I see the hard work, and I hear the team spirit and their voices and it makes me proud to be part of the team. Now turning to our second quarter 2021 financial performance. Due to our strategic deployment of assets and improving demand environment and our strong operational performance, we were one of only a few airlines to produce positive adjusted EBITDA for the entire second quarter. Our EBITDA margin for the second quarter was a positive 7.2%. This result was much better than our initial expectation due to both better revenue and lower cost. Total operating cost increased 2.6% compared to the second quarter 2019. Our cost performance was better than expected, primarily due to strong operational performance. Therefore used fees increasing at a slightly slower rate than expected, and some timing of events that shifted to Q3, as well as good overall cost management.  Moving on to the balance sheet, during the quarter, we leveraged the favorable market dynamics to enter into a series of liability management transactions. To summarize these transactions, we completed the direct placement of 10.6 million shares the holders of our 4.75% convertible notes and used the proceeds to redeem $340 million of our 8% senior secured notes. We also issued $500 million of 1% convertible senior notes using the net proceeds to repurchase 84% and of our outstanding 4.75% convertible notes. After accounting for the premiums paid and payment of accrued interest, the net result was that we were able to reduce interest expense by about $30 million per year and reduce our overall debt balance by about $32 million, while not materially impacting the run rate of net diluted shares nor our liquidity position. Details of these transactions can be found in our earnings release and 10-Q filing that were both published yesterday and are available on our website. In addition to these transactions, we also repaid all of the outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility. We ended the second quarter with $2.2 billion in liquidity, which includes unrestricted cash short-term investments and the $240 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Turning now to our fleet and fleet utilization. During the second quarter, we took delivery of 5 new A320neo aircraft and ended the quarter with 164 aircraft in our fleet. By the end of the second quarter, 23 of our 31 A319s were back in service. Our average daily utilization for the quarter was 9.9 hours or 23% lower than the second quarter of 2019. As I've noted previously, we expect to ramp to full fleet utilization by mid-2022. During the quarter, we completed the purchase of 2 additional A319s off-lease. Our revised capital expenditure estimate for 2021 is now $290 million. During the quarter, we also launched an RFP for additional aircraft required in the 2022 to 2024 time frame. As we discussed previously, these aircraft were expected additions to our order book with Airbus. To recap the forward-looking guidance we provided in our earnings release, we estimate our EBITDA margin for the third quarter will range between positive 10% to 15%. This assumes total operating expenses of about $1 billion. We're also assuming a fuel price per gallon of $2.14 and D&A of about $75 million. As noted previously, for the first half of 2022, while we still have utilization headwinds in, CASM ex fuel will likely be in the low 6s, and by midyear, we expect to reach sub-6 territory. In closing, the ramp-up of our operation and our unit cost progression is happening on target, if not even a little bit better than expected. We don't believe anything about the pandemic changes in our long-term opportunities, and we expect a full recovery in travel demand and look forward to growing the airline again. With that, I'll hand it back to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks, Scott. There has been an increase in news reports regarding jurisdictions reinstituting indoor face covering policies. It's too soon to say what, if any, impact this will have on bookings. All along, we've assumed the recovery would be choppy. But regardless of whatever ups and downs occur related to the pandemic, it doesn't change our long-term view. Low cost and high quality have allowed Spirit to deliver industry-leading margins since our IPO. Nothing that we have experienced or learned during the course of the pandemic has changed this historical fact. And we also feel confident that as we exit the pandemic, we will leverage those same strengths to deliver pre-pandemic margins in 2023 and beyond. With that, back to DeAnne.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, Ted. We are now ready to take questions from the analysts. James, we are ready to begin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Helane Becker.\nHelaneBecker: Thanks very much operator. Probably a question for Scott. As you're thinking about acquiring aircraft, I think you mentioned for the next couple of years 2022 and 2024 deliveries. How are you thinking about aircraft cost? Because we're hearing from other airlines that they're out looking for aircraft too and Allegiance said yesterday, they were able to secure some aircraft down 30% versus pre-pandemic levels. And I'm wondering, if all this demand from various airlines is not going to cause pricing to move up. So how are you thinking about that?\nScottHaralson: Yes, that's a good question, Helane. Good morning too by the way. We were out in the market really pre-pandemic thinking about this. And the rates that we're seeing today, you know, we've mentioned on the previous call too, were really at or below pre-pandemic levels for that time period. Hard to say what's going to happen to the lease rates or cost of aircraft sort of post this near term window. But what we're seeing in this sort of '22 to '24 timeframe our lease rates that are pretty attractive. Hard to say for the user aircraft cause we're in the market, primarily for new kit. But the lease rates are in a pretty good spot today. \nHelaneBecker: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just for my follow-up, I think Miami is one of your new markets. And I'm just kind of wondering maybe Matt this is for you. How you're thinking about Miami. It's an expensive airport from which to operate on a cost per passenger basis. I don't know, how are you thinking about that and balancing your low fares with those high costs? Thank you.\nMattKlein: Good question, Helane and good morning as well. So our decision to enter Miami was one that took a number of years for us to be able to get to that point where we could feel comfortable entering Miami. And that is because the airport there did change their cost structure along with their lease rates, just in general, without getting into too many technical details. The structure there changed a lot, which made it attractive for us to finally enter Miami. We feel like as a leisure airline, Miami is one of the largest leisure destinations in the country. And it was just a matter of time before we were able to get in there and the cost structure to your point about low fares, the cost structure there now allows us to go in there with our low fares and be very profitable. \nOperator: Our first question comes from Brandon Oglenski.\nBrandonOglenski: Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Matt, I think if go back to your implied revenue guidance for the quarter, at the top end of it that would imply, getting back to where you were in 2019, from a yield or passenger revenue per segment level. But maybe you can speak to that a little bit more.\nMattKlein: Yes. Sure, Brandon. So that's right, the top end of the guidance is implied to basically have revenue production at ASM growth. So, our continued move up on non-ticket has been, I would say, something that we knew we would be able to achieve, but the investments have been paying off a little bit faster than we had actually even anticipated ourselves. It's one of those things we talked about over the last few years really, but even during the pandemic, we continued to invest in what we knew would be important for us coming out of the pandemic, and a lot of that was, in what we offer our guests and how we offer it, not just what, but how. So that seems to be paying off well, and the revenue management and pricing of those products has been working too. One of the we had it in the prepared remarks as well, is once we get past labor day, the high end of the guide would be anticipating that there would be a continued move up and that we start to see some of the anticipated demand that comes back from say small and medium sized businesses as well. And as evidenced by that, we have moved every year, we move our capacity around from a summer into the post Labor Day period. And to give you an example when schools in some places start to go back-to-school, say for example, in Texas, we'll move some capacity out of Texas in mid-August, move it to the Northeast, because school goes back after Labor Day generally. So, that's sort of a end of summer move we do with our capacity. Then you get past Labor Day and this year we moved even more capacity into Las Vegas after Labor Day. In fact, I think we're up around 8 or 9 departures per day, once you go from August to September. Now we did that in anticipation of conference season starting to build back up in Las Vegas. So, not just an extended leisure period, but also the anticipation of some of that building back up. That's where we can see maybe some ability to hit the upside of the guide is that kind of traffic with the yields we would anticipate on that follows through. So, hope that helps give some color on that.\nBrandonOglenski: And then I guess for Ted or Scott. I think there is been a perception at least, because we've been talking about CASM and 2022 that could be higher than, where you were previously pre-pandemic. And a lot of investors have asked like, has Spirit lost and sway on cost focus. But it seems like, Scott, I think you said, sub-6 come the back half of next year or maybe I heard that wrong. But can you talk to some of the, the progress on cost or the cost initiatives you guys are looking at?\nMattKlein: Yes. Thanks, Brandon. I mean, look, first off, certainly not the case. Spirit of all people cares about unit cost. It's our biggest strategic asset. So that's our 100% continued focus. But to think about the math of the situation there are inflationary costs that are happening in the industry. We're not immune to that. So, we're seeing inflationary costs on labor and we've talked about airport costs before. All those things are happening. We're likely going to lean in releasing aircraft a little more, that's going to put pressure on unit costs. But, all of those things, still take in, we're going to be, what we said in the prepared remarks, sub-6 by mid-2022. How far below six we go depends on a number of things, for example, like financing aircraft, where we fly those assets. But, in general, we're going to be in the high fives probably, and then we'll see where it goes from there. We've talked about the things that drive unit costs being, what you fly, and how you finance it, and where you fly those assets. So, we'll make financing decisions and fleet decisions over the coming years, we'll make network decisions. And those will impact, where unit cost over time. But the hope is that we can, we can get to, a fairly sizable number below six and continue to maintain, sort of that sort of high fives, CASM for a period of time, but the decisions that will make in the short-term will dictate what ends up. \nOperator: Next question from Jamie Baker.\nJamieBaker: You cited being profitable in the fourth quarter. That's helpful. I realize you're probably not going to provide a ton of granularity. But relative to the third quarter, what really changed it as you move into the fourth quarter? I mean are you expecting costs to meaningfully come down or sequential revenue to meaningfully accelerate? And I ask because it's pretty rare for you to generate more revenue in the fourth quarter than the third. But I mean we're obviously in a pretty robust recovery at the moment.\nTedChristie: Jamie, it's Ted. I think it's both to start. The guys can jump in and give a little clarity. But as the airline has -- will continue to ramp utilization, Scott mentioned in his remarks today, utilization in the second quarter was almost 3 hours less than we normally fly. So with that, with that utilization level, we're still producing below 6.5% CASM ex. And we're talking about a 25-ish percent utilization penalty. So as the airline starts to move the utilization in the right direction, unit costs are going to come down. So I think that's a tailwind heading into the fourth quarter. We also are getting bigger. So total revenue will go up. Seasonally, the fourth quarter is not as profitable, generally speaking, as the third, but we are anticipating a continued recovery as well. And evidenced by the EBITDA margin guide that we provided, right now our expectations for profitability into the third quarter are -- they're around the margin once we get to at small numbers, but we're certainly moving into the right direction and very encouraged by unit cost trajectory and demand recovery. And I think that, that's what's going to move sequentially in the right direction, setting us up that by the time we hit the peak of 2022, we're much more in a traditional run rate.\nJamieBaker: Just as a follow-up, could you quantify what sort of a revenue or RASM drag the new markets? You mentioned the 4 or 5 new cities, the new market activity. What pressure that's putting on the third quarter revenue guide? I mean, could you -- you gave us a third quarter revenue range. Any way to express that on a sort of a same-store sort of a same-store sales RASM basis, something like that?\nTedChristie: Yes. Sure, Jamie. I think probably answered a little less detail than you may actually want. But I can tell you this, that historically, new cities, new service does usually take around a 10% or so RASM penalty as we ramp up. But that has so many caveats in it, which is the time of the year we're launching it. How big is the launch. I think we talked about that a little bit a couple of years ago as we had introduced a lot of new cities. So we don't anticipate that to be significantly different. The one would -- on that is that we do think because, say, for example, Miami, we are starting off in October with, I think, about 1 gate of service. And then by the time we get to Thanksgiving, it will be up to nearly 30 departures per day, which is a relatively large launch for us. However, it's ramping up right before Thanksgiving and then into Christmas. So we're not anticipating there to be the normal drag, say, in the fourth quarter that you might have on new service. And then we'll just sort of see what happens after New Year's because January, as you know, can always be a bit of a wildcard for the industry.\nOperator: Our next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth.\nDuanePfennigwerth: So a follow-up maybe to Brandon's question. Can you just help us mark-to-market on what you've said on timing about getting ex fuel unit costs below 2019. It feels like you've ratcheted up capacity at least once, maybe a couple of times. Now it sounds like you're looking for incremental fleet to add. So what have you said in the past on timing on when your nonfuel unit cost would be below 2019? How does that compare to where you stand now? And how do we contextualize maybe a couple of upward revisions to your capacity outlook?\nTedChristie: Okay. Thanks, Duane. A couple of points there. So on unit cost, we have said that we will be sub 6, which in 2019, we're at a 5-ish CASM. Even heading into 2020, we said CASM ex would be up probably 1 to 2 points. So we were already experiencing inflationary components and then haven't talked about getting to 2019 CASM ex during the COVID or post-COVID period. So to clarify, we have said sub-6 CASM probably hitting that number in mid-2022. So that's the clarification on the unit cost guidance. As for capacity, our capacity moves -- haven't really changed or at least our go-forward thoughts around growth. It's been mid-teens capacity. In fact, the COVID crisis set us back a little bit on a percentage basis. 2022, we would be larger absolute had it not been for the COVID crisis. So -- but we are going to return to our stated previously mid-teens growth rate, and we'll continue that for a period of time. So I don't think things have changed around how we think about growth. I think it's really more around the math maybe in 2021 or 2022 as we get back to full utilization. The growth metric itself on a percentage basis will be a little awkward. But how we think about growth hasn't changed.\nDuanePfennigwerth: And then maybe one for Ted. The commentary, I appreciate there's a lot we don't know at this point in time. And you certainly don't want to set a high bar. But given that you're entirely leisure-focused and given that you don't fly to Europe or Asia or any of those places, like why would it take until 2023 to restore your margins?\nTedChristie: So the -- we mentioned utilization being a drag. And until we can get the airline back to full use, it will it will be a margin drag. And as Scott indicated, that's probably not going to happen until we get to the middle part of next year. So at least for the first half of next year, we're going to have a little bit of a pressure with regard to utilization. We're also anticipating still recovery. While we -- you're right, we don't carry transatlantic and transpacific traffic, and we don't carry large corporate traffic probably. There's in all likelihood, at least some on our airplanes. But it is all demand. All of that stuff is demand in the marketplace. And so it can -- as it returns, the overall marketplace does get healthier. And that is part of the expected recovery, which we anticipate happening over the course of the next year and change. So I think that, that's another component as to why we anticipate it taking really up until 2023 when we're starting to see things more normalize. I've already said in an earlier question by the time we hit the summer next year, we're sort of running again. And I think you can kind of think about that as the start of it for us, at least, I can't speak for other airlines, but that's the way we're thinking about it. It really is about utilization and getting overall demand back to where it was. was.\nOperator: Next question from Hunter Keay.\nHunterKeay: So what is the outlook for gaining some slots at Newark in light of the Appeals Court victory? Ted, can you now compel the FAA or the port to make room for you?\nTedChristie: No. We -- let's start with what we are actively engaged in a number of efforts to get larger in New York. I think that's been well publicized at this point, which I won't comment on further. But -- and today, with regard to the waiver that's in place, there is incremental flying that we can do an award, which we are doing some of. And we recently relocated some of our service to the Marine air terminal. And in doing so, we've created at least physical space for us to get larger to the extent that there is availability. But beyond that, I don't have visibility about how slots would be managed at that airport.\nHunterKeay: And then I'd like to ask you a question about M&A. I know you're going to say you'll do what's best for shareholders, and that's the right answer, of course. But what sort of operational derail you consider when contemplating M&A, not just like integration and the cost of integration, but also culturally, anything related to IT? Is there anything that would be sort of too difficult or an honor as you contemplate maybe engaging in it in one form or another, if you decide to go down that path?\nTedChristie: I think those are all inputs. Hunter, you nailed it on the head there. There's -- we will do what we believe is in the best interest of our constituents, which include our shareholders and our team members and our guests. And M&A can have tremendous benefits to it in the form of synergies. But it can also create complexity and challenges with regard to technology and integration, risk and operational risk, all of those things are considerations. And if you look back over the history of how airline M&A has gone, post deregulation, I think there have been some hits and misses. So, I think we take that all into consideration as we evaluate or would evaluate opportunities for Spirit. Right now, our focus is on rebuilding the airline getting ourselves back to where we believe we need to be. We're in a leadership position today in our space, and we want to maintain that. \nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Linenberg. \nMikeLinenberg: Hey, good morning, everyone. Our two questions here. As you've mentioned, look, you're getting the network back to 2019 levels. But I think one of the sort of interesting sort of back stories here is that if I were to look at the diversification of your network. It does feel like that you've used the pandemic as an opportunity to really add a lot more points, whether it's spokes or even in some cases, call them focus cities like Miami, do you have anything that can give us a sense of maybe how the diversification has increased, say, we go to 2018, 2019, your top 10 markets represented 50% of your revenues and maybe now it's 25% because it does feel like you've you've really made some efforts there, and it's going to really, I think, help you on the backside here. So any sort of data points or anything that you could provide that highlight that shift or evolution would be great?\nScottHaralson: Yes. Sure thing, Mike. So as we exited 2019 and headed towards 2020, we did talk a lot about making sure that we were building upon our strengths, and that includes leisure cities, leisure markets, leisure destinations. So the pandemic got a little bit in the way of the execution of that plan. So we really weren't able to show it off the way that we wanted to. But we probably took that plan and then took it a little bit to another level once we got inside the pandemic. And some of that is based on where we saw demand materializing. And quite frankly, I think some of our competitors were probably thinking the same thing. For us, our low costs allow us to drive the fares necessary to still be profitable long term in leisure routes. And so I think one thing is we're already planning on doing that. And then within the pandemic, we were able to find opportunities to really set up even more. Now there's another side to that as well, which is our Latin America and Caribbean network. Pre-pandemic, we were running around 15% of our capacity was in Latin America and the Caribbean. And really, it was only a few short years ago, that number was 10% of our capacity. And then with the 15% and then within -- during the pandemic, we've got that number up to nearly 20% now. Yes. We'll see what happens after we get back to a more normalized demand environment for the entire industry, if that number stays up at 20%. But we're pretty happy with the results. We announced a new city just yesterday in Honduras, the second city in Honduras that we'll be serving. So we're always looking for those opportunities to diversify the network and find that VFR traffic as well, which is very profitable for us.\nMikeLinenberg: And then just sort of a second here and kind of ties into Jamie's question about fourth quarter profitability versus third? And why? And in fact, you are going to be a much bigger airline in the versus third. But also just what are you seeing on the booking side. Early book, Thanksgiving, Christmas. I realize that it had been difficult to go that far out, but we have heard that the booking curve has elongated and presumably, you're benefiting from a much longer, well, I should say, a longer booking curve than maybe what you saw 6 months ago. Any early read on what you can tell us about sort of the November, December time frame from a book perspective?\nTedChristie: Sure, Mike. So yes, it's pretty far out right now for those time periods. Normally, we are always pressure testing yields for holiday peak periods just to see what's the market looking at and what's the clearing price. Because there's different -- this can be -- This can be a long answer. I'll try to keep it short. There's different booking curves within different travel periods. Some people like to book really far out from their holiday trips and then others closer in. I think you're talking about sort of the far out bookers is kind of what you're kind of talking about right now. And I would say that on yes, that's continuing to move what we would normally see. There's nothing abnormal happening out there that has us concerned that there won't be strength around Thanksgiving or Christmas. The bulk of the booking curve for those holidays comes in after Labor Day. So we'll have a lot more commentary on that on our call in October but as of right now, we're not seeing anything that suggests there's going to be an issue at all out on Thanksgiving or Christmas.\nOperator: Next question from Stephen Trent.\nStephenTrent: Just really a quick one from me. When you're thinking about your pilot staff, how comfortable are you with the labor situation heading into the year in terms of your tenured crew in the fleet at the moment and the pace at which maybe furloughed pilots are currently doing their flight simulator training, just wanted to get your high-level view on how that's looking?\nTedChristie: Sure, Stephen. First to clarify, we did not furlough any of our crews. So we don't have any of that issue. Obviously, some of them did take leaves, and we've been working to bring them back. And are now in that position. So we're actively hiring as we grow and have been doing so really since February of this year, 1 of the first airlines to be back in the market. And the reasons that Spirit is an attractive landing place for pilots remains true today. We do have a rather rapid move to Captain here because of our growth rate. And anecdotally reading and listening to what our pilots have to say. They enjoy the network. They enjoy their ability to balance their lives with the way that our network flows. And so that creates actually quite a bit of traction. And the recommendations coming from our pilots to other pilots is very positive such that the combination of all of those things mean we're oversubscribed today. We have more applicants than we have jobs, which puts us in a favorable position. Not ignoring the fact that over the next few years, there is going to be a looming pilot issue based on what everyone is saying in the marketplace with retirements and active hiring happening at all airlines, but that would put us in a pretty favorable spot there. And as cracks start to show around pilot availability, you're not going to see it at Spirit first. It's clearly going to be at regional airlines and less attractive, low-cost carriers. And so we consider ourselves to be in a pretty good position there.\nStephenTrent: And as a quick follow-up. Given what we've seen in the news with some of the other nonsense that unfortunately, flight attendants have to put up with rude passengers and planes and what have you. Has any of that at all kind of crept into the conversation that you're having with your flight attendants and forgive me, by the way, for stirring up the [indiscernible]?\nTedChristie: Yes. Is it coming up? Absolutely. And you're right, there is a lot of publicized reports on unruly passengers on board aircraft across the U.S. space and across all brands. It is still the vast, vast, vast minority of activity. And as the restrictions have been lifted over the last 6 or 12 months. people are growing more comfortable with the way travel is operating. And the federal authorities have stepped up their enforcement of regulations on board aircraft. All those things have actually taken some of the wind out of that sale and reduce the steam on the airplane. It still happens and our flight attendants are concerned with that. And clearly, all flight attendants and all crew members across all airlines are concerned with that and have elevated the issue. But we're addressing that with the way that we treat passengers onboard our aircraft that behave that we actively ban people who misbehave onboard our aircraft. We're backing up our crews, making sure that they're aware of what we're doing with active communication, with messaging onboard the airplane. And I think that's having some desired effect. So the optimist view here is that as things start to move more towards normalcy, behavior will move in that direction as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Savi Syth.\nSaviSyth: Matt, this will be tied to your response to Brandon. But about 2, 3 years ago, I think, in the face of higher fuel you did more of kind of day of week pruning during the shoulder months. And if we compare 2019, I think there's more Tuesday went tiling in September this year. Is that a shift in philosophy here given that you're expecting kind of normal seasonality into September?\nMattKlein: Yes. Thanks, Avi. So on a -- I think on a mix basis, we do have a little bit more Tuesday, Wednesday as a percentage of overall flying. We are still doing pull-downs on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. I think there's some Saturday pull down going on there as well. It's that's actually, I think, a little bit more of a reflection that a couple of years ago, we felt like we might have pulled a little bit too much on the off-peaks is really what it was. It's not really anything more than that.\nSaviSyth: And then just if I had a follow-up to Mike's response to Mike, on the international market. Just wondering if there is a change, mix change in terms of leisure and VFR type markets. And also just how are those different type of demand profiles performing recently?\nMattKlein: Right. So I think overall, we probably are leaning a little bit more towards leisure. Some cities like Cancun got a decent amount of service added to them as well. Puerto Rico has more service. And that's always -- there's a lot of VFR and there's a lot of leisure in there so that Puerto Rico definitely runs both ways for us very, very well. For example, what we added yesterday, which will start service later this year into Gusagapla and Honduras, that's going to be largely VFR. So we're constantly just sort of looking for where we think we can drive more VFR traffic because we're uniquely positioned to be able to do that better than anyone else. But we're also going to be very, very focused on leisure destinations and when they come back. I can give you another example like Jamaica. Jamaica had just jurisdictional requirements that were different than other leisure destinations. And as those got relaxed, we saw safe, for example, Montego Bay come back pretty strong. And we'll see the same thing in Puntacana. So it's -- I don't think at any given time, we're saying to ourselves, hey, let's push up VFR more than leisure or vice versa. We think we do great in both our cost structure allows us to do well in both. So we're just looking for the next best opportunity to continue to add to that network.\nOperator: Next question from Chris Stathoulopoulos.\nChrisStathoulopoulos: So just going back to the earlier question around what feels like a sort of late return, if you will, to pre-pandemic margins with the 2023 targets. So I just want to understand here how much of this is what you can and can't control and push, if you will? So if demand comes back stronger than expected, variant risk subsides, non-ticket piece continues to perform well and fuel goes the right way. Is there an opportunity to excel accelerate, excuse me, that margin trajectory?\nTedChristie: Well, the Chris. Absolutely. If demand recovers faster than what we're expecting today that would be a contributing factor, 100%. And probably, in reality, outstrips any kind of like benefit we could get about running the airline faster to its peak. So a good move in demand would have a positive view on that. We are -- we have our kind of our case out there is what we're anticipating. And hopefully, we're right or it's better than that. The -- on the flip side of the -- or on the second side of the ledger as it relates to costs, and I can just kind of alluded to it, we're moving the engine pretty quick right now. Not only did we have to retrain or get everyone back to back current for anyone who had taken leaves over the course of the pandemic. But during the pandemic, we took delivery of airplanes, and we're continuing to take delivery of airplanes over the next 5 years. And so we have to hire and train all those crews. We have to select all the routes we want to fly to. We have to negotiate with the airports. We have to get our station contract vendors in place. We have to do all of the logistics associated with making that happen. And so the team is working very hard on making that happen as quickly as they can. So I don't know that there's a lot of flexibility for us from a utilization perspective around the edges probably so. But I think our target of hitting where we want to be by the kind of late spring, early summer of next year feels right to us right now.\nChrisStathoulopoulos: Okay. And then my follow-up, I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned some challenges on pushing yields in some of the off-hour markets. I just -- could you comment on the fair dynamic generally speaking, what you're seeing to some of your peers? And if there's any notable areas of strength or weakness?\nMattKlein: Yes, Chris, this is Matt. So the -- what we call the floor level, sort of the lowest price points you see in markets, the floors, and this is a very encouraging sign. The floors are higher now than they were before -- even before the summer started or say, late spring into summer. So those floor levels, the lowest levels in the market are higher. That's a general statement across the board. So that's a very encouraging development. And I would say what's also encouraging. Now while yes, it is definitely going to be true that we're going to have what we anticipate, I should say, to be some challenges on say, off-peak days of week. That's something that we fully expect. When demand is fully back is when we expect all of that to sort of work itself out. And as Ted just alluded to, we're thinking that will take into, say, spring, summer of next year for demand to be fully back. Until then, there's just going to be a question as to what happens, I think, from the overall industry ecosystem in terms of corporate travel and how much corporate travel is out there. And we don't necessarily take a lot of corporate travel, but we do get a lot of business, a decent amount of business travel from, say, small- and medium-sized businesses, do like saving money and flying on us to get their high value when they fly. I wouldn't necessarily say that we're seeing any pockets of significant concern or weakness. Right now, I think it's just across the board. The low end of the fare structure is higher. What we don't know is once we get through the summer and past the Labor Day period, will we see some of that come down a little bit for, say, 6 or 8 weeks until we get to Thanksgiving. And really, that's no different than any other year. I think as we know, the base is still a little bit lower than we would like it to be. But we don't anticipate there to be any kind of abnormal seasonality trade that would occur, say, versus prior years. Just take 2020 out, for example, and go back a few years. It happens every year, we would anticipate that to be normal, and then we'll see yields stretch back up even in the off-peak once we get into Thanksgiving, Christmas and then into next year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Conor Cunningham\nConorCunningham: So yes, you made a lot of new route announcements. I'm just trying to get a sense for how you're thinking about planning 2022 and 2023. It just seems you're going to have with growth kind of resuming, it seems like you're going to have an elevated new market as a percent of total. So just curious how you're thinking about balancing that in 2022 and 2023 specifically? I know you're not -- nothing has announced that, but just how you're thinking about planning for that going forward?\nMattKlein: Sure, Conor. So as you can anticipate, or imagine there's some details I'm not going to share to answer that question. But I can tell you that we expect certainly in 2022, that around 20%, maybe 20% to 30% of the most of our growth will be sort of in new cities that we're not in today. So we're going to be growing, say, mid-teens capacity, we expect, say, 20% of that growth to be in new cities or new routes connecting dots. So it's not something where we think we're going to be overstretching the network into so much more growth that we won't be able to manage on the RASM side.\nConorCunningham: Okay. Good. And then on Miami. I know it's a complement to Fort Lauderdale right now. But are you looking really well. Are you just concerned that Miami may cannibalize on some level?\nMattKlein: So no, we're not anticipating Miami is going to be cannibalizing for Lauderdale. We want to grow and continue to grow our South Florida presence. The cost structure change at the airport, really gave us the opportunity to go in there. And you can see by the launch -- the size of the launch over the course of a couple of months, how excited we are about being able to now serve Miami and serve it well. In terms of the future, we'll just kind of see how things play out. We need to absorb what we're adding. And if things go according to plan, that will open us up to be able to do some more over time. But we're going to be deliberate and we're going to be pragmatic in our approach. And I anticipate we'll be moving some things around as time goes on and then seasonality will come into play. And then we'll see maybe seasonally, you'd see more or less depending on what's happening. But we expect a good launch. We're excited for it, and we expect to be able to grow that over time.\nOperator: Next question from Catherine O'Brien.\nCatherineO\u2019Brien: So with non-ticket reaching record levels and another record expected for next quarter. Can you just, maybe this to Matt, can you help us frame what part of that growth versus pre-pandemic levels is driven by either new products or merchandising capabilities? Just trying to understand maybe like what part of that relative performance versus far is maybe those items being a little bit inelastic? And what is new that wasn't there in '19?\nMattKlein: Sure. I'd say -- so I do say the $2.85 improvement that we saw versus a couple of years ago in that rate, well over half of that is what we're basically just better at doing today than we were a couple of years ago. And that's very encouraging because as the quarter went on, things got better and better as we went through the quarter. And that's why we have confidence in setting another record this quarter. So it's a continuation of being able to just revenue manage the products in a better way. And in terms of new products, we have enhanced our bundled services offering. So we now have another version of that that's been very popular with our guests to add on to their trips. So that's something that's new. And then as time goes on, we relaunched our loyalty program earlier this year. We're seeing pretty good traction with that, moving along relatively right on top of what we thought the what we thought we would see this year as it ramps up. And as we come out of the pandemic and the timing of when we come out of the pandemic is always sort of a subjective answer. But as we come out of it, we do anticipate we'll see continued improvement and growth of adoption of our new credit card program in conjunction with the loyalty program improvements overall.\nCatherineO\u2019Brien: And then maybe just based on what your operation could handle smoothly and also your outlook on staffing. Could you just help us think through the upper bounds of fleet growth for next year, of course, depending on demand? And maybe very high level, what that MAX level incremental aircraft could apply for capacity?\nMattKlein: Catherine. So we put out a fleet plan on the website. So you'll be able to see what we're looking at for 2022, probably going to be around 24 aircraft is what we're looking at today that will target us for mid-teens growth for '22. On a sort of aircraft neutral -- or sorry, really growth rate. On an aircraft basis, it's about that mid-teens. So that's what we're targeting. And like I said before, it's probably going to continue in the near term, so 23, 24, I think in mid-teens growth, too. So you'll see that click along.\nCatherineO\u2019Brien: Does that -- do those 24 aircraft from the fleet plan, does that include the incremental aircraft you're looking at the RFPs out on?\nMattKlein: It does, yes. So we have an order book of Airbus that's around 17 or so directly from Airbus, and there'll be an incremental 7 less or direct operating leases.\nOperator: Our next question from Dan McKenzie.\nDanielMcKenzie: A couple of questions here. First is on growth versus the sustainability of the sub-6 CASM ex field that you're targeting next year. And I guess the question is, can you potentially leverage scale over the coming 1 to 2 years in a way that you couldn't in 2019? And should we be thinking about the sub-6, pardon me, target as the cost paradigm over the coming cycle here?\nScottHaralson: Well, I'll start. This is Scott, way. So -- and then Ted and others can chime in. But I think we're targeting -- the mid-teens growth rate is around a few things. Obviously, the opportunity set, we think, is vast. And that's one of the drivers of our desire to grow. But the component around mid-teens is as much logistics as it is anything. And so I think it'd be very difficult for us to grow at a much faster rate, just given the supply chain issues and the amount of throughput we would need from crew real estate and all the other components to getting the aircraft even to grow much faster. But growth is dilutive. I mean, so if we were to grow faster, that would have a dilutive effect on CASM -- But I think it's a multipronged approach around how we think about growth. So I think we feel like mid-teens is probably the right number for us at this point.\nDanielMcKenzie: And then if you could remind us, what are the return metrics you're holding that growth to? And over what time frame? And then I guess related to this, when you had competitive responses historically, how long does it typically take for those responses to unwind?\nScottHaralson: Yes. I'll start, and Matt can chime in. But our sort of marching mantra has been mid-teens growth and mid-teens margins, and nothing's really changed that.\nMattKlein: Yes. And I guess, as far as the competition question, I can wax philosophical here first. We -- there has been a lot that we've been told over the years about what happens with our airline. Strong corporate travel is good for us. High fuel is bad for us, high fuel is good for us. And in all of those instances, and in my 9 years here, we've experienced every single 1 of those environments, we've delivered mid-teens margins or better with growth. And so it is our expectation that we will navigate through whatever the competitive environment will look like, we will navigate through whatever the fuel environment will look like. We'll deliver sub-6 CASM ex and we're going to do it with mid-teens growth. And we're very excited about our prospects at doing so and delivering the returns that we expect for our shareholders.\nDeAnneGabel: James, I'm told we have one more person in the queue. We can go ahead and finish with our last question, please.\nOperator: The question is from Joseph DeNardi.\nJosephDeNardi: Ted, maybe just on the 2023 margin target, what's the assumption for CASM ex, like what it will be then to get there? And then what's the assumption around kind of what you can get nonticket to by that point?\nTedChristie: Yes. So the group is not going to be happy with me if I start throwing targets out there in 2023, but let's just recap. We expect it will be below $0.06 by the time we hit our run rate in mid-2022. And the objective around here is to get our unit cost and our efficiency as best as we can. So both of those things, and I would expect that to carry into 2023, by the way. And non-ticket, we just set a record this quarter. And I remember starting here saying, can you get to $60? Well, we're basically right on top of it now. And we're going to continue to kind of put targets out there that we're hopeful that we can attain. We have instituted real technology and process here that's improving our ability to manage the products. And as Matt just alluded to in a prior answer, we also haven't really added all the products that we intend to add, mostly because of COVID. We've been delayed a little bit. Our loyalty program was delayed from where we originally wanted it to be deployed. Our ability to sell packaged vacation products is not where we want it to be today. And those things, combined with the continued momentum we're seeing, I think, is a non-ticket tailwind across the board. So we anticipate nonticket to continue to move up. So I think those are 2 very positive stories heading into 2023 from a margin perspective. How the demand environment shakes out over that period of time is still a But we -- as I just said earlier, we've navigated through those periods and done quite well.\nJosephDeNardi: Okay. And then, Scott, is the trajectory kind of into 2023, is CASM ex down growing mid-teens? Or I think there was some uncertainty around that kind of pre-COVID, what are your thoughts at this point?\nScottHaralson: Joe, so we haven't guided obviously with 2023 yet. But as Ted mentioned and I've talked about before, reaching sub-6 by 2023, And then the decisions we make around what aircraft we take, give it through '21, 19, how we get rid of the age fleet, how we finance them, those kinds of decisions will drive a large part of where CASM is up, and we're not ready to fully make that call yet. So what our plan is or our goal is to manage costs through a flattish sort of view. And that may take a few puts and takes here and there. but that's the idea. We'll see how we're able to do that over time and how long that will last. But this sort of 6-ish CASM plus or minus is probably what it's going to look like. if we can drive some efficiencies then be a little bit below, if we have some inflationary components that bias, I might be a little higher, but that's probably what our run rate CASM is for the sort of medium term.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We'll tent you next time.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is James and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to DeAnne Gabel, Senior Director, Investor Relations. DeAnne, you may begin. \nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, James, and welcome, everyone, to Spirit Airlines' first quarter earnings call. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call will be archived on our website for 60 days. Presenting on today's call are Ted Christie, Spirit's Chief Executive Officer; Matt Klein, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Scott Haralson, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us on the call today are other members of our senior leadership team. Following our prepared remarks there will be a question-and-answer session for the sell-side analysts. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our first quarter 2021 earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. Ted, I now turn the call over to you.\nTed Christie: Thanks, DeAnne. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I've had the pleasure of visiting several of our stations recently. And once again, I am proud to see the well-orchestrated coordination between team members. Together with the rest of the Spirit team, we once again delivered strong operational results. For the first quarter, completion factor was 98.6% and our on-time performance was 85.3%, an excellent result all around. As we enter the next phase of recovery, thanks to the contributions of all our team members, we are well positioned to capture the many opportunities that lie ahead of us. The first quarter started slowly, but as demand dramatically improved during the last few weeks of March, we were very pleased with how the domestic network performed and how the international network results progressed, driving positive cash from operations for the full first quarter 2021 even when excluding the payroll support funds received. Our Florida routes saw particular strength during this period, as the typically strong spring break period was further supplemented by pent-up demand for leisure travel. Assuming the current trends continue, we believe we can achieve a positive adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year 2021. The leisure travel demand recovery has taken root. There may still be some bumps ahead, but as vaccines are more widely available, case counts abate and travel restrictions ease, Spirit is stronger than ever and well prepared to bring our low fares to more places and offer more guests the opportunity to travel. With that, I'll turn it over to Matt and Scott to discuss more details of our quarterly performance.\nMatt Klein: Thanks, Ted. I echo Ted's thanks to the team for doing a great job. Even as loads increase and airports get busier, our guest satisfaction scores remain higher than ever. We are committed to excellent service, while providing the best value in the sky and maintaining our industry-leading low-cost structure. Earlier this month, we named Lania Rittenhouse as our Vice President of Guest Experience and Brands, furthering our commitment and focus to improve our guests' experience on the ground and in the air. Lania has served as our Vice President of In-flight Experience since December 2015 and has been a key contributor to our improving guest satisfaction metrics since joining Spirit. We are delighted to have Lania take on this new role. Turning to our first quarter results. Demand in January and February suffered, as many jurisdictions were faced with another wave of the pandemic. In addition, about 12% of our network was negatively impacted by the new testing requirements for inbound U.S. itineraries. However, March brought better performance across the network and the second half of March came in much stronger than we had initially anticipated. Load factor for the first quarter averaged 72.1%, but the last two weeks of March averaged well over 80%, with many days flirting with 90%. Total operating revenue in the first quarter declined 40.2% year-over-year on a capacity decline of 26.9% year-over-year. Although the sequential change from peak December to off-peak January and February was greater than usual this year as COVID-19 case counts had spiked again, we were encouraged by the steady improvement in operating yields and TRASM throughout the quarter even as we continue to add back more capacity. For the March quarter, fare revenue per segment remained significantly depressed down 24.2% year-over-year. Non-ticket revenue per segment continue to show relative strength decreasing only 10.8% year-over-year. As has been the case since the start of the pandemic, non-ticket revenue per segment for the first quarter was impacted by the suspension or reduction of certain booking-related fees. However, as the quarter progressed and domestic and international demand strengthened non-ticket revenue per segment began to improve significantly as well. Furthermore, non-ticket rate for April has rebounded strongly and we can see a path to a second quarter non-ticket rate that is all the way back to flat compared to the second quarter of 2019. Moving ahead to the second quarter outlook. International demand has stabilized and both our leisure and VFR international markets are doing relatively well. Florida remains strong and as restrictions ease in other domestic jurisdictions we are seeing balanced strength across the network with search and booking trends for the summer looking very solid. Regarding future capacity given the extreme pulldown in operations for 2020, we believe it is helpful to compare 2021 estimates to 2019. Compared to the same periods in 2019, we anticipate capacity in the second quarter will be down about 5.5% with April down 11%, May down 3% and June down 2%. For the full year 2021, we estimate capacity will be about flat on a year over two-year basis. Given some of the skewed comparisons, I want to clarify our capacity plans for the next several years. Our base plan assumes capacity for the full year 2022 will be up about 30% compared to 2021. In 2023, the year-over-year growth rates should normalize back to our typical 14% to 17% compounded annual growth rate. Scott will add a bit of color surrounding our ASM targets and aircraft delivery stream updates in his prepared remarks. In closing, I'd like to add that the revenue recovery has been bumpy as we had anticipated. However, the momentum we're seeing is strong and continues to prove out our low-cost business model is alive and thriving. Our progress on non-ticket production is 100% back on track and peak travel periods are finally starting to see some yield firming. Our network opportunities continue to grow. The early numbers on our new cities starting in May and June are encouraging and we are looking forward to full airplanes and continued revenue improvements this summer throughout the rest of 2021 and into 2022 and beyond. And now here's Scott. \nScott Haralson: Thanks Matt. It certainly feels good and I'll start talking about a return of demand and an eventual return to profitability. I'm proud of how our team has rallied throughout the crisis and has handled the adversity in such a professional manner. I know they are excited to see where things are headed. Now turning to our first quarter 2021 financial performance. Our adjusted net loss was $243 million, or a loss of $2.48 per share. Our EBITDA margin for the first quarter was negative 43.3%, which was better than our initial guide of negative 45% to negative 55%. Both revenue and non-fuel operating expenses came in at the better end of our implied guide. A stronger demand environment in the back half of March improved margins for the first quarter and provided a nice platform to think about a return to positive EBITDA at some point in the second quarter. Now for the balance sheet. While we obviously had a number of ins and outs, we started the first quarter with $1.9 billion in liquidity and we also ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in liquidity, which includes unrestricted cash short-term investments and the undrawn amount available under our revolving credit facility. During March, we finalized an amendment to our revolving credit facility extending the due date from March 2022 to March 2024 and increasing our lending commitment by $60 million bringing the total lending commitments to $240 million. The additional $60 million remains undrawn. We also received a total of $184.5 million during the quarter related to PSP2. We have been notified by Treasury that we will be receiving approximately $28 million of additional funds under PSP2 that will be received in the second quarter. In addition under PSP3 we now expect to receive about $198 million during the second quarter as well. This will bring our total received under the Payroll Support Programs to just over $750 million. Regarding our fleet, during the first quarter, we took delivery of two direct leased A320neo aircraft. We ended the first quarter with 159 aircraft in our fleet. By the end of the first quarter, we had 12 of our 31 A319s back into service and we expect to have about 20 in service by the end of the second quarter. During the quarter, we completed a purchase of two A319s off-lease. This was a quick developing transaction and was not contemplated in our previous CapEx guidance. We have also elected to reaccelerate our seat replacement program. With these changes, our new total capital expenditure estimate for 2021 is now between $220 million to $250 million. When we placed our fleet order in late 2019, we knew the order would not fill our entire capacity need, particularly in the early years. Since then, we have been able to move a few deliveries around to plug some of the holes in our delivery stream. During the first quarter, we accelerated six deliveries from 2025 and 2026 into 2023. There's a modest increase in PDPs for 2021 driven by these accelerations. We will also be looking to secure a few additional 2022 and 2023 deliveries most likely from lessor capacity to fund our targeted 14% to 17% capacity growth target. Now for our forward-looking guidance. We estimate our EBITDA margin for the second quarter will range between negative 5% to breakeven. This assumes total operating expenses will be between $885 million and $895 million assuming a fuel price per gallon of $1.95. Assuming D&A of about $74 million, the implied revenue range based on this guide is $782 million to $811 million. And while the booking trends have been encouraging, it is still difficult to predict with precision where demand unit revenues and profitability will end up. But given all of that, it is likely that we will get to positive EBITDA territory by mid to late Q2 and positive EPS at some point this summer. For the full year, we will likely be negative on a net margin basis, but we do expect to be positive on EBITDA margin for the full year, despite the rough start early in the year. As we look out further into the future, our base case for capacity for 2022 will be between 54 billion to 56 billion ASMs and 2023 will be between 62 billion to 65 billion ASMs. On our last call, I talked about our CASM ex estimates for the airline will be below $0.06, once we get the airline back to full utilization around the middle of 2022. To reiterate, this CASM ex level is based on these levels of capacity. And as I mentioned on the last call as well, how far below $0.06 we get will depend on few decisions we will make over the next 12 to 24 months. From a profitability standpoint, we expect we will be at or above our 2019 operating margin in 2023. In closing, we are pleased to see the first quarter close on a stronger note than we had anticipated. We remain committed to our goal to get the airline ready for full production by the summer of next year. Our focus in the near term is to bring our parked aircraft back into service and get our crew levels ready to run the full airline, both while maintaining our reliable operations and we're right on track to do just that. With that I'll hand it back to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks, Scott. Since February, we have been busy on the hiring front and I'm excited to welcome all our new team members and to progress in our efforts to restore the airline to full utilization. While we acknowledge that the recovery is still in progress and may not be linear, we are very encouraged by the improvements we are seeing in the demand environment throughout our network. In addition, our guest satisfaction is high, operations are running smoothly and our team remains focused on driving efficiencies throughout the business. Combine all that with an extremely dedicated and motivated Spirit team and we are well positioned for the future, which gives me confidence that we will be among the first US carriers to reach sustained profitability. With that back to DeAnne. \nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, Ted. James, we are now ready to take questions from the analysts. [Operator Instructions] \nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Mike Linenberg. \nMike Linenberg: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I guess, Scott, I just -- it's one accounting question. I know you've sort of given EBITDA targets and I think you mentioned that by 2023, I think you said that, the plan is for EBIT to be at or above 2019. Did I hear that right, that it was EBIT? \nScott Haralson: That's right, Mike, operating margin. \nMike Linenberg: Great. So just a question on when we think about -- I know that there was an accounting change in -- I think the last year or two with respect to how gains on -- tied to sale leasebacks are accounted for. Now do you run that through operating expense or do you run that through non-op? \nScott Haralson: I'm assuming you're talking about the accounting for leases? \nMike Linenberg: Yes. \nScott Haralson: Yes, that still runs through operating expenses through aircraft rent. Yes, we were about\u2026\nMike Linenberg: So when you take a gain on the sale leaseback you just run it through against the rental? \nScott Haralson: You're talking -- sorry, you're talking about the gain on the sale leaseback? Yes, sorry. \nMike Linenberg: Yes. So I know in the past, I think it was amortized against -- you take that gain and you'd amortize it against the aircraft rent. I think now it's moved to operating expense or other operating expense. \nScott Haralson: Yes, that flows through the rent line. \nMike Linenberg: Okay. Okay. Great. And then just sort of related \u2013 okay. So then, that you answered my question. That's all I needed to know. Thank you.\nScott Haralson: All right. Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question from Savi Syth. \nSavi Syth: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Matt, just -- I'm trying to understand this a little bit more. Some of your competitors have talked about leisure fares reaching 2019 levels this summer. If kind of leisure fares remain kind of flat with 2019 for the rest of the year, does that mean yield should be flat at Spirit, or does kind of the lack of corporate demand kind of create some fare bucket mix impact there? \nMatt Klein: Well, thanks Savi. I'm not sure, I 100% understand your question. I understand the first part about it of leisure fares with some of our competitors are talking about this summer. And we do anticipate to see some strength this summer from a yield perspective. But I'm not sure I follow completely about how corporate comes into play. \nSavi Syth: And that's what I guess I'm wondering is, if there is corporate demand that's not really there, does that really impact your yields because you don't really fly corporate, or does it have an impact because maybe the fare buckets are a little bit different because you have more capacity going after leisure? \nMatt Klein: Okay. Great. Thanks, Savi. I understand your question better. Yes. So, overall as we talked about it, I know you know this, it's just about supply and demand. So at the end of the day, we'll have to see exactly how the capacity matches up. It's definitely going to be different by region that's out there. We're seeing strength now. We do participate. Usually it's more like the fall fourth quarter, first quarter when there's more convention traffic out there. We do carry some of that traffic as people do tend to book a little bit further out on that and they're looking for the best rates they can find.  But generally speaking, we're not in that corporate world. If your question is related to less corporate traffic means less demand for some of my competitors then we'll just have to see how that capacity flows through the network overall. What we are encouraged by is our ability to see in peak periods that some amounts of yield management we're able to deploy, which is a nice break from where we were as recently as say six weeks ago.  So that's what's the most encouraging to us now. And we're able to deploy more yield management and not seeing a falloff in bookings at the same time, which is exactly what we hope to be seeing for the summer and we're starting to see that occur as early as June and into the July period. \nSavi Syth: Makes sense. Thank you for that, Matt. And just maybe a clarification to you, just you mentioned the peak to offpeak drop-off in January, February was a little bit bigger. How are peaks, offpeaks kind of performing now? Because I'm guessing you're seeing some offpeaks in 2Q as well. Is that similar to kind of prior or is there a bigger variance there? \nMatt Klein: No, it's definitely stronger now. So, the trough in January and February was exaggerated for sure. Like, for example, May is typically -- I mean it's an okay month, it's a shoulder month. And we're not seeing anywhere near the kind of demand falloff that we saw in January and February. We expect to have relatively strong load factors throughout the entire second quarter. The yields aren't as strong in May as they would have -- as they were, say, over spring break and Easter, but that's totally expected and that's what you'd expect to see. So, from a revenue management perspective, it's nice to see some semblance of seasonality also creeping back into the revenue management world. And that's just because it's -- you can plan better and you can make better risk decisions when you have an idea that seasonality is starting to trend back to normal.\nSavi Syth: Helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Klein: Certainly.\nOperator: And our next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Just with respect to spooling back up, as you recall crews and employees, is everyone showing up that you expect to show up? Are you having any trouble finding folks? Are there any friction points in spooling back up that you could point to?\nTed Christie: Thanks, Duane. The good news is no. We've been able to get people back through the training machine I guess, as well as do new hiring. As is the case countrywide, in lower wage type categories, there is a pinch for -- I think, for overall people. So, you're finding that more at airports and places like that, where there's a lot of demand for those types of jobs. I'm talking about macro. But we found that our ability to attract pilots, flight attendants, technicians, all that stuff has been very favorable actually.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, great. And then, just with respect to the kind of more specific or more explicit longer-term growth plans. Is this new or is this sort of as the plan was contemplated? And I guess from the perspective not that you've given a sort of full year cost guidance, but is there cost pressures we should be thinking about as you look to execute this growth plan into 2022 and 2023? And thanks for taking the questions.\nTed Christie: Sure. Well, let me cover the forward-looking growth stuff, and Scott can comment on how we've used costs, although he mentioned somewhat in the prepared remarks. But, I think given the ins and outs of the drawdown in the airline, the weird year-over-year comparisons, the two-year comparisons, we wanted to just make sure we were clear on what our growth expectations were going forward. The answer to your question is not new. We've been consistently saying that we intend to resume our growth trajectory of the mid-teens, which this is consistent with by the way the numbers we talked about in our script. So, I just want to make sure that we had full understanding of how that plays out from a growth perspective. Scott, you want to provide any additional color on what that means for cost?\nScott Haralson: Yes, Duane. I think the point of what we were trying to do was to give some detail around that, because I know some of the numbers we had put out around our fleet and the order book and it's kind of filling in the gaps and some of the changes that we've had to the fleet, have been a little confusing. So, we wanted to just go ahead and put that out there and to reiterate the fact that the capacity that we were talking about here, was already contemplated when we talked about our CASM ex sub-six numbers. So, this has been in the works. It's more clarification than anything new. We've just heard that there has been some discomfort around not understanding what our numbers are going to look like from a capacity perspective. So it's just a clarification.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Got it. And then, maybe just one follow-up there. If you think about the level of OpEx that's running through today, what are you sized for today? In other words, are you sized for 10% 20% bigger than 2019 today, or are you going to sort of staff up to hit early 2022 growth expectations? And thanks for these detailed answers.\nScott Haralson: Yes. Duane, that's a great question. It's a little bit of both. Right now, we have 319s that we're bringing out of the desert. And so, we're flying probably about an equivalent number of aircraft as we did in 2019, probably around 140-ish aircraft. And so, we have a crew level that is pretty similar. And -- but we're going to have to hire a large number of crew between now and the end of the year because the fleet will grow from an operated fleet from 140 to the end of the year, we'll have 173-ish aircraft. So that's a pretty quick additional aircraft plus bringing the aircraft back on to service So that sort of infrastructure component is what, we're talking about when we mentioned it on the last call of about a $30 million number of additional expense which is going to be maintenance and getting crew flight attendants and pilots and some mechanics back into the fold, so that we can handle the aircraft level by the end of the year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jamie Baker. \nJamie Baker: Hi, good morning everyone. At the end of 2019, I don't know how granular your profit plan for 2022 was, but I assume you at least had something penciled in. Is your current 2022 forecast suggest higher lower or the same pretax income as what you were thinking pre COVID? \nTed Christie: I'll give it a word Jamie, it's Ted. I think the answer is lower because we're still in the midst of a recovery. And we still anticipate that the airline won't reach as Scott has said full utilization until the -- call it the second quarter somewhere in there, but really the later part of that. So there's a drag on fixed expense because of that. So you've got the mix of a recovering revenue story and the airline getting back to the size. I think those are both probably net-net negatives to what the story would have been in 2019 versus what we see today in 2022. \nScott Haralson: Yes. I would totally agree with that Jamie. And I think another way that we're sort of looking at it is taking 2019 and really pegging a future date that we expect to get to a run rate which our sort of run rate period is probably 2023, but there's a lot of water in '22. So really sort of bookending sort of 2019 and '23. And then beyond '23 is we're back to a sort of status quo. But that period between now and probably '23 is murky. It could be a range of outcomes. \nJamie Baker: Got it. That's helpful. And second so I was recently reviewing your schedule and obviously there've been a fair amount of sort of new market gyrations and changes in the last year. But overall, I would characterize Spirit as an airline that once it decides to enter a new market, it most likely sticks with said market for a measurable period of time. Is that a fair representation? And if so, why is that your decision? I mean is there a downside to churning markets more quickly the way that some other low-cost airlines do? \nMatt Klein: Hey Jamie, it's Matt. Yes. We believe the answer to your question is yes there's a downside to churning markets like that. Now -- but let me clarify it. Yes, once we announced we're going into a city we spend a great deal of time making those determinations and calls and spend a lot of time researching the city making sure it fits our long-term network plan and growth strategy. Once we're in the city, we will then see not every market always works right out of the gate for us. So if we go into a new city announce 5, 6 new routes, if one of them isn't performing we're not going to be stubborn about it and just sit there with it. We will then redeploy capacity and find what the right routes are for us in that city. But generally speaking, we're of the opinion that you make the call you go into the city and there's a long-term intention to be there. \nJamie Baker: Okay. Got it. Okay, very interesting. Thanks everybody. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question from Hunter Keay. \nHunter Keay: Good mronign everybody. The EBIT margin on '23 that's a big number and I'm assuming you're talking about that in reference to the 13.5% margin you did in 2019. So, the question is, is TRASM above $0.092? Is CASM ex below $0.055 or is it fuel? \nScott Haralson: Hey Hunter, this is Scott. So I'll answer part of it you guys could chime in. But yes, that's right. It's around 13.5% is the baseline for 2019. I think there's a couple, of points in there. One is that we've talked about our CASM ex-number being sub-sox. So that would imply some TRASM appreciation. And we think that's there and Matt can talk about some of the details around that. But, it's also a lower fuel number than in 2019 assumption as well.\nTed Christie: And I'll add the fuel number is a mix of potentially the forward curve, but also more importantly burn.\nHunter Keay: Right, it's right, okay. Thank you. And then, Matt, why did you change the name of the $9 Fare Club? And Thomas, did you have an opinion on that decision?\nMatt Klein: Thanks Hunter. $9 Fare Club definitely had brand recognition and name recognition. However, the Spirit Saver$ Club, we feel, as we revamped, the overall loyalty program and how all the programs worked together, we thought it was more encompassing of the overall sort of brand value that we give to people. And it's not just about -- the Saver$ Club isn't just about getting a fare, it's about saving overall and how the Saver$ Club has big benefits to ancillary revenue sales as well, for the guests and that translates into revenue for us.\nScott Haralson: And since he's not going to say anything, I'll just say, Thomas always has an opinion on these kind of things since, you know him.\nHunter Keay: Yeah. Well, I mean, the question was really about the DOT rulemaking, of course. And it's really an embedded question about, sort of your expectation on the unfair deceptive practices? And how this -- the branding of that might fold in. But we can save that for another time unless you want to chime in on it Thomas. I guess that's a no. All right.\nScott Haralson: Yeah.\nHunter Keay: Thank you.\nScott Haralson: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question from Helane Becker.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator and hi everybody. Thank you very much for your time. Just two questions here. As you've taken more leased aircraft, are you having to also do maintenance reserves or are the lessors at this point comfortable with your balance sheet and your track record that you don't have to don't have to account for those?\nScott Haralson: Hi, Helane, this is Scott. Yeah, we have not had any leases with maintenance reserves since 2013, 2014. So, no maintenance reserves for us.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then, the ones on balance sheet can you recapture that cash?\nScott Haralson: We generally do that in a couple of ways. Obviously the reserves are meant to be recouped once you do the maintenance. So that's generally how that cash comes back to us. But we have also through the years, renegotiated and extended some of the leases. And in that we will typically have a discussion around what to do with maintenance reserves and a large majority of those would generally get those back with an extension.\nHelane Becker: Got you. Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question from Catherine O'Brien.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. Can you -- with the strength you've seen in non-ticket per passenger throughout the pandemic, these products they've driven a higher proportion of total fare than they have historically. Do you expect to see this trend continue, or with maybe some of the positive commentary we've gotten over this -- the first part earnings season from some of your competitors on yields this summer is that more likely to normalize back towards 50-50, we've seen historically? So your thoughts there would be helpful.\nMatt Klein: Yes. Sure, Catherine, it's Matt. And thanks for the question. So we do expect, we will see yield firming on the fare. That will take some time to get all the way back. Between now and then, it's hard to predict exactly when Zen is going to be when the ticket yields are all the way back. There's a lot that goes into that the supply-demand environment being of course the largest factor there. So for a period of time, we will anticipate that non-ticket production will be stronger than the ticket yield. But that's not necessarily -- that's not the long-term design. We would expect things to come back to 50-50, in a more normal environment. And really we've always said that we feel like there's more room on the ticket yield to improve as well. And non-ticket will continue to go up. We're back on track there. And we anticipate we'll start to resume our march upwards on non-ticket over time in a very methodical pragmatic way. The ticket yields will catch up. And one of the things, how that can happen is through network deployment and how we think about the network. And unfortunately the pandemic caused lots of issues across the entire world and especially for our industry. One of the things that we talked about pre-pandemic was how we were going to think about our network moving forward and capitalize on our strengths and continue to build on our strengths and think about that a little bit differently than we had in the past. So we didn't get to deploy that plan. That is our anticipation moving forward, which is why we're continuing to think strongly about Latin America and the Caribbean and how we think about our strengths in Florida, Las Vegas, California, New York where leisure travelers want to go. And as we build upon that strength, we'd anticipate the upward ability for ticket yields to not just come all the way back to 50/50 with non-ticket, but eventually get back higher than 50/50 over time. That might take a couple of years from where we are today but we do anticipate we can get there through network deployment.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, very interesting. Thanks. And maybe just a follow-up related to the network and capacity decisions. With legacy carriers just allocating more capacity to nontraditional leisure routes for them at least for the short-term here and some new low-cost service entering the market, like, how does that impact your overall just what level of capacity you're adding back and maybe some of your route decisions? Does that factor in and if it does help? Thanks so much for the time.\nMatt Klein: Yeah, sure. So the answer to your question is yes, of course, we're taking a look at what's going on out in the network overall. Where we think there's good ideas it's -- we're not -- we don't have a monopoly on good ideas. Other airlines can clearly do analysis and think about what they think are good ideas as well. It doesn't bother us. We know where we think we can grow. I think the new cities that we're adding we're making it clear I think that we believe we're strong to Florida, Las Vegas, California all the leisure destinations that are out there. And that's where you're going to see us grow. And we will continue to add new dots on the map that we think connect well to those places. We did have a little bit of a hiccup in our international network, solely because of the international inbound testing requirement. So we redeployed some capacity in the latter part of the first quarter and into the second quarter. In fact we took our Latin America and Caribbean capacity down from around say 19%, 20% like it was in the fall, we brought that down to around 15% to 16% in March April timeframe. By June we're back to that same mix of ASMs in Latin America and the Caribbean back up to the 19%, 20% level. So we will move the network around where we think its best and how we think about deployment of capacity. And yes the whole industry is one big ecosystem in a way, but we know that when we go into markets we grow them and that's the most important thing for us in our business model.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. Thanks, Matt.\nMatt Klein: Absolutely.\nOperator: And our next question from Joseph DeNardi.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Good morning. Scott just on the -- I think you said sub-six CASM ex in 2022. Is that for the full year? And then what's the trend for CASM ex after that if you're growing 15%? Like is the expectation that CASM ex is down every year after that? I think pre-COVID there was a little bit of pressure on that. So maybe just an updated view there?\nScott Haralson: Yeah. Hey, Joe, so I think the sub-six, we said was going to be a product after we get to full utilization, which we said would happen probably around the middle of 2022. So the sub-six CASM would happen at some point after that once we get the full utilization. And that's really a marker for a full year number. So we'll probably be in that range as we get there in the third quarter, but it's really meant for a full year barometer. Now, obviously, after that we're going to continue to have the inflationary components that are normal for our business. We saw that pre-COVID. Those are not going away. We saw them in wages; we saw it at airports and amortization for us. So those are not going away. But we're going to do what we can to manage those but those are still going to be headwinds. So I would expect the same trend that we were looking at pre-COVID to still be there. It's difficult to say what it will be in 2023 or 2024 but I think that's a good proxy.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, that's helpful. And then Matt, I'm wondering, if you could just talk a little bit about demand stimulation as you see it. Just in the context of there's probably limitless demand to go down to Florida, if the fare is low enough. Can you talk about how sensitive that is like, if your average fare is $50 the market is X, if $50 becomes $45, how much does X go up? Hopefully, you get the point. Just interested in your perspective there.\nMatt Klein: Yeah, you're describing classic elasticity right, Joe?\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes.\nMatt Klein: And we \u2013 yeah, for sure. So every market is going to be a little bit different. So I don't have a really like a rule of thumb to give you, because the size of the market, or the size of the city coming down to Florida, or going anywhere for that matter will matter in that calculation. But what we do know is that, we can stimulate demand and drive load factor that we talked about in the prepared remarks of load factors that we saw. And we're going to see strength in loads throughout the second quarter and the summer. It wouldn't surprise me, if we're at or near the top of load factor for the industry for the foreseeable future. And that's from us being able to do that with our cost structure. And the non-ticket revenue production, while it took a dip in the first quarter, which was really hammered in January and February, and there's a couple of different reasons for that, but the falloff in some of the issues we had with international traffic had an impact. And as that regains its strength and comes back, we start to see that production come back. And when we go into new routes for that matter, we do think about non-ticket versus ticket. So this does come into account in how we think about where we go. Where can we stimulate travel with a low fare, but where do we anticipate the attachment rate for products to be on top of that? That's all part of how we think about it.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. That's helpful. If I could just sneak one more in. Matt, why don't you fly to Hawaii? And where does that rank on kind of the priority list next few years? Thank you.\nTed Christie: Yeah, I can \u2013 I guess Matt's looking at me.\nMatt Klein: I'll hand it over to Ted to answer your question.\nTed Christie: Yeah. So initially, let's start with what we know. Lower 48 Latin America Caribbean the \u2013 as far south as our equipment can go that's the focus of the airline. There's a massive opportunity in that window or that geography. And that's why we are focused there. Up until the introduction of the neo, Hawaii was physically off-limits for Spirit, because we couldn't get there. The airplane now can reach it. But it's as I said earlier, becomes a prioritization discussion. And right now, there's so much opportunity where we live and we know the markets well. It's better for us to stay focused there.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Didora.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So first question for Matt. I guess we're hearing over the course of earnings in the past week or so a lot of airlines adding capacity into the peak periods. And there are more airlines now going after leisure than before. How are you thinking about your revenue management, or are you changing any tactics here in light of all of this, if at all?\nMatt Klein: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. So yes, there is more capacity coming back. We expected this capacity to come back. What's been nice at least for us is, we've been able to deploy more constraint on our revenue management strategies in the peaker periods that are upcoming. And we're very comfortable with the pace of demand that is transacting relative to the constraint that we put in place. It's still \u2013 I wouldn't call it, as strong as we would have hoped to see say for the closing period of late April into May. It's been relatively good compared to where we were a couple of months ago. But we're definitely in a shoulder right now. As we head into the summer, what's been nice is as we said \u2013 as I just said yield management has been able to hold in some cases pretty decent fare levels. Our normal yield management strategy is to pressure test yields and see what we can get relative to the bookings that come in. And then as we've talked about before is generally, I don't care where on the booking curve we get the demand. We just know what we think we can go get from an average fare perspective. So that's been holding. Now, we'll see as we get in closer to the summer, what the closer-in demand looks like. Our anticipation right now is that, it will be relatively strong, and that we'll be able to hold our yield management strategies, especially when we talk about the weekends of the peak periods. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are usually the days where we can drive extra demand, if we have to at lower levels. Generally, that traffic doesn't always just go seven days a week though. So it might go on an off-peak day one direction, peak day in another direction. And that's how we kind of mix the yields together for the best outcome.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Makes sense. And then just I had a follow-up to Hunter's margin question earlier. I guess what gives you the confidence in that PRASM appreciation over the next few years that you talked about, especially when you're growing say almost 50% between now and then? I just don't -- there isn't just a whole lot of precedent for that type of RASM growth in the model, so just curious your thoughts there. \nMatt Klein: Right. So I think its two things. One is, it's, where we're deploying within the network and how we think about development on new routes versus capitalizing on the strengths that we know exist. So, I think that's one piece of it is network deployment. And the second piece of it is, our non-ticket strength and the way we expect non-ticket to very methodically just kind of march up slowly, but surely over time and hold where we are and then keep moving up from there. We've been able to get -- we anticipate, we will be able to get back to flat in the second quarter this year versus 2019. We can see a path to get there. And that is while we're in the pandemic. So, a lot of the strategies and new technologies that we've been able to put in place, we think will set us up well, as we come out of the pandemic as well. And that's on top of just relaunching our new loyalty program and the Saver$ Club rebranding. So there's a lot of different pieces that feed non-ticket that give us confidence in that statement.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Thank you.\nMatt Klein: Certainly.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brandon Oglenski.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Ted, I appreciate the outlook from the team here and definitely a strong one into 2023. But we have a couple more public comps now in the group. And if we look at valuation, it does appear that investors are a little bit skeptical on your ability to execute against that plan. And I guess that's somewhat warranted because, we did have some prior execution issues pre pandemic. So, what can you give the investor base confidence and that the outlook can be achieved in that lessons have been learned from the past?\nTed Christie: Thanks, Brandon. So yes, there are a couple more comps in our space. I don't know that we have enough information to say for sure that there's a premium to valuation because we haven't seen any numbers. There's a market cap discussion, which could be related to a variety of things, which could be balance sheet, could be forward-looking estimates, could be a bunch of stuff. But to get to the heart of your question is, what are we doing to ensure that we are delivering confidence? I think we have 10 years of track record here, as a public company. I think our -- I think, we've shown that we -- while you mentioned for example, we have had operational struggles maybe in 2019. I think, we've proven to ourselves and to the market broadly that those things are behind us. I think, we were starting to enter into a phase of really renewed growth opportunity pre COVID. I was feeling like -- and I think, we were hearing back that our network deployment decisions and the way we were going was very much in line with that. So, the best answer to all of this is execution. It's delivering upon the promise. It's hitting the numbers. And I think our -- at least our history to date has -- gives us credibility and I think we're going to build on that. And we'll worry about the comparisons later because we're focused on being the best airline in the business and I think we're on our way. \nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate that response. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Stathoulopoulos.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, just getting to the topic of yields here in a different way. If you could comment on, what you're seeing on fares now. And if business and long-haul international stays for longer on pause for your competitors, how -- if you could give some color on how you're thinking about managing yields, whether that means more opportunistic on closing yields. And the second question. With the recovery in ASMs here, any color on the cadence of costs or CASM ex? And just remind us what percent of the mix of fixed versus variable costs. And if there's a benchmark as ASMs recover whether that's marginal cost per mile or something else that we can look at here to get a sense of how productive ASMs and costs are being deployed here? Thanks.\nScott Haralson: Hey, Chris, this is Scott. I'll start and then Matt can fill in the first part of your question. I'll talk about cost. So for this year, I mean, we've talked about 2.1. We ended Q1 at about $0.074 from a CASM ex perspective. We've talked about sub six towards the back end of 2022. And so we'll probably see probably a somewhat linear progression between first quarter and the sub six numbers. So we're looking at second quarter, probably in the high 6s. We'll end the year probably in the low 6s and that will trend towards a sub six number in 2022. So I think that's probably the best way to look at it and we've talked a little bit about what that means for beyond that. And from a fixed variable perspective, as we've mentioned before, the best barometer is probably 50-50. But obviously, that moves and we're going to get into technical components, but that fixed variable component moves the closer you get to departure. But if you generally think it about it at a medium-term level, it's around 50-50.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay.\nMatt Klein: Okay. And for the -- your yield management question, Chris, I'll try to restate to make sure I'm getting it right here. But if corporate demand and/or long-haul international takes a little longer to recover then what does that mean in terms of Spirit being able to deploy proper yield management and how we think of yields? There's a couple of different ways to think about that. In the grand scheme of things in the big picture, we want the economy to be all the way back and roaring back which it will. We want that too. So it's just great overall for everyone involved when that occurs. So we are not rooting against these kinds of things at all. We want the economy to rebound. In terms of -- if it takes a little bit longer to recover, we may see that and we talk about that and we're anticipating as we get past the summer into the early parts of fall that's a question mark. And it's not anything that I'm actually really worried about as well. So if we see a little bit of a lull in September or October, maybe not dissimilar to just the normal shoulder period that's fine, because once we get back to Thanksgiving and Christmas and beyond, we'll be back into the heart of leisure peak season and we know we will perform extremely well. And then as we head into 2022, everything will move along fine. So if there's another six or eight week lull post summer, it's not anything we're worried about. And the fact, we're already thinking about that and thinking about how we deploy yield management strategies in the event that occurs. It's nice to be the low-cost provider. We have the ability to stimulate travel and work and use elasticity to our benefit and just get more people on the aircraft and make it through until we get to the holiday periods. So that's the way that we're thinking about it right now.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thank you.\nDeAnne Gabel: James, are there any more questions?\nOperator: No, there are no more questions.\nDeAnne Gabel: Awesome.

DeAnne, you may begin.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, James and welcome everyone to Spirit Airlines fourth quarter earnings call. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call will be archived on our website for 60 days. Presenting on today's call are Ted Christie, Spirit's Chief Executive Officer; Matt Klein, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Scott Haralson, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us on the call today are other members of our senior leadership team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for sell-side analysts. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current expectations, are not a guarantee of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements are included in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude the special items. Please refer to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. With that, I turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks, DeAnne, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As we report the results of the final quarter of the most difficult year in Spirit's history, my thoughts turn first to the resiliency and grit of the Spirit team. My sincerest and humblest thanks to our team members for their contributions throughout the year. They met the challenges of 2020 with a winning attitude and pull together to ensure that Spirit is well positioned for the opportunities ahead. Together, we have built a company with the pillars necessary for success. Our guests have noticed the improvements we have made and others are taking notice as well. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Spirit team on being named to Fortune's 2021 list of the World's Most Admired Companies. Spirit was not just the only ULCC to be named on the list. We are also one of only three U.S. airlines and one of only eight airlines worldwide to be included, a very validating and earned recognition. As we all know, the pandemic had an abrupt and devastating impact on our industry, and 2020 certainly turned out much differently than how it began. But from adversity comes strength, and that's definitely been true for Spirit. I'm very proud of how our team pivoted as needed and came up with solutions to new problems. From the beginning, our top priority was and continues to be the wellbeing of our team members and guests. We quickly moved to adopt enhanced cleaning and sanitization protocols along with many other measures that met or exceeded the CDC guidelines and rules. We redefined how to make tactical changes to our schedule faster and closer to departure than ever before, which has been an asset especially given the choppiness of the recovery. And we did so while delivering strong operational performance. For the full-year 2020, our completion factor was 97.9%, which based on preliminary results earned us a first place ranking among reporting carriers, and our on-time performance was 86.7%, earning us a third place ranking. During 2020, we furthered our commitment to invest in the guests by leveraging technology driven solutions to enhance self-service options. And we also launched an entirely new mobile app experience that has earned a 4.8 star rating. I could go on and on, but I'll summarize by saying I am very proud of our talented and dedicated team. With case counts declining, and the vaccine rollout underway, now is the time to turn our focus to preparing for the recovery. And thanks to the efforts of all the Spirit team members, we are very well positioned to do just that. There are still many uncertainties about how the recovery will play out, but one thing we know is that our leading low-cost structure remains a key competitive advantage. And we intend to protect that asset to ensure our leadership position in the industry is maintained. With that, I'll turn it over to Matt and Scott to discuss more details of our quarterly performance.\nMatt Klein: Thanks Ted. The unprecedented events of the last 12 months have challenged all of us to rethink and re-engineer a number of our processes. And I joined Ted in thanking our team members for all their contributions for taking excellent care of our guests and for taking care of each other as we move through the pandemic. Turning to our fourth quarter results, total operating revenue for the fourth quarter declined 48.6% year-over-year. Demand in October 2020 was relatively strong. Unfortunately, this momentum was dampened by the spike in case counts leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday. However, demand for travel during the peak Christmas holiday period gave us another welcome glimpse of the strong pent-up desire for air travel. Load factor for the full fourth quarter averaged 71.5%, but some of the peak travel days hit the mid-80s in load. Total revenue per Passenger Flight segment decreased 14.5% year-over-year, primarily driven by a 25.6% decrease in average passenger revenue per segment, while non-ticket revenue per segment only decreased 4.5% to $55.42. For some added color, the small reduction in non-ticket rate is fully driven by effects of the pandemic on a couple of line items. Our customers are savvy and they evaluate purchase decisions based on total price. And as illustrated by our strong non-ticket revenue per segment, they value the option to pay for the extras of their choosing. Our guests and others are recognizing the improvements we've made in our product, our operational reliability and overall level of service. In fact, Spirit moved up one spot to fourth place in the 2020 edition of the middle seat scorecard, which is the Wall Street Journal's annual airline ranking of U.S. airlines by operational performance trailing only Delta Southwest and Alaska. Additionally, just a few weeks ago, we launched our redesigned FREE SPIRIT loyalty program. We are very excited about the enhancements to the program and believe guests will enjoy the new benefits which in turn will drive increased revenue and returns for shareholders. Moving ahead to the first quarter outlook. In addition to the usual seasonality change we see from December to January, the trends for January and February were negatively impacted by increased jurisdictional and regulatory restrictions as case counts, especially on the West Coast spiked. Additionally, the new testing requirements to enter the U.S. from international destinations, which went into effect on January 26, has also had a very recent and profound negative impact to our Latin American and Caribbean network, which currently represents 20% of our total flying. To be clear, the inbound testing requirements do not impact U.S. territories. Therefore, the impact from testing affects approximately 15% of our total network as approximately 5% of our flying is to and from U.S. territories, which is not included and required testing regulations. Having said that, the booking curve remains unusually compressed across the network so forward, visibility remains somewhat limited. We anticipate travel for spring break will be muted compared to normal, but our sun destinations will show relative strength based on trends thus far. We are encouraged by the early signs of traction in the latter half of March, and therefore we anticipate our exit rate for March will be much stronger than what trends indicate for early March. These trends are also supported by our recent survey data, which indicates sentiment has improved dramatically. In fact, our survey data shows sentiment is at the highest level it's been since we began tracking the data last spring. And we are seeing evidence of this translating our search data which will later translate into bookings. Capacity for the first quarter 2021 is estimated to be down 17% compared to the first quarter of 2019 with January down 19%, February down about 22% and March down approximately 11% compared to the same month in 2019. While disappointing we do believe the January and February trends are clearly transitory, based on survey results, rapidly declining case counts and anticipated vaccine penetration. We expect that by the end of the second quarter, the leisure demand profile will more broadly stabilize and that's how we are approaching our network and our capacity. With that as our backdrop, we still expect to be back to 2019 capacity levels by midyear. But as always, we will be keenly watching the developments between now and then and adjust our plans as we see fit. And now here is Scott.\nScott Haralson: Thanks Matt. Also wanted to say thank you and congratulations to our Spirit team members. The recognition from Fortune magazine, The Wall Street Journal, and a host of other websites and publications is a reflection of the great airline we are running and the great experience we are delivering to our guests. I'm honored to be part of this team. Now turning to the fourth quarter of 2020 financial performance, our adjusted net loss was $158 million, or a loss of $1.61 per share. Our EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was negative 17.8% in line with our revised guidance given in early December. Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter decreased 21.5% year-over-year to $659 million. This change was driven by a 25% reduction in capacity, as well as the 57.7% decrease in aircraft fuel expense due to decreases in both fuel rate and volume. Despite the 25% decrease in flight volume compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 some volume related expenses increase year-over-year. For example, landing fees and other rents increased 6.8% year-over-year due to rate increases at various airports. And salaries, wages and benefits increased modestly, primarily due to an increase in crew members versus 2019. On the balance sheet, we ended 2020 with $1.9 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments. This cash balance is almost twice as much as it was prior to the pandemic. During the fourth quarter, we took delivery of two A320neo aircraft, one of which was debt financed and the other financed through a sale leaseback transaction. We ended 2020 with 157 aircrafts in our fleet. With most of our A319 fleet in long-term parking for the fourth quarter, we only operated roughly 130 aircraft during the period. We are however starting the program to bring the A319 back into service. As Ted mentioned, we took time to prepare the network and the operation for the recovery. In 2021, we will invest some time and money to get the airline ready to run full speed once we get to the point where demand is strong enough to do so. We can take advantage of this lower utilization period and set the airline up for success in 2022 and beyond. One of the initial steps in bringing the parked aircraft back into service, there will be a fair amount of catch up maintenance expense to get them ready for service after being in long-term parking. We will also have expenses associated with additional training from new hires, as well as ongoing training for crews who have been on longer-term voluntary leaves. We have been working with Airbus throughout the pandemic to move our aircraft positions around. As I discussed on prior calls, we were able to push some 2020 and 2021 deliveries out of the period. Since then, we have been able to move some positions around to fill in some holes we had no delivery stream in 2022. In total, we move six additional aircraft into the year, bringing our total aircraft to be delivered in 2022 to 17. This does drive higher net pre-delivery deposits in 2021 and net pre-delivery deposits for the year are now estimated to be approximately $105 million. Together with our other CapEx of $60 million to $85 million, our estimated total spin for capital expenditures in 2021 is now $165 million to $190 million. Operating expenses for the first quarter are estimated to be between $740 million and $750 million. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated to be $1.75 or 32% higher than it was in the fourth quarter. In addition to the first quarter typically being a seasonally weaker quarter than the fourth, our views on the first quarter of 2021 have been progressively worsening throughout the quarter. Given the tightening of jurisdictional restrictions, international testing mandates, and increasing fuel costs, plus our shortened booking curves have a smaller. We have a smaller portion of revenue booked today than we would historically. Given this, we estimate our EBITDA margin for the first quarter will range between negative 45% to negative 55%. This takes into account our quarter to-date performance. Our projection that demand will stay muted through the first half of March, and that the back half of March will be relatively strong. March could be as much as half of the quarter's revenue and any improvements in spring bookings would improve our EBITDA production. But with what we know today, this is where it sits. We realized that most stakeholders aren't overly focused on many of our traditional unit metrics. And we agree until we get back to full utilization of our assets, unit metrics are not the most useful in evaluating the business. For now, our focus remains on maintaining sufficient liquidity and maximizing EBITDA margin. However, as we look out into the future, we know unit metrics will eventually matter again. Our goal is to get back to pre COVID unit cost levels. But first, we need to be able to run a full airline. Prior to the pandemic, we were guiding to a 2020 CASM ex-fuel number of around [5.65 cents]. We anticipate being able to run 100% of our available capacity sometime around mid 2022. At that point, we would expect our non-fuel costs to be trending below success. How far below six will really depend on a few decisions we make over the next couple of years around our fleet, where we fly our capacity growth and our financing decisions. But one thing is for sure we have all people recognize the value of having the lowest cost structure in the industry, and that won't change. In closing, we don't believe the pandemic changes our opportunities for growth. In fact, it might even increase the available opportunity set for Spirit. We will continue to have the lowest cost in the industry and will be a beneficiary of a leisure and VFR demand resurgence when it happens. Our strong and improving brand, together with our low costs will position us to succeed as demand recovers. With that, I'll hand it back to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks, Scott. The road to get to today has been filled with many new challenges and difficult decisions. I couldn't be prouder of our actions and progress over the past year. While not necessary, is also nice to have these achievements recognized publicly. We still have ways to go before leisure demand fully rebounds. However, as the vaccine is more widely available, case counts abate and travel restrictions ease. We anticipate our guests will be ready to go visit friends and relatives and enjoy the many destinations we serve as we get closer to the summer months. It is with this in mind we turn our focus toward the recovery. With that back to DeAnne.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, Ted. And James, we are now ready to begin to take questions from the analysts. We ask that you limit yourself to one question with one related follow-up. We are ready to begin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Linenberg.\nMike Linenberg: Two quick ones here. When we think about the composition of where your capacity is going to be deployed this quarter. I think, Matt, you said 20% was Latin America/Caribbean, but you did call out I guess five points for that, I guess is, you're referring to Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands. March quarter, how does that change? Is it more 90% domestic 10% Latin/Caribbean? If you can give us some color on that? Thanks.\nMatt Klein: Sure, Mike. Actually, the numbers I gave you there are what we're doing in the quarter now. So 20% of our flying is Latin America and Caribbean, approximately 5% is a touch more than that, but approximately 5% is in the U.S. territories, 15% would be International, and the rest would be domestic.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, thanks for clarifying. And then how I'm just curious, notwithstanding the very short booking curve, several carriers are now looking to offer tickets out beyond kind of that traditional 330-day period. I know historically, you've done a bit - your window was maybe more like 180-200 days? Thoughts on, potentially opening up more inventory further out, does it make sense, does it not make sense, based on how you think about longer term, et cetera? Thank you for answering my questions.\nMatt Klein: So right now, we do not see the need to push the schedule that far out way out into the future, networks change, opportunities change. And historically, the booking curve hasn't really pushed anywhere near that far out for us in terms of impacting our overall results. So we're comfortable with the length of our schedule, and that does vary. Usually, we're out like you said 180 days, we'll go out to 240 days sometimes. But having said that, just about the booking curve in general and thinking about bookings out into the future, we are, besides talking about the back half of March there, we are starting to see some traction starting to occur out in the early parts of summer as well. Just wanted to make sure I clarified that too, that the booking curve is compressed for the mass - for the majority of when we take volume. However, we are starting to see traction out in the summer. And in some cases, we're actually starting to see volumes that are above last year's levels for out in the early parts of summer. So there are people looking to fly and there are people looking out there. I would just say, the stuff that we're getting in the summer right now, it's still small numbers, but it's very encouraging, and kind of goes along with the overall theme that there is pent-up demand out there, and people want to fly.\nOperator: Next question from Brandon Oglenski.\nBrandon Oglenski: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking my question. I guess Ted, can you talk to, the metrics that are driving you guys when you want to add capacity to the schedule? I mean, are you in any way constrained by the Airbus order book? I think that's a fair debate with investors, whether you want to have exposure to a legacy order book, or maybe not have that exposure as some of your competitors do? So can you talk to some of those constraints and what's driving the future here?\nTed Christie: Sure, so close in - good morning Brandon, by the way close in we evaluate capacity based on EBITDA performance. So that's the way we're moving the capacity through the system. And we feel like we have the right tools now to help us refine that close in. As we look at our opportunities down the road and you heard Matt mentioned that by the summer of this year, we anticipate being back to 2019 capacity levels, really the limit or overall let's say the medium term is more our ability to deliver crew. We have airplanes in - that have been in long-term storage that - as Scott mentioned, we're bringing those back into service. We'll have to train crew and hire crew to get ourselves ready, which means we won't be running that full airline, even with the fleet we have delivered today. And we'll deliver over the next little bit until the middle of next year. So that's our limiter right now, beyond that, right before the pandemic hit, we ordered 100 airplanes with Airbus. And I think we said that that was still well under shooting the total opportunities that the company has, that we would refine around that and find necessary lift to round out the delivery schedule. And if anything, a silver lining to this pandemic as we believe that does open up doors for us to find airplanes when we need them. And you heard Scott mentioned that we did find a few to be able to address some needs in 2022. And it's good to be in that position that we're actually going to need airplanes in addition to what we have over the next five to seven years. And it's nice to be in a position to be able to take advantage of that for once. So I think those are the ways we're thinking about short, medium and longer term.\nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate that, and I guess the commentary on 2022 Scott, getting back to below six and CASM fuel ex, that's really based on that utilization and the ability to get crew back in the system, is that right?\nScott Haralson: Yes, I think that's part of it, Brandon. We said, I've been pretty clear that running a full airline is important to you know an airline like Spirit. We didn't have the structural changes that other airlines are going through, our fleet was already simple. We didn't have the age workforce before. So we're going to make sure that we run an efficient airline, I mean doing that is running at full capacity of the airline. And that's going to be important as we think about getting back to pre-COVID unit costs. Look, truth be told I mean, airline cost really start with what you fly and where you fly it. So, as we as we continue to think about our fleets, our network, and how we schedule it, over the next few years, that's really going to drive how far below six we get. So those decisions are really still to be made, but that's how the math is going to work.\nOperator: Our next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: How much of the cost progression from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is a function of PSP optics?\nScott Haralson: Duane, this is Scott. So really when you think about the move between Q4 and Q1, the PSP really didn't have a lot of impacts. We were already starting to bring crews back in order to anticipate the running of, more capacity in the back half of the year. So the PSP component didn't really move the cost numbers. A lot of the move between Q4 and Q1 is related to capacity and fuel. I mean, that drove more than half of the change in the expenses. But we were already moving the airline forward.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, that's helpful. And then just maybe one for Matt, can you give us a sense for how your thought process is evolving regarding how dynamic or tactical you're going to be from a planning perspective? Obviously looking backwards, this has been an unprecedented year for you and for the industry and for all the people involved? But going forward, is the message that you're going to be more patient with bumps in the road on demand, like what you're seeing with international and less tactical or not?\nMatt Klein: Thanks, Duane. I would answer the question, sort of a couple of answers to your questions. So I'm trying to keep it as concise as possible. We are definitely reacting to and understanding what's going on from the booking curve perspective as best as we can. It is compressed, so we do have to take into account when we think about making changes. What we have done, though moving forward, is we've been able to isolate a lot of our flying where we think there are issues that are happening or may happen. We've been able to redesign our schedules to make sure that we're isolating the flying for the crews and for the aircraft on a lot of what could be against demand risk involved flying. So, if we get closer into that flying and we don't see the results that we like from a booking perspective, we have and ability without disrupting the network to make some changes close in. So in that regard, I think I would tell you that we have improved and we'll continue to have an ability to make close and tactical changes as we see fit. Having said all of that, once you get really close in on top of the flying itself, then you start to have different kinds of analyses on what costs do you save by not flying some things. So when we're a few weeks out from travel, some of the costs can't really be saved by not flying. So all of that is part of the decision process to think both tactically and then further out strategically and how we set up the network.\nOperator: Our next question from Hunter Keay.\nHunter Keay: Did the NOLs that you're building right now have any impact on the math on taking 33 airplanes if you're not going to need the tax shelter from accelerated depreciation that you would normally get if you're running the business sort of focused on sort of cash management?\nScott Haralson: Yes Hunter, it really doesn't, I mean we're looking at the assets really from a 25-year view. The other long-term assets, our view of returning back to profitability will happen in the near-term And so we're really taking a longer-term view around the opportunity set, not sort of thinking about the near-term NOI or cash tax component of the business.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thanks, Scott. And then couple of questions on the JetBlue-American tie-up in New York. First, do you expect to get any of the divested slots at JFK and at DCA and then why you guys so opposed to it? It's not a JV, they can't coordinate on pricing, can't pull revenues. What is the big deal, and why are you guys been so vehemently opposed to it in the filings?\nTed Christie: Hi, Hunter. It's Ted. Thanks for the question. I wish I could elaborate. But we do as you referenced have an open complaint here with the DOT so I think I'd be remiss in offering any further commentary on that.\nOperator: Our next question from Catherine O'Brien.\nCatherine O'Brien: So I had a question on some of the staffing and utilization comments you've made. If your capacity is going to be back to 2019 levels by mid-2021, in the second half of 2020, you were seeing some salary and benefit inflation due to having more crew members in the second half of 2019? Why is it that crew is a limiting factor to getting back to full utilization 2021? Do you think a portion of your current leave is it trying to going around with co-productivity or was it just my calculus skewed? Thanks.\nTed Christie: I'll start. This is Ted and Scott can jump in behind. So there is lag is basically the answer. So as we've discussed in - our workgroups have been very flexible and proactive with us over the course of this pandemic in using voluntarily programs to get our costs down as we navigate the downturn but bringing those people back online requires some training and that does have expense with it, as well as time. And we have a fixed set of resources that we can use to get those people through training both in fixed plants, in simulators and in trainers themselves. And so it does have to move its way through the snake a little bit. And I think that's why that ends up being a little bit more of a limiter in addition to the hiring that we'll have to do to staff the additional airplanes that are being delivered as we speak. So Scott, do you want to?\nScott Haralson: Yes, I think the airplanes are big component of this. We're 20% bigger in the number of aircraft today than we were in 2019. So the deliveries are still coming. So what we're talking about is getting to the point where we can operate all of the entire fleet, not our 2019 fleet. So the measure keeps moving even though we pause the hiring. So we now got a spool that back up again. So we got to catch up what we missed for probably what amounts to about a year's worth of hiring, we got to do that again over a condensed period. So that happens as we just said, it's a lag but the aircraft have kept coming in.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. Very clear. Thanks for that. And then one for Matt, I guess how should we think about the moving pieces of revenue going forward? Based on your guidance seems that load or fair non-ticket, we expected to work in a bit into the first quarter? Can you just walk us through what you're seeing in higher revenue managing right now? Sounds like some of your peers planning to manage loads thing for you. Is there anything funky going on with non-ticket given the international demand flying? I know there's a couple of questions in one, so I appreciate it?\nMatt Klein: Sure. So there is not too much funky going on in the international network with non-ticket. Generally speaking, the issue with international network is going to be on the volume side more so than it is on the yield profile. That's not to say there is not some impact on the yield profile there is, but it's largely a volume issue, then I'm sure you can understand why with that. In terms of the overall network, we have been and will always be a low fare carrier. And our cost structure helps to support that, we grow markets and we stimulate markets, none of that's changed within our business model. And none of that will change moving forward. So we are first and foremost going to be a volume carrier. That's who we are and what we do our cost structure supports that. And then as we see the ability to you'll manage, we will, and we do. So I don't think anything is really going to be changing right now, as you can imagine the whole industry is dealing a little bit with the supply versus demand imbalance. And what's going on right now in my opinion is just its transitory. I think this is the third time since the pandemic started, that we've had a dip in demand relative to case counts and other things that are going on with headlines in the media. So we'll come out of this just like we have before, it'll be stronger than it was before. And I really think that the best news moving forward is that customers want to fly, we're seeing that across our survey data. And one thing we're going to talk about a lot, we're not going to give perfectly clear detail on this, but we have still a cancellation rate that is relatively high, it's very high compared to normal circumstances. And it's still relatively high, even for being almost a year into the pandemic. What that means is that there is a lot of people that are buying tickets, they want to go somewhere, and then their plans change for a variety of reasons, most of them being impacted by something related to COVID-19 in their personal lives in some way, shape, or form, or where they want to fly to. To me, that's another real positive sign that there is a lot of demand out there. And for whatever reason, people can go soon. And you can define soon in varying ways. But soon those issues will be alleviated. And then we'll see the pent-up demand actually be able to go when they want to go and where they want to go.\nOperator: Our next question from Helane Becker.\nHelane Becker: Hi, everybody, and thank you for the time. So this is I think a pretty easy question, on the flight attendant contract that comes due in May, are you talking to the FAs? Are you postponing it? How are you going to address that?\nTed Christie: Good morning, Helane, It's Ted. I think that we're in regular to be clear - we're in regular communication with our flight attendant leadership group, and have been for quite a while. And I would describe the relationship is very strong. And the timing of the contract, and that sort of thing it will mature here over the next six months or so, meaning what the next step is, and how we handle the open and when it's time to start negotiating at a quick pace. So I wouldn't put up a fine point on the actual date, but it will come. Clearly, we're all distracted right now, working through the issues the airline has in front of it, but that time will come and we'll be ready to do it. And I know our partners, the FA will be ready as well.\nHelane Becker: And then my follow-up question is with respect to the third-party maintenance business you're doing at Miami for GlobalX. How are you thinking about that? Is that like a business that you want to get into? Is it just a convenience, that they're there, you're there, you can do this for them? I'm just trying to find something in the annual report last night the K, but I couldn't really find anything about it. So if you talk about it, maybe you can point to the page?\nTed Christie: I think if that's your answer, it's so small. That it didn't bear mention. I think to your - the genesis of your question, I think it's more the latter issue, which it's convenient. We happen to be sizable here in South Florida. And we could offer a little bit of assistance. Whether or not that's a business we engage in is for a later date. We have periodically helped and done a few maintenance items for other companies in the past as well, where we've had bases, very small stuff. The reason that this one is public is because GlobalX needs to talk about it as part of their certification process. But otherwise, it would be well under the radar.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Didora.\nAndrew Didora: I guess my question is really for Scott. With where fuel has gone and some of the cost pressures that you talked about in your prepared remarks, I can model your 2021 OpEx getting back pretty, close to 2019 levels. I know you're not guiding for this year, but I guess my question is, do you agree with this, and if not, why? And you guys have been talking a lot about being one of the first factor to cash breakeven profitability and whatnot. Are there any guideposts you can provide with that cause backdrop there in terms of where revenues need to be to get back to both cash flow - cash breakeven and profitability? Thanks.\nScott Haralson: Andrew from a fuel perspective, I mean, even though we're forecasting a fairly sizable increase over 2020, it's still down versus 2019. So if we think about profitability for the airline and returning to that, it's the same math we've talked about before, which is really around EBITDA margin. And if you adjust for fuel then that makes the hurdle slightly lower than 2019. So assuming we're around the 20% number for EBITDA margin, some kind of unit revenue at full capacity at 20% discount to 2019 puts you in the range of where you would be from a cash breakeven perspective, obviously, we've pulled expenses out. So the hurdle is a little bit lower than that. But that gives you a proxy for how we're thinking about when that might happen. Returning to a full airline is critical to getting to EBITDA breakeven and eventually to profitability. So that's the first big step, we'll drive capacity, we'll drive load, and then we'll maximize TRASM sort of in that order and that's probably how it's going to play out.\nAndrew Didora: Just a follow-up there, just kind of with this cost structure, just curious why is 1Q you're still forecasting and based on your EBITDA margin guide revenues down directionally, 50% still versus the first quarter of '19. And I know you're prepping the airline for the recovery, but with revenue still down 50% why aren't you taking more capacity out right now? Thank you.\nScott Haralson: Yes, I mean, I think ultimately, Ted mentioned earlier, we have a pretty tight model in how we think about the deployment of capacity. And given word TRASMs are, there is not a lot of incremental benefit for flying it, but there is incremental benefit. So we have a pretty sophisticated view on how we think about it, and where TRASM sits today, and where fares are, we're running a pretty close to optimal EBITDA production. So that implies that if we were to fly less, EBITDA would be worse. So I think - look I mean, it's tough, you understand the math, because you're not sitting over here, but it's what we talk about every day, the single biggest thing we can do to maximize EBITDA in this period is to fly the right amount of capacity. And so that's our number one focus.\nOperator: Our next question from Jamie Baker.\nJamie Baker: Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Similar question to what I asked JetBlue, I'm trying to understand how pricing and revenue management is going to respond to demand recovery. Because even in just a modest recovery scenario, you're going to be experienced a pace of bookings build, that's likely well in excess of what your automated systems have experienced in the past, you can save some time and tell me if you think this is irrelevant. But as with any automated process, I'm wondering what the response will be to inputs that haven't been witnessed or experienced before?\nMatt Klein: Jamie, this is Matt, thanks for the question. So I've been here about a little over four years now, 4.5 years, and since we've been here, we've gone through I think, three different kinds of demand environments before we got to the pandemic, so it's been every year we think about our processes, we think about our data, we think about our ability to respond. And you see that, and how we also not just move the network around, but how we think about revenue management of the ticket, as well as non-ticket. So I would answer your question by saying I agree with you for a lot of airlines, they're going to have systems that may be a little bit slow to respond to changes in demand recovery, we're not going to be one of those airlines. We spend a lot of time thinking about how we compete. And with a point-to-point network and how we've seen competitive reaction over the years, we've become experts in understanding how our competitors think about us, how they think about their own pricing in our markets and how they think about their yield management, and in some cases, lack of yield management in our markets. So we're used to that. In fact, I think that we have the muscles already built to be the best at responding to this when demand recovers because we've been there for a number of years already. So we're ready for this. And we can move very quickly based on how demand moves either up or down for that matter, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And just a follow-up, in terms of getting below $0.06 in 2022, just to clarify if you're talking on an annual basis, not just dipping below $0.06 at some point, but more importantly, to the extent that you do fly the requisite capacity, and don't achieve that outcome. What do you think the reasons might be? I mean, what are the cost buckets where - or is it really a no brainer if you produce that capacity, it's almost mathematically guaranteed to be below six. I'm just trying to assess your confidence?\nMatt Klein: Now, it's fair question, Jamie, I think the way we're talking about it is we're going to get to full capacity most likely around that mid-mark in 2022. And we'll get to some point after that, we'll get to a run rate CASM that's sub six, you know, like we said, how far below six depends on a number of variables. And I think the variables that benefit us on the downside will likely be the ones that may have some risks on the other side, including some of the inflationary components that we've talked about. We've talked about airports being in significant mover as of late, hopefully, that reverses as the industry gets to a more efficient throughput in the airports. So hopefully, that migrates the other way. But there are going to be things that we do some of the decisions we make around the fleet, around how we schedule the airline, that will dictate some of that. But there is obviously labor pressures that we're all going to face. We're going to have to mitigate this. So I think it's for us, we didn't have a lot of the structural changes during this period. So it's the same issues that we've had in the past will be the same issues that we have going forward. We just have to be efficient and thoughtful about how we run the airline.\nOperator: Our next question from Joe Caiado.\nJoe Caiado: Matt, quick question about your near field international business that isn't to U.S. territories, Caribbean markets, et cetera. What is the traffic flow between VFR and fare leisure? I'm just curious if there are differences in the duration of those near field international VFR trips versus leisure trips, and maybe a different sensitivity to the new testing requirement for your traffic base that's flying more to visit family as opposed to a three- or four-day beach vacation? Or is it just too early to tell?\nMatt Klein: No, it's not too early to tell Joe, the more pure leisure play and none of our destinations are really pure leisure plays. But the ones that are highly reliant on leisure vacation traffic has definitely been impacted more than the VFR traffic. And without getting into specific details, I can tell you that the search volume definitely reflects that but it's not as disparate as the results are showing. People want to fly and they want to travel to these destinations. They're just right now on the sidelines, because quite frankly, if you're not in the industry, it's a little hard to understand. And it's a little hard to have the confidence that you need to understand that you can get tests and a lot of these leisure destinations. But it's a change and it's something that not everyone fully grasped yet. That could change a little bit over time. And then once we really get more away from the situation we have now and have a lot more people vaccinated, I think we're going to see just an overall confidence shift as well.\nJoe Caiado: Quick one, Scott, you made clear you think are well funded right now, plentiful liquidity. Does that still hold true if next week the administration were to start requiring COVID tests for domestic travel? And Ted, are you involved in those discussions with the white house? And how would you handicap that overall probability at this point? Thanks for the time.\nScott Haralson: So thinking about liquidity at a high level not specifically around testing, look, I mean, we feel pretty good where we are. So the quick answer is we're not planning on anything additional. I think what would drive that is the same things that drive our thoughts around, the balance sheet and leverage and capacity growth and all those things. It's really around demand unit revenue production, it's therefore profitability. Those things will be at the forefront of how we're thinking about planning the airlines, once we reach our profitability levels again, and look we're not going to be naive about the idea that, longer term, unit revenue depression, with our growth rates, isn't a great outcome. So we're going to be flexible and ready to adapt the airline in that world. But our view today is that, we're going to be a beneficiary of the outcome and we're going to be ready to grow the airline again, and there's going to be profitability for us to be had. But we're going to be flexible and thoughtful about, protecting our six year event.\nTed Christie: And I guess, as it relates to domestic testing and the issue, while I have - I personally have not had direct communications with the White House. We are a member of a lobby for organization that represents the four ULCCs and they have been in communication with the Secretary of Transportation, and they are aware of our concerns. We do not support the idea. We think it doesn't address the issue. And I think everyone has, and you've heard not just from me, but from our peers, that it would be logistically extremely difficult to do and expensive. And I don't know that that given all of the protocols that airlines have put in place and the confirmation from independent authorities that travel on board airplanes is not a transmission event. That's why we don't believe it addresses the issue. So that point has been made strongly and we're hopeful that that will carry the day.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joseph DeNardi.\nJoseph DeNardi: Matt, you talked about I think mid 80 load factors during peak periods in fourth quarter if I heard you correctly. Can you talk about that the pricing you saw during those periods like are you seeing strong demand at the same price point pre-COVID or is this strong demand, but with much more promotional fares?\nMatt Klein: On - let me answer the question on average Joe, it's on average, we're going to see lower yields, even on the strongest of days and strongest of flights. Having said that, it's not necessarily about the high end of the booking curve, it has more to do with getting a base on board. And one of the things so, the base on board has been paying less to get on board. One of the issues that we've had and I don't think based on the environment that I'm seeing and experiencing. I don't think we're unique in this either, but the booking curve being compressed does make us a hedge a little bit on how we how to put revenue on the airplane. So are we selling a little bit too inexpensive on peak periods. I would tell you we are, relative to where we would like to be. But our feeling is that we need to do that in order to make sure we get a good base on board so that we then get more confidence and understanding how the traffic will actually flow through the network. I hope that makes sense there, Joe?\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes, it does thank you. And then Scott, you're going to love this question. Can you give us EBITDA margin guidance by month for first quarter? So what was January and what's the assumption for February and March. And then does CASM ex did better or worse in 2Q versus 1Q? Given how you're talking about supply and kind of prepping the business to run at full speed again. How should we think about the impact of those costs on 2Q assuming you get close to kind of pre-COVID capacity by the end of the quarter? Thank you.\nScott Haralson: Yes, hey Joe thanks for that. Yes, I can't give you EBITDA margin by month, but sort of talk a little bit about the inputs here, right. We know January and February are seasonally lower than March. And we're going to be a little smaller in January and February than we were in March. So those are going to be sort of directional components that will help you get there but I can't give you the number. But and so to your to your second point around Q2, I think the view is today, we're going to be bigger in Q2, probably some sizable amount, probably around 30% bigger in Q2. And I would expect us, right now we're sort of looking at expenses growing at probably around two-thirds of that number. We're going to invest some things in the business to get ready for, full capacity in 2022. So they're going to be a little bit higher on the expense side from that perspective. But we're going to start to see efficiencies in the business as we as we grow capacity.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, is the two-thirds ex fuel or including fuel?\nScott Haralson: That's going to be total op expenses including fuel.\nOperator: And our next question from Darryl Genovesi.\nDarryl Genovesi: Scott, if I heard you correctly, you said you can get back to sub $0.06 on non-fuel unit costs when you're back at full utilization. And I think that will happen in mid-2022. I just want to make sure I understand the framework combine with what you said on the fleet, it sounds like the 2022 capacity view there, some capacity view that you're using to frame that cross guide it's like 30% higher versus 2019. Is that right?\nScott Haralson: Well, we haven't talked about capacity for 2022 yet. I mean, you could use, sort of fleet growth as a proxy for that. We have our fleet numbers out there. We have - we've grown the airline, 16 aircraft last year, will grow at 16 this year, and 17 in 2022. So you can sort of do the proxy for capacity. But we haven't given a number yet.\nDeAnne Gabel: Yes, this is DeAnne. The comment about the 30% was regarding second quarter of 2021, we think will be 30% larger than in capacity than we were in first quarter of 2021.\nDarryl Genovesi: No, thanks DeAnne, yes, I saw that. I'm basically doing what Scott just suggested. I'm looking at the fleet what you said about the deliveries, what you said on I think five A319 retirements you have coming up. And I was kind of getting to like a 30ish percent type of capacity boost implied by the comment that you're going to get back to operating a fleet utilization, essentially was what you imply? So I just want to make sure as I was doing the math right. And if that's right, given that nominal demand is still some 50%, lower from 2019 today, I guess the question really is, should CASM ex below $0.06 really be your guiding late here? It just seems like you're taking a lot of risk on RASM to get to that target?\nTed Christie: I might jump in here, this is Ted. Nominal demand below 50% may or may not be true at our level. And in fact, we don't believe it's true. The leisure component is 100% or approaching a 100% demand today. And we expect it will be the vast majority of the demand over the perhaps the earlier parts of the recovery. And so again, we've said this over the last couple of calls, the pandemic doesn't necessarily disrupt our story. We still think there's going to be leisure demand and we're going to capture our portion of that. And so for those reasons, we did not - make permanent changes to our delivery schedule. We did not make permanent changes to our business plan. Now with that said tactically, we have been smart about deploying capacity and making sure that we don't penalize EBITDA. And so, if this appears - if our current assumption, there all appears to be wrong, we would make changes to address that. But for now, that is the assumption and I think it's founded a lot on good history and theory.\nOperator: Our next question from Savi Syth.\nSavi Syth: Scott, maybe if I could clarify on the kind of sequential chain, or just the understanding of could you quantify just how much that maintenance of spend might be that's elevated. And I'm guessing its 2Q more so than 1Q. And also just training, I'm just trying to understand that how much is elevated to kind of catch up to kind of this aircraft that are coming in and trying to understand just when? Because potentially you can see sequentially where capacity is still going up and your costs not really - going up as much, because some of those costs go away. So I'm trying to get an understanding, and I was wondering if you could help quantify that?\nScott Haralson: Yes, that's right Savi. I mean so for you, when we talk about capacity increase into Q2, that's going to drive, probably half of the costs increase. The other portion will probably be driven by, catch up expenses. We had aircraft parked, we're going have to get through, maintenance events, that'll probably take us, a good portion of 12 to 15 months to do. So we expect these catch-up expenses to last really through the year. And we'll probably spend call it $30 million of catch-up expenses through that period. And that's going to be, other heavy maintenance components, on both the air frame and the engines, it will be training for crew, it will be new hires. So all of those things will happen, and you can't snap your fingers and have the airline ready to go. So it will take us 12 to 15 months to do it. And it will cost some money to do that.\nSavi Syth: And that's super helpful. And then just on the purchasing right now, and I know you've talked about cancellations, I'm just kind of curious just how much of the ATL is credits. And what percentage of your new sales are in kind of cash versus credits - these kinds of credit that - from cancellations?\nScott Haralson: Savi, this is Scott. So ATL balance is roughly $400 million, we're probably in the $250 million range. So probably 60 plus percent of the ATL is sitting in credit shells and from a redemption perspective, we're in the range of probably 10% to 15% of our bookings are coming in the form of credit shells, at least at this point. And I don't know if that will change over time, but that's probably a good proxy.\nOperator: And our next question from Dan McKenzie.\nDan McKenzie: I wonder if you can just elaborate a little bit on the new credit card deal and how it might drive a change in behavior. So what percent of the historical passenger base is maybe likely to travel more, possibly pay more to rack up more miles? And what could the credit card economics look like say three years from now, could this program ultimately maybe 10% of your revenue, say in three to five years?\nMatt Klein: Hi, Dan, it's Matt. I will try not going to answer your question exactly with the detail that you would like as some of that - are things that we're not really - ready and willing to share totally on that. But I can tell you that our expectation is that the new loyalty program and the credit card deal is going to also create more repeat traffic for us as well. We're already pretty good at getting repeat traffic onto the plane based on our model and how reliable we are and how reliable and consistent the product is out there. So that in and of itself has creates very high repeat rates. In terms of how many people we think are going to travel more that's all theory. And that's all things that we have on paper. But for us internally, but I will tell you that what we've done to design the program gives incentive for passengers to engage with the model. So we want people to get rewarded for adding more ancillaries onto their itinerary, and onto their trip. And that in and of itself we believe is going to create a higher repeat rate and a higher brand efficiency in terms of customer acquisition in the future, and all of those pieces holistically that lead to marketing expense, as that translates that into revenue on the aircraft. All of that should get better with a stronger loyalty program and the credit card will be a key component in helping us drive that through.\nDeAnne Gabel: And with that, we are out of time for the day, but thank you all for joining us again today and we will talk to you soon.\nTed Christie: Thank you.\nScott Haralson: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentleman.

My name is James, and I'll be your operator for today's call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to DeAnne Gabel, Senior Director of Investor Relations. DeAnne, you may begin.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, James, and welcome everyone to Spirit Airlines' third quarter earnings call. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call will be archived on our website for 60 days. Presenting on today\u2019s call are Ted Christie, Spirit\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; Scott Haralson, our Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Klein, our Chief Commercial Officer. Also joining us today are other members of our senior leadership team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for sell-side analysts. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company\u2019s current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements are included in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude the special items. Please refer to our third quarter 2020 earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. With that, here's Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks, DeAnne, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As we sit here today, nearly seven months removed from the beginning of the COVID crisis, I am ever more impressed and humbled by how our team has navigated this incredibly dynamic time. I thank all our Spirit team members for their commitment and professionalism in dealing with the challenges and consequences that the COVID pandemic has imposed on our company and the industry. Together, once again, we have shown the flexibility and resiliency of our business model. We still have a ways to go before we resume business as usual. But thanks to the efforts of our team, our strong guest satisfaction metrics, excellent operational performance, improving brand image and industry-leading low-cost structure, I remain confident Spirit will be one of the first to reach sustained profitability. Additionally, I would like to take this opportunity to provide a special acknowledgment to our union leadership groups and all our team members, who worked with us to find a solution to mitigate planned furloughs. Various voluntary time-off programs in place through May 2021 enabled us to capture the necessary savings while preserving jobs and our options should demand trends worsen or recover faster than expected. The strong participation in these innovative programs demonstrates the esprit de corps of Spirit Airlines. We also offered early app programs to eligible team members and implemented a modest reduction in force of our management staff and business partners. Those were painful, but necessary actions to help us manage through this crisis. During the third quarter 2020, our operational performance continued to excel. Completion factor was 99.8%, which earned Spirit a first place ranking among the reporting carriers, and we delivered on-time performance of 90% or better for each of the three months during the third quarter 2020. Year-to-date through September 30, we ranked second in completion factor and third in on-time performance among reporting carriers. This is remarkable performance especially in light of the numerous network changes since March, which can further complicate a complex business such as ours. Getting guests back on the plane is one of the first and most important steps to recovery, and we're doing that quite well. For October, we estimate our load factor will average in the mid-70s. While these load factors are still on reduced year-over-year capacity, what is clear is that history is indeed repeating itself. Leisure travelers are much more resilient and they clearly prefer products that provide the lowest total price of travel. As we have been saying since the beginning of the crisis, our model shines in tougher times as we are best positioned with our cost structure and our network to respond to building leisure demand. This hypothesis has proven correct once again over the past few months. It is likely the recovery will not be linear and we anticipate demand will ebb and flow. However, all the work we have done prepares us to add capacity back where it makes good financial sense to do so and react quickly to demand indications and changes. With that, I'll turn it over to Matt to discuss more details of our revenue performance.\nMatt Klein: Thanks Ted. I want to start by saying thank you to all our Spirit team members for going the extra mile to take excellent care of our guests. Their high service standards, especially in the face of additional challenges brought about by COVID-19, have helped us deliver great value to our guests. Despite heightened anxiety levels by some travelers around COVID-19 concerns our guest satisfaction metrics have never been higher. Our guests value the operational improvements we have made; our extra sanitization efforts; continued focus on guest health; our low fares and customizable travel options; and of course our friendly and efficient service. And, we are continuing to make other enhancements to the travel experience for our guests. We are rolling out new cabin interiors, upgrading our seats, which offer enhanced seat comfort and provide more usable legroom. And as we announced last week, we are relaunching our loyalty program in January to bring more value to our guests and unlock enhanced earnings potential for the airline. The public feedback, we've received from industry experts on loyalty programs, have rated our new program amongst the best in the industry, and they've congratulated us on integrating key features of our business model into the program itself. We are also improving the overall travel experience for our guests by rolling out touchless and self-service opportunities that expedite the check-in process. We have developed meaningful updates to our mobile app that have already shifted many guests to use our own devices for check-in. And we recently launched self-bag-drop in a number of our stations, which allows our guests to tag and drop their own bags. Additionally, Spirit is the first airline to launch domestic facial biometric solutions on self-bag-drop aimed at expediting our guests' airport experience. Turning now to our third quarter revenue results. Our total operating revenue in the third quarter declined 59.5% year-over-year due to demand impacts from the pandemic. Total revenue per passenger flight segment decreased 21.1% year-over-year. While both average fare and non-ticket spend per passenger segment declined year-over-year as expected, non-ticket revenue per segment declined much less than ticket revenue per segment. Average fare per segment decreased 35.1% to $35.57, while non-ticket revenue per segment only decreased 7.2% to $51.37. As a reminder, because we operated so few segments in the second quarter 2020, items not related to passenger travel such as breakage, brand loyalty and other revenues had an outsized impact on our per segment results. However, during the third quarter, the impact from these items was in line with the third quarter last year. Our team is doing a great job offering our guests more choices and driving superior non-ticket revenue results. In fact, right now in October our non-ticket revenue per segment is expected to slightly increase versus October 2019, yet again illustrating the strength of our business model. Fitting to our network, we've seen some international jurisdictions lift their travel bands but we are still not operating 100% of our previous international network. Demand for international destinations remains highly correlated with quarantine restrictions. So while we will bring back service to all our international destinations, we have been doing so at a pragmatic pace. Our current December holiday travel period network expectations for our Latin American \u2013 Latin America and Caribbean network have us increasing ASMs versus 2019, demonstrating that the strength of our international network continues to perform. Turning to capacity expectations. October capacity is estimated to be down 36% versus October 2019 with November and December, each down approximately 20% year-over-year. This equates to fourth quarter capacity being down about 25% compared to the fourth quarter last year. While we feel more upbeat and encouraged by the trends post Labor Day, we are closely monitoring the situation. As we expect demand will be fluid and at least somewhat correlated to COVID-19 headlines and jurisdictional quarantines, the booking curve is still materially shorter than normal but both it and our travel search curves have been progressively lengthening. We were pleasantly surprised with how October trended and bookings for the Thanksgiving period are certainly encouraging. Based on our current assumptions, we estimate total revenue for the fourth quarter will be down between 43% to 45% year-over-year. Obviously, if we see heightened travel restrictions or other disruptions, it could change this outlook. We are not seeing anything in our bookings to suggest this is going to happen but we are mindful that the recovery may still be a little bit bumpy and there will be some noise while demand recovers to pre-COVID levels. But make no mistake about it, our demand is solidly on the way back and we know that the strength of our model presents us with more opportunity to bring low fares and more go to United States, Caribbean and Latin American traveling public. Not surprisingly, price-sensitive travelers going to visit their friends and relatives have been among the first travel segments to rebound followed by vacation travel. Both of these segments are core to our network. And together with our industry-leading cost structure and ancillary revenue model, we remain well positioned to excel at serving this part of the demand segment. And now here's Scott.\nScott Haralson: Thanks, Matt. I joined Ted and Matt in thanking all of our Spirit team members for their dedication to the success of our company. Throughout the organization we have maintained a can-do attitude in the face of all the uncertainty of the last seven months and I am grateful and honored to be a part of this team. Turning to our third quarter 2020 financial performance. Our adjusted net loss was $215 million or a loss of $2.32 [ph] per share. Adjusted operating expenses for the third quarter decreased 24.3% year-over-year to $650 million. This change was primarily driven by a 62.9% decrease in aircraft fuel expense due to decreases in both fuel rate and volume. In addition, other expenses such as distribution, ground handling and crew accommodation expenses were lower year-over-year, due to a substantial decrease in flight volume. Better operational performance also drove a significant decrease in passenger reaccommodation expense compared to the same period last year. However, despite a significant decrease in flight volume compared to the third quarter last year, other rents and landing fees increased year-over-year due to airport signatory adjustments and rate increases at various airports Spirit serves. Our fuel efficiency as measured by ASMs per gallon, improved to 10.3% year-over-year and we expect to see about the same year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter due in part to the fact that we plan to keep our A319 fleet parked until next year. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $2.1 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments. During the third quarter we received the remaining $33 million of the initial payroll support program funds, completed our at-the-market stock offering, netting $157 million of proceeds. And we issued $850 million of 8% senior secured notes, collateralized by our brand and loyalty assets. Upon successful completion of the secured notes offering, we notified the U.S. Treasury that we had elected not to participate in the CARES Act loan program. Regarding fleet, we took delivery of one debt-financed aircraft, ending the third quarter with 155 aircraft. Earlier in October, we took delivery of two aircraft, one of which was debt-financed and the other was secured under a sell leaseback transaction. With these two deliveries, we will end 2020 with 157 aircraft. We have 16 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2021. 10 of those are secured under direct operating lease arrangements. We expect to use sale/leaseback financing for the remaining six aircraft, the first of which is not scheduled for delivery, until June of 2021. Total capital expenditures for 2020, are now estimated to be approximately $545 million or $200 million net of financing, a further reduction of $15 million since our guidance last quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we estimate our CapEx will be approximately $45 million or $5 million net of financing. Most of these expenditures are related to aircraft. As for 2021 CapEx, again, assuming we use sale/leaseback financing for the six aircraft not yet financed our initial estimate is about, $100 million to $125 million. We'll have outflows of about $40 million for net pre-delivery deposits and another $60 million to $85 million of other CapEx, primarily related to aircraft, including one spur engine and other spare parts. Our daily cash burn averaged $2.3 million for the third quarter. This was better than our updated guidance of approximately $3 million, primarily due to better-than-expected revenue and timing of some payments. For the fourth quarter 2020, we estimate our average daily burn will be around $2 million per day, slightly better than what we saw in the third quarter of 2020. As a reminder, we define average daily cash burn as the sum of operating cash flows, debt service, total CapEx net of financing, and pre-delivery deposit payments. It does not include the impact of any other financings capital raises or funds from the payroll support program. Given that we have fortified our liquidity position, making cash burn as a metric, less relevant, we are migrating our guidance towards more traditional metrics, such as EBITDA -- on EBITDA margin. Cash burn has its uses, but becomes less important as the liquidity runway, gets extended beyond the near-term horizon, and working capital fluctuations become less important. EBITDA and EBITDA margin better reflect our sustainable cash generation capabilities, and are a guidepost for our decision-making. As an example, in determining our level of capacity our goal is to maximize EBITDA. And we'll continue to make capacity adjustments up or down, that align with this goal. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter was negative 43.9%, which is good enough for second best in the industry. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect our fourth quarter total operating expense including fuel to be between $675 million to $685 million, assuming a fuel price per gallon of $1.23. We estimate our EBITDA margin will improve considerably, to a range between negative 9% to negative 14%. In closing, our financial metrics are reinforcing the strength of our model in recessionary times. Leisure travel is resilient, especially at low fares. And we're seeing solid load factors, strong non-ticket numbers and top-tier margin production. While this environment is bumpy and hard to predict, we're ready for that. We built a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. This combined with our low-cost structure, sets us up well to manage through this crisis. So with that, I'll hand it back to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks Scott. In summary, our team has done a great job tackling the challenges presented, since March. While the pandemic continues to have a negative impact on demand for air travel, we do not believe it changes our competitive position or represents a paradigm shift. Our future is still very bright. I thank the Spirit team, for doing a great job managing through this crisis. When I list the accomplishments of the Spirit team on my whiteboard, I'm proud to say that we have addressed many of the issues we identified in March. Such as, to ensure the health and well-being of our guests and team members during this pandemic, to solidify our cost advantage and minimize our cash burn, to fortify our liquidity position and to pivot our network in ways and magnitude that I never thought possible. Operationally we're doing great. Our guest satisfaction metrics are higher than they have ever been. And our low fares plus ancillary revenue strategy is capturing ever higher load factors. Soon it will be time for us to turn our attention to the recovery. And I look forward to Spirit finding ways to continue to build upon our advantages and resume the company's growth in ways that will enhance our profitability and shareholder return. With that, back to DeAnne.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, Ted. James, we are now ready to take questions from the analysts. [Operator Instructions]\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Helane Becker.\nTed Christie: Good morning, Helane. Hello?\nHelane Becker: Sorry. Good morning. Can you hear me?\nTed Christie: Yes, now we can hear you. How are you?\nHelane Becker: Okay. Not like 100% certain what happened there. Okay. So I just have \u2013 first of all, thanks for taking my question. And I see sequentially you guys actually did a really good job on generating higher revenue. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of traffic coming back? I mean, it just seems like what percentage of maybe Orlando or Fort Lauderdale you're seeing that may have come back number one? And number two, what's the time line to get to nonfuel unit costs back down to 2019 levels? Thanks.\nTed Christie: Okay. So I'm going to \u2013 I'll kick off. I'll let Matt and Scott fill in around the edges. But as it relates to the first half of your question with regard to network strength regionally, I think as we indicated on our previous call earlier on in the pandemic during the summer Florida for sure \u2013 more of Florida airline nearly 50% of our capacity touches Florida. And Florida was, having its issues with the coronavirus. And I think we are seeing that in our activity and in our bookings and probably feeling a little disproportionately disadvantaged as a result of our geographic focus in Florida. That has turned and Florida has responded well. So we're seeing good activity across the state in Fort Lauderdale, which is clearly our home and in Orlando and the West Coast as well. And as Matt indicated in his comments that flows down into the Caribbean, and you can tell from our ads there that's been productive. Matt, do you want to add anything more and we can turn it over to Scott from there?\nMatt Klein: No, I think, I would just add that as we've seen more things open up in Florida, and we've seen this in other parts of the country, as well Helane not just here in Florida. But as there are more things to do for example, once the beaches opened up here in Florida and remained open people from up North knew that, there were things to do once they got down to Florida for example. And that's true across other parts of the country as well. So as Ted mentioned there was some impact early on from our geography and it feels like that's rebounded and we're set up well for the holidays we feel. Scott?\nScott Haralson: Yeah. Hey, Helane, this is Scott. I'll answer the back half of that question. When we think about 2019 CASM ex so we were able to cut expenses out of operating costs this year reduce fixed costs, but we were already very lean pre-COVID. So we also expect to see pressures in 2020, 2021 and beyond an airport cost. Airlines are having to cover some of the deficits at the airports today in the near term. Don't know, how long that will extend. And SWB will continue to rise here at Spirit and in every other airline. So we're not the only ones having to deal with some of the industry pressures. We're also going to lean a little bit more to lease financing versus debt financing in the near term. So that's going to pressure CASM. So getting back to pre-COVID CASM levels, it's going to be difficult and that's easy to say. But we haven't given up on that at all. We have some levers we can pull, to help mitigate some of these pressures. But it's still a little early to really talk about post-CASM, but those are really the puts and takes of what it's going to take to.\nTed Christie: The only thing, I'd add is 2019 as you recall it feels like miles in the rearview mirror. But it's a difficult operating year for Spirit. We actually had quite a bit of challenges earlier in the year and in the summer. And we spent a lot of money, recovering from that. And that amongst other things will be a tailwind for a very better going forward, because we've got that benefit. So as Scott said, there's definitely pressures that we're seeing across the industry. But our objective here is to maintain and widen the competitive advantage that we have against everyone else. And when we look at the way things are set up, when we look at how other airlines are going to have to deal with similar challenges, I like our puts and takes better than theirs. And so whether or not we achieve absolute CASM levels of 2019 in 2021 or 2022, we don't know exactly. But as Scott said, we haven't given up on that. What's more important is that we're expanding upon the advantage that we have against other airlines. And we do think that that's very achievable in near-term.\nOperator: Our next question is from Savi Syth.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. Just if I look at your capacity with much of the capacity being in November, December, understanding that things can change, but if current trends hold should we expect kind of similar trends in January, February to what we're seeing in October and perhaps March seeing that better improvement? Is that the kind of basic planning approach?\nTed Christie: Hey, Savi, it's Ted. So we've been quite tactical and \u2013 about our capacity throughout the course of the pandemic and you've seen it in the way our network has pivoted around. I mean, we were flying 50 flights a day in May and flying 550 in July and flying 300 in August or so. So we've been very careful at reading the signs in the tea leaves. Right now, we feel very good about how we're positioned in November and December. And we will digest that information and evaluate what that means for us in January and February. One thing, I would say and based on the experience we saw in September and October the off-peak didn't necessarily behave linearly the same way it would normally. So as you're building your way through the recovery it's not same thing to say well September should be off versus where August was or January should be off of where November was for example. I think it's just a different setup. So if things continue along this momentum change you're going to see us continue to add back. And if we're right and this is -- and our Plan A is accurate we think by the midpoint of next year we'll be closer to where we were in 2019. And taking 16 airplanes next year we can start thinking about growing again. And that's sort of our base case. And then we'll evaluate whether or not we're right or wrong in real time and we'll be able to make those adjustments accordingly. As Scott said, we've built a lot of flexibility into the model and I think we're comfortable that we've got up and downside protection.\nMatt Klein: I think -- and Savi just to add to that specifically to January and February in addition to what Ted mentioned is most of what we'll be evaluating is how we think about the off-peak days of week in those months. So we think about this strategically of course, but then as we get closer to the travel period is when we really fine-tune into what we think is going to happen with demand and what we can support on the off-peak days a week until we get back to those peaker periods of spring break and beyond.\nSavi Syth: That makes sense. Thank you. And if I might ask just on the financing side -- or the fleet side of things. Have you had any kind of discussions with Airbus on the kind of delivery schedule beyond 2021? Is there kind of thoughts on reworking that or even kind of finalizing the 100 aircraft delivery timing?\nMatt Klein: Yes, we have had our \u2013 obviously, our initial discussions there but -- and reworked that delivery stream really moving aircraft out of the back half of 2020 and the front half of 2021. And we feel comfortable that we were able to move aircraft into periods where we actually didn't have deliveries in the first place. So we feel actually pretty good about where the delivery sit as it is today. We actually might supplement some of those deliveries with direct operating leases from lessors. That's been our plan all along. So I think that would be the flex capacity. We might move up or down that amount we might look to the lessors for. But I think our order book from Airbus is in a pretty good spot.\nSavi Syth: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth.\nMatt Klein: Good morning. Duane. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you. Good morning. So just a couple of network questions for me. Such a crazy year for your network planners your network replanners. I agree you've done a good job of changing the plan when required pulling back when needed. As you think about this year is there anything you take away from this experience organizationally that improves your long-term planning process?\nTed Christie: Well, I'm going to start and I think Matt will have a comment, but I'm going to -- the answer to the question is absolutely, yes. So this has been a horrific period for the airline industry in general and for us. I'm not going to try to sugarcoat it. But we've implemented some very interesting close in monitoring around how route profitability is trending in ways that we probably hadn't done before maybe because we were spoiled with how our network always responded. But it clearly gives us enhanced visibility closer in. And so I think that's the first thing. I think the second thing is, while we're thinking about where we sit today as it relates to profitability or lack thereof or focus on cash generation, I think, we've developed some interesting tools around that too at what is optimal capacity, which in some places is very intuitive and some might be counterintuitive to be honest. So I think we've thought about both network placement in different ways. We can be much more dynamic in that but also in capacity deployment and be very thoughtful about that. So...\nMatt Klein: That's right. Duane, I would just simply add that this for the most part falls along the lines we've been talking about for a few years of just being as data-driven as we possibly could be. And other aspects of the company where we've been collecting data and synthesizing it in a certain way really has come through big time, and we're using it in the network planning side that we really hadn't even anticipated previously. So as Ted said, it's been great to use new pieces of data and think of it in ways that weren't necessary bore and now they're necessary and we have a good infrastructure in place now for the future as well.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks for that. And then just along those lines as we think about kind of the industry revenue recovery, it's a bit of a chicken-and-egg challenge right? Like if the industry -- if the inventory is not on the shelf you're not going to generate the revenue. And there's just so many markets right now that do not have direct service. So as you look at the world from here going forward is this a time for breadth, or is this a time to invest in building some depths in specific markets? And thanks for taking the questions.\nTed Christie: Sure. It's a great question. And as it relates to right now October 29, the answer is we've obviously had to pull flying from our core network that over time we expect will come back. So the first move is restoring the core network back to where we believe it needs to be. In the mix in there is an evaluation of opportunistic advancement. So we have looked around throughout the country and in Latin America and attempted to determine are there areas where we would like to be that we have opportunity perhaps to get into? Obviously, Orange County is an example of that. But your idea or your concept of depths and breadths we always have looked at that way. So, the first step has to be to get the network back to where it was before. Because we believe that's the -- those are the best flying ideas on the table right now still for the most part. And then be opportunistic around that as well.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the thought.\nTed Christie: Yes. Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Hunter Keay.\nHunter Keay: Hi everybody. Good morning.\nTed Christie: Good morning.\nScott Haralson: Hey Hunter.\nHunter Keay: On the 319, Scott, just remind me you said they're all grounded. Is that correct? And then would you -- if you're struggling to drive out CASM a little bit and demand continues to get a little bit better is there a scenario where you don't bring those planes back and you maybe replace them? Is that what you're kind of referring to when you talk about supplementing deliveries with some operating leases? Would you use those scenario, or you would maybe just not bring 319s back and just basically swap amount for larger A320 family aircraft?\nScott Haralson: Yes. Right, right. So, it's Scott, obviously. So, yes, today the 319s are parked, not necessarily grounded but just -- they are parked in advance of the time period where we think they'll be useful again. So, when we think about the 319s obviously, we've been planning for those to go away at some point because they are our aging fleet. They're our oldest aircraft in the fleet. So, we have planned out into the future at some point where we would likely replace those either with 319s or 320 or 321 aircraft whatever that may be. So, it's really a matter of timing. If we accelerated those retirements today or if we felt there was an opportunity to fly those in the near-term because when you think about it the marginal cost of those aircraft it's pretty small today. We own those outright and they have some unique timing components that make operating them fairly inexpensive. So, there are some things we can do with that aircraft depending on what happens with demand. So, right now we're viewing it as flex capacity. But depending on where the market is for A320s and all those things it may change which aircraft we view is the right aircraft for us over the near-term. So, those are all the sessions that are going on right now. We're not ready to make a call on what will happen to the 319s in the near-term. But it's really going to be demand-driven. \nHunter Keay: Okay. Thank you. And then what percentage of your customers fly alone?\nScott Haralson: Well Hunter--\nTed Christie: I don't know the number off the top of my head.\nMatt Klein: Yes. We're actually not dissimilar from other airlines that I've worked at in the past. So, it's going to be roughly around half the passengers are flying on their own in a PNR.\nHunter Keay: Okay, got it. Thank you, Matt. Operator Our next question from Jamie Baker.\nJamie Baker: Refreshing but not surprising to hear the term PNR as opposed to six-digit record locator. You -- just one of my industry knits. So, last week -- early last week the week-on-week growth in TSA screenings started to slip into negative territory. I'm wondering if that's consistent with what you're seeing on the volume side. Or if possibly there's somewhat of a corporate influence on that broader metric in which case your figures might be better?\nTed Christie: Hey Jamie it's Ted. So, as we indicated and I think it was in Matt's comments too while there is clearly headline activity and that's ebbed and flowed throughout the course we haven't seen anything yet that would reflect that in the way that our booking trends have moved. So, it's possible that the flux in TSA capacity may be related to other demand segments that we're just not carrying to your point. But at least as of today we haven't seen a change in trending but we're sensitive to that. So we're watching it. And I think we wanted to make that clear in our prepared remarks that we're always being careful around the ASM and we think we're prepared to deal with it one way or the other.\nJamie Baker: That's very helpful. Second -- and a relief. Second point, you made a good point about how your monthly capacity has jumped around. I'm curious though if this is just sort of using your existing operating muscles, or if there are some best practices that you're picking up. Again specific to how you operate your response to Duane's question was helpful but it was more about how you are analyzing some of the data. What I'm wondering is whether there's a corresponding operating component as well. We've always thought that nimbleness was very much part of your model. It just -- it feels like you're getting better. I'm just not quite sure what measures to look at to test that thesis. Thank you.\nTed Christie: Thanks for the compliment. I would agree with you and I'm extremely proud of the team because I think they haven't -- I would call them best practices, but I'm not sure some of them come from somewhere else. I think we've developed a few things on our own. It starts with the network clearly. And the network team has come up with a way to make that network much more building block in plug-and-play than it used to be before. So flights can come in and go out and be less damaging to the crew network, which ends up being our Achilles heel from time to time. And so, I think it starts there. And then our operators have navigated that flocks extremely well. So it's in the way we're doing line construction. It's in the way that we've worked with our union leadership on bid procedures. It's a variety of different small things that have added up to us being extremely close to running tactical than we used to be before. And, I guess, their best practices, some of them -- I'm not -- I wasn't aware of, to be honest. So I think we came up with them. So -- \nMatt Klein: Yes, that's right. And, Jamie, what we're doing here is working very, very closely, as Ted mentioned, between the network planning and the scheduling group and the operating groups. And we're flexing up and down around peak travel periods. We do that every year. This year is even larger than normal. And part of that can be multiple day transition schedules to make sure the aircraft need to go where they need to go, get the crew and position and be ready from a maintenance perspective. So, all of those things coming together. We've been building our team and getting ready for this. And the team that's in place here knows how to do that. And I think our completion factor, as Ted mention, and our on-time performance speaks to that. So it's been great to see everyone work together. On things added, some airlines have traditionally been siloed off. Here everything is one big ecosystem and working well together.\nJamie Baker: Solid answers. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator: Our next question from Mike Linenberg.\nMike Linenberg: Hey. Good morning everyone. I guess, two here. Matt, just to you, we hear a lot about how short the booking curve is. And obviously as we approach the holiday season, it is getting a little bit longer. But if you could give us a sense of maybe what percent of tickets on Spirit maybe are being purchased within. I don't know, if it's three or maybe seven day is the right network versus what it was a year ago maybe sub-Q and how that's trending in the fourth Q?\nMatt Klein: So, Mike, that's a great question and one that I cannot answer for you. But I can tell you that directionally we are seeing the lengthening, as I said. And what we are seeing is around holiday periods, it's compressed and it's more compressed than you'd like to see, but it is lengthening. And even just in the last week or so, we've started to see the curves really kick in, which we were expecting to see and the good news is that it's happening. And to me, that's what's important, is making sure that what's happening is matching up to our expectations in this compressed curve environment. So that is what I can say for that answer.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. And then just, second, when you look at other carriers who are sort of rolling out their own predeparture COVID testing type processes, can you talk about maybe what you're doing on that front? And sort of in the context of we have American looking to do something with flights to Jamaica, Costa Rica, Bahamas. Obviously, those are cities or markets that are important to the Spirit network. Or is this kind of a situation where maybe it's better for Spirit to be a follower rather than a leader, just given your price-sensitive customer base? So sort of a broad question there, but I'm just curious about your take on all of it.\nTed Christie: Sure, Mike. It's Ted. So I never like to use the word follower, but I think in this regard the industry is figuring out what the best answer is. Right now, there are in some circumstances testing available that tends to be passed through to the customer. So it's just access to a testing site or a location and then, it's done and that's been the first step. We've been in conversations with a variety of airports who are looking at establishing fixed locations within the airport to make it accessible right there to the -- if they have quick testing available and that becomes more routine. That could be the next step. And I think these things at the margin would be helpful for us, because our international network does require a lot of babysitting with regard to testing today. And so, we have had to navigate. I don't know if we'll be the leader on whether or not we integrate it into our process or for lack of a better word which tends to be a dirty word for us, bundle it, right? But I think we will be looking and talking with airport authorities, for sure, about the best way to make it available to make it more convenient for our guests.\nMatt Klein: Yes, that's right. So, like -- I think your question is more about on the demand generation side, probably more than anything else and that's what Ted was referencing. Just operationally, we have quite a few number of destinations that require certain kinds of tests that we have to, in fact, do checking on before the guests would even arrive into those international destinations. So there is definitely some growing pains for a couple of weeks on that. But it's all under control now and we feel pretty good that we know how to make sure that we have the right paperwork and make sure the tests are correct. So at least on the operational side we definitely have a handle on that. As Ted mentioned, on the demand side working with airports, that's something that we would participate in, but we're working closely with airports to understand what that even means and how does it get in the hands of the guest properly.\nMike Linenberg: Very good. Thanks guys.\nMatt Klein: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question from Brandon Oglenski.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. And I got to admit I'm still cracking up about the single joke. Maybe you guys should get a partnership with Tinder or something really spice up the frequent flier program. Sorry, I\u2019m divorced. So, that's pretty funny to me. Ted on the outlook for EBITDA margins, we really appreciate that. But do you think you can get to a breakeven outcome with industry revenue still not recovering or let's say corporate travel not back, because aren't your larger higher cost competitors going to be seeking out the same markets as you guys? So do you think as investors here we just have to wait it out?\nTed Christie: So it's a great question. And we've spent a lot of time evaluating our position versus the market and Scott will follow me here because he has some thoughts mathematically on how it works. But I've heard other carriers reference what percent of last year's revenue that they need to get to in order to break even and that seems to me to be a little bit unfair when you're not also referencing how much capacity you plan to fly or what the inputs to the revenue are, which could be load or yield. And so I think, if you fly for example one flight, you can breakeven with at a 50/50 fixed versus variable, you could break even with 50% of your revenue. Clearly that's an impossibility from a yield perspective. So clearly what we do know today is that the low-fare leisure customer is the market. The question will always be who can carry that traffic at a breakeven or better outcome? And based on fares that we see prevailing today, we can do that eventually when we get our capacity back to where it needs to be, we will produce results that will be positive EBITDA and eventually trend our way back into profitability and where we want to be. Unfortunately higher cost carriers have a much higher hurdle rate, and therefore their breakeven load factors at these prevailing fares are considerably above 100%. So there will have to be a rationalization eventually in there, and I think we're prepared to navigate it. Scott what would you\u2026\nScott Haralson: Yeah. I think to push on that a little bit further is that any business that has a high fixed call-through as airlines do, it's very difficult to get to cash breakeven with a limited amount of capacity. And so the relative nature around yield is the critical component right? As you fly less of your capacity, you need higher yields in order to reach that breakeven almost to the point where the way the math works is if you're flying 100% of your capacity and we've talked about this before, your reduction in revenue that you can handle is really your EBITDA margin. That's your best proxy for reduction. Now you could also handle a corresponding reduction in capacity to that level but you would need the same previous yield. So either a reduction in capacity or reduction in yields gets you to that same EBITDA margin breakeven point. Now if you start to reduce capacity and you're having yields that are lower than previous numbers, it makes it more and more difficult to get to cash breakeven. So I think that's what the industry has either learned or will learn or they already know the dirty little secret is that you need the capacity and the yield to get to cash breakeven. With both of them down, very difficult to do.\nTed Christie: And clearly the ramp for us to get back to our previous capacity and a yield that gets us to breakeven is smaller than it is for anyone else because our fixed base is smaller.\nScott Haralson: So it's a critical point that Ted said the hurdle rate is lower. So you should naturally expect low-cost carriers Spirit included to fly more than the higher cost carriers. The hurdle rate is just lower. And the rate between covering variable and total allocate, a fully allocated cost is just smaller. So the way the math works is we'll fly more as an ultra-low cost carrier and we'll be likely to get to cash breakeven quicker and profitability quicker. That's just the way the math will work. And who's flying today is our low-cost leisure travelers. We're set to carry those. So that's just the way it's playing out.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate the thorough response. And I guess if I can follow-up on that. Matt I think you mentioned that your ancillary or non-ticket revenue was actually up or if you could comment on that. But also in a no change fee environment going forward with a lot of your competition moving there does that change the dynamics at all on ticket versus non-ticket?\nMatt Klein: Sure Brandon. So right now our change fees are waived just like the rest of the industry. So there's no product differentiation there right now. And in fact right now our change fee revenue is basically zero. So when I talk about the October non-ticket rate being up slightly year-over-year that's in the face of headwinds like no change fee revenue. So just think about that, however, that's a relatively large piece that's just gone away yet we still are having the success. And it's going to be based on things that we've been talking about for a while, which is understanding how best to price our seat assignments how to think about the merchandising of bags and when they're purchased and the purchase process. And also we're doing a really great job at the airports with making sure we understand what -- when to collect for a lot of those charges as well. Overweight bag fees is something that we've done a great job in making sure that we do a good job of collection on. And some of the technology we're putting in place will actually assist us in that over time too. So I don't know if that perfectly answers your question, but that's how we're thinking about non-ticket revenue moving forward.\nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question from Joe Caiado.\nJose Caiado: Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone.\nTed Christie: Good morning, Joe.\nJose Caiado: Question for Scott on the balance sheet. You completed your at-the-market equity distribution. You raised the $850 million in secured debt consequently chose not to take the federal loan. So are you now effectively done with your capital raising needs for the time being? And what's the next balance sheet move you need to make? Is it addressing 2021 maturities?\nScott Haralson: Yes. Hey, Joe, this is Scott. So I think you're right. I think we're done in the short term. Obviously, we're on a wait-and-see approach to see what happens with the recovery. We feel pretty good about where the balance sheet is today. We've been able to maintain the health of the balance sheet. Our net leverage is at a reasonable level up a little bit from 2019, but not considerably. That was our goal as we thought about reading capital. So the CARES Act and the equity capital provided us a good bit of flexibility here. So we feel like the balance sheet is in a good spot. Now we need EBITDAR production on the other side and we'll see how that plays out. But I think as you think about the balance sheet going forward, yes, it's going to be to maintain or decline that net leverage position. We were able to get through this like I said in the okay spot, but we'd like to reduce that over time and that's going to come from EBITDAR production. So as we get back to profitability that's going to be an important trigger for us. And it really might change in the near term how we think about financing the fleet. We talked about more leased aircraft versus owned. So capital deployment will be important. But I think the idea is to start thinking about the net leverage position. We may not actually pay down debt. We may carry an extra cash by a little higher cash balance in the short term. So net leverage will be down. There will be a little cost of coverage, but we're going to play with either paying down debt or just carrying more cash. So it's really about net leverage.\nJose Caiado: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then just a quick follow-up -- a quick modeling question I apologize. Still for you Scott. How should we think about the salaries and wages line moving forward? It was about flat in the third quarter. How should we think about that for the fourth quarter? And then also for 2021, if you can help us out there at a high level, just given the voluntary savings that you've secured from your employees through next May and your base case assumption that you might be close to 2019 capacity levels by next summer? Thanks for the time everyone.\nScott Haralson: Yeah. So a couple of puts and takes here. So for Q4, we're going to be about flat in SWB. We're going to fly a little bit by our airline in Q4 probably around 10% more in Q4 than we did in Q3. So we do have benefits from more leads in Q4 than we had in Q3, but we did have a considerable amount in Q3 as well. So that is a little bit of a -- to make sure we haven't modeled correctly that the number is -- maybe not -- we said $15 million is benefit to not having furloughs and leaves and said. So that number won't actually play out in the fourth quarter because we had about half of that in the third quarter. So that flat quarter-over-quarter SWB number is mitigated a little bit by capacity increases in there as well. So when we think about next year, we haven't completed our budgeting process for 2021. So it's difficult to say. But we will be a beneficiary of some of the reductions in force that we have this year. But we are planning to grow the airline again. So we're going to have increased training and crew costs to make sure that we can fill those. So I think we're going to get back on that normal run rate. We may see some ASM benefit in some areas. But I think on an ASM basis we may be pretty close to last year 2019.\nOperator: And our next question is from Kathryn O'Bryan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks so much for the time.\nTed Christie: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. So maybe just coming back to this non-ticket per passenger strength. I've been impressed how well that's held in, especially in light of the growing gap between non-passenger and -- excuse me non-ticket excuse me not non-passenger, non-ticket and average fare. Is it that demand for those projects is just inelastic once the ticket has been purchased? Hello? Can you guys hear me?\nMatt Klein: Yes. We just heard some music.\nUnidentified Analyst: Oh, yeah.\nDeAnne Gabel: Can you repeat last part of the question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Sure. So basically the question is, is demand for these non-ticket products just inelastic once the purchase has been once the ticket has been purchased, or are you seeing an increase in demand for things like seed assignments with COVID, or is this really your own systems getting better? And then I guess is that what we should expect to be driving the strength in terms of revenue acceleration into the fourth quarter, or should we also expect loads and fares to improve as well just underlying that revenue outlook. I realize a lengthy question there. So thank you.\nTed Christie: All right Katherine. I'll try to knock them all out there for you. I would say that our guests recognize that optionality has value. And right now in this environment, I think that our guests want to -- we're just having a further validation that what -- choosing what they want as part of their travel experience is winning right now. And I would say, there's some level of inelasticity in there, because there's definitely sort of a floor that we feel comfortable with. But overall, we're just doing a much better job as the years go by of understanding the demand on certain products understanding -- especially say our big front seat product and understanding the constraint on that supply and how to drive yield out of that. Also what's helping is our revamped mobile app is definitely a better booking experience, including ancillary products. So a lot of the technology involved continues to improve. So, it's not just understanding the demand environment. It's also the distribution of the products has improved. In terms of when we think about overall production in the fourth quarter, we continue to see good sequential traction as it relates to load factor ancillary revenue as well as the passenger fare. So, again, sequentially we are seeing good strength across the board. And I would add to that that historically as we see the passenger fare improve the ancillary production improves marginally related to the fare itself. So that should act as a further tailwind as passenger fares return to normal after we get through the worst of the pandemic. We would expect that to be a tailwind additional to the improvements that we've seen during the pandemic itself. So I tried to be thorough but hopefully I caught it for you.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. That was great. Thank you so much for that. And if I can maybe just fill out one quick one for Scott. On the sale/leaseback like what does that market look like right now from an airline perspective? Is it getting more attractive as lessors looking to add growth opportunistically, or are terms getting a bit more expensive as more airlines are looking to this financing option just given that balance sheet are generally strapped. Thank you so much for your time everyone.\nScott Haralson: Yeah, Katy. It's Scott. Good question. It's moved around. I think early in the process in the COVID crisis lessors were not willing to put additional capital to work. So the sale/leaseback market was tough.  But I think we've seen it open up, especially for good credits like Spirit, I think most of the money is going to navigate towards credits like us and other U.S. carriers. So that market is opening up as we speak. So I think the rates that we're seeing are going to be pretty similar maybe a little bit higher than pre-COVID numbers or pretty close. And by the time that we go-to-market with an RFP either late this year or early next year, we expect them to be pretty competitive to pre-COVID levels.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And next question is Joseph DeNardi.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Good morning.\nTed Christie: Hey, Joe.\nJoseph DeNardi: Ted I'm wondering if you see this as an opportunity to maybe broaden the business model a little bit incorporate more used aircraft and target some of the lower utilization markets out there? Are the opportunities in your traditional market's still the more attractive path? I think that's been a question for you all at various points in the past couple of years. Just curious if all this changes how you see that.\nTed Christie: Well, as -- thanks Joe. As you know our model has not been about low utilization used aircraft. We take new deliveries and we stimulate in larger markets. We do have as was asked earlier and I think Scott answered the question with regard to the 319 fleet it kind of sits in that window to be honest. And for that reason can be thought about in a variety of different ways, which we have not formed an official conclusion on as Scott alluded to. But when we look forward, we're still -- we still have a robust delivery schedule with new aircraft. Because the opportunity to do that type of flying is very -- we still see that as being very bright. So I think that's going to be our core focus. And picking up airplanes in the marketplace where we have holes will probably be done on the new side as well. Because one of the advantages that we've talked about in the past, that doesn't get a lot of press is that, our fuel efficiency will move faster than the rest of the industry because of the percent of our fleet that will be neo-powered. And I think that, that's going to be a significant margin tailwind for us over time. And so, we would expect that to continue. But I think there are -- there at least sits today in our fleet, some thoughts around should we look at using those airplanes in unique ways.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe Ted or Scott, when you think about the airline and maybe most specifically the capital structure what it needs to look like post-COVID, do you see all this as kind of once in a generation, or do you see this as something that needs to be factored in as potentially reoccurring even if not to the same magnitude. Do you just kind of hope this doesn't happen again, or do you factor in that maybe it does and incorporate that into the capital structure? Thank you.\nTed Christie: Yes. I'll just make a brief comment. Hope is not a strategy. So, we take away from each one of these things new learnings. And you heard Scott say earlier that we probably will maintain a little bit more liquid balance sheet for a little while as we think about how we digest this problem. We're in the middle of it right now. So it's hard to feel good or bad about what whether or not it's a black swan or possibly more frequent than that. But I think we -- it would be natural for me to say that we'll probably be a little bit more careful. Scott?\nScott Haralson: No I agree. I think as managers of the business look this crisis has been a scar to all of us mentally. So it changes how you think about the business. It will. And so, I think the conservative nature of the balance sheet, you'll likely see that across a lot of industries, how people think about balance sheets. Very difficult for our finance group to plan for a crisis like this. If we would have brought this up to any Board meeting or management meeting that we might have to plan for a crisis of this magnitude, we would get locked out of the room right? That was yesterday. Tomorrow is a different story. And so, we'll likely see conservatism throughout the business we expected.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks, Scott.\nDeAnne Gabel: James, I think we're -- completes our time for today. Thank you all for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Erin, and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Maria Cuartas, Senior Analyst, Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.\nMaria Cuartas: Thank you, Erin, and welcome everyone to Spirit Airlines\u2019s second quarter earnings call. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call will be archived on our website for 60 days. Presenting on today\u2019s call are Ted Christie, Spirit\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; Scott Haralson, our Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Klein, our Chief Commercial Officer. Also joining us on the call today are other members of our senior leadership team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for sell-side analysts. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company\u2019s current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements are included in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting on periods to exclude the special items. Please refer to our second quarter 2020 earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. Ted, I now turn the call over to you.\nTed Christie: Thanks, Maria, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I want to start by saying I\u2019m very proud of how the entire Spirit team has responded to the changes driven by COVID-19. Many of our procedures, processes and work environments have changed, all while our personal lives have been disrupted. Our team has done an incredible job adapting as necessary, while maintaining their focus on delivering the best value in the sky. As we begin to welcome our guests back, we are taking purposeful steps to provide a safe and healthy experience for our guests and team members. We continue to expand and enhance our cleaning procedures. During the quarter, we launched antimicrobial fogging of our facilities and aircraft, which is effective against the coronavirus. This new process further improves upon our existing high-grade disinfectant fogging. In addition to these and other enhanced cleaning procedures, we are enforcing our policy that guests and team members must wear a mask while on board. These enhancements, coupled with the most advanced air handling and filtration systems onboard any aircraft line today, we believe create a safe and healthy environment for all. Financially, our top priority is to conserve cash and enhance our liquidity position. Given the significant decline in demand due to COVID-19, we dramatically reduced our flight schedule for the second quarter. During the month of April, we made several significant schedule cuts given the highly suppressed demand environment, operating only about 50 flights per day. In May, given the weak demand, we continued to operate this minimum schedule. We increased flying in June as a result of encouraging, albeit tenuous signs of demand rebounding. These favorable dynamics, our low-cost structure, a relatively-strong June and an uptick in forward bookings for July, resulted in favorable cash dynamics for the month of June. In connection with the finalization of our aircraft deferral agreement with Airbus, we also amended our 2018 PDP financing facility, extending the expiration date from December of this year to March of 2021. Due to deferring aircraft and amending this financing facility, in June, we made a principal payment of nearly $50 million. If not for this one-time principal payment, we would have achieved nearly zero average daily cash burn for the month of June. This, of course, doesn\u2019t mean we are through the worst of it. In fact, with the recent barrage of headlines regarding the increase in new coronavirus cases, we\u2019ve seen another setback in demand. We expect the rest of the summer to remain challenging for us and the industry. However, when demand for leisure travel rebounds and stabilizes, as evidenced by our June results, our leading low-cost structure positions us well to be among the first to return to profitability. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott to discuss more details of our quarterly performance.\nScott Haralson: Thanks, Ted. I join Ted in thanking the entire Spirit team for helping us navigate through this crisis. The last few months have been challenging, and our team\u2019s perseverance has been inspiring. To our financials, for the second quarter, our adjusted net loss was $286 million or a loss of $3.59 per share. Adjusted operating expenses for the second quarter 2020 decreased 43.3% year-over-year to $481 million. These changes were primarily driven by a 92.5% decrease in fuel expense and reductions in other flight volume-related expenses. Salaries, wages and benefits expense was about flat compared to the same period last year, despite an 11.6% increase in our pilot and flight attendant workforce prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Enhancing and preserving liquidity remains the top priority. We ended the second quarter with $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments. During the second quarter, we completed a public offering of common stock, netting us proceeds of $192.4 million, completed a convertible debt offering, netting us proceeds of $168.3 million; and we increased our senior secured revolving credit facility from $110 million to $180 million, of which we drew the full $180 million during the second quarter. These transactions bring our total liquidity raise through financing transactions since the onset of the pandemic to over $540 million. And last night, we launched an at-the-money offering for 9 million shares of our common stock, which, if executed at yesterday\u2019s closing price, would yield about $150 million. In addition, we received proceeds from the Payroll Support Program portion of the CARES Act for $301 million and expect to receive the remaining $33 million of proceeds before the end of July. We are pursuing additional financing for our unencumbered assets. We currently have traditional unencumbered assets that are valued at approximately $600 million and intangible assets, such as our FREE SPIRIT loyalty and $9 Fare Club programs, as well as other brand-related assets that we believe could be used as collateral to raise significant additional proceeds. We have applied for a loan under the CARES Act secured loan program. If approved, we are eligible for up to $741 million, and we have until September 30 to determine whether or not to participate. Regarding our fleet plan, we have reached agreement with Airbus to defer some of our 2020 and 2021 aircraft deliveries and corresponding predelivery deposits. For the remainder of this year, we will now only take three additional aircraft, bringing our total 2020 deliveries to 12 versus 16 previously. For 2021, we now have 16 aircrafts scheduled for delivery versus 25 previously. You can find a copy of our updated fleet plan on our website. Of the three remaining deliveries this year, two will be debt financed, and the final delivery will be financed with the sale-leaseback transaction. 10 of the 16 deliveries in 2021 are secured under direct lease arrangements, and we have not yet secured financing for the remaining six. We expect to use sale-leaseback financing for these six aircrafts, the first of which is not scheduled for delivery until June 2021. Total capital expenditures for this year are estimated to be approximately $560 million or $215 million net of financing. The amounts not financed in this year are primarily related to predelivery deposit payments. For the remainder of the year, we estimate our capital expenditures will be $112 million or $28 million net of financing. The majority of these expenditures are related to aircraft. As we progress through the second quarter, our cash burn declined primarily due to an improvement in net sales. We define average daily cash burn as the sum of operating cash flows, debt service, total CapEx net of financing and predelivery deposit payments. It does not include the impact of any other financings, capital raises or funds from the Payroll Support Program. Our average daily cash burn trended from about $9.5 million in April to about $1.5 million in June. As Ted mentioned, our cash burn in June included a one-time principal payment of nearly $50 million related to an amendment of our PDP financing facility in conjunction with our Airbus aircraft deferral agreement. On our first quarter call back in early May, we previously guided to cash burn levels of around $4 million per day for May and June. However, we ended up at just under $3 million per day for those two months, excluding the PDP facility payment, which was not contemplated in our $4 million per day estimate. Looking forward, based on current demand trends and the operation levels, Matt will discuss, we estimate our average daily cash burn for the third quarter 2020 will range between $3 million and $4 million per day. Before I close, I want to address the question as to how we can maintain our cost advantage in this environment, even if our utilization is temporarily lower than in previous years. Our cost advantage comes from four things, higher utilization, higher density seating configuration, more efficient fuel burn and overall lower cost. In the end, the higher utilization has the smallest impact of the four, while our structurally low overall cost base is the largest contributor to that advantage. In fact, if we would have operated the daily utilization at the industry average of almost 11 hours per day in 2019, we would still have a CASM ex of well under $0.06. This is still half of the CASM ex of the three largest carriers and 30% to 40% lower than the other lower cost airlines. Point being, our cost advantage is here to stay. All airlines are going to be facing short-term utilization reductions and it impacts everyone\u2019s cost structure. With that, here\u2019s Matt.\nMatt Klein: Thanks, Scott. I also want to thank our Spirit team. Throughout the upheaval caused by the pandemic and economic crisis, our team has pulled together to support one another and the communities we serve. I\u2019m inspired by our entire team and proud of everyone\u2019s dedication during this unprecedented time. As others in our industry have commented, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on travel demand. Our total operating revenue in the second quarter declined 86.3% year-over-year. As Ted and Scott both indicated, the demand environment has been volatile. Our flown load factor in April was 17.9% on a 76% reduction in year-over-year capacity. The May flown load factor was 65% on a nearly 94% reduction in capacity, and the June flown load factor reached 79.1% on a 79% reduction in capacity. We were very encouraged by the trends we were seeing for summer travel throughout the month of June. But unfortunately, as the headlines turned negative in mid-June regarding the increase of COVID-19 cases, demand for July pulled off a bit. Having said that, we anticipate July flown load factor will be in the low to mid-60s. We anticipated the recovery would be rocky, and it certainly has been. On an ASM basis, July capacity is estimated to be down 18% year-over-year, August down 35% and September down 45% year-over-year. This equates to third quarter capacity being down 32% compared to the third quarter last year. International travel bans are still restricting us from serving many of our international destinations. But once the bans are lifted, it remains our intent to bring back service to all the destinations we served prior to COVID-19. In the international markets where we have reinstituted service, visiting friends and relatives are a big part of the demand segment and we expect it to be so with other destinations once they open. As such, we anticipate we will add back service to our VFR markets first and broaden our service as more tourism-oriented destinations come back online. The timing of stabilized demand recovery remains uncertain, but it will recover. The economy of the United States is resilient and has always bounced back stronger than it was before any previous crisis presented itself. Based on history, we believe price-sensitive travelers going to visit their friends and relatives will be among the first travel segments to rebound, followed closely by low-fare leisure travel. Both of these segments are core to our network, we are in a great position to offer low fares and doing so at a profit. And now I\u2019ll hand it back to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks, Matt. The continued health and economic crises that have caused unprecedented challenges on many fronts. Social unrest in our country is another challenge we must overcome. Now more than ever, we need to unite as a country and stand together against racism and bigotry of any kind. At Spirit, we celebrate our differences and know that we are stronger together because of them. Despite these challenges, our team has remained dedicated to provide excellent service to our guests and each other and to offer compassion for those around us. I am humbled and encouraged by the heart of the Spirit team. In times of economic and societal crises such as this, the power of travel and human connection is ever more needed. In any macro setup, fares are the single most important component of anyone\u2019s air travel selection. And the simple truth is that Spirit is best suited to carry plane loads of low fares. As our cost structure and network construction give us the tools to do so in a profitable and sustainable way, nothing precludes any carrier from offering low fares. However, only a low-cost airline can do so and win. History has shown in a multitude of past recessions that low-cost airlines outperform the market. Some have questioned the sustainability of the low-cost model, be it because of utilization, density or lack of hubs. The facts and economic realities favor our model during periods such as this. Discussions about market share, marginal cost and hub economics are irrelevant to our business model. We will selectively deploy our assets in ways that we believe drive the best possible return, get us through cash neutrality, and on our way back to profitability. While it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to when demand will return to normal, one thing is very clear, the margin of travelers needed for Spirit to achieve these goals is significantly narrower than it is for any other airline. With that, back to Maria.\nMaria Cuartas: Thank you. We\u2019re now ready to take questions from the analysts. We ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. Erin, we\u2019re ready to begin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Savi Syth [Raymond James]. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nTed Christie: Hi, Savi.\nSavi Syth: I wonder if you could provide a little color. I appreciate the trends have maybe flattened out or reversed. But could you help us understand just how the year-over-year kind of net revenue progressed? And kind of what your expectations would be, especially given the noise around seasonality?\nTed Christie: Sure. I don\u2019t introduce, and Matt can jump in here as well. So as we indicated in the second quarter, revenue really began to move in a positive direction relative to our size, of course. Throughout the later part of May and into June, and we added capacity into the summer period as a reaction to that. Once we head into the fall, it\u2019s a seasonally off-peak period of time. And I think it\u2019s fair to say September and October are going to be very off-peak this period. So I think you would expect that year-over-year revenues would be challenged in that period of time when compared to the experience we had thus far for the latter part of the second quarter and into the early part of July. But Matt, do you want to give any more specifics?\nMatt Klein: I think, Savi, as we think about the progression through the summer, I think it\u2019s important to note that the peak periods have performed relatively well. Again, this is all on a relative basis, of course. July 4 holiday was strong. There\u2019s a lot of travel demand out there. Our \u2013 I think, evidenced by what we\u2019re going to do from a load factor perspective in the month of July still speaks to demand is out there. What we\u2019re being very aware of and recognize is that as we get out of the summer into the fall, traditionally off-peak periods will continue to be traditionally off-peak. So we\u2019re expecting there to be a normal progression, probably a little more exaggerated this year for obvious reasons. And then we\u2019re just thinking about how we prepare ourselves as we head through September and into the fourth quarter and then hit the holiday periods again at the end of this year. So a little bit of \u2013 I\u2019m not going to give you exact numbers on how the revenue is progressing through the summer into the fall, but that\u2019s kind of the way we\u2019re thinking about off-peak periods heading back into peak periods.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s actually \u2013 still helpful. Thank you. And then on \u2013 just on the cost trend, I\u2019m kind of curious now that you\u2019re pulling down capacity again into the third quarter, but still above kind of the second quarter, just should we assume kind of a lower year-over-year declines? Or is there anything else that we should consider as further cost actions are taken?\nScott Haralson: Hey, Savi, this is Scott. Yes, I think when you think about the third quarter OpEx, we\u2019re probably going to be in a range of $670 million to $680 million of OpEx expense, that includes about 80 million gallons at $1.26 as compared to our $480 million of OP expense in Q2. So I think you could think about it that way.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mike Linenberg [Deutsche Bank]. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning, everybody. I guess two questions here related to Scott. The secured loan program under the CARES Act, the $741 million, the way it reads in the release, it does sound like that it\u2019s up to $741 million and the actual loan may be actually less than that. And I\u2019m just curious, you highlighted $600 million of unencumbered traditional collateral that could be pledged and then you highlighted some other items without a monetary amount. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, but does it suggest that maybe you wouldn\u2019t have enough collateral to back the $741 million, or maybe it would require almost all of your collateral that you have, both traditional and non-traditional? I don\u2019t have a sense of what the potential LTD is. Can you just add some color to that on that $741 million and whether or not you have a sizable collateral pool to back that?\nScott Haralson: We can do that. So I think for the government loan, we\u2019re targeting to use our intangible assets. So that\u2019s the loyalty program and the $9 Fare Club. And we expect that we\u2019re going to be pretty close to the value that\u2019s needed for the government loan. We\u2019re still in the process of finalizing the valuation and how the government would take those assets, but we do expect we\u2019d have enough to cover the loan if we wanted to do that, but not require any other tangible assets.\nMike Linenberg: That\u2019s actually great color. Thanks, Scott. And then just actually my second question, and again, back to you, when I think about your ATL, so from the March quarter to the June quarter, it moved from $411 million to $452 million, and that makes sense when you think about what your future sales are as you head into a peak period. How about \u2013 as we think about the split, though, call it, traditional tickets that are on the books that have been purchased versus what is potential refunds, did that split change all that much from March to June? I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like a one-third, two-thirds, carriers have sort of \u2013 the demarcation seems to be split along those lines. I\u2019m just curious if there was a shift here if it was what you saw at June quarter end, still very similar to what you\u2019re seeing at March quarter end? Thank you.\nScott Haralson: Yes, Michael, the ATL balance did grow [inaudible] as well. So with a $450-million-plus ATL, our credit shell balance is just shy of $250 million.\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nScott Haralson: So it comprises a pretty good chunk of the ATL. That\u2019s probably the way you should think about it.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski [Barclays]. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Ted, I think given that you announced the order book restructuring, can you give us any insight into how you\u2019re thinking about 2021 or even the normalized period? How fast do you want to resume growth? And do you think you could even do it before we get like a vaccine out here for this virus as some of your other competitors have highlighted that maybe demand will come back until we have that outcome?\nTed Christie: Hey, Brandon. Sure. So obviously, we worked \u2013 Scott and the team work closely with Airbus to create a little bit more breathing room for us with regard to the order book. But another component of our fleet that remains that exists today that is somewhat \u2013 we\u2019ve described as kind of a swing component of our fleet is the entirely-owned 319 fleet, which is somewhere between 25 and 30 airplanes, it\u2019s in that ballpark. And we reserve the right to use those airplanes or not at any given point, either at regular utilization, lower utilization or not at all. And so the work we did with Airbus gives us a decent amount of breathing room with regard to deliveries, CapEx and also flexibility as it relates to timing the recovery. And then additional shock absorber is using those other aircraft to help us time it a little bit better. The core of your question, which is what is the \u2013 what is our expectation and when will we time the recovery? Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have any fresh information on that that would help you. But we are using the real-time information that we\u2019re seeing today to help guide our views on what the fourth quarter peak will look like, what will look like heading into the spring of next year. It is our expectation, by the way, that the company will resume its growth. That, as Matt mentioned, eventually, the economy will recover. Leisure travelers are returning to the market already. And we expect that, that will continue. It\u2019s going to be bumpy. And so navigating that window of time is really the crux of the issue. And Spirit is assembling a level of resources to be able to do that with fleet flexibility, with deferral rights and making sure that we have the appropriate capital on board to navigate it. So I don\u2019t have a definitive date as to when we expect that to happen because we\u2019re digesting real-time information, but I think we have created enough flexibility to be able to do it when it happens.\nBrandon Oglenski: Well, I appreciate that response, Ted. And I guess this question can be difficult to answer, but is this a situation where you got to build it and they will come? Or how do you manage capacity in this environment? Do you wait to see the bookings then had to the schedule? Help us out for folks that don\u2019t run an airline?\nTed Christie: Yes. Well, it\u2019s a great question. And we mentioned this on our May call that we were not intending to lead the recovery. We\u2019re going to evaluate the market, see where demand recovers and then deploy into it, which is exactly what we did in June and July. And I think that worked well for us. If you\u2019ve seen from our forward schedules, we are removing capacity versus the peak in July as we head into August and September. And I think that shouldn\u2019t shock anybody because as Matt mentioned, it is an off-peak period, and we don\u2019t intend to try to drag the market to recovery. We\u2019re going to evaluate it. And that will mean we\u2019re going to have to continue to move the network in and out, depending on the seasonality and the pace of the recovery. So to those that don\u2019t run an airline, it\u2019s treacherous. But I do feel pretty good about our ability to use the assets we have to navigate within that window. Timing it perfectly is anybody\u2019s guess. But our focus on seasonality, network flexibility and cost structure, we think, sets us up to be able to navigate it. And that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019ve been driving the network over the last 45 to 60 days.\nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate it.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Jamie Baker [JPMorgan]. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. So a question that may not be answerable just given how choppy demand trends are. If you were to characterize how your competition is behaving in your markets relative to, say, the fourth quarter of last year, would you characterize competition as more aggressive, less aggressive or the same, or impossible to tell?\nTed Christie: Hey, Jamie, good morning, it\u2019s Ted. So when compared to a normalized period, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s impossible to tell because I think demand trend is choppy, I think that the capacity movements across the various airlines are different, and individual strategies around which type of traffic to target and that sort of thing. Those are all not normal today. So I think it\u2019s impossible to kind of characterize it. What I will say is that our activity in June and July has reinforced that low fares can bring back activity. And as the kind of media market and the news cycle in late May and early June began to turn more favorable, and we were looking towards a relaxation of restriction, leisure travelers were like a coiled spring, they were ready to come back low fares, okay? And admittedly, that has hit another bump in the road here because the new cycle has gone the other way. The numbers clearly in our home state of Florida are not encouraging. And as you know, our network is largely Florida. We have 45% to 50% of the network touches Florida. And so even specifically to us, we probably have a little bit more of a challenge right now as Florida navigates its issue. But what\u2019s been encouraging over the last 60 days is seeing how people react when the new starts to get more favorable and the information starts to become more favorable. And that\u2019s where we think we\u2019re going to be ready to deploy, okay? It\u2019s navigating the window of time in the middle there that becomes the challenge.\nJamie Baker: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up, and again, this may also be difficult to measure, but are you seeing any demand difference based on stage length? I realize you don\u2019t \u2013 obviously don\u2019t have truly long-haul flying. But any interesting leisure patterns out there? For example, consumers are totally willing to spend 90 minutes on a Spirit aircraft, but longer flights, you\u2019re seeing different demand trends, anything like that?\nMatt Klein: Hey, Jamie, it\u2019s Matt. I\u2019ll take that one.\nJamie Baker: Hey, Matt.\nMatt Klein: I would basically say the law of supply and demand continues to hold. It\u2019s probably the best way to say it. When we see opportunity to attract that kind of traveler, the leisure traveler, then it doesn\u2019t really seem to matter where they\u2019re going. If we have the right price and the right schedule at the right time for them, then we\u2019re seeing ridership of that.\nJamie Baker: Okay.\nMatt Klein: I would tell you that heading in, I\u2019d say, back in April, May, was operating under the thought that you\u2019re bringing up, which is the further the flight the less likely a guest may be willing to sit on any aircraft, no matter whose product it is. That doesn\u2019t really seem to be the case. It really seems to be where there\u2019s pockets of strength and there\u2019s demand for that kind of travel, leisure travel, then it doesn\u2019t seem to reflect the length of the haul relative to the ridership.\nJamie Baker: That\u2019s great. Thanks for taking my admittedly long questions. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Dan McKenzie [Seaport Global Securities]. Your line is open.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions here. Matt, Florida \u2013 state of Florida, 45% to 50% of the network. I know Texas and California are bigger markets for you guys as well. Has there been a difference in demand progression in the COVID hotspot states, if you will, pardon me, versus the rest of the network? And I guess I\u2019m just wondering how that\u2019s impacting or how that\u2019s affecting how you\u2019re optimizing the schedules as we head into the fall?\nMatt Klein: Yes, certainly. So we are taking \u2013 as Ted mentioned, we\u2019re taking, in real-time, all the information that we can from various states and applying that to our thought process. Back when things first started, and things started to pop up in the New York metro area relatively quickly, we basically stopped flying to the New York metro area for a period of time based on that information that was sort of at the outset of the outbreaks earlier. As that got better, we added more service back into the New York metro area. As we\u2019re seeing impacts from headlines, which are legitimate, obviously, from what\u2019s happened with case counts, some leisure-oriented destinations are being impacted, and that has a direct impact on demand. We have a relatively large presence in Myrtle Beach. And Myrtle Beach, for example, has had some negative news, and then you see bookings relatively quickly kind of tail off and there\u2019s an impact with cancellations as well. So as the headlines move around the country, then you start to see cancellations pop up and a lack \u2013 and a reduction in gross demand at the same time. We\u2019re not going to be immune to that. That\u2019s happening to every airline across the country. Right now, we do feel like there is some geographic impact to us that on a mix of the network basis, we\u2019re probably feeling more than others, but we also anticipate that will start to change as things then end up changing across the country. We\u2019re \u2013 we have some presence in California, but we\u2019re not a major player in California. That may impact airlines really soon that are bigger players in California. So we expect it\u2019s going to be a little bit of squeezing the balloon until everything is under control as the months progress.\nDan McKenzie: Understood. Okay. And then second question here, a balance sheet road map question. Scott, I\u2019m wondering what the balance sheet looks like exactly at the end of the year in terms of debt, just based on how you\u2019re thinking about what you\u2019re going to need to raise in terms of additional liquidity here? And then what is the year-end liquidity target that you\u2019re shooting for?\nScott Haralson: Hey, Dan. So we\u2019ll start with cash because that may lead into some of the debt discussions. So we\u2019re not going to give a full-year target or any guidance on the balance. But what I can do is probably walk you through some of the math of how that may play out. I mean we start today with $1.2 billion cash balance, and we have an ATM in the marketplace that you can take a guesstimate on how much we take of that in the year. We have the government loan or some type of program, where we use the frequent flyer program and $9 Fare Club as collateral. So you can take you a guesstimate on how much we could take from there. There\u2019s other CARES Act benefits, and that sort of gives you your pro forma cash balance. And then we\u2019ve given guidance on cash burn of $3 million to $4 million for the third quarter. You can probably expect the fourth quarter directionally to be a little bit better than that. We\u2019re not going to give a number because we\u2019re not sure where that\u2019s going to play out, but directionally a little bit better. So that could get you to sort of a year-end cash balance that we\u2019re looking at, or at least a ballpark. And then of that, from a leverage perspective, we haven\u2019t added a ton of debt so far, really the revolver has been the big component and a little bit of the government payroll support program. But we are going to lever up a bit in the back half of the year, either in the form of the government loan or some type of program where we use the intangible assets. So the lever is going to move up. There\u2019s just no way around it.\nDan McKenzie: Understood. Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question in queue comes from Duane Pfennigwerth [Evercore ISI]. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Thanks. Just wanted to check my understanding of your definition of cash burn. It\u2019s not a Spirit question because these definitions are all over the map. But if your 2021 CapEx is in the range of, say, $700 million, but it\u2019s 100% financed, that would not impact your cash burn. So in other words, you could get to cash flow break-even, but the balance sheet could still be expanding?\nScott Haralson: Yes, Duane, it\u2019s net of financing. So if we were to lease 100% of the aircraft we took, then that would have basically zero cost from a CapEx perspective or from a cash burn perspective.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. That\u2019s consistent. And then not sure if you have it off hand, but can you give us breakage revenue for all of last year? We got the first half with the disclosures last night. I wonder if you had that for all of 2019?\nScott Haralson: Duane, I do not have that on hand. We can see if we can compile something there. I don\u2019t know if we disclosed full breakage for 2019, but we can take a look.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then just on demand, kind of big picture, and forgive me if you\u2019ve said this already, but there\u2019s some industry peers that have talked about demand in the kind of 20% to 25% of 2019 levels over the summer. Is that how you\u2019re seeing it also?\nMatt Klein: Duane, this is Matt. I\u2019m not sure exactly what the reference is that some of the competitors are talking about. But in terms of how we think about overall demand, we also had a question earlier. I want to add to this, that Savi asked at the very beginning about revenue. We are prepared to talk about that. In the third quarter, capacity will be down 32%, as we had mentioned earlier. And we\u2019re expecting a revenue outcome year-over-year to be down about 65%. So revenue down 65% year-over-year relative to the 32% reduction in capacity for the third quarter.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay.\nMatt Klein: So I don\u2019t know if that helps add color to your question there, Duane, or not.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That\u2019s it. Sorry to have you repeat it. I appreciate the answer. Very clear.\nMatt Klein: Yes. No problem. Thanks.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Joe Caiado [Credit Suisse]. Your line is open.\nJoe Caiado: Hey. Thanks very much. Good morning. My first question is a strategic one for Ted or Matt, whoever wants it. I\u2019m curious if the current crisis presents a sort of a hidden opportunity for Spirit to actually go and seek out new strategic airport partners, whether that\u2019s in the domestic market or near field international destinations, just airports that can offer attractive fees or terms to attract Spirit to those airports sort of help them stimulate demand and support the economic recovery when it does pick up again? Or I mean, is that something that you\u2019d even consider doing right now, maybe going out with RFPs to position for when things normalize? Or is that something like that just very back-of-mind during a time like this?\nTed Christie: Well, clearly, what\u2019s front of mind \u2013 thanks for the question, Joe. What\u2019s front of mind obviously is navigating the crisis right now, focusing on liquidity, cash burn, using the network to enhance those types of things. But with that said, as we \u2013 as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect that as the economy begins to recover, that our travel segment will be leading that. And we believe that Spirit will be at the front end of it of that travel segment. So evaluating our opportunities throughout the course of this crisis, while not the first thing that I wake up and think about in the morning and the last thing I think about at night, is a component of it. And so we expect the business \u2013 broadly the industries, speaking broadly, will get smaller. And with that we believe there will be opportunity. And so thinking about how to pursue that is one of our projects. Again, not the first one, but something that we think we can do, whether or not it\u2019s exploring unique airport partnerships or expanding in areas that were previously difficult for us to gain access or looking at our existing franchises, the way we fly today, be it in large leisure destinations or even international, and are there ways for us to capitalize upon our geography, quite frankly. So I think those are all on the list, and we expect as the recovery happens that they will materialize.\nJoe Caiado: Right, right. Okay. Thanks, Ted. My second question, a very quick one, just \u2013 and apologize if I missed it. What\u2019s your latest thinking on the need for layoffs or furloughs in the fourth quarter after the payroll funding expires?\nTed Christie: I am sure. So there is obviously a bright line date at September 30, right now where the CARES Act covenant does expire. We are still in fluid evaluation as to what we think we would need to do. I\u2019ve mentioned that, as we talked about this kind of like the period of time that we\u2019re attempting to navigate until the leisure segment begins to recover, how do we do so? And included in that could be rightsizing a fleet and/or rightsizing of other fixed-related expenses and that sort of thing. We are in regular discussions with our organized work groups and they have actively been taking voluntary action to provide the company with flexibility, thousands of employees accepting voluntary leaves that help us navigate the crisis and reduce fixed expense. And so while those are on the table, we continue to look at ways to mitigate the need for an involuntary action post September, 30. But right now, I think we\u2019re still reading the game film to be honest, because the summer has been up and down both sides, and we want to make sure that we digest all the information before we make a call. Being small, being a little bit more nimble, being a single fleet type, allows us to do that a little bit closer than I think you\u2019re seeing from larger airlines.\nJoe Caiado: Got it. Thanks, Ted.\nOperator: And your next question is from Hunter Keay [Wolfe Trahan]. Your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Hey, everybody, good morning.\nTed Christie: Good morning, Hunter.\nHunter Keay: Scott, what would your daily cash burn be say like a three months lead time, if you had to take your capacity growth rate down to zero?\nScott Haralson: Well, we\u2019ve generally talked about sort of the baseline cash burn for the business at today\u2019s levels of fleet will be around $4 million a day. So that we could \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about a fixed variable component. So we\u2019d be about half of our operating expense. So I think that\u2019s probably a good number.\nHunter Keay: Cool. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks a lot. And then you talked about utilization being down. I think you\u2019ve referred twice to it as being temporary or short-term. So what is the lag between the time when you actually hit your pre-COVID capacity levels and when you hit your pre-COVID utilization level? Like, I guess what happens first? And is there a big gap between those two things occurring? Thanks.\nTed Christie: Yes. I\u2019ll try first, Hunter, because it\u2019s an interesting topic because threaded into your question is how long is the period of time that we\u2019ve been discussing this whole call, like how long is the kind of the slower part of the recovery which we\u2019re just not sure about.\nHunter Keay: Well, Ted, I\u2019ll just \u2013 Ted, it\u2019s really a cost question, not so much a demand question, just so I\u2019m clear, you know what I mean? I\u2019m really \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not really asking about like your view on when demand recovers. Just so we\u2019re clear. You know what I mean? So about the utilization lag when you can get back to that 12.3 hours per day. Sorry to interrupt you. I just wanted to just clarify.\nTed Christie: Okay. Sorry, I interpreted it, you would have the utilization go up when the demand recovers.\nScott Haralson: He said the 12.2 hours or 12.3 hours versus 2019 capacity.\nHunter Keay: Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s right. It\u2019s just \u2013 yes, what happens first? You hit 2019 capacity on an ASM basis or you hit the 12.3 hours per day first? And maybe that is a demand question. It wasn\u2019t intended to be in one, though. Anyway, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nScott Haralson: The fleets moved since 2019. Obviously, we\u2019ve taken deliveries. So to get to 2019 ASMs, we can have lower utilization.\nTed Christie: Right. And the only thing I\u2019d add, because I was going to get to it, is that to the extent that we decide to keep all the airplanes, utilization would lag the ASM production because we are bigger, to the extent we decide to keep all the airplanes. And that\u2019s the \u2013 when I said, navigating the period of time by which we believe we\u2019re in this down \u2013 still in the shoulder part of this down, would guide our decision on whether or not that\u2019s true and we haven\u2019t yet made that call. But those are the working parts. It\u2019s the fleet count and the return to demand.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Sorry to interrupt you. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nTed Christie: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from Helane Becker [Cowen Securities]. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi team, and thank you very much for the time. I know I should probably know this, and I apologize that I don\u2019t. Do you own the land upon which you were going to build your headquarters building? And if so, would you consider selling it to get through this crisis before pursuing it once we get back to some level of whatever is normal?\nScott Haralson: Hi, Helane, this is Scott. So yes, we do own the land. So I don\u2019t think the decision to sell the land would be to generate cash. I think it\u2019s really decision around what we think the future of that facility is going to be. So if we decided to continue down the path, obviously, we wouldn\u2019t sell it. If we decided to change plans, then we could sell. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s for generation of cash.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then my other unrelated question is, one of the things that has changed among some of your peer group is ancillary fees and I\u2019m kind of wondering what you\u2019re thinking about the future of those fees and how they\u2019re going to look once we get to some level where people are not afraid to fly again?\nMatt Klein: Hi, Helane, it\u2019s Matt. Good morning.\nHelane Becker: Hi, Matt.\nMatt Klein: So what\u2019s interesting is right now, in the environment we\u2019re in today, our seat assignment charges and bag charges have been relatively stable once we got into a closer to somewhat normal situation that we\u2019re in now with demand, although it\u2019s nowhere near real normal, if that makes any sense. They\u2019re hanging in there actually. So those charges seem to be ones, it\u2019s part of our model, it\u2019s core to our model and our customers are continuing to act in a normal way there. If you\u2019re referencing, say, change fees, if you mean that one overall that one is always up for discussion. And I think our perspective on that is we\u2019re going to have a structure out there that we think generates the most overall total revenue for us and still provide the services to the guests. So we\u2019re always an evaluation of all of our service charges so to the extent that we think a change would benefit the customer and benefit our revenue generation, then we would make a change. Right now in the world we are in today, it\u2019s been relaxed. We do not anticipate it\u2019s going to be that way in the long-term future. It may still be relaxed for a period of time, but in the long run, we would expect things to come back to normal as we\u2019re already seeing with a number of our charges today.\nHelane Becker: Got it. Okay. Well, that\u2019s really very helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Klein: Great. You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien [Goldman Sachs]. Your line is open.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Just a couple on CapEx, first. So maybe first a clarification, did your agreement with Airbus to defer aircraft end up resulting in a slightly larger reduction to 2020 CapEx than that $185 million target you called out last quarter? I think on my math, I was getting closer to $210 million, although there could be some other moving pieces there. And then in your 10-Q, you have AerCap CapEx of $356 million for 2021, but 16 aircraft scheduled for delivery, that seems a little low. Is there something else being netted against that? I guess just probably bigger-picture question, how should we be thinking about 2021 CapEx in total? Thanks.\nScott Haralson: Yes. Hey, Catherine, so from the CapEx number this year, really, I think the \u2013 one of the components is the net of PDPs. So if you net the PDPs for this year, we expect to have about $80 million remaining of CapEx this year. So maybe that\u2019s the difference in your 2020. In 2021, it\u2019s a little bit different because the 16 deliveries that we have, 10 of those are direct operating leases from lessors that are not part of our order book. So six that we have from Airbus during 2021 are really the CapEx of what you\u2019re trying to think about.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Got it. And then anything on the non-aircraft side we should be thinking about for 2021?\nScott Haralson: For the remainder of this year, we\u2019ve said around a little more than $30 million of non-aircraft CapEx. We haven\u2019t thought about 2021 yet. So you can use a barometer of 2019 or 2020 as a guesstimate for 2021, but we haven\u2019t done our CapEx plan for next year yet.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Great. If I could sneak maybe just one quick more \u2013 fleet one in? I know you just noted that your decision on how big the fleet is going forward will be demand dependent, but can you just help us think through what flex you have in the event you did want to get to a smaller fleet? Is it just that 20 to 25 A319 owned fleet you mentioned earlier, or should we also be thinking about lease return? And thanks again for all the time.\nTed Christie: Sure. I\u2019ll take that one. Thanks for the question. So I think the \u2013 as I alluded to, those 319s that we own are the natural first step beyond utilization, of course. So if you\u2019re just talking about fleet, there are zero-cash burn airplane today, so they can they can be partially used, they can be parked or they can be retired and there\u2019s 25 of those aircraft in the fleet today. So that\u2019s going to be \u2013 which, for the size of the airline we are actually a sizable percentage of our global fleet. So I think that\u2019s the biggest component. Lease returns. We don\u2019t have any scheduled lease returns in the near-term here. So I think we\u2019d really be focused on this sub fleet of aircraft first.\nScott Haralson: Yes. So to finalize the point, we own about \u2013 almost 20% of our fleet unencumbered. It\u2019s the 25, 319s. And we have four A320s unencumbered as well. And we don\u2019t have \u2013 like Ted said, we don\u2019t have a lease return until really the end of 2022. So it\u2019s the unencumbered assets that give us the flexibility.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And your next question in queue comes from Joseph DeNardi [Stifel]. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hey, good morning. Scott, I know the loyalty program and the co-brand card, updating those were two initiatives. And I think maybe they\u2019ve continued to progress through all this. Can you update us on how that\u2019s going? And what the nature of the conversation with BofA has been? Are they approaching things differently given the environment? And how sensitive do you think the economics of your co-brand card are to potentially being smaller or growing at a slower rate going forward? Thank you.\nMatt Klein: Hey, Joe, it\u2019s Matt. I\u2019ll take that question. So I would characterize the discussions with Bank of America as extremely stable and very productive. And the reality of the situation is that due to everything going on right now. We\u2019ve actually slowed some of our development on the program overall in terms of a technology perspective and getting things ready to go. So long answer short, I think the relationship is great. Things have been approached about the same way. And really, the pacing item is a lot of the IT work that we purposely slowed down right now just while we\u2019re thinking about CapEx overall, but that\u2019s not an indication of our lack of desire to move it forward. And we will move it forward. The time line just got pushed out a little bit due to everything going on right now.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. And then just in terms of maybe the demographic of your customers, can you just talk about maybe what portion of your customers are older just in light of COVID? Has that \u2013 did that shift as demand came back? And then have you learned anything in terms of what\u2019s effective marketing spend and what\u2019s not as you\u2019ve kind of turned off and turned on the airline over the past few months? Thank you.\nTed Christie: Yes. Sure thing, Joe. So I\u2019m not going to get into the exact percentages, but we do have a pretty good handle on the demographics of our customer base. What I will tell you, though is directionally, the ages of people on the aircraft have come down during the pandemic. So the traveling consumer on average is becoming younger on board. And along those lines also things like household income \u2013 we\u2019re tracking as much as we can, and some of those other components have changed around a little bit. As you\u2019d expect, with the younger average age, the household income has come down a little bit with that as well. But we\u2019re getting very good information these days in terms of surveys. And as the pandemic has continued, we\u2019re actually getting better information. It seems like our guests are as willing or, in some cases, more willing to share their experiences with us. And along those lines, experiences have been good. Our Net Promoter Scores have, in fact improved during this period of time. So it just goes to show that continuing to run a good operation matters, and our guests are seeing that as well.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nTed Christie: Absolutely.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew [Bank of America Merrill Lynch]. Your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. Can you hear me?\nTed Christie: Yes, we can hear you.\nAndrew Didora: Great. So sorry if I missed this earlier, but just trying to get a sense for like what type of revenue decline, do you think you need to reach in order to cash burn breakeven? Any sort of guide proposed you can give there? And I guess if you\u2019re uncomfortable giving a guidepost looking forward, maybe give us a sense of where June revenues came in to achieve that sort of cash burn break-even number?\nScott Haralson: Hey, Andrew, this is Scott. That\u2019s an interesting question on the drop in revenue. The way that we sort of thought about it technically is, look EBITDA margin is your sort of ongoing cash generation breakeven number. So if you had a 20% EBITDA margin, you could withstand a 20% reduction in revenue to be cash breakeven as an estimate. So I think at any point below that number, if revenue declines greater than that number, you have to take a corresponding amount of fixed asset of your business, especially if you\u2019re going to operate a smaller amount of capacity. So difficult to say what that number would be. But I think from a longer-term perspective, you got to get EBITDA margin at zero to be cash breakeven.\nTed Christie: And the only thing we could add to that is our EBITDA margin going into the crisis was higher than the vast majority of the airlines. So as it returns, we expect that we will be the first one to generate cash. At what percentage of revenue is the trickier question, and it\u2019s hard to say that definitively without knowing whether you mean with a stable fair or with the same capacity deployment all that sort of thing.\nAndrew Didora: Right. Fair enough. Are you willing to give a June revenue number?\nTed Christie: You mean like revenue decline...?\nAndrew Didora: Revenue decline, yes.\nTed Christie:\n\u2013:\nAndrew Didora: Okay. Got it. My other questions have been answered. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And your final question comes from Darryl Genovesi [Vertical Research Partners]. Your line is open.\nDarryl Genovesi: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the time.\nTed Christie: Good morning, Darryl.\nDarryl Genovesi: Ted or Scott, you reduced your second quarter capacity by 83%, but your labor costs barely budged. I know you have this moratorium on furloughs to deal with, but other carriers operating under the same restrictions were still able to take out 20%, 30% of their Q2 labor costs. So I was just hoping you could help us understand some of the moving pieces beneath the service on labor specifically?\nTed Christie: I\u2019ll start. Scott can jump in as well. So yes, labor costs basically flat despite the fall in capacity. I think the other input is that labor volume went up because we were a growth airliner heading into this period. So we have more bodies on the property year-over-year than we would have otherwise. So I think that\u2019s offsetting some of the benefit of the voluntary lead programs that we saw. And of course, those built throughout the quarter. So we didn\u2019t get a full run rate benefit in there and we\u2019re not set up, given the company\u2019s opportunity to eventually resume its growth profile and go through recovery as leisure demand recovers, we have to determine how much of this is permanent and how much of this is temporary. And I think that bigger carriers with more travel segments like long-haul international and business travel being larger components of it are probably making the same decisions, but maybe on a more accelerated basis because it\u2019s a different market. And so I think that could be also contributing to maybe what you\u2019re perceiving as a disconnect between where we are and someone else. Scott?\nScott Haralson: Yes, agreed. So we increased total overhead for people, probably around 12% year-over-year. And so that number is going to be a driver of the disconnect. Plus, we had some moves that we made intra-quarter that we had to spend a little money on the buy us some flexibility, that did help us in other areas of the P&L. So we were a little bit inflated in the second quarter. And that shouldn\u2019t replicate itself in the third quarter.\nDarryl Genovesi: Can you just say where you are relative to your minimums on hours?\nScott Haralson: You mean from an average crew member?\nDarryl Genovesi: Yes, I guess so. That\u2019s probably the one that makes the most sense, and where do you think that goes. And maybe the exit rate would be good, too.\nScott Haralson: Yes. Obviously, first of all for the second quarter, we operated a minimal airline. We\u2019re going to be four times the size of that in the third quarter, so we\u2019ll approach minimums, but I would still estimate we\u2019d be adding some together.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.\nMaria Cuartas: Thank you.

Please refer to our first quarter 2020 earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. Yesterday we issued a press release announcing underwritten public offerings of our common stock and convertible notes. We cannot discuss those offerings on this call and we won't be taking questions about the offerings. We will however, discuss topics covered in our earnings release and 10-Q such as liquidity, cash, burn, capacity, et cetera. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks DeAnne. Thanks to everyone for joining us today. As others in the industry have already commented the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry and Spirit have been profound. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, we were on target to meet or beat our initial first quarter pre-tax margin expectation of 6.5% to 7.5%. In early March yield pressures heightened as competitors looked to fill empty seats no longer filled with business traffic. Through the second week of March, we were able to stimulate demand with lower fares. But as events throughout the nation were cancelled, theme parks closed and travel bans implemented, load factors dropped precipitously. Capacity growth was reduced as soon as possible, but it was not fast enough or deep enough to keep up with the falling demand, resulting in a first quarter revenue decline of 9.9% year-over-year and total unit revenue decrease of 18.8%. This led to a pre-tax loss for the first quarter 2020 of $74.6 million compared to a pre-tax profit of 72.1 million in the first quarter last year. As the virus spread, our entire team quickly mobilized to protect the health and well-being of our guests and team members and to shore up our liquidity. I don't have the words to express how proud I am to be part of the Spirit team. Whether it is in helping each other, our guests or our communities, the esprit de corps of this group is unsurpassed. My heartfelt gratitude goes out to them, along with my condolences for anyone who has personally suffered loss due to this pandemic. In addition to the many actions we took to maintain our financial strength, which Scott will elaborate on, our first priority was to see to the safety and protection of our guests and team members. We adopted enhanced cleaning procedures between each flight including utilization of hospital grade disinfectant and state of the art HEPA filters on our entire fleet. We are also implementing the use of new disinfectant fogging procedures on our aircraft and electrostatic disinfectant in our facilities. We are also providing support to our guests with flexible seating while on board, travel flexibility during the crisis and expanding the use of technology to provide for contactless check in. And earlier this week, we announced that we will be requiring team members and guests to wear face coverings during flight and while travelling through airports. Supporting our communities is one of our cornerstones. As bans on travel were implemented often with little notice travelers became stranded abroad. Spirit took the opportunity to provide specially approved flights to bring stranded travelers home throughout our network. Many of our team members raised their hands to volunteer to work these unscheduled flights. Thus far Spirit has provided transportation to more than 3,000 stranded travelers, and we will transport hundreds more in the coming days. As the needs of our communities have grown, the Spirit Airlines Charitable Foundation has partnered with other nonprofits to provide food to seniors and families struggling during this time, and has supported organizations with the fabrication of face masks for health care workers, again, a big thank you to all our team members. I also want to commend President Trump, the administration and members of Congress for their support of the airline assistance program included in the CARES Act. This legislation recognized the important role airlines play as critical infrastructure for our country and as catalysts for the economic recovery. With that here's, Scott.\nScott Haralson: Thanks Ted. And I appreciate all of you being on the call today. Although, I wish it was under different circumstances. I would also like to join Ted in thanking the entire Spirit team. The hard work and dedication of all our team members has truly been inspiring. Let's talk about the first quarter, prior to the arrival of COVID-19 favorable weather patterns and strong operational results together with good overall cost control were setting us up to handily beat our first quarter CASM ex-fuel expectations of up 3.5% to 4.5% year over year. On a per ASM basis, the largest driver of the year-over-year increase was salaries, wages and benefits. Our depreciation and amortization and other operating expense per ASM also contributed to the increase. Turning to the topic of the day, that is liquidity. We ended the first quarter of 2020 with $894.4 million of unrestricted cash and short-term investments. The dramatic change in the economic environment and passenger demand led us to take quick and decisive action to preserve cash. We suspended hiring deferred CapEx projects, implemented voluntary leave programs and cut costs throughout the business. Based on those actions, before considering savings related to capacity cuts, we eliminated or deferred approximately $20 million to $30 million of non-fuel operating expense for the remainder of 2020. And we expect to increase those savings as we head into the latter half of the year. We have reduced our non-aircraft CapEx by $50 million and are in discussions with Airbus to defer some of our 2020 and 2021 aircraft deliveries in corresponding pre-delivery deposits. Assuming these discussions are successful, we would reduce our aircraft related CapEx by approximately $185 million. In addition to actions to preserve cash, over the last six weeks, we have tapped several sources of liquidity. We entered into a two year secured revolving credit facility for up to $350 million, with an initial commitment of 110 million. In April, the commitment was increased to $135 million and was fully drawn. We expect to receive a commitment to increase the revolver by an additional $30 million effective around May 18, 2020. This revolver is currently secured by about $250 million of our $900 million of previously unencumbered assets, leaving us with $650 million of other unencumbered assets to use as collateral and other secured financings should we decide to do so. We are participating in the payroll support program under the CARES Act, and expect to receive a total of approximately $335 million, of which 50% of that amount or 167 million has already been received. The remaining 50% will be spread as follows; 20% in May, 20% in June and 10% in July. These funds will be used exclusively to pay for salaries and benefits of our team members. Also in connection with the payroll support program, we are obligated to issue to the US Treasury warrants to purchase up to 500,150 shares of common stock. Spirit has also applied for the CARES Act loan program, prior to the April 30 deadline to reserve our allocation of up to $741 million. One of the benefits of the program is that we can wait until September 30 of 2020 to decide whether to take any part of the loan. If we decide to participate, it would need to be 100% secured by assets of the company and we would be required to issue warrants equal to 10% of the final amount taken. The CARES Act also includes several provisions associated with income and federal excise tax relief. We estimate these provisions will provide approximately $200 million of cash benefit before the end of the year, comprised of $180 million of tax related benefits, and more than $20 million of benefits from the deferral of FICA payments. Most of the $180 million of tax related benefits are from provisions that allow the company to amend prior year tax returns and recapture cash tax payments from prior years. As we think about overall liquidity, our plan is to raise enough liquidity to be able to remove the liquidity risk under almost any reasonable downside scenario, and put us in a healthy position to prepare for the recovery. Also, we want to be able to do it in a manner that maintains the health of our balance sheet and restores our ability to grow again once demand returns. As of April 30, our estimated unrestricted cash and short-term investments balance was around $915 million. Our April balance includes the initial payroll support program payments of 167 million and $135 million from the drawdown of the revolver. In addition to operating cash flow, in April, we paid debt service of $47 million and had CapEx and pre-delivery deposits net financing of $9 million. Our air traffic liability balance as of April 30 was approximately $400 million, of which our hold back exposure was about $335 million. And of this amount, nearly 85% is in the form of credit shells or about $285 million. Due to the phasing of our schedule changes cash refunds in April are approximately $50 million, but reflect a number that is considerably higher than we expect in May and going forward. The most important action we have taken to date to minimize our cash burn is reducing our operation to a bare minimum. These reductions are saving the company at least $150 million a month. Today, the operation is at a level that is 95% below our planned capacity. At these capacity levels with basically zero cash sales net of refunds, we estimate our operating cash burn per day is about $4 million. We will continue to evaluate options to further reduce that amount if demand does not begin to rebound in the coming months. The approximate $4 million of burn per day is calculated as the sum of operating cash flows, debt service, fleet CapEx net of financing and PDPs and it does not include the impact of any financing, capital raises and payroll support funds. In summary, we have done and still continue to do a lot of work to shore up our balance Sheet, minimize our cash burn, and put ourselves in a position to be as healthy as possible when demand returns. And with that here's, Matt.\nMatt Klein: Thanks Scott and hello, everyone. I hope you and your families are healthy and doing well. I also want to thank our dedicated Spirit team. We've all had to adapt to a lot of changes in a very short period of time. Ted gave you a snapshot of what we were seeing throughout the month [technical difficulty]. It's not possible to know exactly when the economy will improve. Given the uncertainty when demand levels will begin to recover, we are taking a conservative view. We expect demand for travel in the summer will rebound a bit, but still be significantly lower than last year. We reduced April capacity by approximately 75% versus our original plan and for May and June we've cut our schedule by about 95%. However, based on anticipated demand trends, we are looking to add a little flying back to June such that it is only a 90% cut. If trends improve in the coming weeks, then you could see us add some additional flying for later in June. It's too early to assess what our schedule beyond June will be. To the extent things are better or worse than expected, we have flexibility to adjust up or down. But our decisions on that will depend on prevailing demands. Fourth quarter capacity will be determined after the trends over the next couple of months are assessed. Rather than leading to demand recovery with empty capacity. We will err on the side of conservatism for now. So that may mean our summer schedule is under optimized to an extent if demand returns more quickly than we currently expect. However, we feel that's a better starting point versus overestimating what demand might be in this environment. When demand does recover, we anticipate consumers will be searching for low fares. Given our industry leading low cost structure, we are well positioned to provide just that. Historically, lower fare leisure and VFR travel is the first to come back after an economic downturn. And our expectation is that we will see the recovery earlier than most carriers as people begin to visit their friends and relatives, which is very much core to our network. International travel bans still restrict us from serving our international destinations. But once the bans are lifted, we intend to bring back service to all of the destinations we serve prior to COVID-19. Again, visiting family and friends will be a big part of the near field international recovery, which will help drive our international rebounds. As is also true for domestic line, demand trends will be our guide as to the pace of bringing services back online. Switching gears a bit to non-ticket, our first quarter 2020 non-ticket per segment was very strong coming in at $58.75. There wasn't one particular initiative that drove this performance, but rather a variety of items contributed. Unfortunately in this environment of drastically reduced demand it's too soon to know what to expect for non-ticket trends in the future. However, the infrastructure and planning we put in place over the last few years will serve us quite well as we reestablish non-ticket trends and production. In closing, I think it's important to state that demand will recover. The pace of that recovery is unknown. But this is a resilient industry and the economy of the United States always comes back stronger than before. As we move past this crisis, we intend to be in a position to best capitalize on the opportunities that clearly lie ahead. And now I'll hand it back over to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks, Matt. Going into this crisis, we were in a very strong liquidity position, had a healthy balance sheet and over $900 billion of unencumbered assets, which will assist us as we managed through what is likely to be an extended period of low travel demand. As Matt described, we are taking a conservative view in the context of planning for the recovery. This will allow us to grow into the demand we see rather than using hope as a strategy. We believe this approach sets us up well to conserve resources, but allow us to react quickly to the economic recovery. When we look past this crisis, the fundamentals of our business remain intact. Demand will return and we believe that our product and cost structure will be key drivers of our performance during the recovery phase. For the next couple of years, it may be that we are smaller than we had planned before the current economic situation developed. However, we believe there are plenty of new market opportunities to support our growth once demand begins to recover, including perhaps some opportunities in constrained markets that didn't exist before. In fact, we strongly believe that we will emerge from this crisis even better positioned than we were previously. If history is any indicator, low cost low fare travel is where the recovery comes first. And it is our belief there is no other airline in our space with the cost structure, brand, reliability, and network to take advantage of that better than us. Cost control and low costs have always been core to Spirit, but it will matter even more as the leisure traveler returns to the market. Thankfully, we have never relied on high yields to justify higher costs. We stimulate demand with low fares, and we believe that will be the hallmark of the post COVID-19 traveler. In the meantime, we rely on our years of conservatism with our balance sheet, our low costs and improving brand to carry us through this period. The focus now is on making sure our guests and team members feel safe and can rely on Spirit to take care of them. I sincerely believe that this period is a good test of our strategy to build one of the best low cost airlines in the world. While it may be hard to see the end right now, I am sure that Spirit will be part of that new opportunity. And with that back to DeAnne.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, Ted. We are now ready to take questions from the analysts. We ask that you limit yourself to one question with one related follow up. Rebecca, we are ready to begin.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and answer-session. [Operator Instructions] Duane, your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thank you. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to say, really good detail in the 10-Q. It's unusual to have that before the earnings call. But it did trigger some questions. And I wanted to just check my math. Your remaining aircraft CapEx for this year stood at 700 million, but you're negotiating with Airbus to get that down by 185 million and just check that 185 million pertains to this year and how much of that is financed at this point?\nScott Haralson: Hey, Duane, of the remaining CapEx you're talking about assumed [ph] to be financed?\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yeah. So is the 185 reduction related to the 700 million you have left, so that would get us to call it 500 million and how much of that is financed at this point?\nScott Haralson: Yeah, the anticipated reduction is \u2013 well, said another way, the aircraft we plan to take this year, it will be financed. The remaining component of what we expect to defer with Airbus is part of that 185.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: So where would you peg CapEx for the remainder of the year from an aircraft perspective relative the 700 that's in the queue?\nScott Haralson: Yeah, we have a financed amount of CapEx of probably around 200 million-ish of financed.\nDeAnne Gabel: That leaves about 375 Duane. I'll check and answer you afterwards, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then it said debt principal repayments for the rest of this year of 300 million, is that still a good number? There was a lot of movement back and forth with the credit lines and so that may be a stale number, but is 300 still a good assumption in terms of principle for the rest of the year?\nScott Haralson: Yeah, that's right Duane. No change in the principal payments.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then can you just remind us, I know, historically you guided to heavy maintenance? Over and above that, where does that stand for the rest of 2020?\nScott Haralson: We had initially discussed around $110 million of maintenance CapEx. That number right now is down to about $80 million of maintenance CapEx and will likely come down a little bit further as we go through the year, but right now it's about 80 million.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, that's great. And then just lastly, maybe one for Matt, the sequential improvement in load factor, good to see it get off the mat here or start to anyway, can you talk about what level of fare stimulation that required, so that may actually be some improvement. In other words, demand was not responding to lower fares, maybe this is evidence that it's starting to. So any color around the fairs required to get that and any trends regionally, where are folks going as we wait for big leisure destinations to open back up? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.\nMatt Klein: Yeah, sure, thanks Duane. So you're correct. Yields were very low as we bottomed out, they're still low. We have had the opportunity to begin to test some higher fare levels, which again, for us are still very low simulative levels, but definitely off the bottoms of where we were. So we are encouraged by some of the movement in fares from where it was, even as recently as a few weeks ago. So that is definitely a positive that we're starting to see. But again, it's on a relative basis. So just keep that in mind.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks, guys.\nTed Christie: We're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Hunter Keay, your line is open.\nHunter Keay: Thanks, operator. So most airlines generally talk about cost advantage on a unit basis, Scott, do you know what your non-unit absolute cost advantages are normalizing for growth and utilization?\nScott Haralson: You mean on an absolute per departure basis? I mean, obviously sighs \u2013\nHunter Keay: Yeah, totally, yeah.\nScott Haralson: No, we haven't done the math on a per-departure basis for the other airlines. But I assume on a percentage basis it's probably about the same as our departures are big driver of our utilization manage.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And then again, I read the Q like Duane did, but I didn't see anything in there on hold backs that seemed incremental, but can you just tell me Scott, did you say something that changed \u2013 is that a subsequent event about the hold back after the quarter ended or are you just \u2013 can use tell me what you said. I think I missed what your comments on the hold back?\nScott Haralson: The hold back in regards to the credit card, I think that has changed in regard to that. The ATL balance has moved around a little bit as the amount of refunds has impacted us, but the credit card hold back trigger hasn't changed.\nDeAnne Gabel: What he mentioned Hunter was that he gave the April and it's in the 10-Q as well. In addition to the 3/31 he just gave the April balances.\nHunter Keay: Okay, got it. Alright, thanks, everybody.\nTed Christie: We're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Savi, your line is open.\nSavi Syth: All right, good morning. Thank you. I realized we're in survival mode here. But Ted, you contemplated what things would look like when demand returns. And just kind of curious if you could talk a little bit more about what cost might look at. I'm guessing there'll be some difficult decisions around the size of the organization and the network. So I'm guessing you'll be able to maintain your kind of high utilization rates in whatever kind of the new normal is, but just how should we think about if we're going to have a few years of slower growth, what that means from a cost structure standpoint and competitiveness standpoint?\nTed Christie: Sure. Thanks, Savi. So I mentioned multiple times in the script that costs are key to who we are, that doesn't change. As we evaluate the recovery. As we've indicated, we expect the leisure component of the marketplace to recover sooner than corporate demand or even long haul and long haul domestic and long haul international. And for that reason, what we're really talking about is some of our cost advantages related to our utilization of the assets and our capacity growth. In the near term, we would expect capacity growth to be a little muted because I think there's going to be a macroeconomic effect in both the leisure marketplace as well as the corporate marketplace. But as that starts to recover, we would expect that our advantage to continue to widen these VR peers because the growth will be at the leisure side of things. So you could think about it in a capacity basis, it doesn't necessarily have to be utilization or anything like that. It's really just wherever the demand exists, that's where the capacity will be. And we feel that in our segment, capacity will follow that demand a little bit strongly, more strongly because that demand will exist. So cost for us will be about widening our advantage. And in the near term, maintaining our current cost structure as much as we can. We're going to see pressure when there is less growth, but we're going to be managing that as best we can as well. And we haven't made a specific decision yet on, as Matt indicated, on what the size of the airline will be for the remainder of the year. But amongst the range of outcomes would be that we're maybe not growing as much or perhaps a little smaller for a period of time. And that means we'll have to make some decisions about right sizing the airline at that point.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And just a follow up on the comment about right sizing, just how much of your fleet is kind of fully unencumbered or maybe leases coming off this year where you have the flexibility if you need to kind of downsize it with kind of minimal impact.\nTed Christie: Yeah. Scott, you want to?\nScott Haralson: Yeah. Hey, Savi, this is Scott. So, today we have 29 unencumbered aircraft, 25 of which are A319s, four A320s and we do have one lease that will come due on the end of 2022. So that's the extent of our owned and upcoming leases from a fleet flexibility perspective.\nTed Christie: So rough number is about 20% of the fleet right now gives us some level of flexibility. Yeah.\nSavi Syth: That makes sense. Alright, great, thank you\nOperator: And our next question is from Mike Linenberg. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good morning everyone. Just I guess two liquidity related questions here. I guess Ted and Scott, when I look at the potential size of what is available to you under the loan program, the 741 million it's roughly double of your PSP payment and I'm just curious sort of the calculus there because most who've applied are getting a number that's much less and I'm not sure if maybe you were just first in line. I realize maybe there was a bit of a land grab here for people to get earmarks, but if you can just talk about that, because it is interesting. It did stand out as obviously, a good backstop.\nScott Haralson: Yeah. Hey, Mike, this is Scott. So I think it's really the calculus behind it. The grant program was based off of 2019 payroll. And so I think the number in that perspective was a little bit depressed because as a growth carrier, our 2019 payroll had increased into 2020. And then the loan program is based on ASMs and so our utilization produces a pretty good amount of ASMs relative to the size of the airline. So I think that's where the disconnect likely sits.\nMike Linenberg: That's very interesting. And then super helpful too. And then just my second question under the CARES Act, this ability to go back with your \u2013 to carry back losses and get the benefit, you obviously took it this quarter. Presumably this discrete tax benefit, we will see this continue through the year with additional losses, if you could answer that number one, number two sort of ties into is that cash or is that just an accounting construct?\nScott Haralson: Yeah. No one is actually going to be cash and it'll be anticipated later in the year. Likely in the fourth quarter, so we'll apply for those eminent tax returns and receive cash payment in the later part of the year. It's actual cash.\nMike Linenberg: So Scott, but \u2013 and then just so I know that goes \u2013 you can go back five \u2013 is it five years that you can go back?\nScott Haralson: Yeah, it's a five year tax carry back, sort of 2018 eminent returns can go back to 2013 and 2014 cash tax payments.\nMike Linenberg: Well, okay because you've generated a lot of profit over those years. So very good, thanks. Thanks for the heads up.\nScott Haralson: Again, we leased a lot of aircraft back then. So we were a cash taxpayer.\nMike Linenberg: Yeah, very good, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Brandon Oglenski. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess on the cash burn of about 120 million a month right now that you guys spoke about. In a less robust environment later this year, where do you think you could get that to, especially as we lap some of the restrictions on employee reductions later this year. I know that's a difficult topic.\nScott Haralson: Yeah. Hey, Brandon, this is Scott. I'll start and Ted can chime in too. So the 4 million in really sort of where we sit today, we would consider to be the trough. It's sort of the bottom. As we progress through the summer and into September, the things that are going to move that are obviously going to be bookings, and a little bit more as we think about capacity manipulations and doing a handful of things around the edges, but until then, we're going to be around that number. And the flexibility would be able to come post September 30.\nTed Christie: Brandon, the only thing I'd add is, Scott mentioned bookings. The big levers are bookings and right sizing the airline. So we'll be using this time to evaluate how those trends are going. And so as we start to see traction from a demand perspective and bookings start to recover, that's going to have a material impact on the burn rate. And then post September 30, to the extent that bookings do not recover, and we're forced to make decisions, that would actually reduce the burn rate as well. So in either case, we're looking at a longer runway, to the extent there is a protracted demand decline. But we know that the way the industry is looking at it right now is, what's the worst case scenario and that's the 4 million a day.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay and then just one for Matt. The question is around the order book here, the 185 million reduction. I think you said that would be to 2020 capital outlays, right. But it also mentions that this is impacting the 2021 order book, I guess, are those discussions just initial? I mean, are you still expecting to take as many aircraft as you thought pre-COVID-19?\nMatt Klein: Yeah. Hey, Brandon. The hundred 85 is related to 2020. And we are in discussions with Airbus as we speak around the back half of 2020 deliveries and the front half of 2021 deliveries as the primary component of our discussions, so we do expect those delivery positions to move.\nDeAnne Gabel: And Brandon this is DeAnne. The stand 185 million includes not only what would be for aircraft, but also as we move the delivery stream, of course, the phasing of pre-delivery to payments also moves.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, alright. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jamie Baker. Your line is open.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. Also some cash burn questions. So in the release you say that you're working on voluntary lead programs? Can you give us an update on that? And whether there be any structural reason that your take rate wouldn't be similar at least in the ballpark of what others have achieved and how that relates to potentially drawing down that 4 million daily burn?\nTed Christie: Sure. Thanks Jamie. It's Ted. So we've worked with our partners and I'm referring principally to our flight attendants and pilots right now just because those are the vast majority of the company's workforce, as you know it on the ground service personnel, we have Spirit employees at Fort Lauderdale airport, both on the ramp as well as at the ticket counter, but everywhere else, we have contracts service providers. So those are a different discussion. But as it relates to our pilots and flight attendants, specifically, we were able to work with them to come up with reduced minimum voluntary leave programs. And the take rate in the month of May was good, it was very good. We maxed out what we were looking for. So our team has responded very well, which we like to see. And I think it's consistent with what you've been hearing from other members of the industry.\nJamie Baker: So it's already captured in the current numbers that's fine.\nTed Christie: That's correct.\nJamie Baker: That wasn't clear to me. Also, just on the aircraft side, you mentioned obviously working with Airbus and the deliveries. Have you also saw deferrals on aircraft leases, if the answer is yes, any color on terms with duration would be appreciated? Thanks.\nScott Haralson: Hey, Jamie, this is Scott. The vast majority of our discussions around the positions will be with aircraft that are taken directly from Airbus. Given the complexity of the number of parties, it's the easiest way to think about moving the deliveries and the vast majority of our deliveries are with Airbus directly.\nJamie Baker: Well, I wasn't thinking so much in terms of aircraft unit. I mean, our channel check suggests that anywhere between 80% and 99% of the world's airlines have raised their hand and saw some level of lease deferral and I just didn't know if you should be counted in that assumption or if that is still under negotiation or not a consideration of yours.\nScott Haralson: Yeah. Jamie, so if you're talking about payment deferrals. We are in discussions with our lessors, lenders and all of our significant vendors about payment deferrals.\nJamie Baker: Okay, so to be determined. All right, thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nScott Haralson: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Helane Becker. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi, everybody. And thank you very much for the time. So I have two questions. One is the model is a high density model and people are talking about social distancing on board planes. And clearly, it's not sustainable to keep the middle seats empty for an indefinite period of time. But can you just talk about how you're thinking about the model in light of some protracted period of time where you have to ensure safety on board the aircraft beyond what you already do.\nTed Christie: Hey, good morning, Helane. It's Ted. So as I mentioned in my comments we have made \u2013 we already had a number of things in place and we've made a number of adjustments to ensure the safety of our guests and our team members on board the airplane that include enhanced cleaning procedures on high touch items, disinfectant fogging and requiring face coverings for team members and guests. We think that that's the solution to help ensure that people view air travel as a safe environment. Clearly the air quality on board airplanes is amongst the best in the world. And it re-circulates quicker than in any other fixed facility that you would be in. So I think over time that will prove to be the most important component is ensuring that the guests feel comfortable being on board airplanes with these initiatives that we've taken. And that's the way that the industry will start to lead to recovery, so that's where we've been focused actually.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that's very helpful. And then my other question is, are you able to do any \u2013 to capture well enough people's information for contact tracing? And you can't stop someone for from writing on their email that they're mickeymouse@disney.com, but is it \u2013 are you able to do that? And then the other question is, since Florida is one of the first states to open, are you noticing at all an increase in bookings for later in the summer from your local residents?\nTed Christie: So Helane has it relates to the first half of the question, obviously there's PII information and the company is a custodian of that and to the extent that there were government regulation and/or legislation around contract tracing, we would be an active listener, I guess, at that point. So I think that that's probably an ongoing discussion. With regard to bookings, I'll let Matt jump in a second. But you're right. Florida has begun the process of loosening some restriction in the non \u2013 the not larger counties. So Miami Dade, Broward and West Palm, which are the three largest counties in the state are still in the phase zero of the process, but the rest of the state has started to open which is encouraging. And it is early, by the way, that process just started within the last seven days. So Matt, I'll let you comment anymore, if you're seeing any trends you want to share or not.\nMatt Klein: Yeah. Sure. So Helane, I would actually characterize what we're seeing as relatively broad. It's not specific to any given geography or region. In many cases what we're simply finding is that people are starting to want to move around a little bit. They've put off seeing significant others in other states. And as long as they're travelling in a safe way, we're starting to see come back a little bit. Low fares is definitely helpful in driving some of that extra demand. So I wouldn't classify it as any given region per se. It's just \u2013 it's going to take some time. And as things like states and beaches and attractions and other kinds of venues start to open up, we do expect we'll start to see some more confidence overall in the economy, which will lead to just overall confidence in travelling, whether it's to a certain state or not. So I think that's the best way for me to characterize it.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that's hugely helpful. Well, thanks team.\nTed Christie: Thanks Helane.\nMatt Klein: Thanks Helane.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Caiado. Your line is open.\nJoe Caiado: Hey, good morning, just a couple of quick ones here. Can you just give us an update please on the relief that you have or have not been granted from minimum service requirements? How much you're still seeking there and is the plan capacity cuts here for the balances of Q2, is that contingent on getting more exemptions there?\nMatt Klein: Sure, Joe. So we did initially go out with a relatively large list of exemption requests. They were initially denied, with the exception of one in Puerto Rico and Aguadilla, which was in fact closed. So that was granted. We then subsequently came back with a request for a number of large airports that have significant amount of service in them from other airlines already. So we were granted exemptions for six large cities across the country. We have then subsequently applied for a handful of other, say medium sized cities that we are in discussions with now on receiving those exemptions. If we were to receive them, we would have some schedule changes to make. Right now we are planning on serving those communities. If granted, we would make those adjustments. I would tell you that the way that we added back the service or some of those minimum service requirements, didn't really add a whole lot of flying into the network. I'd say it was minimal, that the bigger issue that we have in some of those \u2013 with some of that flying is more around how limited the flying is and whether or not it's providing the best service that we can be providing in this critical time right now, so that's the reason for the secondary service exemption request.\nJoe Caiado: Okay got it and then just real quick on the CapEx reductions. Can you describe more precisely what discretionary CapEx you're deferring, what those projects are and then on the aircraft side, are you actively exploring sale leaseback opportunities to further reduce that burden? Thanks everyone.\nTed Christie: Hey, Joe on the non-discretionary CapEx, yeah, we're deferring almost all of our discretionary CapEx minus a few items that will continue to be completed, but we expect that number to drop dramatically through the year. I think we have about a $50 million reduction in non-discretionary CapEx. And in relation to the sale leaseback component that is a financing possibility for go forward deliveries. We're not looking at sale leaseback for currently owned aircraft at this point.\nJoe Caiado: Great, yeah, that's what I meant for future deliveries, the piece of the aircraft CapEx that isn't financed. Okay, got it. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Our next question is from Catherine O'Brien. Your line is open.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time.\nTed Christie: Good morning.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Good morning. One follow-up on the May load factor, I think an encouraging sign, but just wanted to dig inside a little deeper. On channel checks on just now, TSA passenger numbers. We haven't really seen any list of the bottom yet month to date versus April. I realize early days here, but could you just talk about what your load factor on flights look like today? Is that above 50% load factor maybe more back half weighted or you're seeing that today and then if it is more back half loaded, how confident are you in those bookings, just maybe versus any trends on cancellations you've seen over the past six, seven weeks? That'd be helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Klein: Sure, Catherine. It's Matt. So I would tell you that in May we've been starting to see some improvements in the load factors. Part of it has to do with our schedule adjustments, part of it has to do with the way that we've been pricing the product and what we were seeing in May was definitely more than what we saw in April. And we do anticipate that as we move through May and go into June that the load factors will continue to improve. Now, we're also making sure that we're pricing the product properly and seeing where we can best take advantage of any demand that's out there. Keep in mind we're talking about a significantly depressed flying schedule right now as well. So in terms of the TSA checkpoint numbers, things of that nature, the amount of capacity that's come out, especially for us is significant. And us seeing some improvement on those loads and then subsequently, which we anticipate to see on fares down the line is going to be not a big number in the grand scheme of things right now. As we move through this month, we will then be able to anticipate \u2013 we'll be able to review trends and then see what we think is going to happen from an anticipation perspective towards the end of June. So I would love to be able to tell you exactly what is going to happen between now and the end of June and into the summer. But from what we can tell right now things are improving slightly off of a very relatively low base. And we are starting to have more confidence in thinking about how we price some of the products that we have out there. So to me, I will tell you that we are improving. If you would ask me this question three weeks ago, I would have had a different answer probably that I have today. So it is nice to see things are starting to move out a little bit.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Understood, maybe one quick follow up on that one and I have one more on the unencumbered assets. So is your book flow factor above 50% or that's more you're just starting to see some movement in booking channels and feeling good about your pricing strategy? Just trying to get a sense of how much of that commentary is actually locked in bookings versus what's expected based on pricing versus capacity. Thanks.\nMatt Klein: Right. Sure. So just to be more clear on that, I apologize for that earlier. We are seeing a shortened booking curve for sure compared to what would be normal for Spirit. So we are seeing demand come in. It's coming in closer to departure than what we have seen historically. And I think that makes a lot of sense. It's I think, as people gain more confidence in what they're hearing and seeing and feeling then they're having confidence in booking some of that travel. So the booking curve has come in quite a bit. We anticipate it's going to stay muted like that for a period of time. And as again, from a prior question, I think maybe Helane asked, as we move forward through the summer, we anticipate the booking curve is going to push back out as people get more confidence in being able to go on their July 4 holidays and picnics and seeing their family, friends that they haven't seen for what is now months.\nTed Christie: And I'd add Catie. This is Ted. The lows we're seeing are what we're experiencing today.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, understood. Thank you. That's clear. And then if I just sneak one quick one on unencumbered asset. Is this 650 remaining after \u2013is that all the assets or is there any more you could potentially add to that pool that you're not including in your current definition and then given this level of unencumbered assets, do you expect to be eligible for the entire portion of the curriculum? Thanks so much for the time.\nScott Haralson: Yeah. Hey, Catherine. This is Scott. So the 650 is our tangible asset base. We do have other intangible assets that are not included in that number. And in regards to the loan program, we've had limited discussions with the Treasury in regards to this, but the one statement that has been made is that they intend to be flexible on the types of collateral, including lifting frequent flyer program as one of the possibilities. Obviously, we have a frequent flyer program. We also have a paid loyalty program that acts very similar to that. So there is an expectation that there will be some type of flexibility. We don't really know how much yet. We haven't been down the past of discussing that with the Treasury, so we'll update you when we do have that detail.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Thanks. Appreciate that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Trent. Your line is open.\nStephen Trent: Thank you very much, everybody and double thanks for taking my questions. So I just had one or two quick ones. When we think about your ticket refund policy for example, maybe fully flexible coach ticket, you have to pay a cash refund versus other tickets, just refresh my memory, kind of what's the broad mix and how you expect that might evolve going forward?\nMatt Klein: Sure, Stephen. It's Matt. So right now our policy has been relaxed from our pre-COVID-19 policies. And right now, if guests are impacted, that their travels impacted, then we have the ability to issue credit shells for them for use within 12 months of the date of issue, which is different. Our previous policy was that you had 60 days to book your future travel. So in many cases that covered you out maybe eight, nine, 10 months, in this case now, we've relaxed that where you have 12 months to decide to travel and that you must be completed your travel within that same 12 month period. So in terms of policy for Spirit, it's greatly relaxed. In fact, it's probably one of the most relaxed in the industry compared to our previous credit shell policy. So that's something that we anticipate to be out there for some period of time. And in terms of I think, the question was regards to maybe our mix of refunds versus credit shells. Thus far, we've had quite a few credit shells that have been created. As we go through some schedule change activity, the refund number does increase. It's very specific to when we have to reduce some of our futures schedules. So those refunds happen for a finite period of time, and then they kind of go away. As we move through the summer we anticipate right now that our reductions to the schedule won't be as heavy as they are right now. So that would have a muting effect on that number as we move through the summer \u2013 spring and then summer.\nStephen Trent: Very helpful, Matt, thank you very much. And just one other quick follow up. I know that the Department of Treasury is still requiring your guys to do some flights where you sought some relief. Could you just touch briefly on what might be the opportunity to run additional Air Cargo on those flights if any assuming the natural levels are low?\nTed Christie: Hey, Stephen, it's Ted. We don't carry any cargo today. So that's not part of our operating certificate. So that's not what we're doing today. To the extent that we were to evaluate that as a future opportunity, we would, but today we're not carrying cargo.\nStephen Trent: Okay, thanks Ted. Let me leave it there and hope you and your families are well.\nTed Christie: Likewise, thank you, Stephen.\nMatt Klein: Thanks Stephen.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Stathoulopoulos. Your line is open.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thanks for taking my question. And thank you for all the detail on the liquidity and early Q release. So going back to an earlier question on how the ULCC model might have to evolve in this pre-vaccine world. And you spoke about increasing traveler confidence, hygiene kits and cleaning of the aircraft et cetera. But could you give us a little bit more sort of detail in the interim, how that works with respect to \u2013 structurally speaking, whether it's with load factors or flight frequencies. And then thinking about that, how that might evolve, as we look about \u2013 think about cash profits per flight system ROIC. And then tying that back you mentioned in your prepared remarks about opportunities potentially to go into markets that you didn't have a presence for before because of constraint capacity. Thank you.\nTed Christie: Sure. Thanks Chris. It's Ted again. So in the near term, obviously, people are getting familiar with the effects of the virus and what that's having on their travel behavior. So there are things happening in the near term here that are an attempt to kind of get people more comfortable and that can include some of the items we already discussed or obviously onboard offering some seating flexibility as well and need to be said that people request that. But to the broader question, we do not believe that this is a secular shift in the airline business. That will take some time for people to regain their confidence and to get comfortable traveling generally. But we don't think it represents a change in the way the business will work down the road. And so our expectation is that utilization will return to normal once we start to recover and our guests will be focused on hey, do I have the necessary protections to make myself comfortable and what are the fair levels that make me comfortable to get back on the road? So that's where we're focused and that is our belief. And that has been the case in other crises type recoveries as well. Post 9/11 there was a lot of fear as to whether or not the airline business would be the same and I think we proved to each other that it was actually a recoverable and strong business coming out of that. So it is our expectation. There will be some time required in there for that to happen. With regard to the growth opportunity down the road, as we alluded to, there is a possibility at least that we're going to see windows of opportunity in places where today there is constraint. And as I've said multiple times throughout the course of this call, the leisure traveler will be the vast majority of the recovery. And so to the extent that those places open up, we want to be ready to be able to pursue that opportunity, which is part of our establishing a strong balance sheet, maintaining resiliency and being there ready to capitalize on those opportunities when they occur.\nDeAnne Gabel: Rebecca, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Alright, our last question is from Joseph. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Good morning. Matt just on the commentary about some early signs of demand recovery, like how fluid is that, how quickly are things changing, like what would you have said what you said a week ago or two weeks ago?\nMatt Klein: Joe, they are moving a lot with what the news is that's going on that people are hearing and experiencing themselves. And it is moving, I'd say probably a little quicker than what I had personally anticipated even from a few weeks ago. But again, I just have to caution by saying it's on a relatively low base. So that's \u2013 in my prepared remarks we talked about taking our June schedule, we've added some more flying back in to where we initially started. So we are seeing some more movement on that, the fares are still low. If you would have asked me like I said earlier three weeks ago, I would have had a different answer to this question. So we are starting to see some signs of some traction. Again, I just have to caution that it's on a low base.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, that's fair. And then Scott, just given the conversations you're having with Airbus, can you just kind of level set like what that means in terms of fleet count? Like sometime or middle of next year, where do you see the fleet just based on the discussions you're having now?\nScott Haralson: Yeah. Hey, Joe, I can't give exact numbers here. We're still in the midst of the discussion. But I would expect our new deliveries over this call it 18 month period from the middle of this year through 2021. Those new deliveries to be down around 40% or so give or take. So you can do the math there and sort of figure out where the number is, but that's about the extent of the detail I can be at this point.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay with no aircraft leaving the fleet.\nScott Haralson: That that's a \u2013 yeah, a different discussion, but as we talk about with Airbus that's the way we're thinking about the number of deliveries coming in. We talked earlier about the number of unencumbered aircraft we have and that kind of flexibility. So those will be different thoughts and discussions about how we either exit that fleet or encumber that in some type of financing facility or not.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, thank you very much.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you very much. Everyone have a nice day.\nTed Christie: Thank you.\nScott Haralson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference."}, {"symbol": "SAVE", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-10-24 16:12:12", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Spirit Airlines' Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ellen and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like turn the call over to DeAnne Gabel, Senior Director, Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, Ellen, and welcome everyone to Spirit Airlines' third quarter earnings call. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call will be archived on our website for 60 days. Presenting on today's call are Ted Christie, Spirit's Chief Executive Officer; Matt Klein, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Scott Haralson, our Chief Financial Officer. We will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts following our prepared remarks. Also joining us in the room today are Thomas Canfield, our General Counsel; John Bendoraitis, our Chief Operating Officer; and other members of our senior leadership team. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance or results. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements, including the Risk Factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our third quarter 2019 earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. With that, here's Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks, DeAnne. Thanks to everyone for joining us today. For the third quarter 2019, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.32 and operating margin of 13.5%. Numerous summer storms including Hurricane Dorian along with record passenger volumes and our own self-inflicted operational challenges made for a difficult operating environment. I want to thank all our team members, especially those on the frontline for their commitment and dedication to provide a quality travel experience to our guests during what was a very busy summer travel season. I'm pleased to report that post-Labor Day our operational performance has been very good and we have consistently achieved completion factors at or above 99% and an on-time performance in the high 80s or better, placing us once again in the mid-pack of our competitors for the year. Over the last week, we've had a couple of big announcements. We announced that we're building a headquarters complex near Fort Lauderdale Airport. We've outgrown our current headquarters location and are currently spread amongst several buildings in various facilities. This new complex will allow us to consolidate various locations, including our training facilities and drive efficiencies and cost savings to support our ever-growing network. And speaking of growing our network, we also announced an MoU with Airbus for 100 A320neo family aircraft along with 50 purchase options. A lot of exciting things are happening for Spirit and for our guests. We'll give you more of those details shortly. But first, here's Matt and Scott to discuss our results for third quarter 2019 and our forward outlook in more detail.\nMatt Klein: Thanks, Ted. For the third quarter 2019, total revenue increased 9.7%, which includes an estimated $20 million impact from Hurricane Dorian. Total revenue per available seat mile decreased 1.7% year-over-year on 11.6% capacity growth. Excluding Hurricane Dorian, we estimate our TRASM would have been down about 1% year-over-year. On a per-passenger segment basis non-ticket revenue for the third quarter was $55.37, up 1.7% year-over-year. We continue to see improvement in seat assignment revenue per-passenger segment and the take rate for our bundled services offering continues to grow. Additionally, it is important to note that both of these initiatives still have a lot of opportunity for optimization and conversion rate expansion. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate non-ticket revenue per-passenger segment will increase between 1% to 2% year-over-year. Despite a shorter average stage than we initially assumed for 2019, which is penalizing to non-ticket per segment and the delayed implementation of a few of our ancillary initiatives non-ticket for the full year 2019 is still expected to be between $56 and $57, which bodes well for next year. Shifting now to some overall comments about our e-commerce initiatives. The latest update to spirit.com has been fully implemented and has been converting at stronger levels versus the last version of our site. Our ticket and non-ticket metrics have improved considerably on both the desktop and mobile web versions of the site. Turning to the app. The current version of the app has been in production for the last three months and we are starting to see the benefits from a booking volume perspective. Push notifications have gone live and soon we will be able to start driving take-rate improvements on products like the BIG FRONT SEAT, which will create more demand for that product and further help drive higher yields on this non-ticket revenue stream as well. We are very pleased with the continued performance of our ancillary initiatives. And together with the initiatives to launch next year we are confident we can grow non-ticket revenue per-passenger segment by 3% in 2020. Turning to network. Earlier this month, we added Nashville to the system. Not only is it a growing leisure vacation destination, Nashville is one of the fastest-growing cities in the U.S. and we are excited to add it to our portfolio. We've also been busy expanding our footprint of service to Canc\u00fan, Mexico. By March 2020 we will offer service to Canc\u00fan from 11 origination cities. Our unbundled product and focus on international leisure markets makes Canc\u00fan a perfect destination for us to grow. We've also recently announced additional flights to Puerto Rico leveraging our unique ability to profitably grow the size of this VFR market. By March 2020, we will be at 13 flights a day to Puerto Rico up from less than three a day just a few years ago. These service additions will maintain our mid-teens Latin America and Caribbean mix of system capacity. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we estimate our capacity growth will increase 16%. Now turning to our revenue outlook. Domestic and international demand trends remain strong. Our retiming of flights in our Orlando to international markets have taken effect and built upon the maturing nature these routes have been experiencing since the summer season. For our domestic network, we are still seeing loose inventory controls for leisure fares than we saw last year at this time, but demand remains good and we're capturing more off-peak volume which is translating into high-low factors. Based on the trends we're currently seeing for the fourth quarter 2019 we estimate TRASM will be down 4.5% to 6.5% year-over-year. For reference this translates to a 5.5% increase on a two-year stack versus Q4 2017. Looking ahead to 2020 we plan to grow capacity 17% to 19% year-over-year with about 100 basis points attributable to 2019 being a year with a depressed completion factor. In closing demand is good which is supporting the revenue environment. From an inventory perspective the backdrop is not as tight as it was last year but we've been able to leverage our cost advantage, grow profitably into real-estate-constrained airports and set ourselves up for a strong set of holidays in Q4. A powerful part of the story is the continued strength in ancillary revenue per-passenger segment, which coupled with the maturing network in 2020 sets us up well to compete. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.\nScott Haralson: Thanks, Matt and thanks to everyone joining us today. Our third quarter 2019 CASM ex-fuel was $5.66, an increase of 8.4% year-over-year. In addition to the transitory pressures due to Hurricane Dorian and our other operational challenges during the third quarter we continued to face ongoing cost pressures from airport rents and landing fees, ground service rates and maintenance amortization. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we estimate our fourth quarter CASM ex-fuel will be up 3.5% to 4.5% year-over-year. Shorter average stages contributes about 100 basis points to that increase, with the remainder primarily related with the continued pressures from airport rents and landing fees, ground service rates and maintenance amortization. That will put our CASM ex-fuel at about $5.55 for the full year of 2019. And in our guide for the fourth quarter, we are assuming that the weather pattern will remain similar to what we have experienced over the last six months. While we are confident we have made the adjustments to better recover in the event of a weather disruption, we are assuming a higher number of weather-related disruptions year-over-year. Turning to fleet. As Ted mentioned, we are happy to say that we have signed an MoU with Airbus for 100 firm, A320neo family aircraft, along with 50 purchase options delivering from 2022 through 2027. We will be supplementing these orders with additional leased aircraft to reach our mid-teens target growth rate over that period. This order allowed us to not only improve the economics of our current order book, but also address some outdated terms and conditions. We gained further flexibility with this order that enhances our ability to flex our total fleet count up or down, using options fleet retirements or leasing more or less aircraft. Regarding potential tariffs to be levied on Airbus aircraft, it is our understanding that deliveries assembled in Mobile Alabama will not be subject to a tariff. All of our remaining 2019 deliveries as well as our first nine firm orders delivered through mid-summer 2020 are slated to be Mobile deliveries. We do have two first half 2020 direct operating leases delivering from Hamburg. All other deliveries are still to be determined. In the near term, tariffs do not change our overall cost structure. We are working with Airbus to mitigate the impact and we remain in regular communication with our trade representatives and believe that over time, it will get resolved. However, until then it does remain a concern. Ted also mentioned our new headquarters development. This development will be ready in the middle of 2022 and we'll have approximately 200 aircrafts in our fleet at that time. Part of this development will replace the various facilities we currently lease and eliminate the need to lease additional fleets around Fort Lauderdale. The administrative portion of the development will cost approximately $80 million. We will also consolidate the four current training facilities with Fort Lauderdale into an operations training facility for our pilots flight attendants and airport's personnel. This facility is estimated to cost about $100 million. In addition, we plan to spend another $70 million building our corporate residence large enough to cover about half of our overnight lodging needs in Fort Lauderdale. All in, the total cost is approximately $250 million and is NPV positive. We expect to realize operating cost savings in the neighborhood of $10 million in year one growing significantly over time, which will drive further improvement in our relative cost advantage. We ended the quarter with $1 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments. And for the 12-months ending September 30, our average adjusted net debt to EBITDA was down year-over-year to 2.5, a level which we are very comfortable with. Looking ahead to 2020. We're still working through the final budgeting process, but based on the current mix of airports in our network plan, we are anticipating even greater pressure on airport rents, landing fees and ground-handling rates than we had initially assumed. Based on our current assumptions, we estimate CASM ex-fuel will be up 1% to 2% for 2020. From a profitability perspective, given the CASM ex-fuel pressure in 2020, we believe our expected increases in ancillary revenue for passenger segment and relative network maturity can produce TRASM to drive earnings growth at or in excess of our capacity growth rate. This would also drive an increase in ROIC year-over-year. And with that it's back to Ted.\nTed Christie: Thanks, Scott. A few years ago, we set ourselves on a course to improve our brand, our operation and our guest experience all while profitably growing our network, maintaining the lowest cost structure in the industry and growing our relative cost advantage. We've done a good job delivering on those initiatives and are excited about our future plans. Over the last three years, we have made great strides in improving our operational reliability. And despite a few hiccups this summer, we consistently deliver high completion factors and good on-time performance and our guests are noticing. This summer our guest satisfaction numbers reached record highs, proving that our investments in the brand are paying dividends. Our total addressable market remains very large and we plan to capture those opportunities by growing capacity in the mid-teens range over the next several years. We secured new aircraft orders to help us achieve that growth. And our new headquarters complex will position us to support our growth over the foreseeable future. In August, we announced that we'll be installing new more comfortable seats that will provide additional usable legroom. The seats will add comfort for our guests and will reduce weight on the aircraft acting as an additional cost benefit. The new seat installations will begin in December. And more improvements for our guests such as Wi-Fi and a revamped loyalty program are planned to come online before the end of next year. In addition to improving our product, we are committed to investing in our team members by giving them improved tools and productive training for them to drive further efficiencies and higher service levels. Investing in our people and product, while delivering consistently reliable operations, are all part of our mission to deliver the best value in the sky, while providing exceptional guest experience. Together with our low fares and our leading cost structure, this sets us up well to continue to drive earnings growth. With that, back to DeAnne.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, gentlemen. We are now ready to take questions from the analysts. We ask that you to limit yourself to one question with one related follow-up. Ellen, we are ready to begin.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Linenberg.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good morning, everyone. Two questions here maybe tied to growth. With respect to the 100-aircraft Airbus order, does that include any, sort of, conversion rates into the smaller A220? And if it doesn't does it mean that I know that at one point you were considering a second aircraft type. Is that topic now kind of behind you? And you're just going to focus on Airbus narrow bodies? Or is that topic still alive?\nScott Haralson: Mike, this is Scott Haralson. Yes, quick comment on the conversion component. We did in this order 319s, 320s and 321s so the 320 family. However, we do have conversion rates up and down the spectrum of what Airbus offers through the 2019, 2020 and 2021 as well into the 2020 if we would like to do that. That's just a mechanism and the contract -- not a hint to our desire to do that at all. Our plan is to operate the 320 family of aircraft.\nMichael Linenberg: Is there any, sort of, going down that line and looking at an A220 a smaller airplane? Or it sounds like that that is not going to be a focus over the next couple of years? Because that was at least the company was contemplating that a few years back.\nScott Haralson: Yes, the way we are viewing the small gauge is that the A319 would be that aircraft for us that's the way we placed this MoU as we sit today but we do have the option if things were to change to down convert to a 220 if we wanted to but that is like I said not the plan as we sit today.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. And then just second it's sort of tied to growth. Ted, you talked about the comment you made the addressable markets for you are still quite large and maybe this is more of a philosophical question. Do you feel like that the number of markets available to you today is similarly large of a few years ago prior to the rollout of basic economy by the larger -- or I should say basically by everybody else? Has that at all changed the calculus there? Your thoughts on that. Thank you. \nTed Christie: Sure. No it hasn't. In fact, what's been interesting to watch even in my seven or eight years here, it's been the expansion in that opportunity over that time despite our growth into the opportunities. So the relative cost advantage and fair positioning in the markets where we see that opportunity has actually grown the total addressable market rather than us consuming it at any realistic rate. That's why we feel so bullish about the ability to grow into it. What Scott mentioned is, we pursued a fleet answer that we think addresses that broadly. And we think the 320 family can do that for us and we reserve the right to be flexible within that gauge. So we're actually pretty excited about it over the next several years.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Very good. Thanks, gentlemen.\nOperator: The next question is from Savi Syth.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. Just another question on the growth here. I wondered, I'm a little bit surprised by the level and just kind of wondering if you could give a little bit more color on where that will -- generally how -- what the growth will be made up of and kind of your confidence on driving the revenue line? It seems like it's coming from ancillary but is there anything else and most of it also is on the operational front, given, is it going to be with fewer departures so that you don't have the operational issues that you had this year just a little bit more color on the growth? Thanks.\nTed Christie: Sure, Savi. It's Ted. I assume you're talking about the 2020 forecast for growth. So what we're assuming in there is a few things: one is the stage will probably stretch back out again. So that's going to give you a little bit of mathematical growth by a couple of points. In addition to that, as Matt mentioned, 2019 was an artificially depressed year due to some of the operational challenges beginning in Easter, through the summer and into the hurricane season, so that actually adds another point. When you start kind of normalizing for that you're really landing mid-teens on a stage-neutral basis, which is about where we would plan to be. Now I'd tell you that, one of the exciting things for us from a fleet deployment perspective is our ability to optimize the gauge within the network. And one of the things we've alluded to, since we started taking the A320neo aircraft is once we got scale in that fleet type, it was going to become the long-range airplane in the fleet, which is clearly accretive to margin, it's accretive to earnings and it's dilutive to CASM ex and produces capacity. So we're finally at a position today. In fact, today we have 31, 319s in the fleet and those are our long-haul airplanes. As of today, we have about 14, 320neos and by the end of the year we'll be almost 20. So we're finally getting to the point where we can actually subfleet that airplane and have it run the way it was built to run and we think that's going to be beneficial to gauge, which is another net benefit I guess to growth. So net-net, we feel what we feel like we are consuming the right opportunities next year. I think if you normalize for the couple of things I'd say, we are very much in line with the company's growth rate over the last few years. And what I would also add is that, because I think you alluded to is how do we feel about unit revenue production going into next year. Clearly as we mentioned, we got a little bit of cost pressure heading into next year, if you figure that that's 100 to 150 basis points of cost pressure, that's going to pressure the margin probably by about a point. But as we talked about ancillary performance, we expect to be up almost 3%, which is really almost 150 basis points on the margin right there. And as we've talked about this year, we've had network maturity drag throughout the course of the year both in the amount of new flying relative to the market and international exposure out of Orlando. Both of those things we figured was around 100 basis points each throughout the course of the year. So when you start to add this stuff up, you set yourself in a position where we're actually got margin tailwind kind of coming out of the box and then it's just a question of how the industry capacity stacks up and how the environment looks from a competitive standpoint. But I think we're set up pretty well to deliver good earnings growth next year.\nSavi Syth: And to step back my question on that, so should we assume -- it seems to be what you're alluding to but kind of similar domestic versus international growth. Is that fair so you kind of keep that mid-teens fixed?\nTed Christie: Exactly, that's what Matt mentioned in his comments, it's what we're going to do and what we call international we're really saying Latin American, Caribbean, because Puerto Rico is not technically international. But when you add all that up, it's going to sit around 15% of the network but the issue or the drag that we've had throughout the course of this year was a lot of the international out of Orlando, which a good chunk of that by the way was greenfield flying. So it's maturing right now, like we're lapping that beginning this quarter and we feel very good about the setup, especially with the retiming we did this quarter.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jamie Baker.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. We are not asking about consolidation directly that's not really the issue. But with the new aircraft contract did you build any I don't know deliberate contract flexibility into that as part of the order? Should you end up participating in M&A at any point during the delivery stream?\nTed Christie: Hey, Jamie, it's Ted. So we were pretty thoughtful throughout the course of this order for a variety of things. And as Scott mentioned in his comments, flexibility was a component of our fleet desires going forward and that flexibility went up or down within gauge, and we built a balance sheet to enhance that by the way. So, we're very excited about the growth prospects. We feel good about the setup. We have the desired fleet flexibility to move within gauge to get more airplanes that we want to retire aircraft, to sell aircraft. We have flexibility within the contract as well. So, I would say broadly speaking, I think we're in a good spot.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That helps. And second, Scott talked about earnings growth next year despite the disappointing cost guide or what the market has interpreted as a disappointing cost guide? The color and response to Savi's question was helpful. But just to point out the obvious The Street assumes that the best you can do next year is essentially flat earnings. So my question really is whether you would settle for that? Or put differently, if you get a few months into 2020, because clearly you're internal forecast is better than what The Street is modeling, but if you get a few months into next year, and it looks like it's going to be another year in the, call it, mid-to-high $4 range do you make changes to the plan? Or at that point you just say, well maybe 2021?\nTed Christie: So, you are right. I mean I think as we set up both in the commentary Scott provided as well as where I was mentioning on the prior question, we do feel good about our ability to drive earnings growth headed into next year. We think we have the tools and relative comparison that sets us up well. Look, we're active managers, and we're always looking to make adjustments. We're not going to undo the long-term strategy of the business, if there is a close-in macro shift. But, if we don't feel like -- and this would be true in any given year. If we don't feel like the things we're doing are working, we look to change that; in fact, we did some of that this year. There were a number of markets and opportunities that we launched this year that we cancelled. And I think some of the reflection of driving network performance from an operating perspective too is going into next year stretching out the stage looking at the way we're routing the aircraft and frequency in markets. I think those things are going to be helpful for us heading into the next year. So, I would tell you that we're not going to need here based on like a small short in -- short-term kind of micro thing, but yeah, we're active managers. We're always looking to push the earnings.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Hunter Keay.\nHunter Keay: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Hey, Scott, you've given some of the moving parts -- actually you know what, let me change the question. I'm asking here for one. On CASM ex, which P&L items do you see the best opportunity to drive costs up less than capacity, like for example, I can see distribution and maintenance in 3Q came in pretty well. So, if I think about where you might be able to beat sort of P&L buckets of a CASM ex number? If you're going to be there, where am I most likely to see that?\nScott Haralson: Yeah. I think most of the benefit that we'll see in 2020 will come from running a good airline, especially year-over-year. A lot of the challenges we have this year, as we mentioned before, won't replicate itself into 2020. So, we'll get benefits hopefully from our ability to utilize crew better both pilots and flight attendants as well as from an operating expense perspective. So, we get that in an number of areas obviously from interrupted trip expense, but it does have littering benefits throughout the P&L, including ground handling over time, all those sorts of things that we do benefit indirectly from running a good airline.\nHunter Keay: That's like a other OpEx. A lot of that sounds like it might be other OpEx, if anything right?\nScott Haralson: It's -- most of that is other OpEx including ITE and some of the airport ground handling components.\nHunter Keay: All right. And then deferred heavy maintenance on the balance sheet is now up to $330 million, it's a long-term asset. Can you help us understand how growth in this line item impacts the P&L and ultimately CASM ex, whether it's a two-year lag, one-year lag look at the backwards look, forwards look? Just help us understand how that is leading or lagging indicator for anything that you might see on the P&L? Thank you.\nScott Haralson: Yeah. I mean well that obviously flows through heavy maintenance amortization. So, in years like this year and 2018, we've had heavy capital maintenance spend years, outsized years actually. So, as we look into sort of 2021 and 2022, those numbers come down dramatically. So the amortization line where that flows through will come down as well. So the headwinds we faced in 2018 and 2019 have been pretty outsized from an amortization perspective, and then those will mitigate a bit as we head into 2021 and 2022. But that's where that will flow through from a balance sheet perspective. So that's where the benefit will show up.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Just looking back and reflecting on your top line execution this year, what do you plan to do differently from a new markets perspective in 2020 on your network plan?\nMatt Klein: Sure. Duane, this is Matt. Well, I think to start off with I think it's important to look back at the history which I think you're alluding to. In 2018, we entered nine new cities; in 2019 this year we entered seven new cities. We will be adding a few new cities to the network next year, but it will be considerably less than we've seen in the last couple of years. And when you add those new cities, the spool increase and that spool percentage of our overall network does matter. It matters in the short run. In the long run, the opportunities are great and we're very pleased with where we've been growing and the results we've seen. But overall, having those less cities will definitely help that overall mix of new city ASM mix and that should overall be a tailwind to unit revenue year-over-year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. And then -- I don't if there is a way to do this, but we see your new fleet plans, but can you talk about kind of annual retirements in the plan? And how much flexibility you have 2020, 2021, 2022?\nScott Haralson: Duane, this is Scott. And we do have -- like Ted mentioned earlier, we have set up the balance sheet through the year to own more of the assets unencumbered which gives us flexibility to retire. We do have an estimated retirement plan for an aging fleet, but our ability to flex that or do them a little sooner provides us flexibility to mitigate some of the sort of macroeconomic shock issues we may face. So we do have that flexibility. And also two as we think about this fleet or one of the concepts that we built into this is that we're taking less firm aircraft in the early part of the delivery period which means we'll be leasing a few more aircraft in 2022 to 2024 timeframe. And then that really acts a sort of an optionality component for us where we can take more or less aircraft in that period. So as we think about flexibility, it comes in the form of leased aircraft and also in the form of what you mentioned retirement of the aircraft on a schedule that we sort of have planned already today.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thanks for that and if I could sneak one more in. Just the cadence of your non-fuel unit cost growth next year, specifically into the March quarter does it continue to look up, call it, mid-single digits like we are seeing here in 4Q?\nScott Haralson: Hey Duane, this is Scott again. So thinking about the cadence we're in the sort of mid-innings of our budgeting process, so we don't have a good view into -- for the unit cost cadence for the year at this point. So there's not much I can tell you there. I think we'll be able to update you here in the coming months. But from a history perspective you can sort of look at how CASM flows through the year in any given year may be estimated that way. I don't have any guidance to give you today on cadence.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Catherine O'Brien.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good morning. So just taking a look at your newly introduced non-ticket per flight segment guidance here in the fourth quarter, you know, I realize there could be some more room here on passenger flight segment growth. But given that 1% to 2% growth guidance that would imply a fair flight segment down in the high-teens or maybe even 20% which is a deceleration on two or three years out how can we look at it? Can you just talk about what's going on there? I mean, I know last year you had good growth there. Just what's driving that? Is some of that just a refocusing on driving higher non-ticket any color there would be great? Thank you.\nMatt Klein: Sure. This is Matt. I'll take that question. So when you look at the mix there and how the TRASM is comprised between non-ticket and passenger, you did hit on a key component there, which is the passenger flight segment number. We've been able to shift our strategy as necessary based on the competitive environment. There is a lot more volume pushing through off-peak periods and we are also participating in that volume in off-peak periods. That volume in off-peak periods generally is going to be driving a lower average fare on the ticket side. The non-ticket number which is very impressive from our perspective is that, we've been able to hold and even improve that non-ticket number while the ticket yield has seen some degradation. And the passenger flight segment numbers would make some of that component to continue to help maintain the production So long way to say, you're correct the passenger flight segment number matters a lot and that's part of driving more volume in the off-peak, times of the week, times of the month.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, great. And then maybe just one on the cost side of the house, you've noted that you've taken some more measures to make sure that you can recover the operation more quickly going forward in the case of an IROP situation. Can you flesh that out a little bit details on what you're doing to help the operation? And I guess should we think about those being a net tailwind to CASM? Or maybe a little bit more cost on some of these recovery measures offset by lower passenger reaccoms, stuff like that?\nScott Haralson: Hey, Catherine. This is Scott. I'll start and then Ted can fill in as well. But from an operational and cost perspective, as we think about 2020, we've done a few things. Even really starting in 2019 and as we've headed through the summer, planning the airline with a few more reserves from a crew perspective, thinking about how we run block and how we run the network, those things were a part of some of the issues that we had in 2019 that we don't think, we'll replicate into 2020 has primarily centered around the crew. So what we've done as we think about the 2020 plan is be thoughtful around reserves and how we utilize the pilots really specifically.\nTed Christie: Yes. I mean you asked whether or not it was this decision or this investment is CASM accretive, we believe the answer to that is a resounding, yes. This has been what we've been testing over the last three years is that, our view is that better operational performance. While it does require a certain \"investments\" either in the amount of block you deploy, the amount of reserves you have. The scheduling of the different airplanes may reduce utilization at the margin. But we believe that the savings associated with less disruption-related expenses over time interrupt the trip expense, crew lodging, moving parts throughout the system all those things coming out is a net benefit to CASM. We saw the bad side of that this summer and we expect to see the good side of it going forward. So I think that the answer to your question is absolutely yes a benefit to CASM.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Helane Becker.\nHelane Becker: Thanks, operator. Hi, team. Thank you very much for the time of course. Two questions. One on -- as you think about the growth in the fleet, so if you -- I guess I think 10 crews per -- five crews per aircraft, 10 pilots per plan. And I'm wondering if you're thinking about as you hire these 1000 more pilots plus whatever you need to hire for reserves how do you compete with the other airlines that are in the process of replacing retired pilots who have a higher starting pay. I mean -- are you -- and your contract doesn't come up until 2023. So how are you contemplating attracting people to your brand?\nScott Haralson: Yes, it's a really good new story Helane. The reason that Spirit is one of the most attractive places to work is that because of our growth our pilots achieve seniority and therefore move themselves up into the captaincy faster than any other airline. And they do it by a factor of two times or three times faster than they will anywhere else even when taking into account the retirement schedules. So what we love to see when we -- and you mentioned some numbers there that we're hiring a good deal of pilots and we see them every time they come into the office. We bring them in here and we get to meet with them and they are thrilled to hear about the company's growth opportunities because they want to be here and be part of it and they want to further their career. So that's our single-best asset when we're attracting pilot talent.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's great. And then my other and really this question for you Scott I guess is on your -- and I know this is not a big number right 7% or 8% of expenses is your airport cost, but you do complain about them and you are not alone by the way. But as you grow do you have more I don't think power is the right word but more ability to a greater ability to push back to the airports to get better I don't know get lower costs or better agreements? Or how do I think about that?\nScott Haralson: Helane from an airport cost perspective, we don't get to negotiate too much with the airports on this. We're pretty much a taker in most of the expenses, but we do have some things in our own tool belt that we can do. Obviously, we are a high-utilization carrier. So the assets that we use at the airport are pretty efficient relative to the industry. Plus this drives our desire to use automation effectively at the airport as we think about the go-forward plan the front end of the process. But airports is a considerable expense for us and we think about our ability to utilize assets and the resources that we have there and even thinking about the number for 2020, the number is pretty substantial as we think about the increase. It's a 100 basis points headwind as we think about inflation at the airport and resources there.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Great.\nTed Christie: Helane to answer that it is our selection of where we fly is our active decision. We pick where we go. And when we choose to go into an airport, even if the costs are higher than what we experience on our average, we're doing that intentionally because we view the profit opportunity is there. In some ways you should almost view cost structures as airport pass-through, because you're driving revenue based on the opportunity that exist in that geography. While it pressures our unit cost because of some of these decisions we're making, we should expect to see benefit on that. And I was asked earlier to the extent that that's not working we obviously pivot. But while it is definitely a mathematical pressure to CASM it's less concerning to us because we picked intentionally to go there.\nHelane Becker: Right. So I guess what I'm hearing you say is as you go into a specific market regardless of the cost knowing you can pass the cost on to your customer in the form of a higher ticket price?\nTed Christie: I wouldn't say regardless of the cost, I'd say that where we pick we do so mindfully and we do so intentionally. And to the extent that those things don't work we change our mind.\nHelane Becker: Got it. Got it. That's very. Actually thank you very much, that's very helpful. Have a great day.\nTed Christie: All right Thank you,\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Caiado.\nJoe Caiado: Hey, good morning. Thanks. Matt quick one for you. Can you just give some more detail on the specific ancillary initiatives that are going to drive that 3% growth in non-ticket next year and sort of the ramp up or the cadence of those initiatives in 2020?\nMatt Klein: Yes sure Joe. I can certainly talk to the initiatives. The cadence I may hold off on but the initiatives I can go through some of that. The biggest thing that we have moving forward for us is our new website is now in live it's been live for a little while now as well as our app and those things are continuous development platforms for us. But we finally got to a place where we feel like we modernized a lot of where we are and that gives us the ability to really start getting into the merchandising and the ability to understand better from analytics perspective what's going on in this site. Our goal is to drive as high of a conversion rate as we can off of the website, but we definitely mix in with that how we sell our products and what the take rates are for those products on the site as well. There is a lot of opportunity that we've been waiting to really unlock. And as we move through this quarter and into next year, we're going to be able to start to really leverage what we know to be an opportunity there. So, that's one piece that's giving us confidence on the number. And I would say the other piece is we're basically in the final stages now of getting our new hotel and car content putting onto the website that will be a little bit of a benefit later this year to really start to pick up into next year; and then by the middle of the year, we will have an even more improved merchandising opportunity there as well. So, some of these products that we at one point in time were really the leaders in the industry on and we took a little bit of a step back, we're now about to take advantage of a lot of those opportunities. So -- and let me just add to that 2020 we feel really good about. 2021 has opportunities as well. We also look at the next six to 12 months. We're looking down the line and we know what's coming we know what we're going to build. And we sit around and think about what are the ways that we can optimize further today. Those opportunities just take time to absorb. We want to make sure that we're not moving too many pieces off at the same time. It's harder to learn that way. So, we're trying to be very methodical and pragmatic as to what we launch and when we do it.\nJoe Caiado: Okay. Thanks. And then a question on the new aircraft order. Are these -- the 319 and 321neos that you're going to get next decade? Are they going to have the same seat density as your current 319 and 321ceos? Or is this also an opportunity for some densifying and upgauging?\nScott Haralson: Yes, hey Joe, this is Scott. So, the plan right now is to keep the same LOPA configuration that we have today on all three. But we will think about those changes depending on what the 319 fleet does over that period of time. We can be flexible on how we think about LOPA most really on the 319 fleet. The 320 and 321 really depending on where we sit with the number of aircraft we may make some decisions around LOPA. But as it sits today they will be about the same.\nJoe Caiado: Understood. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joseph DeNardi.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Scott just on the maybe the CapEx profile for the business over the next few years. Can you speak to that? It looks like next couple of years, you will probably start with $1 billion? And then just kind of your perspective on leverage through a cycle, what you'd be comfortable with kind of on the high end?\nScott Haralson: Sure. I think from a CapEx perspective, like you said, I think just giving the fleet count that we have over the next few years, you're going to see it up around $1 billion from a CapEx perspective. And really that is pretty typical on a size of the airline; we will be over the next few years relative to what we've been since 2013, 2014 from a CapEx perspective. So, it isn't a material increase from a percentage basis it's actually probably smaller. And from a leverage basis, we think we're going to continue to drive leverage down even with those CapEx numbers because we knew that we would peak from a lever perspective around the 2018, maybe 2019 timeframe. As the new debt that we had in 2014, 2015 amortizes and we continue to sort of grow the airline that levered number will come down. So, we feel comfortable where we are. We feel comfortable with the trend where it's going. And so I think we're not concerned at all about the CapEx.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then Matt just on the maybe the kind of the RASM environment or assumptions for next year. Is it kind of given the exit rate particularly and the base fair, is it safe to assume that kind of your expectation would be that RASM would continue to be pressured in first half of the year and then you'd expect kind of an inflection in the back half like very high level? Is that your expectation?\nScott Haralson: The short answer Joe is yes. That's how we are thinking about it. And there were a couple of things that happened last year as well. Ted went into some of that. And things like having a pretty bad storm over Easter weekend those are impactful for us. And you can't plan on that and we don't anticipate things like that to happen again. So, there are some other kinds of pieces that are mixed in to the overall answer, but that's how we think about things generally; first half a little bit pressured; back half we'll start to be able to take advantage of the year-over-year comp.\nJoseph DeNardi: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Rajeev Lalwani.\nRajeev Lalwani: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time. Actually two questions for Matt. First Matt, just starting with the near-term. Can you talk just generally about the yield environment progression between 3Q and 4Q, i.e. are things in better or worse? And then where does SAVE come into all of this i.e., do you think some of the yield weakness is more strategic with folks targeting you guys?\nMatt Klein: Sure. So from an industry perspective, we did see coming out of July 4th through the summer, passenger yields were not as strong as we were anticipating and what we would have liked to have seen. I think we talked about that probably in a great deal. And then we got hit with Hurricane Dorian pretty hard over Labor Day weekend, which was the last great weekend of the quarter. So in terms of that being behind us the off-peak periods have more capacity for the industry, capacity drives price \u2013 pricing, and we have to basically adjust to make sure that we're capturing what we need to capture to drive our unit revenue performance. So off-peaks have been pretty stable, but stable at a level that are low fares. We have a great cost structure. Historically, last few years we've been trying to make sure that fares can push up, when we think -- if we think that's the best way to drive unit revenue, we'll do that. And generally speaking, we've been players in trying to do that. As the environment shifts or as capacity comes into other times of the week, other times of the month, other times of the year, we're going to adjust to that as well. We are about low fares. And if we have to drive our unit revenue through low-fare volume then we'll do that, and we're probably the best position in the industry to do that. But having said all that, the peaks continue to be strong. There's plenty of demand out there. We're utilizing our processes that we've been putting in place for the last few years to really understand competitive dynamics. There are definitely times when we know that we have the ability to sit out on the booking curve, and we don't need to take the cheapest fare three months out from departure. We have the ability to forecast demand just like everybody else and we know where we're strong. And when we can leverage those yields higher we will, especially in the holiday and peak periods. As we -- as how we participate in all of that, I think I just mentioned it. We're out there thinking about the network as well and thinking about how we deploy our assets, thinking about where we are strong. Over 80% of our seat growth in the last couple of years has been to places like Orlando, Las Vegas, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, New Orleans. And you have a city like Austin, which has great incoming demand and great outgoing demand, outbound demand. So, all of those things play into unit revenue. And having less mix of new cities certainly will help. By the first quarter of 2020, our new mix capacity goes from 8% in 2019 to 4% in 2020 that's meaningful for how we think about unit revenue production.\nRajeev Lalwani: That's helpful. And then as a brief follow-up on the idea of high capacity leads to lower yield, how are you thinking about next year from an industry standpoint just given your guide of being upper or whatever it is? Obviously, it's going to matter greatly given the size of Spirit versus others?\nTed Christie: Hey, Rajeev, it's Ted. I don't know what you were talking about guide up. We did talk about ancillary being up 3% so maybe that's what you're referring to. But as I walked through earlier, if we start out with just the basic math, which is we face a little bit of a headwind from a CASM ex perspective, if you assume all this fuel-neutral for the purposes of this discussion, and then we get a tailwind on the ancillary and we get a tailwind on the relative network maturity, because of these things we've discussed before that actually sets us up to be at an advantage from a margin perspective versus we believe the rest of the industry, because those things are very unique and specific to Spirit. Then you do have to think about what's happening from an industry growth perspective and overlap and competitive issues and that sort of thing. But as we said earlier, we feel like the relative positioning that we have puts us in a good spot to grow earnings at least at our rate of growth. And that would imply that we're going to be able to digest the marketplace changes and whatever happens. And a few moves down sometimes revenue -- RASM moves down; and a few moves up, revenue moves up. But neutral of that we think we're set up in the right space versus our competitors to drive that earnings growth.\nRajeev Lalwani: Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you guys.\nTed Christie: Yeah.\nMatt Klein: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Susan Donofrio.\nSusan Donofrio: Yes. Hello everybody. Just wanted to ask on international. Can you talk a little bit about your performance and just your thoughts on plans for growth going forward?\nMatt Klein: Sure. Susan, it's Matt. So we are not dislocated from other airlines as it comes -- as we talk about international. For example, Dominican Republic does continue to be pressured, Haiti continues to have some pressure as well. But at the other end of that, we've seen really good strength and volume out of both other kinds of just tourist destinations. Our growth in Cancun should tell you how we think about leisure markets like Cancun. Our growth in Puerto Rico should tell you how we think about Puerto Rico in general, and how we've been able to grow there. But there's also lots of good news throughout the rest of the region. We set out last year to change the mix of our system capacity to be around 15% mid-teens for the mix of our capacity. This year that's continued to be our plan and our schedule. That's out at the first quarter shows around the same percentage. In any given quarter, you may see that move up or down, which is going to be mostly based on seasonality not about intent to serve the region. So -- and the good news with that as well is we continue to see really good non-ticket performance there and depending on the time of year especially around peak periods it gives us the ability to flex our non-ticket profile even stronger for a lot of the international markets. And by the way when we say international, we're talking about Latin America and Caribbean as Ted mentioned. There\u2019s places like Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands are not really international but they're in the same region there.\nSusan Donofrio: Right. And then just an unrelated question on dynamic pricing of bags and how should we think about that in terms of just your thoughts on that?\nMatt Klein: Sure. So I want to make it definitely clear that when we talk about bags, we're not talking about individualizing different price points for individual people. We're talking about different kinds of price points based on the profile of the search request. So am I going to leisure -- a tourist destination for seven days and I'm buying my tickets three months out might have a different price point for bags; then am I flying this weekend on a quick trip to Vegas. So we may have different kinds of price points and how we think about take rates on that. We do a lot of work. We've been able to really leverage a lot of data. And as lot of e-commerce companies do, we're really getting into the weeds of being able to think about how we refine our analytics. And I don't want to talk too nuanced here, but there's a lot of new technologies and new ways to analyze our data and bring in new thoughts around machine learning that can really help how we move forward.\nSusan Donofrio: Great, very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Brandon Oglenski.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I'll just keep it to one here on the 2020 outlook, but I mean maybe to be more explicit when the max comes back at some of your competitors, we most likely will see capacity go up I guess. What can you give investors confidence that we can resolve some of these off-peak issues that have been a drag this year? Or Ted is your point that the maturity in the network could offset some of those headwinds and that's why you have confidence in growing earnings equal to capacity growth?\nTed Christie: Yeah. I think that's the point Brandon is that we had some unique -- I described a few of them, which was throughout the course of the year we called out Orlando International has a 100 basis point drag on unit revenue and our relative maturity has anywhere from 100 to 200 basis point drag on unit revenue throughout the course of this year. Those were specific Spirit things that actually flip around next year. And so, we do believe that while there will be pressures or benefits heading into next year depending on when, for example, capacity comes online with the max or who is growing where or whatever unique to Spirit we have tailwinds. And so we are set up, we believe in the right position. I would also add and Matt referenced this in one of his comments that over the last three years, our load factor is down around three points from where it used to be. Now part of that has been in our intentional effort to drive yield. And to the extent that we're in an environment where yield is less of the focus and load becomes more of the focus, our cost advantage becomes more and more important. And I think it's underappreciated at that point, because good ancillary performance and driving a point of yield every year is the same as getting a point or two of -- driving a point of load factor is the same as getting a point or two of yield. And so I think that that's part of the reason that we feel good about going into what could be a higher growth year for the industry depending on how things come.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate. Thank you.\nDeAnne Gabel: And we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dan McKenzie.\nDan McKenzie: Thanks for squeezing in here. Good morning. I think you referenced book away in the prepared remarks less of it today. I'm wondering, if you can talk about what it cost to you so far this year? Has it been 100 bps of margin pressure, 200 bps? And I guess just as background, I think about the people flying Spirit is maybe people that typically fly once a year. But maybe you could touch on the percent of repeat flyers and loyalty?\nTed Christie: Sure, Dan. There's a lot in there. So let me try to take a little bit of that. In terms of book away, we didn't really mention anything specific about that. But one thing that I can talk to is our Hurricane Dorian impact is we had previously estimated it to be a little bit higher than it ended up being because part of that is normally after a hurricane, you will see some avoidance to book and it's not specific to any given airline, it's just maybe a little bit of an avoidance to book that region of travel. We didn't really see that as much after the hurricane this year as we've seen in the years past, maybe it was the timing of when it happened. We're not certainly sure what happened but that is one of the reasons why we came in little bit better on the third quarter is that impact wasn't as strong, which I think speaks to the overall demand environment in general and why low fares can drive volume and we did that. And we're pretty pleased with how that worked out. In terms of repeat travelers, we don't really -- we haven't disclosed exactly what those percentages are. We can definitely tell you that, that the brand, the brand evolution and the continued great operation, the great job we've done on guest services training, both at the airports and with our flight attendants, has been very, very well-received not just internally, by our own team members, but externally as well. We're seeing it in our guest satisfaction metrics. And while we didn't have that greatest operation this summer, in terms of our own expectations, we still hit record guest satisfaction numbers this summer, which speaks to the overall brand, our overall ability to get our message out into the marketplace to the general media. And it's paying off. And we believe it's the way that we can help leverage our growth into the future. We know that's not the most important thing that's out there in terms of how we run the business. But it certainly is an important ingredient as to how we think about ourselves. How we are investing in the guest product, and how that can help take us through any kind of operating period.\nDan Mckenzie: Yeah. Good clarification. Thanks. And then, the second question here just on, the fleet optimization. I'm wondering if you could talk about the percent of the network, that's tied to the A319s today that are in the wrong market that could shift to the neos. So, I think you showed its one point of margin pressure this here that goes away next year? So I'm just trying to bucket here x-percent of the revenue this year that was that was sub-optimized pardon me that was sub-optimized. And gets fixed as we look ahead, how much of a margin good guy could that be?\nTed Christie: Well, I don't think, I'll talk to specifically the margin improvement on that. It's not something we would -- we really want to share. But we've been waiting for us to be able to have a significant number, a material number of the neo aircrafts. So we can call what we're just calling a sub-fleet here. And that allows us to fly the aircraft reliably from an operations perspective, in many places, that today we're using A319. I think you understand that point. But just give you an example, today we've been flying 319 to Lima from Fort Lauderdale, on A319 with some seat bock restrictions on it just from a performance perspective. The Neo eliminates that issue. So, we now have the ability to fly the right aircraft during the right mission, generate very efficient ASMs, and drive the right kind of revenue, and non-ticket performance, because we're not going to take any kind of bag restrictions either on that flight anymore as well. Those are the kinds of ways that we can use the neo sub-fleet to drive very efficient growth.\nScott Haralson: That's right. And it helps from a cost perspective as well as Matt mentioned from the revenue side, using the right aircraft on the right route, is an extremely CASM dilutive play.\nDan Mckenzie: Understood, okay, thanks for the time guys.\nDeAnne Gabel: Great, thank you all for joining us today. That concludes our third quarter earnings conference call.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Please refer to our second quarter 2019 earnings release, which is available on our website, for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. And with that, here's Ted.\nEdward Christie: Thanks DeAnne, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our team delivered strong quarterly profits for the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted earnings per share increased 52.3%, and our operating margin increased 300 basis points to 16.3%. The strong demand environment and continued execution of our strategic initiatives drove a top line improvement of 18.9%. A very busy travel season coupled with numerous storm systems has made for a challenging operating environment, and I want to thank the entire Spirit team for all that they do every day to care for our guests. For the second quarter 2019, our on-time performance was 75.8% placing us in the middle of the pack relative to other U.S. airlines. Our completion factor was 98.2%, down about a point year-over-year. Over the last three years, we made numerous adjustments to our business and have materially improved our operational reliability. In addition, we are doing a much better job of ensuring a quality guest experience regardless of the operating environment. Coming off a record operating year in 2018, we elected to make some additional tweaks to how we run the business in an effort to drive further efficiencies. It has always been in our DNA to push ourselves toward further improvement. Given our operational performance this summer, it is evident that some of these changes were not effective. We are already making adjustments to our winter schedule and are thinking differently about how to approach the peak period next year to improve our ability to recover after weather disruptions. With that here's Matt and Scott to discuss our results for the second quarter 2019 and our outlook for the third quarter and full-year 2019 in more detail.\nMatthew Klein: Thanks Ted. We are pleased to report that for the second quarter 2019 total revenue increased 18.9% to just over $1 billion. Total revenue per available seat mile increased 5% year-over-year on 13.2% capacity growth with gains in both load factor and yields. On a per passenger segment basis, non-ticket revenue for the second quarter was $55.54, up 1.8% or $0.97 year-over-year, and we remain on track to produce non-ticket revenue per passenger segment between $56 and $57 for the full year 2019. Our dynamic pricing initiatives around seats and market segmentation around bags continued to do well. Additionally, we are very pleased with the growing contribution from our bundled services offering which we believe still has a long runway for continued growth. In the last six months, we've added six destinations to our growing network. Most of the new markets we've added in 2019 have been domestic routes and for the most part they are on pace with our expectations but they were a drag on second quarter TRASM. In regards to our international network, overall I'd say we're pleased with the region\u2019s performance. However, some of the routes we added late last year are taking longer to mature than we had anticipated, which negatively impacted second quarter TRASM by approximately 100 basis points. We are making a few adjustments in the post Labor Day schedule to these routes which should help improve the portfolio\u2019s overall performance. Looking forward to the third quarter, we estimate our capacity growth will increase approximately 13%. For the fourth quarter, we estimate capacity growth will increase between 14.5% and 15.5%. Compared to our initial plan for 2019, our average stage for Q3 and Q4 will both be significantly lower. Third quarter stage will be down 4.2%, and based on the current plans fourth quarter stage will be down 2.5%. Shorter stage flights are generally beneficial to TRASM and that's true on our network too. However, even though most of the new routes we've launched in 2019 are shorter than average stage, they are still spooling up, so we are not yet seeing the full benefit to TRASM that a shorter stage generally provides. Now turning to our revenue outlook, domestic and international demand trends remain strong. While inventory controls do not seem to be quite as locked down as they were last year at this time, I'd still describe the backdrop as stable. Based on the trends we are currently seeing; for the third quarter 2019, we estimate TRASM will be somewhere between down 1% to up 1% year-over-year. Overall, we're pleased with the development of the network. We took the opportunity to enter new cities as real estate gate constrained airports became available. We are seeing some TRASM drag simply due to the mix of new flying in the network compared to recent years, but we expect that will be beneficial to unit revenue throughout 2020. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.\nScott Haralson: Thanks Matt, and thanks to everyone joining us today. Our second quarter 2019 CASM ex-fuel is $0.0541 an increase of 4.6% year-over-year in line with our previous guidance. During the quarter, we continued to face ongoing cost pressures from various airport rent escalations and ground service rates as well as higher than expected costs associated with a higher cancellation rate. These headwinds were partially offset by several favorable variances. As Ted mentioned, in designing the summer schedule, we made a few strategic changes in an effort to increase our efficiency. In the end, these moves left us with less buffer in the system and impacted our ability to recover from adverse weather conditions, which in turn is driving higher costs. We're already making adjustments to our plan for the peak period next year. In the meantime, for forecasting purposes, we think it is appropriate to assume we will continue to see a higher level of disruptions from weather for the remainder of the year. We estimate our third quarter CASM ex-fuel will be up 7% to 8% year-over-year. In February, we had anticipated CASM ex-fuel for the third quarter would be up 1% to 2% year-over-year. Compared to that initial expectation, we had previously disclosed 150 basis points of pressure related to the additional costs in conjunction with the Fort Lauderdale runway construction. Another 250 basis points is due to reduced ASM production and shorter stage. The remaining 200 basis points is related to higher estimates for continued flight disruptions through the peak periods of Q3, which is clearly where we are focused. For the fourth quarter, we estimate CASM-ex will be at 3.5% to 4.5%, a shorter stage, and anticipated lower ASM production than we had initially assumed contributes about 150 basis points to this increase versus our initial guide of up about 1%. The rest of the increase was primarily related to higher estimates for flight disruption costs. We're always pushing levers in an effort to improve efficiency, increased productivity, and grow earnings, and when the net effect isn\u2019t what we're expecting, we will pivot; and that's what we\u2019re going to do here. We view this cost performance as an anomaly, and while it's too early to provide a 2020 guide, our view is that about 200 basis points of this pressure is transitory and will be tailwinds in 2020. In other words it will not repeat in 2020. Not sure yet of the tailwinds will offset the 2020 headwinds but flat to maybe up gently feels about right. While we will make a few tweaks to help the stability of our network and operation, we're still producing top, growing earnings and producing solid mid-teens margins. These tweaks will complement our strong core business and set us up for a strong 2020. Now from a fleet perspective, we took delivery of two aircraft in the second quarter one debt-financed and one leased ending the quarter at 135 aircraft. We expect to take delivery of 10 additional aircraft by the end of the year. We recently signed lease agreements for four additional aircraft to deliver in 2020 and nine additional aircraft to deliver in 2021 to help us meet our mid-teens capacity growth rate. In regards to our fleet RFP, we continue to make progress on our discussion with the aircraft and engine manufacturers and are targeting a decision between late August and early September. And with that, I will hand it back to Ted.\nEdward Christie: Thanks Scott. The business is doing well and we're delivering strong earnings growth. Admittedly, we have a couple of bumps to overcome in the second half of the year and we've taken a dip and reliability this summer. Year-to-date, we are running nearly an 80% on-time airline which places us fourth in on-time performance among U.S. reportable carriers, but we can and will do better. On the cost side much of our cabin hit is self-imposed. We pushed a few levers a bit too much that coupled with more weather related cancellations than last year had an adverse impact on the operation. And also was a notable change versus what we assumed in the base case in our original plan. We\u2019re already changing the inputs to our network plan going forward to offset these unexpected impacts. On the revenue front, we are pleased with our revenue management initiatives. Non-ticket continues to do well and we are on track to hit our target this year. And that\u2019s even with a couple of our 2019 initiatives taking a bit longer than we originally expected. The timing then of most of their benefit may actually skew to 2020 setting us up well for next year. We continue to anticipate we will produce mid-teens margins in the back half of 2019 and we are on pace to deliver good earnings growth this year. The foundation of our business are stronger than ever with an estimated CASM-ex of about Five and a half cents our cost gap to our competitors is larger than ever. Our non-ticket revenue production is the highest in the world and we have line of sight on initiatives to increase it even further and we are producing among the best margin in the business. With that, back to DeAnne.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thanks Ted, Matt and Scott. We are now ready to take questions from the analyst. We ask you to limit yourself to one question with one related follow-up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: So Scott, I think you were talking about a 2020 cost outlook, if I am not mistaken, it\u2019s very in there, and sorry I was distracted for one second. But you guys highlighted that you need to take your reserve crew ratios up a little bit looking at block time solutions to avoid these issues in the future. Can you just talk about how much structural cost that could add to the network as you look out getting beyond this quarter?\nEdward Christie: Sure Brandon, it's Ted. So, I think a key to this discussion is when we made changes, we looked at 2018 as an excellent operational year. And we said to ourselves, we think there is an opportunity to increase efficiency and drive a little bit more earnings potential in the peak by pushing utilization where we could, but also and that's in regard to crew as well. And I think what we\u2019re finding is that that was actually destructive from a cost perspective. So, as we look forward and as Scott mentioned we're going to pivot and make some changes to reserve staffing for one, schedule construction for another, and all of those things while they may on the surface appear to be cost additive. What we're really saying is net of all the impacts that we experienced this year, which is considerable additional disruption related expenses which we've already said is in the neighborhood of 200 basis points in the quarter. In addition to that, we lost ASMs as a result of cancellations. And so, our view is that by making this change, we\u2019re actually going to improve the cost structure. The net of all those things actually act as a tailwind. So, the benefit of less cancellations, less disruption related expenses, and less recovery related expenses like overtime far outweigh the additional expense of having more reserves. And that\u2019s the balance we've been looking to strike. Admittedly, the number is frustrating for us given where it landed, but we look to make these changes all the time. We\u2019re always looking to optimize and execute to a better total output plan. And I think where we found ourselves was a little bit over our skis. And so, we\u2019re going to make the necessary adjustments that we think will be beneficial to unit cost going forward.\nBrandon Oglenski: Well Ted, I appreciate that response, but forgive me for being a bit critical. It seems like we had maybe for different reasons, but similar outcomes back in 2017 when we had disruptions with your pilots. Is this just a case that maybe Spirit has run into too much scale here where you need to rethink the operation of the company, because these - weather and contracts come up all the time right?\nEdward Christie: Yes right, no, the answer is no. We don't view this as anything structural to the business. Obviously, the circumstances in 2017 were completely different, but I would say that the level of tolerances luckily that we're dealing within here are much narrower than when we first launched this kind of operational improvement exercise really in early 2016. We knew we needed to make a trade for marginal utilization to improve the overall operational performance and improve the cost structure, and that experiment has worked generally very well for us. So while admittedly, the combination of some of the tweaks we made here plus a much worse weather pattern year-over-year probably caught us a little bit like I said over our skis, we don't view that as long-term structural. In fact, most of these things naturally reverse and we know exactly what we did here. So the good news is, we can fix that and we're already launching a lot of that change heading into the peak periods of - the remainder of the fourth quarter, but more importantly into the peaks of next year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Caiado. Please go ahead.\nJose Caiado: Ted, you spent a lot of time improving your operational reliability over the last few years as you pointed out that that\u2019s improved your reputation with passengers. Just given the setback in your reliability this summer, are you feeling any reputational hit with passengers, and are you doing anything differently in terms of how you're compensating and taking care of affected customers?\nEdward Christie: So, thanks for the question. The short answer to the first part is no. The good news is, the work we\u2019ve put in on improving this airlines' operational performance and therefore its brand reputation is actually reaping dividends when things don't always go our way. So, we are still much along the path in a brand improvement initiative, and we don't see there being an interruption as it relates to how we\u2019re operating right now. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, the on-time performance of the business is actually pretty good. What we are really talking about is the last few cancellations on any given day, and that's the part we look to improve upon. It may seem big and clearly in the peak, it drives more expense than we like, but it's really targeting those last few cancellations and that starts with network construction and schedule design, and then it ends with how we think about our reserve ratios for our crew, flight attendants, and pilots in an ability to better operate. So, I don't see there to be any disruption from a brand perspective which is the good news. As it relates to how we take care of our guests, we\u2019ve been on an improvement process as well over the course of the last three years; and in order to live up to that reputation, we at times will take care of our guests in ways that may have been different than the airline you experienced in 2013, but that's not a cliff effect. I think it's more about how we view the nature of whatever the disruption is the cancellation and how - we think we can re-accommodate. The good news is as the network has gotten larger and the airline has gotten larger, the options for us re-accommodate our own will grow and that will help us over time. So again I think the focus here is on, we know exactly what we did and we\u2019re looking to pivot back the other way and we think that acts as a tailwind going forward.\nJose Caiado: So we shouldn't think of that - last point maybe as a bit of structural cost creeps Spirit being a little bit nicer to passengers and the expense associated with that?\nEdward Christie: No, I wouldn't think of it that way at all. In fact we\u2019re just more efficient generally and all in all as we move through over the next - really the next - this is a long-term story and a long-term view on things. So it\u2019s going to be a tailwind over time quite frankly.\nJose Caiado: Okay, I appreciate that. Maybe just a very quick follow-up for Scott if I may. Would you characterize this updated full year cost guide as a kitchen sink. Just in terms of how conservative you were with the completion factor assumptions for the rest of the year does it also embed a bit of a cushion for other unknowns? Basically can investors get comfortable that we're extremely unlikely to see another bad cost surprise next quarter and that you really have your arms around this thing? Thanks everyone.\nScott Haralson: Yes, thanks Joe. Yes that\u2019s right, I think look what we've done here as we said look we have some trends with the weather patterns. We've made that assumption going forward. Obviously, the end of Q3 and end of Q4 has a different seasonal weather pattern than does the summer times and even interruption gets a little bit cheaper. We\u2019ve made those adjustments too. So what we\u2019re doing here is we feel like, we have arms around, what we need to do operationally. We\u2019re going to make those changes to the network. What we can do in the short term, so we think that with the disruption that we expect to have and the structural changes that we have, we feel pretty good about where we are with the guidance so far. I mean, look, we\u2019re third of the way through the Q3 production already. So we have a pretty good idea where Q3 is going to fit. And we feel comfortable where Q4 peak will end up. So we feel good about where we are and given sort of what we've seen this is what we would expect to happen.\nOperator: Our next question is from Savi Syth. Please go ahead.\nSavanthi Syth: I was just wondering if you can or maybe for Scott or Ed. Flat to maybe gently up look for next year on the cost line. Could you help me understand kind of the margin that you hear. I know there is some shifts from non-op to op as you start doing more operating leases versus debt but being a ULCC and growing mid-teens I mean, I always thought the kind of the view was maybe unit revenue was flat to down but unit cost flat to down as well and so just wondering how we should think about kind of the set up even and that fact up gently is even with the reversal of some of the kind of the miss out this year?\nEdward Christie: Savi, it's Ted. Let me make a few comments, and I am going to let Scott kind of someone around the edges as well. So you know, as a low cost operator clearly cost you have to focus. We know we are a cost business and that has to be where we\u2019re focused going forward. But revenue is a component as well, and some of the changes we made this year to our network by bringing the stage in and launching a bunch of new cities that we found opportunities to get into haven\u2019t help the unit revenue store close in but we think those are going to be beneficial to us going forward. So stable cost next year, we think on an improving revenue comp is a really good market story actually and we faced headwinds every year that every airline faces from a cost perspective but we manage those using our growth and in this case using tailwinds from expenses we incurred this year. So I do think that it sets us up well actually going into 2020 and with absolute cost very, very low here, maintaining that cost level is a widening advantage against everyone else and that's really got to be our focus as we move forward. So Scott, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d had any more.\nScott Haralson: No, that right. Savi, I\u2019ll give you a little bit of color on 2020.We\u2019re not ready to give a firm guide. We haven't gone through the planning process but we know little bit about the puts and takes. We do know that the disruption costs interrupt the trip expense that happen this year won\u2019t occur next year, definitely be a tailwind but we have industry is facing increasing labor costs and rent cost as we talked about before. We\u2019re going to have increasing amortization costs and depreciation costs, plus we\u2019ve leased a number of aircraft this year that will have a full year effect. So we may not get the same rent, our ownership good guy that we\u2019ve gotten in the past and in 2020. so these sort of puts and takes leave us in the early frames of 2019, thinking about where we are going to fit. We feel like we're in that sort of flat to maybe gently up. Like I said in the prepared remarks and will be able to give a more clear view into that as we head into the latter part of 2019.\nSavanthi Syth: And if I might follow up with Matt just talking about the stage length pressure might be a little bit less here in the fourth quarter. Could you help us maybe think about fourth quarter because I know a lot of us are struggling with some of the comps that we have from last year?\nMatthew Klein: Yes, so - I am not going to give a guide or talk specifically to our fourth quarter revenue outlook but what I can tell you is sort of how we go about thinking about. How we're thinking about putting a guide together. So we do look sequentially. We look at what's going on this year. We look at how we are performing right now. We look at all the different pieces that go into unit revenue number and then we look historically and understand how trends move us seasonally out of shoulder into peak, out of peak back in the shoulder and then into the peak again at the end of the year. So we took all of these different variables into effect. We weighted heavily based on the current environment that we\u2019re in and then we also look at things about how the network may have changed on a year-over-year basis. So we take all those things together and that's how we think about our unit revenue guidance. I know that we always report and talk about them on a year-over-year basis but really what we're doing is looking at what's actually happening in real time and applying that -- applying that out to the future. So one of the things that we mentioned is our network and more new markets than we've historically seen. So for example in the third quarter, last year 6% of our seats were in what we would call new routes pulling up. This year it\u2019s 11%. In the fourth quarter, it\u2019s a little bit lower on an absolute basis but on a year-over-year basis it goes to 3% last year to 8% this year. So those are the kinds of variables that we think about when thinking about our unit revenue guide and then when we talk about how it becomes beneficial for 2020, we have the ability to think about that and this goes in cycles, this goes in waves. Last year we entered nine new cities. This year we\u2019re going to enter seven new cities and as we put our network construction together for next year we think about these things and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helps a little bit for you but that's how we think about putting our guides together.\nSavanthi Syth: Just a follow-up on that, Matt. So is the kind of the assumption that you continued doing some of the Tuesday cuts last year. I know late last year we\u2019re thinking maybe you did too much and you might do less of it?\nMatthew Klein: Yes. So on a mix basis as a percentage of the network, we have a little bit less this year than last year. It's still relatively healthy number of cuts on off-peak days a week, but it's not as large a percentage as it was last year, that's right.\nOperator: Our next question is from Hunter Keay.\nHunter Keay: How does this recent experience with recoverability impact your thoughts on an aircraft order and the value of fleet commonality?\nEdward Christie: So as Scott mentioned in his remarks we\u2019re really at the in the short strokes here on our fleet orders, so we don't want to comment specifically on how we think about things in that regard because we were running a competitive process. We want to make sure that we get the best absolute result for our shareholders. Clearly inputs into that are there are benefits to having common fleet and we understand those and we spent a lot of time modeling them. And so, it's a consideration as we think about what's the right answer for us going forward. Much like there are other considerations that impact that as well like the price of the airplane and the maintenance cost of the airplane and the total cost of ownership, so I would say it's definitely an input and we know a lot about it being a single fleet operator today. So I think that at least can give you some color. Given where we are in the process I don\u2019t think we would really comment much further than that.\nHunter Keay: And is one way to improve the cost structure may be to reduce -- and bear with me on this to reduce your presence in airports with really high or quickly rising CPEs and favoring ones with lower CPEs, because obviously the rhizome temptation and the demand is obviously strong in the high CPE airports but the costs and the operational challenges there are only certain to get worse. So as you think about balancing all this stuff together, how do you factor in these CPE trends with what you just out with in terms of the cost grade? Thanks.\nEdward Christie: Sure. I think you're right. You're seeing cost creep at all airports by the way even the low CPE airports are in improvement process today. So there's projects nationwide and we\u2019re going to see pressure on a percent basis across the board, so I don't know the you could just isolate high cost airports versus low-cost airports. Mathematically what you said is correct. If we abandon all high-cost airports and when the low-cost airports our CASM will go down. I don't know if that's the right earnings outcome for our shareholders. And in fact over the last 10 years, we've been very careful about building a franchise that have balance to it, that includes larger leisure destinations, international and originations to lease and so there may be a mathematical answer in there, but I don't know that we think that's the right strategy going forward.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg: This is kind of a follow-up on the guidance to Scott. You call out 200 basis points the costs that are primarily related to higher estimates for flight disruption costs. It looks like that's referencing just the 3Q CASM guide, but I know that you go on to say that for the rest of the year you're anticipating challenging weather conditions. So on a full-year basis when we think about the lower completion factor because of maybe more inclement weather than normal. What is that, is that 100 basis points hundred, 150 basis points?\nScott Haralson: Mike this is Scott, so the way we\u2019re calculating or estimating the full year impact it's really about 100 basis points of ITE. There's about 50 basis points or so of ASM production will call it which is really sort of completion factor. And 50 basis points related to Fort Lauderdale construction and a little bit of Easter as well. So we\u2019re really talking about 200 from a full-year perspective.\nMichael Linenberg: Then maybe just a follow-up to that issue and whether Scott or even Ted you can answer. As you think about your systems and the ability to recover and deal with our regular operations are you anticipating maybe an increase in CapEx. Are there new systems that you have to invest in given the size of the company today or do you feel like what you currently have your current toolbox is sufficient and you\u2019ll get to the recovery and will be fine in 2020? Thank you.\nEdward Christie: Mike, it\u2019s Ted. So I do believe that what we have available to us today is both the knowledge base and the toolkit to make these adjustments. This has nothing to do with CapEx, this has nothing to do with systems. These are strategic decisions that we made in an effort to improve efficiency. And in this case coupled with the bad weather it didn't work. And what we\u2019re saying is that gives us an opportunity to pivot in all of that stuff then acts as a tailwind going into next year. And that's the way we\u2019re thinking about it, this is purely about execution around how we think about network and schedule construction. And how we think about allocation of crew resources.\nScott Haralson: Mike this is Scott, I would add to that, I don't want to oversimplify the operational component of this, but what we know the issue and have identified the changes we\u2019re going to make. So a vast majority of the fixed is in the crew and we know we can make that change. It doesn't structurally change the cost structure, it doesn't change how we view systems or people or processes. So we've identified and we\u2019ll be able to make that change in a fairly simple manner.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.\nRajeev Lalwani: Ted a question for you, over the last couple of years Spirit\u2019s made a bunch of network adjustments to move away from some of these highly competitive markets. Is that part of what's creating some of these headwinds for you as this completely unrelated to some of those network shifts you made to again avoid some of those hypercompetitive markets?\nEdward Christie: Well again I don\u2019t know that I would use the word avoid or whatever. We've had growth that comes in ebbs and flows. Rajeev so we've had years where we've grown considerably in Vegas and Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. We've had growth in bigger cities we had big international expansion those kind of things have happened at any given point. And this year we've added a lot of new midsized I would call them cities throughout the kind of \u2013 throughout the Eastern half of the United States. But no the direct answer to your question as they are totally unrelated the way we deploy in the roots we choose is not affecting the company's operational performance. What is the inputs as to how we view the resources that we deploy. So again optimizing for that utilization of both crew and asset is really what we know and understand about what we've done thus far and what we know we can fix going forward.\nRajeev Lalwani: Ted that\u2019s helpful and then as a follow-up Ted you\u2019ve touched the company as being sort of and correct if I'm wrong a flat to down year in, year out CASM story is that now off the table?\nEdward Christie: Yes, so I think we start with where we\u2019ve been and where we are today. And Scott mentioned that the airline business generally faces inflationary pressures that we deal with from time to time but are generally worse I would say sequentially than they have been wage related and airport related inflationary pressures. Luckily, we do have growth that helps us offset some of that and we still gaining scale that does help us offset some of that. So I think what's core for us Rajeev is widening the advantage maintaining absolute very, very low cost. That will come around the margin with any given year being maybe up a little or maybe down a little or maybe stable at any given year. But I think our view is that as we focus on operational efficiency good operational results and maintaining an absolute very low CASM our advantage widens over time and that sets us up well for our growth story.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jamie Baker.\nJamie Baker: So one of the questions I have and feel free to tell me if you think this is misguided. But is it possible that you're trying to overfly your pilot contract. I mean when I think back to last year you know management was pretty bullish about moving to a PBS. There definitely seem to be some efficiencies at the new contract we\u2019re going to unlock. I'm just wondering whether possible you\u2019ve tried to squeeze too much from the contract or possibly you haven\u2019t in which case there could be a contract related tailwind next year. I guess I'm just wondering if there's a pilot contract angle to what's currently going wrong again don't hesitate to call me out if I'm barking up the wrong tree?\nEdward Christie: Jamie, it\u2019s Ted. So first of all you know we've had the contract now for about a year and a half almost. We did get a bit implemented earlier this summer which was the last component really of that agreement. And we\u2019re very pleased with the way that implementation has gone, by the way still early. So we\u2019re still figuring things out as it relates to it, but we think that the teams did an excellent job of getting that implemented and going forward. I think that the answer to your question is we pushed, we may have pushed a little bit too hard as it relates to the structure or the construct of the resource allocation for pilots or flight attendants perspective to be fair. But I don't think that had anything to do necessarily with the contract. I think that was more about us just saying hey, we ran a really good airline last year and we challenged ourselves and said we felt like there was a little bit of slack in the business. And in doing so we said, we think we can probably \u2013 optimize a little more and that through those vehicles we just talk about. And I think if we were right about assuming that the weather pattern would be the same year-over-year we might be having a different discussion. So I think what we learned here is that in making those changes coupled with either this year being a more regular weather pattern and last year being artificially good don't know. But it definitely tells us a lot about the sensitivities in there and I think that's our time to adjust. While I would never criticize you were saying you are barking up the wrong tree. The concept is correct we probably did push, but I think it has more to do with our strategic decisions than it does with contract itself.\nJamie Baker: I just so would like to give management the opportunity to say no you\u2019re wrong. Can you say, a quick follow-up can you say how your RASM forecasts have evolved during the duration of the MAX groundings it doesn't look to me that there's been a profound impact given pretty limited overlap. I'm just curious as the delay wears on what has the sort of MAX related RASM experience been so far?\nMatthew Klein: So Jamie this is Matt, and its widely reported about where the cancellations have occurred and who should be seeing benefit or not seeing benefit. Generally speaking with the way the cancellations have rolled has been pretty widespread across the country. There are few routes that we had a little bit outside benefit from perhaps and we\u2019re taking advantage of that from a yield perspective. But generally speaking we\u2019re not necessarily seeing anything broadly helping us across the board. And one other thing to mention as it relates to what we've been seeing and we talk about network construction and a lot of the new things that we've added into the market this year is. It\u2019s possible for sure that we are seeing a little bit more MAX benefits than what we've been able to specifically tease out of our numbers. Simply because the mix or the flying we\u2019re doing is skewed more towards new than we had in the past. So it is a little hard so that there are so many moving pieces with how revenue comes into the network. It's hard to be able to pinpoint specifically on anyone given point.\nOperator: Our next question is from Helane Becker.\nHelane Becker: I just had two questions and they were mostly related to your loyalty program and the redesign of that. And I was kind of wondering if you could maybe update us on what you're thinking about there? And then the other question I had is on the big front seat and monetizing that and how you're thinking about your aircraft design going forward?\nMatt Klein: Helane, this is Matt. So from a loyalty program perspective, we are delayed on rolling that out. We talked about that I think a little bit earlier this year as well. You get one chance every show off to redesign your program and we\u2019re making sure that we get all the inputs correct. We\u2019re making sure that we have all the technology lined up so that when we go to launch everything works seamlessly and flawlessly and included in that would be a proper promotional push behind what we\u2019re doing as well. So all of those pieces together we\u2019re making sure we take our time on that and get it right. It is delayed, it is something that we wish we already had in place later this year, so this will be something that's beneficial to us next year and moving forward we\u2019re really pleased and proud of our non-ticket production that we've had this year with things like new programs like that not yet even contributing to the bottom line. So when we talk about non-ticket in general and the opportunity and excitement that we have for moving forward that is a perfect example on that you bring up of opportunity moving forward. In terms of big front seat and I think your question with regards to how we think about cabin construction moving forward. For big front seat, I am going to let Scott or Ed chime in on the cabin construction but in terms of big front seat itself in terms of revenue production we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019re doing there. It\u2019s continuing to improve at a very, very strong levels and we\u2019re really probably only in the fourth or fifth inning at best of being able to truly optimize the revenue. They are not just from a pricing and revenue management perspective but also from a merchandising perspective. So it's another one of those opportunities that are tailwinds for us as we continue to move through this year and into 2020 and reeling to 2021 big front seat still provides a lot of revenue opportunity for us.\nScott Haralson: Helane, this is Scott. To the cabin construction, we don\u2019t have any thoughts around changing the number of BFST to have and applying I think what Matt talked about, the merchandising opponent is what we really focused on. As we think about the RFP, if that's what we're getting at. No, no intent to think about adding additional BFS at this point.\nOperator: Our next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I think you had some leadership changes in network planning earlier in the year or late last year. Just staying on this new markets theme, can you quantify how much your new market push is holding back RASM either you know margin points or RASM points. What is the profile the new markets that are doing well versus the new markets that are holding you back and to what extent if any is the aggressive new market push versus dense buying in the markets that you're already serve contributing to the op strain?\nMatt Klein: Duane, it\u2019s Matt. Great question. So we didn\u2019t quantify that in the prepared remarks but I am prepared to tell you that in the second quarter the construction of the new cities, we think, we estimate it was between around 100 to 200 basis points of an impact to our second quarter TRASM and there's a lot of moving parts in there. I don\u2019t want to get into all the details as to where that comes from but we estimate its around 100 to 200 basis points in the second quarter. And we anticipate that\u2019s having the same impact on third quarter as well. Again we will be able to give you a better number on that after the third quarter closes because there\u2019s a lot of pieces still moving around in there but that\u2019s what we\u2019re anticipating the impact is. We didn\u2019t specifically call it out because a lot of this is just part of the normal course of business and you asked the question, so there\u2019d be answer but for the most part we just believe that the network moves, we have lots of cycles. We had opportunity to be able to get into new cities for us that we were previously not able to get into and we took advantage of those opportunities. When opportunities present themselves and we think they are good and they're already part of our five to seven year plan then if we have to advance some of those opportunities up, because they become available, we\u2019re going to do that. And it means there\u2019s a short-term impact and a long-term benefit to us. The last thing you want to do is be shut out of opportunities that we know are accretive to the network over time.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes. I certainly wasn\u2019t asking it from a big market versus small market perspective I know that's a thesis from for someone to call but you know to what extent did your new markets push contribute to the ops strain and I guess the basic question is, is densifying existing markets, whether those are big cities or small cities more attractive than the spaghetti approach that you had here?\nMatt Klein: So to follow-up then, directly the answer to your question is no. Adding the new cities that we added of not really added to any of the issues we\u2019re seeing from an operational perspective. One thing that we can say though, on to the second part of your question there is when we do densify in certain cities, it does give us the ability to think about how we schedule the airline and how we schedule the ability to have tail swaps or how we schedule the airline to help think about crew line construction. So as we do densify in certain cities, we definitely have those opportunities. Orlando and Las Vegas are perfect examples of that as we continue to grow in those cities. It\u2019s given us more ability to create a more flexible schedule and we\u2019re taking advantage of that in fact, as we move -- as we move through the summer to Scott, to what Scott and Ted said earlier, about learning -- learning from how we schedule to making changes, we've done some things already in our August schedule that should be up slightly beneficial and more beneficial than as we move out of the summer into the fall and into next year. We\u2019re going to be learning from things that we\u2019re doing and are taking advantage of that -- of that densification say in Las Vegas, it gives us way more opportunity to create swap opportunities for the operation to recover and run more in time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Susan Donofrio. Please go ahead.\nSusan Donofrio: Question on forward planning. So just given some of the challenges you\u2019ve had this quarter and certainly a number of the weather disruptions appear to be from Northeast of Florida. Are you thinking differently about new route and how you go forward with these? If you could address that, that will be appreciated.\nEdward Christie: Sure, Susan, it\u2019s Ted. So I think that as I mentioned earlier, the forward planning is definitely going to have an impact. What we\u2019re seeing today is going to have an impact on our forward plan. It has more to do with the inputs into that plan from a resource perspective than it has to do with route selection. We are primarily a Florida airline and that will not change. We have almost 50% of our capacity there touching Florida and it is a big piece of who we are. We\u2019re headquartered here. We\u2019re the home state airline. So while the weather has definitely shifted south this season and we've seen some data from the FA to confirm that it definitely has focused from the north, down into the south this year, that does not change our view of the overall opportunity. What it does do that was influenced the way we think about our recoverability and the slack we put in the system. And I think this quarter, this third quarter is an example of we probably push the marginal utilization of crew a little bit harder than we needed to and that probably cost us money rather than saved, and I think reversing that is very much in the cards.\nSusan Donofrio: And then it appears there maybe some north case available, any comment and whether you guys would be interested?\nEdward Christie: That\u2019s just obviously just came up this morning, so I think it's just too early to talk about that at all. We have a presence in New York, we\u2019re happy with our performance there and we'll just have to see how things develop.\nOperator: Our next question is form Kevin Crissey.\nKevin Crissey: The sector wants to be investable or many investors and analysts want the sector to be investible but kind of like unforced errors make it tougher days where the stock down double-digits or make that more challenging, particularly when it comes on the cost side which we can take for granted in the way. Can you talk about whether in the schedule process its different to change the amount utilization and sector, but are you changing any of their processes that you used to create the schedule, are you incorporating more team members from other divisions or is it the same people just making a more conservative approach to the schedule? Thanks.\nEdward Christie: Kevin, it\u2019s Ted. I\u2019ll comment here, obviously Matt\u2019s team is responsible for the scheduling, he can add in some color but we are an aggressive shop and since 2016 we have done a much better job of getting the teams together in a room talking about the impacts that we have. I think from time to time we've had some very good successes that have come out of that exercise and quite frankly setting aside this summer, there have been some periods over the last three years where a few things did not work very well and we had tougher operational periods in early 2017 and the like that we learn from. And so, there is already a lot of heads and a lot of brains involved with this, to make sure that we\u2019re running the most efficient schedule we can. Clearly, as I\u2019ve defined it, we've narrowed it down to a few discrete items that that we understand and that we intentionally moved, so as it relates specifically to right now, I think it is a little bit \u201ceasier for us to adjust\u201d because we know exactly what we've done and exactly what we\u2019re going to do to change it. So regardless of that there\u2019s a lot of people talking about how do we make it better going forward?\nOperator: Next question is from Catherine O'Brien.\nCatherine O'Brien: So maybe first question, can you give us some color on the benefits if any you\u2019re seeing from your revenue management improvements and adding more dynamic pricing ability to revenue stream, is there a boost that you saw in the second quarter, are you anticipating that to increase, doesn\u2019t move towards the year any color there would be great.\nMatt Klein: Catherine, it\u2019s Matt. Thanks for the questions. So we have seen a lot of benefit from what we\u2019re doing from a revenue management perspective in terms of ancillaries, from the bags perspective, we are just beginning to a learning what we call clusters of customer segmentation. So we\u2019re looking at specifically how groups or parties think about bags, where they\u2019re flying to and then making sure that that pricing is very transparence everyone is extremely important. I want to make sure that there's no surprises in and how that pricing works, so that's very -- it's very clear and evident on our website as to how that works, so we've taken a lot of time to do that and be thoughtful about that. On a seats perspective, we talked a little earlier about big front seat and where we are there and all the opportunity we have going on there. And one thing that we talked about in the past a little bit but I think I can bring up right now as well is that stage does have some impact on our non-ticket production, so the fact that stage was down 4.5% in the second quarter but non-ticket per passenger segment was up 1.8% in the second quarter. I think probably speaks to the answer to your question about the success of our revenue management initiatives.\nCatherine O'Brien: And then maybe just you know, reflecting on the fact that you are seeing a drag to RASM this year given some of the new markets you\u2019ve added over the past 12 months and to ramp up on those markets is a little bit slower than you were initially expecting. Does that change how you think about maybe 2020 or even farther out capacity growth both in terms of how much in the complexion of that growth? Thanks.\nEdward Christie: Catherine, it\u2019s Ted. So it's a great point and as Matt mentioned, we were opportunistic in finding markets that largely were gate constrained and an opportunity for us to get into them, they were part of our plan and we gave ourselves that that opportunity clearly increased the mix of new flying this year, but I can tell you that based on what we know today, it turns around again next year and such that that gap that Matt was describing in percentage terms probably goes back down to a more normal rate, and again, acts as a natural tailwind. As the markets matures, so we think about what the company has done over the last year, we\u2019ve got a big international presence that's growing and maturing in Orlando and then thus far this year we've added a bunch of new cities that are clearly a drag right now, but all of that stuff should help us going into 2020.\nCatherine O'Brien: Maybe like one really quick follow-up to that. In terms of these new markets maybe in larger cities just ramping a little bit further than you thought. What's driving this slow ramp is that competitive response, is it just your forecast in terms of where the [indiscernible] those market any color will be helpful?\nMatthew Klein: So this is Matt again. So just to be clear some of them are taking a little bit longer. And most of that is regarding our expansion out of Orlando from an international perspective. And that's really just because the expansion we did there was very large and very quick. And a lot of those routes don't have a whole lot of history behind them from a nonstop seats opportunity perspective. So we\u2019re building markets which is what we do in general and it was just the large number of them some of them are ramping a little slower. And we mentioned I think after Labor Day we\u2019re starting to make adjustments to the schedule, optimize the schedule little bit better there in Orlando. So and just to be clear about other new routes, we are very happy with how they are moving, they are actually moving along the lines. There is few exceptions as there - always are but generally they're moving along the lines we\u2019d like to see. It's just the mix is double in percentage point terms than it was last year that is what\u2019s having the drag on unit revenue. Specifically it\u2019s not this city or that city in fact we\u2019re happy with everything we\u2019re doing there. Some of the routes ramped even faster than we expected. So I don\u2019t want you to take this away it\u2019s something that we have an issue going on overall. It\u2019s very normal kind of process and just a mix of new routes is really what\u2019s causing the drag right now, right now.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan McKenzie.\nDan McKenzie: Matt following up on that last question. If you would take a look in international versus domestic would you characterize 75% of the 200 bps RASM headwind in the third quarter or second quarter from international or 50% or all of it. I\u2019m just wondering if you can just pull a little finer point on that response?\nMatthew Klein: So thanks for the questions we can make this more clear. We had about 100 basis point drag from the international network itself and that\u2019s just from the ramping like we just described. And then on top of that, the domestic is probably causing that\u2019s the part that\u2019s a little harder to pinpoint exactly when we\u2019re estimating its between 100 to 200 basis points on the domestic new routes.\nDan McKenzie: The new routes 100 bps, okay. The book away in the third quarter revenue outlook from the operational disruptions, is there any book away embedded I guess first off. And then secondly, what's the revenue opportunity from calling back some of this lost business. And I guess you know related to this, I\u2019m wondering if you can just talk about the on-time in June versus what you're seeing months to date and where you expect to end the year exiting?\nMatthew Klein: So the operation itself is not really causing a book away for us right now. One of the things that does occur when we cancel flights in the peak season which is we're in right now, we don't really have a revenue recoverability on that and a lot of that is just because we have very, very high load factors and the industry has high load factors. So a lot of times, we can get people to where they want to go for a day or two and if they\u2019re only taking a couple day trip, they may choose to cancel the trip out right which we don't like of course and we don\u2019t want to provide that kind of experience to the guest but it just happens in the summer more than it happens other parts of the year. So if they canceled their outbound that means they can\u2019t come back, but if they are coming back only two or three days from now, our model and product is not set up to sell a lot of that demand super closed in. So a lot of times we get the outbound cancel, than the seat flies empty coming home. So that's why when we have operational disruption in the summer and peak periods, it impacts us more than it may impact other airlines out there. And Ted you want to talk to the on-time performance.\nEdward Christie: Yes, so and just a clarification on that Dan, I mean we aren't seeing any evidence of book away. I mentioned earlier that the brand is strong, our metrics are still good. I think that the work we've done today's is doing exactly what we would have hoped. And quite frankly from an on-time perspective we\u2019re still clicking along very much with what we hoped. Our on-time performance while lower in July then it was in June not surprisingly given the weather and the fact that we are intentionally pushing in the peak. We're still in the 70s and so that feels like about what we would've scripted out. If you\u2019d asked me at the beginning of the year how I felt about on-time, it's more about the completion factor and the last few flights of the day that's where we\u2019re having the \"disruption\" and that's the part that can be fixed with a few changes to the schedule and a few changes to reserve optimization.\nDan McKenzie: Can you just remind me when those change is going to effect, is it in September or is it more fourth quarter?\nEdward Christie : You know it's a bit - from a schedule perspective I think Matt mentioned earlier there's a few things that we can do close in that will assist a little bit heading into the fall and by the time we reach the peak of the fourth quarter there would be a few more things helping us from a schedule perspective but the really longer pooling attempt is making sure we have adequate crew resources to be - to make sure we have the mix on reserve correct, that just takes the engine a little bit longer to spool up. So we're really thinking more about that being more of a Q1 and beyond kind of thing next year which is why our forecast today assumes there will be a little bit more disruption than we had originally planned and a little bit lower completion factor.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time.\nDeAnne Gabel : Great. Thank you everyone for joining the call today and we will catch you next time.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "SAVE", "quarter": 1, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-04-25 17:05:07", "content": "Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to DeAnne Gabel, Senior Director, Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thank you, Christine, and welcome everyone to Spirit Airlines first quarter 2019 earnings call. This call is being recorded, and simultaneously webcast.

Presenting on the today's call are Ted Christie, our Chief Executive Officer; Matt Klein, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Scott Haralson, our Chief Financial Officer. We will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts following our prepared remarks. Also joining us in the room today are Thomas Canfield, our General Counsel; John Bendoraitis, our Chief Operating Officer; and other members of our senior leadership team. With that, I will turn the call over to Ted.\nEdward Christie: Thanks, DeAnne. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. I also want to thank our entire Spirit team for their contributions to our first quarter 2019 results. We executed well on our revenue initiatives and maintained our focus on controlling costs. Together, with strong underlying demand trends, we were able to grow earnings per share by over 90% year-over-year to $0.84 per diluted share. On the operational front, in the first quarter, we improved our completion factor by 70 basis points achieving a 98.9% completion factor for the March quarter, and our on-time performance for the quarter was among the best in the industry at 82.6%. Based on preliminary results, we ranked among the top three carriers for on-time performance in January, February and March. With that, here's Matt and Scott to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2019 and our outlook for the second quarter and the full-year 2019 in more detail.\nMatthew Klein: Thanks, Ted. For the first quarter 2019, total revenue increased 21.5% year-over-year to $856 million. Total revenue per available seat mile increased 4.1% year-over-year on 16.9% capacity growth, with gains in both load factor and yields. On a per passenger segment basis, non-ticket revenue performed in line with our expectations. And for the first quarter was $56.20, up 1.6% or $0.91 year-over-year, primarily due to our dynamic pricing initiatives and our bundled services offering. Both of these initiatives are continuing to mature and we remain confident we can grow non-ticket revenue per segment each quarter this year and produce non-ticket revenue per passenger segment between $56 and $57 for the full-year 2019. We are pleased to say our new website is now launched and in full production. This new platform provides better analytics that over time will help drive ancillary revenue via improved merchandising, which we expect will lead to better conversion rates of ancillary products. The new look and feel of the website is aligned with our goal to modernize our product and showcase the high value our product provides the leader customers. Over the last 18 months, we have also made good progress in improving our brand reputation. Our complaint ratios have declined to an all-time low. We remain among the best in the industry in terms of baggage handling and, as Ted mentioned, in on-time performance. We have recently ranked number four in both The Wall Street Journal and Money Magazine for 2018 overall performance. And just last month, we received the ATW Value Airline of the Year Award, beating our competitors from all across the globe. We still have a lot of work to do, but the hard work from our entire Spirit team is creating a powerful foundation from which we'll build on for many years to come. Turning now to our capacity guidance, we estimate that on a year-over-year basis, capacity will be up approximately 13% for the second quarter, up approximately 14% for the third quarter, and up 14% to 16% for the fourth quarter, for a full-year capacity growth of approximately 15%. Much like we did last year, we are in the process of evaluating the mix of off-peak and peak volumes for the fall and winter of this year. And based on that, we will likely make further adjustments that could include some reductions to our fall schedule. In addition, we are seeing fuel prices escalate. Fuel price in and of itself doesn't change our thoughts about how much we should be growing, but it does impact where we deploy our capacity. This process is dynamic and will take into account our view of marginal performance during those more off-peak periods. We don't have any formal update today, but we will keep you updated as we lock in our schedules. Now, turning to our revenue outlook. In the latter half of March, passenger yields in our markets softened a little more than we had modeled out. This trend continued through the first half of April. However, it's important to note that Easter bookings were strong and yields firmed over that period as we expected. Additionally, based on the trends we are seeing for May, we believe the pricing softness we experienced in the second half of March through early April was largely transitory. May is shaping up much like we expect it to, based on this part of the booking curve and June trends look encouraging as well. Given this, for the second quarter 2019, we estimate TRASM will increase approximately 5% year-over-year. This includes an estimated 200 basis points benefit due to the shift of Easter. Overall, macro trends look strong and we like how we are set up as we head closer to the summer peak travel period. While we are always focused on the travel period directly in front of us, the work we are doing now in evaluating third quarter trends and post summer is also top of mind. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.\nScott Haralson: Thanks, Matt. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. The team did an excellent job of managing several cost pressures during the quarter. Efficiency and productivity gains helped to offset higher-than-expected pressures from various airport rent escalations and ground service rates, such that our first quarter 2019 CASM ex-fuel was $0.0546, an increase of 2.4% year-over-year, which was in line with our guidance. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher salaries, wages and benefits for ASM, driven by higher pilot rates. This increase was partially offset by lower aircraft rent per ASM and better operational performance. Regarding fleet, in the first quarter, we took delivery of five new aircraft, ending the quarter with 133 aircraft in our fleet. As we've mentioned previously, in order to meet our targeted 15% capacity growth rate in 2020, we are looking to add a few additional aircraft beyond our scheduled deliveries. We sourced two used A320 aircraft that we expect to be in scheduled service sometime late fall. Additionally, we have had our back half of 2019 deliveries delayed a bit with one of our 2019 deliveries now expected to deliver in early 2020. Net-net, our capacity profile for 2019 remains about the same. We ended the March quarter with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment. We had operating cash flow of $205.2 million and we generated adjusted free cash flow of $163.8 million. Looking ahead to our second quarter cost guidance. This summer, the Ft. Lauderdale Airport will begin doing construction on the north runway, limiting the throughput. Following our review of the airport's operational plan, we decided to increase the number of crew members and effective aircraft spares in Fort Lauderdale Airport during the construction, adding approximately 100 basis points to the CASM ex-fuel year-over-year percentage change for the second quarter 2019. Separately, last weekend, a severe storm system impacted a large majority of flights to and from Florida. We canceled 318 flights and incurred costs of about $6 million of passenger reaccommodation and disrupted crew expenses. The additional expense and loss of ASMs related to the storm adds approximately 150 basis points to CASM ex-fuel. Taking this into account, we estimated our CASM ex-fuel for the second quarter 2019 will be up approximately 4.6% year-over-year and our full-year 2019 CASM ex-fuel guide is now up 2% to 3% year-over-year, which includes 50 basis points related to carrying the extra crew during the Fort Lauderdale runway construction and 50 basis points related to the Easter storm. Our cost advantage is one of our most important assets. Despite some near-term pressures going into 2019, going forward, we expect to continue to expand our relative cost advantage by further improving our operational reliability, gaining scale benefits, using technology to enhance efficiencies and leveraging opportunities to increase utilization. With that, back to Ted.\nEdward Christie: Thanks, Scott. Before I close, I want to address a question we often get asked about how we make our decision as to where we add service. We believe our total addressable market remains very large, larger than we can possibly absorb over the next five-plus years growing capacity in the mid-teens range. Over the last two years, we've been very consistent about executing to our plan of broadening and diversifying our network by targeting large leisure destinations, near-field international markets, as well as large origination markets which may include growth in gate-constrained metros when we are able to secure the necessary access and real estate to support it. For example, in the last 12 months, we have added quite a few new destinations to our network, including Burbank, Sacramento, Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Austin, Indianapolis, Asheville, Jacksonville, Greensboro, Richmond and Columbus, as well as Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Cali, Colombia and Guayaquil, Ecuador. We further grew our international footprint with 13 flights from Orlando to international destinations we also serve from Fort Lauderdale, and we've also added some new service connecting existing Spirit destinations that weren't previously connected. This strategy has been working well for us over the last several years and we plan to continue with it. We routinely evaluate the impact of our service in new markets. The data supports that our entry does stimulate more traffic than the seats we add and that the total revenue carried in our growth markets goes up commensurate with our entry. This Spirit FX has proven true in nearly every instance, which we believe validates our model and shows the benefit low cost service can bring to existing markets, no matter how large or small or the level of their current service. In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong first quarter results and the overall momentum in the business. We are well-positioned to leverage our strengths as we head into the peak summer travel period in mid-June. With that, back to DeAnne.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thanks, Ted. Christine, we are now ready to take questions from the analysts. We do ask that you limit yourself to one question with one related follow-up.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Savi Syth. Please go ahead.\nSavanthi Syth: Good morning, I was just wondering if you could, on the cost side, give us a little bit more color on why this kind of came in so late in terms of \u2013 you probably knew that there was a airport construction going on? And just kind of help us understand \u2013 get comfortable with the fact that this is kind of related to the airport construction and not something that's ongoing. Thanks.\nScott Haralson: Great. Hey, Savi. This is Scott. Hey. The plan for the runway construction has been \u2013 ongoing discussions with Spirit and the airport and the other airlines for a while. We and the other airlines have been in discussions and have been considering the airport issues and their timeline, our own desires to minimize the impact. So up until the middle of the quarter, until we review the final plan and decided on a plan of action for Spirit, we really did not have an answer. So we decided that it would be prudent for us to add a few extra crews to think about spares intelligently. And now we're telling you about it. So it's really been sort of an ongoing discussion and how we're going to handle it.\nSavanthi Syth: Got it. And, Scott, maybe as you kind of think about costs, what you're seeing today, kind of execution and any progress on kind of the PBS? How are you thinking about second half, into 2020, like, what the underlying kind of core trend is?\nScott Haralson: Into the second half of 2020, Savi? Is that the question?\nSavanthi Syth: Sorry, second half of 2019 and into 2020.\nScott Haralson: Right. So look, we're confident about the core cost of the business. Outside of the discrete items, with the airport construction and the weather, we're handling what the industry is dealing with, which is increased labor cost, increased airport cost, but we're really satisfied and really encouraged about the ongoing management of the core cost of the business. So our core cost to remain intact. And, look, we're confident in our ability to continue to widen the cost gap versus the industry. So we're managing what we can manage and I think we're in a good spot.\nSavanthi Syth: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Caiado. Please go ahead.\nJose Caiado: Hey, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Matt, question for you. Can you just talk a little bit about how the international expansion out of Orlando has performed relative to your initial expectations?\nMatthew Klein: Hey, Joe. Thanks. Yes, so the big growth there, just to remind everyone, started in fourth quarter of last year. We started off with 11 new routes in October and November of last year and then we added a couple more routes in the end of February, early March of this year. And whenever you add to a franchise like that, you know you are undertaking an investment. And we talked on the last call about how we were pleased with what we saw over the peak holiday period in the fourth quarter. And as we head now out of the first quarter into the second quarter, we like what we see from those routes. Now, having said that, anytime you add that kind of capacity growth, I believe our capacity growth in the international region was somewhere around 90% year-over-year in the first quarter; and in the second quarter, we're looking at about a 50% ASM growth in that overall franchise this year. So that's always going to have some bit of a drag simply because there is an investment going on there, something we knew would happen, and something that we're pretty comfortable with. We like the non-ticket production that we're seeing there as well. And overall, we think it's a great idea for us. As we've talked before about, our unique ability to carry VFR traffic \u2013 visiting friends and relatives traffic \u2013 and our model plays really well in there in terms of an ancillary revenue production on top of the tickets purchase. And I think Ted has some thoughts on it as well.\nEdward Christie: Yes. So the only color I might add there to help you think about it is \u2013 and what Matt said is 100% correct. We're very excited about building out the international franchise and seeing it blossom here in Orlando is a really good step for us as we think about what happens beyond that as well. But with that kind of capacity growth, you are seeing a drag on system RASM. So we're putting up these numbers we're talking about in the first quarter and the second quarter. And despite what we think \u2013 if you did some math, and it's not perfect, by the way, and you think about how you might otherwise have deployed those airplanes domestically, it's probably around 150 basis points drag on the whole system right now. With that said, very excited about what we're going to see as it goes into the summer and fall and eventually laps itself by the winter and will be a very positive contributor going forward. So right now, we're putting up pretty good numbers with this franchise and investment being built. And it's something that we don't talk a lot about, but we feel really good about how it's moving forward.\nJose Caiado: I appreciate all that detail. Thank you. My second question, maybe for John, just the first part is when that runway construction at Fort Lauderdale is expected to be completed. Apologies if you said it and I missed it. But then, John, how does that impact your ability to push utilization higher this summer from an ops perspective? Thanks.\nJohn Bendoraitis: Yes. Thanks for the question. So just as a reminder, construction period starts on or about June 3 and runs for approximately 120 days. So kind of end of September-ish is the plan. There are contingencies on both sides of that and there are incentives to make sure that that gets done on time. In terms of utilization, that's just something that we work on as a team ongoing. Every year, we push the utilization up in the summer time. That's our busiest period. It's not going to affect the utilization for this summer. The construction won't affect it, in that we've got our plan built. What it does affect is our ability to run an on-time operation potentially. So mitigating delays that are a result of the construction or the weather, but we intend to run the same high utilization that we always have.\nMatthew Klein: Yes. Joe, the only thing I would add there is we've clearly made commentary around, as the operation has improved, we see an opportunity to flex utilization in periods of high RASM. And while that opportunity exists, we were never intending to over rotate on that opportunity, meaning we never intended to pump utilization at any one given point quickly. This was always going to be what lessons are we learning about how the operation is performing. Heading into this summer with the Ft. Lauderdale construction, that immediately makes us more cautious. And while the airline always has been a high utilization airline, I think we're going to be careful in that regard. And Scott alluded to it in the commentary around costs that we're clearly thinking about crew, so that we're in a better position to recover. But in addition to that, the positioning of our spares and the amount of spare available time that we have is probably more than we would have otherwise. And so I think that, again, is reflective of what we think will be a challenging operation. But, again, it points to the fact that there is opportunity here over time for us to move utilization, again, not dramatically so, but in a way that we think adds to the RASM trajectory.\nJose Caiado: Understood. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jack Atkins. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess, first off, here for Matt. Matt, you talked about some challenges in the second half of March and into early April from a yield perspective. Could you maybe just sort of expand on what do you think drove that? And you mentioned that you thought these were transitory issues as you look out into the busier later spring-summer travel months. But just curious what drove that greater-than-expected weakness in late March and early April if you have some ideas around that?\nMatthew Klein: Yes. Sure, Jack. Thanks for the question. So what was interesting along the way, throughout these periods, is we still were able to put really good volume on the aircraft. So it wasn't necessarily a matter of being able to attract demand. And over the spring break period \u2013 and you have to remember, as we've talked about a lot, Easter shifted out of March \u2013 out of April 1 last year. So Easter had a big piece in March last year and straddled the beginning of the month into late Easter. In fact, this is one of the latest Easters an Easter can ever fall. When that happens, you do have a trough period that will occur in late March, early April generally speaking. And we knew that. And we knew that heading in. The issue from what we saw \u2013 and this is that our leisure routes, and especially some of the established national routes like Puerto Rico and things of that nature, performed really well. It was some of the, say, non-Florida that, while we were able to put a lot of volume on the aircraft, we were not able to get the yields that we had been seeing, say, in the fourth quarter and third quarter last year. So there is a little bit of anticipation that, as we get into a more sort of shoulder period, that we would see those yields come through. And again, the demand was strong. We saw the loads, but we just weren't able to get the yields up quite to the level that we had anticipated. And we're not talking about really large impacts here. We're talking about just not getting it over the hump that we were expecting to see. The reason why we have some confidence here moving forward is that, what we're seeing now out in May and into June is, again, demand looks good. Memorial Day weekend, we like how we're setup from an inventory profile perspective and demand is coming in. So largely, we feel pretty good what we're seeing in May. Historically, when you see signs like this in May that gives you encouraging trends about what you're going to see in June and the summer. Will it hold this year? We won't know until we get into it, but it looks like it's setting up to be a setup that historically has a pretty decent correlation. One other thing to add is, we do have some reduced expectations for May as well because when you have an Easter this late, it can have an impact on leisure demand into May. So again, there's a lot of moving parts when you think about PRASM and then the resulting TRASM. So we're always trying to juggle all of these to come up and model out what we think we're going to see. And a lot of times you rely on history to help you with that and then you mix in the recent trends that you're having in current time.\nJack Atkins: Okay, great. Thank you for that color, Matt. And then, for my follow-up question, and I guess this one's for either Scott or John, when you think about just the construction at Fort Lauderdale, just to go back to that for a moment, and then you're looking out into the third quarter, as that construction continues, are there levers that you guys can pull within the business, whether it's at Fort Lauderdale or other places within the business to help sort of offset some of those incremental costs that you're going to be incurring? As you plan out \u2013 try to plan out for the third quarter, are there some things you can do in the business when you get out 90 to 120 days to help mitigate some of those incremental costs?\nScott Haralson: Hey, Jack. Yes, and so two points. On the Fort Lauderdale construction, yeah, we're going to carry some crew, but we're going to do some things operationally to help mitigate that in the way that we route crews and the way that we route aircraft and isolate certain things to help mitigate some of the impact. But the other cost in the business, look, we're always trying to find ways to reduce our unit costs. And we're going to continue to do that and probably even with a little more zealous as we go through Q2 and Q3 and Q4 even. So we're going to find ways to handle that. But, look, it's going to be a challenging summer for us. Lauderdale is a big piece of the network, but we're going to do what we do with managing costs and make sure that gets taken care of.\nJack Atkins: Okay. That's great to hear. Thanks again for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Wondered if you would talk a little bit about new markets, the profile of markets that are outperforming versus the profile of new markets that are underperforming?\nEdward Christie: Hey, Duane. It's Ted. I'll take off. We can let Matt fill around the detail. One thing about the network that we've witnessed, and I mentioned it in my prepared commentary, is the diversity of the network becomes ever more apparent as we move through. And the good news about that is the \u2013 what we're seeing is that the performance in all of those various segments of the business is consistent with our expectations and performing in line with what we would have seen prior. So if it's international, clearly, we already discussed that today. With that dramatic an increase in capacity, you would expect to see some drag and we've got that kind of built into our expectations, but we're very excited about what that will do over the long-term. And then, you talk about our leisure build-up and we've had a pretty large increase in large leisure destination flying over the last two years. And that is all performing very, very well. And so again, that stuff, coupled with mid-sized cities feeding those opportunities, and where we can, we still have opportunity in large constrained metros. Admittedly, each one of those cities behave a little bit differently. Not each city is the same. So Sacramento, for example, right now has announced into Las Vegas. That's one opportunity in Sacramento. And we're doing four routes out of Charlotte, for example, and we did eight or nine opportunities out of Austin on the launch. And I think what you're finding is that each city is a little bit different. They're all relatively small components of the network, but they all are producing in line or better than what we thought. And that's very good news from a diversity standpoint and it enhances our overall deployment opportunity. So I guess, that's the color I would give.\nMatthew Klein: Yes, sure. And just to add to that, just some figures for you, is in the last year, we've added 83 new routes to the network. And then, as you hear us talk about, we're always looking to see where we can make optimization changes to the schedule. So 83 new routes and we had 15 exits in the last year. So pretty good hit rate for us. And we're pretty proud of that. And so overall, we think the way that we're deploying is generally working. And I think, for the most part, as Ted mentioned, a lot of our growth is happening in leisure routes. And when you think of cities like Orlando, Las Vegas, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, New Orleans, the vast majority of our seat growth, not just last year, but over the last two years, has been just to those five cities alone, building upon what we think is our strength, which is making sure we hit up on leisure destinations.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And then, just for my follow-up, I don't know if it's possible, but can you talk a little bit about competitive markets that were MAX markets? Theoretically, when these MAX aircraft were grounded, initially, it was sort of a shock to the system and there is no ability to do any proactive planning on the part of your competitors? But as you look into May and June, there should be more ability to plan for that. And South Florida, in particular, had a very high degree of MAX capacity for at least one of your competitors. So is there any way for you to weigh in on if you're seeing benefits from MAX coming out of the system?\nEdward Christie: Yes. Sure, Duane. So the truth of the matter is, we had our deployment ideas already kind of sketched out and, for the most part, announced for the year. So where we are today is where we would plan to go. There obviously, has been an impact on the broader industry as a result of capacity deployment coming out because of the cancellations associated with the delays and getting the MAX going. That may provide near-term benefit in some markets. Anytime you have a capacity reduction that could help. But I don't think it affects the long-term strategy of our business. I think we're planning \u2013 we have really laid out for ourselves over the next five years what we plan to do and have a pretty good idea of how those things are going to move in and out. Now, the timing of each individual market may move. So some may be done sooner depending on availability of gates, for example, or some may be done later, but, nonetheless, we have a pretty good idea. And so I think that's probably where we sit as it relates to the MAX cancellations, Matt, do you want to that?\nMatthew Klein: Yes. One other thing, Duane, with that is when we think about, say, South Florida, in general, our ASM growth in second, third quarter is right now low-double digits in the second quarter and high-single digits in the third quarter in terms of ASM growth for us in South Florida. The industry is roughly flat. And that includes our growth. So overall, we feel pretty good about what the overall profile looks like in South Florida. And adding on to what Ted said, irrespective of what's going on with MAX groundings, this is what the environment looked like already and there's been some adjustments. But, generally speaking, that's the kind of seat growth you're seeing in South Florida. So we think it's actually a pretty decent setup for the second and third quarter there. And, yes, we have seen some routes where we will expect to see some benefit, but it's very limited in terms of where we expect to see large benefit. And, in fact, most of the routes where some of the grounding, some of the pulls have come out due to the MAX are routes where some of our competitors had six, seven, eight, nine, 10 flights a day. So for the most part, it helps, but it's not like there's a large number of markets that are being ceded to us for a short period of time.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Crissey. Please go ahead.\nKevin Crissey: Hi. Thanks for the time. Maybe the first one is for Matt and the second one for Ted. Matt, one of the challenges for your stock, I think, from this point forward is kind of how well you did on RASM in the second half of 2018, creating tough comps. But maybe it's not so tough because, two years ago, were pretty easy comparisons. Can you talk about how you see the overall backdrop for RASM growth? I know you're probably not going to \u2013 I doubt you'd be guiding specifically, but, structurally, I'm trying to mitigate this concern for investors, the back-half tough comps.\nMatthew Klein: Yes, sure. So that's right. On the year-over-year basis, the comp is going to look tough year-over-year. What we're doing to offset some of these things is taking place on both the fare side and the non-ticket side. So on the fare side, our fares are still generally really low out there. We have a lot of room to move up on fares. And we're chipping away at that as best as we can, especially as we've been seeing oil tick up a little bit here. We've been taking action. So some of the things that don't really get widely reported, but, in fact, that we've done is we took a $3 system-wide fare increase a couple of weeks ago. A large part of that fare increase has held reasonably well on what we would call mid-level and higher-yielding fares. Again, remember, higher yielding fares for Spirit. So those are things that we do that don't necessarily get reported, but we're taking action. We know it's coming not only from the unit revenue comp perspective, but also from an overall earnings perspective. That's our job. We always maximize unit revenue, irrespective of what's going on with fuel. And we've also been adjusting our fuel surcharges and other kinds of peak travel surcharges. So we're taking a lot of action on the fare side to push those fares up as best as we can. A lot of times inventory control, not just with ourselves, but with the industry in general, will limit some of the improvement we can see on a route-by-route basis. But, generally speaking, we feel pretty good. And we're continuing the trend that we've had the last few quarters of seeing a large majority of our markets continue to see unit revenue improvement on a year-over-year basis. So we're really happy with what we're seeing there. We do not expect that to change. The amount of growth or the level of the growth may change a little bit, but the overall growth that we're seeing is very encouraging to us. It means what we're doing is working and what we're pushing forward even in a competitive environment is working as well. And then, sorry for the long answer, Kevin, but then the second side of that is the non-ticket side of the business. And we've talked a lot about our various initiatives that we have out there. We have current products that we're continuing to get better at, revenue management of those products. I'll just give you a quick example, is our seats product that we have, big front seat as well as selling exit rows and other seats in the aircraft. We're very pleased with our continued yield management there. We don't talk about some of these breakouts a lot, but I'm comfortable telling you that our seats product is up high-single digits on a year-over-year basis. So the revenue management strategies are working. And some of these things just take a little bit of time. There's a lot of reliance on us deploying some technology out there. The data layer that we're adding to our website, which we talked about in the prepared remarks, is very exciting. And we're already being able to see new things on our new website, and it's only been out there for a couple of weeks. So these are the kinds of offsets. We're aware of what some of the comp issues are or what's being talked about, and we're working hard to offset all of that. That's course of normal business for us, Kevin.\nKevin Crissey: Thanks so much for the comprehensive answer. And, Ted, for you, maybe a bigger picture structural question. Every company has some area of needs or where they've historically chosen to invest later or, some might argue, under-invest basically an opportunity to look for more investment. Can you talk about what areas you might have, whether that be crew scheduling software or tech ops software or what are the areas that maybe you think that Spirit has an opportunity to make some investments that are really going to pay off?\nEdward Christie: Sure. Sure, Kevin. Thanks. So this is my seventh year. I just eclipsed my anniversary a few days ago. And I think, over that period of time, we've gone through quite a transformation, most of which has gone unnoticed because, I think, it was fair to say that, in the early stages of my tenure, we were significantly under-invested from a technology standpoint. I would have answered that question directly at that point. Over that period of time, we've invested significantly in the core infrastructure of the business to make sure that reliability is there from a technology perspective, and then shifted our focus to the deployment of applications that can actually improve performance and reduce costs. Now, that's where we are. And so in an acknowledgement of the progress that we've made, we also are acknowledging that there is room to continue to improve. And, for example, the storm that we just went through, and it was \u2013 use of the word unprecedented is a difficult one to use, but we haven't seen that level of ground stop in the Florida marketplace except for a hurricane before. So it was a very unusual setup. Where we got frustrated was it took us probably a day longer to recover than we needed to. And some of that comes with technology improvement and our ability to reassign crews faster than you can do manually. We've already made the decision to and are in line to implement that new technology later this year, and that happened prior to this storm and well prior to this year, but it does take some time to get the resources all deployed at the right time. So yes, the answer to your question is we made significant improvements in that regard, but I still think there is room for us and, as Matt alluded to, on the revenue side as well to continue to improve. I think that's where we spend the most of our time, is on technology. The core business is running very well and we feel like we have made the necessary investments in human capital, so that we've got the right leaders in the right positions to make these decisions.\nKevin Crissey: Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes. Hey, good morning. Two questions here. Matt, just with respect to the RASM guidance for the June Q, you talked about May and June booking up well. At this point, what percent would you actually have on the books for both May and then June? Rough estimates would be fine.\nMatthew Klein: Well, Mike, we don't usually talk about this in terms of absolutes, but we do have \u2013 a vast majority of our bookings are made prior to entering the travel months themselves. So for example, once we get into May, we're generally looking at a minority of bookings yet to come in. June still has a lot to go. We will take a lot of bookings from now until the beginning of June for the month of June. And then, once we get into those travel months, largely, we're just filling in what's left on the aircraft. So a lot of times, we'll have decent numbers in terms of having great visibility. So right now, for this quarter, we're looking out at June. It is out there and we are expecting to put a lot still on the books between now and the beginning of June. So we'll see how those trends play out.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And then, just my second question, either Matt or Ted, I know this is probably hard to measure as it relates to, call it, the price sensitive business traveler, but you would think that when you look at your operational performance, your metrics, you got us \u2013 you must be starting to attract more of that type of crowd, that higher quality crowd. And you may see it with respect to, like, the percent of people who book close in.  And I'm asking this within the context of \u2013 we look at some of the recent route additions, like a Sacramento or Burbank to Vegas. I know Vegas is not necessarily a business market, but there is still a decent amount of business travel there. The fact that you went into those markets with three daily flights, which is somewhat atypical, and when you look at the service pattern, it's actually quite attractive to that price-sensitive business traveler. I'm curious. I realize it's probably a multipart question, but are you seeing a pickup in that type of passenger, if you can measure that, number one? And number two, is that driving some of these route additions?\nEdward Christie: Sure, Mike. It's Ted. So the summary is, as you heard us say before, we didn't build the airline nor do we market the airline towards that type of traffic. We are focused on discretionary traffic that is largely based on leisure, visiting friends and relatives, that type of thing. There is probably a component of it, especially for small businesses or mid-sized businesses who control their own profit and loss statement and are focused on making sure that they manage their business that way. We no doubt have some of that traffic on our airplane, but the business is largely constructed around the leisure opportunity. And you mentioned some specific opportunities, for example, in Las Vegas. Those are very, very large markets. Sacramento to Las Vegas, Burbank to Las Vegas are huge markets from a leisure perspective. And they will also help the network from west to east because Las Vegas is now depending on the month, it's number two or number three in our network in size. And so there is a tremendous opportunity for those people to reach other destinations through Las Vegas. So I think it was not built nor is it our intent necessarily to carry that traffic. We know it exists. And we think it's on the airplane, but the largest opportunity is in that leisure discretionary traveler.\nMatthew Klein: That's right. And, Mike, I would just add to the end of that, is what we're trying to do from a reliability and on-time performance perspective is really to help the cost structure and make sure that we're running a great operation. Along the way, there will be some brand benefits as I kind of mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks. And our goal is just to make sure we're in the leisure customers leisure customers' consideration set. Look, in our test, we had some issues that hit our reputation. And we're overcoming all of those now. And what we want to do is make sure people that are, what we call, on-the-fence customers reconsider us as part of their consideration set. So it's not about going after the small business customer, although maybe some of them will end up flying on us. It's about reconnecting with leisure customers who may not have had the best experience with us in the past, and now they are going to have one. It's about getting those people to come back.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. Thanks, gentlemen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Hunter Keay. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just want to get back to a comment you made earlier today where you said fuel doesn't dictate your capacity growth, but it may dictate how you deploy it. I don't understand that. If you can do better pricing in those other markets, fuel aside, why wouldn't you just be putting those planes in there to begin with? You understand what I'm asking?\nMatthew Klein: Yes, Hunter. It's Matt. So it's a very fair question. So the way that we think about this is, depending on the fuel environment, there may be different kinds of routes that we would view as bigger investment routes that we know may take lower fares for us to be able to stimulate the kind of traffic that we want to get on to those aircraft. And if fuel is at certain levels, then we're just not going to \u2013 we just don't know that that's going to be a prudent decision at that time. So that's largely what we mean about when we think about routes and connecting dots or thinking about new routes, in general. And then, in terms of how we think about marginal flying in off-peak periods, it's sort of the same thing. Our goal is to maximize unit revenue, but our goal is really to maximize earnings. And there's going to be times when we get to certain levels where it's just not \u2013 it just doesn't make as much sense for us to deploy some of those ASMs, especially on off-peak days of the week.\nEdward Christie: Hunter, it's Ted. I refer you back to last year. We talked specifically. I think fuel was kind of on the move. Roughly right around the same time that it's moving right now and basically the same amount. And we made some decisions to move stage a little bit on average and a little bit of off-peak. And I think that's again, none of this is dramatically changing the entire capacity deployment structure, but it is us optimizing the earnings line. And I think that that's the kind of I think that's what Matt was alluding to.\nHunter Keay: Yes. That makes sense, Ted and Matt. And I'm just trying to \u2013 just as a follow-up, I guess, you've reiterated the full-year capacity guide and I think you're clear about sort of where you're going to deploy it. But are you suggesting here that, given where fuel is, as you look into the fall period, you're just not confident about the off-peak demand being good enough to warrant certain types of capacity? So are you basically suggesting that you have some concerns about off-peak pricing after the summer period sort of regardless of where fuel is?\nEdward Christie: Yes. So I don't know that I would say that. I think what we would say is that \u2013 again, I would focus more on the earnings discussion because the fuel component is a significant component of variable costs, and that's how we think about the most marginal flying. So I think it's more an earnings discussion than it is a pricing discussion. We're going to do all of the things that Matt alluded to earlier and discretely discuss to continue to move yields in the right direction to reflect the fuel environment. We also expect that that will be naturally the case in the industry. So that's why we will remain dynamic in the decision-making as to how we want to look at off-peak flying or stage or anything of that nature.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thank you everybody.\nEdward Christie: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone. And thanks for getting me on here. I guess, maybe I'm a little confused, but does that mean that you are rethinking 15% capacity growth for the year? Or am I just interpreting this that, there's certain markets that are going to work and others that won't and you should still be thinking that's the right growth rate?\nEdward Christie: Yes, I think, for now, Brandon, you should assume we're at 15%. I think what we're implying is that we take into account the marginal input costs, and it's possible that number may move, but it's not going to be material. We will optimize within the earnings band that we want. And so even if we're flying the same airplane the same number of frequencies every day, if the stage of that airplane is a little bit shorter, you're going to get a little bit less ASMs. That doesn't change the overall throughput of what we're going to do with that aircraft. So I think that's what we're trying to clarify. And it's the same thing we did last year. You could really just look at the way we approached it and said, okay, well, we should all be thinking about it that way going forward.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. And then, I guess, Ted, in light of the higher cost outlook here and I think an earlier question, we're talking about the higher comps on unit revenues into the back half of the year. Should we still be thinking that margin expansion is possible? Or are you happy being in around 15% on an EBIT line and growing the business at this pace?\nEdward Christie: Well, if you're talking about beyond this year, I think we are \u2013 that's a very robust move for us on the margin line and the earnings line this year, which we, obviously, knew the setup was going to be and very excited to be able to continue to deploy into. Beyond this year, we target opportunities at that number. It just so happens we're kind of back to the mean. And any individual micro marketplace, we're going to try to optimize that number higher. But that does depend on what's happening within the macro environment as well. So if you stretch this beyond 2020, it's tough for me to say exactly what the setup is going to be. But, clearly, our long-term target is still to find market opportunities in that mid-teens level. And it's good to see that that's basically where we hover around right now.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Helane Becker. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, team. Thanks for taking the time. Just two questions. One, can you just talk about the experience in Orlando specifically and if there's just been a lot of extra or industry capacity that's gone into the market that overlaps some of your opportunities, is one question. And the other unrelated question for Ted, can you just talk about capital allocation and how you're thinking about \u2013 or maybe Scott, how you're thinking about aircraft ownership, lease versus owned. I don't think it matters from an accounting perspective, but from a financing perspective it might. Thanks.\nMatthew Klein: Sure, Helane. This is Matt. I'll take the first part of that. So in Orlando, with that international expansion, we did have one competitor out of Latin America add two routes actually around the same time that we were announcing and starting service from Orlando, and that competitor is pulling those routes out in May and June of this year. So I think it talks to what we always talk about, is our leverage on the U.S. side of the business and our ability to serve VFR and leisure traffic is a bit unique. And I think this is probably proof of that. So two routes there that we're looking at now that are going to be ours. And there was also four other routes that we added in Orlando that don't have overlap with us. So there are routes in there that we have to ourselves and there's other routes that are actually heavily competitive as well. So generally speaking, that's how the setup is for Orlando. And as Ted was mentioning, some of the things that we put in Orlando are also sharing characteristics that we have in Fort Lauderdale. So overall, we really like what we're seeing. And part of the discussion about schedule optimization also involves what we're doing in Orlando. We're going to be taking a look at how can we create a little bit more network connectivity in Orlando. And, again, these are things that we can uniquely take advantage of in Orlando. That will also help that overall production.\nScott Haralson: Hey, Helane. This is Scott, to either answer the second part of that question. From a capital perspective, we feel good about where we are from a debt and lease perspective. We're in the 60% to 65% range on debt. We're going to be opportunistic, as we've already sort of talked about a little bit about the ongoing 2019 fleet transactions. As we see an opportunity to buy aircraft off lease or add additional capacity where necessary, we can do that in a flexible way. Look, we think debt financing is an efficient way to finance long-term assets. And our debt capacity and our ability to service that debt is well within levels that we can handle. In fact, we're going to see leverage decline over the future periods, as we expected, as we started debt financing. So we feel like we're in a good spot. Actually, the real question is about how we're deploying that capital and generating marginal returns. And we feel good about that. So we feel good about the debt levels and we feel good about how we're deploying the capital. So I think we're in a good spot.\nHelane Becker: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.\nDarryl Genovesi: Hi guys. Thanks for the time. Ted or Matt, I can't prove this, of course, but if I were to go back to your last conference call in January, I think you probably, at the time, would have been looking for more than 4.5% RASM growth in the first half of this year. And I don't know if \u2013 your expectation back then would've been 6% or 7%. But I feel fairly confident that at least investors and, I would venture to guess, yourselves were probably expecting the first half to play out a little bit better than this. That being said, I understand you're also thinking about a big airplane order, probably making some assumptions around what the long-term growth rate of the airline is going to be. And just wondering if there have been any updates to your thought around the right capacity plan and the right level of CapEx to support that plan.\nEdward Christie: Hey Darryl, how are you? Welcome back.\nDarryl Genovesi: Thank you.\nEdward Christie: So I think, look, it goes without saying that we entered into the first quarter expecting our unit revenues to be up 5% and they were up 4.1%. So I think it's fair to say that that was not in line with what we wanted at least for that quarter. With that said, there's been a lot of moving parts since then. And we're still very excited and extremely thrilled to be putting up what we think is amongst the best unit revenue performance in the industry with the highest growth rate. And our objectives around that is focus on the ancillary production, make sure that we're driving along that in a way that we can feel comfortable, will continue to add to the bottom line and move the fare where we can off of relatively low numbers. And I think that that's still got a nice setup for us, noting that the comps get more challenging in the back half of the year, but the absolute numbers are still low. With all of that, the growth opportunity still looks great. And, yes, we are in the process of evaluating a fleet order. And in doing so, trying to arrive at what we think the appropriate growth rate is over the longer term. For now, we've been targeting around mid-teens. But we've always said that, over time, that will round as the airline gets bigger. And I think the right way to think about this fleet opportunity for us is flexibility. What we want to be able to do with the manufacturers and with our financing partners is to design a fleet strategy that gives us ultimate flexibility to grow at rates consistent with the market opportunity. And so in micro flashes of either a recession or a downturn of whatever that might be, we want to be able to adjust. And in times of more robust growth, we want to be able to deliver. And I think what we've heard based on the preliminary and secondary feedback as we're well into this process is we're going to do that. We're going to get that flexibility in a way that we think helps us going forward, which I think is key. And it allows us to be dynamic in the view of the growth rate over the next five to 10 years.\nDarryl Genovesi: Thank you. And then, I guess, I'd like to just ask you one on CASMx. And, Matt, feel free to chime in. Your stock is down 10%. And I would say that most of that's probably attributable to the CASMx guide for this year being worse. And, I guess, I'd just \u2013 most of the qualitative commentary that you've put around, it would suggest that this is somewhat one-time in nature. But with the stock down 10%, 11%, the market doesn't seem to believe that. So with that in mind, would you help us understand what some of the puts and takes are for 2020 CASMx and if you have any preliminary thoughts on where that might shake out?\nEdward Christie: So let me address the core comment, which is the CASMx. Obviously, we had to move the guide by 100 basis points for the full year. Yes, we did describe it in a way that \u2013 and quantify in a way that reflects the fact that we believe it's two discrete items related to timing of a construction event at our primary airport and an unfortunately-timed storm in Easter period. And so we don't think that has any impact on the company's go-forward cost structure or strategy heading into next year. Right now, we're not prepared to give you any detail on 2020. But I think the puts and takes are basically the same thought around the way we looked at 2017, 2018, 2019, which is the company continues to mature its fleet, which is going to act as a headwind on the maintenance side, which shows up in our depreciation and amortization lines. We have pressures on wages and rates at airports. And then, we offset that with efficiencies. And Scott outlined some of the sound bites around that, but these are real things. Technology deployment at the airport in the form of more sophisticated bag drop facilities and queuing facilities and kiosk technology will actually help us from a unit cost perspective. And so doing more and more of that, consistent with our growth strategy and finding efficiencies on purchasing and obviously, we're going to have a big fleet order. We expect that that will be a natural CASM tailwind for us going forward. All of those things help offset those pressures, keeping our long-term cost structure intact and widening our advantage against the industry. And that's probably the way you should think about it.\nDarryl Genovesi: Great. Thank you very much. Really appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Baker.\nJames Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. You had 12 minutes of prepared remarks before Q&A. So shoutout on that. By the way, that's very efficient. I mean that.\nEdward Christie: Thank you.\nJames Baker: You're welcome. No, no, it makes better use of everybody's time. So yours included. A similar question to what I asked on the JetBlue call. I think a lot of the industry trends right now are kind of shared between ultra low cost carriers and the big three. Not to mention the tweeners in the middle, stuff like ancillary revenues, segmentation and so forth. Those are kind of big picture type themes. But I keep coming back to the topic of loyalty, which seems to me to be a theme whose benefits are really skewed towards the big three. I know you offer a differentiated value proposition to your flyers, but have you thought at all about the longer-term competitive ramifications of not being able to participate as aggressively in the loyalty sandbox?\nEdward Christie: Yes. So Jamie, great question. So we do think about these things. And one thing that we, for example, and in prior years, a lot of our growth \u2013 this is like a network answer to some of your question, is a lot of our growth in prior years has been connecting dots in cities where we already exist. And when you think about sort of credit card penetration and our $9 fare club subscription loyalty program, as well as our overall FREE SPIRIT loyalty program, some of that stuff can saturate over time. So as we've grown this year, we've gone into some cities that we think we probably should have been in for a little while. We just didn't have the deployment capacity available to us until this year. And cities that we've gone into Austin, Indianapolis, Raleigh, and some of the cities we went into last year like Richmond and Columbus, as we continue to grow, it's going to give us better opportunity to compete on some of those products. And that's in addition \u2013 and it's a little bit of an open question overall because, for us, we know that we still need to do more on our loyalty program. And we've been talking about knowing that we're underperforming there and knowing that when we started the program a while ago it was disruptive and new. And, quite frankly, now it's not reflective of our overall model. And we need to make changes to that. That's coming later this year and it'll probably be more of a benefit \u2013 not probably, it'll be more of a benefit for 2020 than it is for 2019. And I think we're going to have a pretty competitive product from our perspective from a leisure product perspective. There's a lot of people out there who fly one or two or three times a year and we want to make sure that they're thinking of us when they think about who they select for an affinity card and thinking about us from creating a program that matches up with our model. So we'll have details on that later this year. So we are thinking about that. And it is something that we know, moving forward, is a place that we do need to compete a little better on than we are today. So I think it's hard to say whether we won't be able to participate on our own kind of level on that in the future as well. It's hard to say that right now.\nJames Baker: Okay. Yes, that's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on the April 11 fare increase. That's whatever 5,000 or 6,000 fares. Your comments earlier made it sound like a portion of that did not stick. I guess I didn't see those fares roll back or was your point that some of the higher fares were sort of competed away or something. I'm just a bit confused on the mechanics there.\nEdward Christie: Yes, sure. Certainly, Jamie. So there was a lot of fares that were, quite frankly, on the lower end that we were not able to hold some of the increase on. But the mid-level and higher end stuck.\nJames Baker: Okay. All right. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much everybody. Take care.\nEdward Christie: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.\nDaniel McKenzie: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. One housecleaning here. Wanted to make sure I heard correctly on the lost revenue that you're building in from the runway construction challenge. Was it 150 bps from RASM that's from misplaced planes? Or is there some book away that we're going to need to think about as well? So have you baked in something on bad ops making headline news that could cause some book away?\nEdward Christie: No, Dan. I think there is some confusion. We did not mention any revenue impact associated with runway construction in the summer. We only referenced some cost that the Company plans to incur as a risk management tool to prepare ourselves for that, which \u2013 as a 100 basis point CASMx impact in the second quarter and a 50 basis point impact on the full year. That's all we talked about. There was a mention of a 50 basis point impact to unit revenue, we expect, in the second quarter as a result of the storm. So basically, we lost high RASM ASMs over the Easter period and that probably impacted our view of the second quarter.\nDaniel McKenzie: I guess I'm just wondering if you've maybe factored in some book away here. Doesn't sound like maybe you did or do we need to or how should we think about that?\nMatthew Klein: Yes. Dan, so it is not necessarily book away that's going to occur. A couple of things we did in Fort Lauderdale to help with the operation as we worked with the airport on an operational plan as we did move some flights around a little bit. So we have some flights now that aren't perfectly timed, the way that we would have otherwise liked them to be timed, and that's really to help the overall airport operation. And that's contemplated in our second quarter revenue guide.\nDaniel McKenzie: Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then second question here, leave it to me to kick a dead horse. I hear you loud and clear on growth that adds to RASM growth is working. And of course dynamic growth based on the opportunities. But if I can just push back a bit here, if you accept that Spirit's cost advantage is sustainable, what's the rush? So given where we are today, given end of the cycle worries, given investor worry about off-peak pricing weakness persisting, how do you think about growth at 2x to 3x GDP versus 5x GDP or higher? Would slower growth reduce potential revenue and cost volatility?\nEdward Christie: Hey, Dan. It's Ted. Yes, so I understand the question. It's hard \u2013 all of those numbers and I don't mean this the wrong way, but they are arbitrary looks at what a targeted growth rate should be, right? You're just picking something that doesn't \u2013 what we do is we look at the actual opportunities that exist and then try to round out a growth opportunity around that. So there has been actually a decent amount of thought put into the amount of growth that we're deploying right now and plan to deploy over the next three to five years. I wouldn't characterize it as being in a rush either. I think it's imminently deployable, I think we've figured out the ways to move through from an infrastructure perspective. So I understand the pushback and we hear you on it. But I think that the growth opportunity that we see is so large that a rush would be a number that's considerably bigger than what we do today. So I think this is a much more thoughtful and methodical growth strategy than you might otherwise do if you were staring at a massive opportunity like this.\nDaniel McKenzie: Got it. Understood, okay. Thanks for that, Ted.\nDeAnne Gabel: Hey, Christine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in DeAnne. Ted, you talked about kind of the opportunity with the loyalty program and the card. Some of peers \u2013 your friend at United has kind of quantified what he thinks their opportunity is. Air Canada has done the same thing. So can you just help us with what you think the potential improvement in revenue or margins could be once you get kind of a market rate program and economics? It's tough to kind of to do that math, just given your size and your customer demographics. Thank you.\nEdward Christie: Yes. I can appreciate that, Joe, and we'll probably \u2013 we're not prepared right now to give you where we think it will go. Let's break down the primary components though. Today, we've instituted a little bit of a self-help triage program as it relates specifically to work hard with Bank of America. And we've already seen progress in that regard. So we were seeing degradation actually in the revenue performance of the card program into last year and we've now reversed that. And so as it exists today, it's starting to perform more in line at least, which gives us some cause for optimism. The next available opportunity to really change the economics [indiscernible] is that your renewal rate \u2013 your renewal date and that doesn't happen for another three years for us. So what we've got to focus on is \u2013 and I think it's true that we under indexed even within our peer set today, on revenue associated with both the card platform and the loyalty program. I think that's true. And so what Matt just went through a long discussion on is how do we get ourselves back into \u2013 at least in line with where we believe to be. I'm not prepared right now to tell you how big that number is, but we're shooting off of a low base.\nJoseph DeNardi: Is it points of margin, Ted?\nEdward Christie: Absolutely.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then, Matt you mentioned kind of the benefit potentially to 2020 from the loyalty program. Is that just something from, like, a point valuation or accounting standpoint you're changing related to the points that will drive higher revenue or is that an assumption that you revamped the program, it becomes more appealing, you generate stronger loyalty? It seems like one is a little bit more certain than the other. Thank you for the questions.\nMatthew Klein: Yes. So Joe, it is the latter. And you are correct. So we are expecting that the change in the program and the change of how we create that loyalty through the points and formula that we will be putting in place. So we'll drive more usage. And what we're creating is also in an effort \u2013 and we'll reveal this at the right time later this year. But it's also revolving more around our overall model. And we think we're going to be a bit unique as well in what we put out there. So it's something that's not out there in the industry today and we think it's going to create some pretty good awareness. And again, it's sort of what we talked about earlier also, is we do believe there's going to be benefits on the passenger side over time as well, not just from better loyalty of infrequent travelers, but also just entering into the consideration set. Whether someone wants the Spirit credit card or not, the fact that they're going to be hearing about it and understanding that something is new and modern should just overall create more consideration for people that are out there, whether they want the credit card or not.\nOperator: Thank you. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

With that I will turn the call over to Ted. \nTed Christie: Thanks DeAnne, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. 2018 was a year of many accomplishments. We achieved a completion factor of better than 99%, ranked among the best for fewest bags lost, improved our customer service metrics and delivered a record on-time performance of 81.1% testing [ph] most of the other U.S. Carriers for the full year.  We ranked number one in on-time performance in October and based on preliminary results, it looks like we ranked among the top three carriers for November and December. We leveraged self-help initiatives to increase our average fare and average non-ticket revenue per segment and improved our CASM ex-fuel to nearly 4% year-over-year. My thanks and congratulations go out to the entire Spirit team. It is very fulfilling to begin to realize the benefit of our hard work over the past couple years.  Before we begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results, I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge Bob Fornaro for his many contributions to Spirit. In early 2016, following a shift in the competitive landscape, Bob joined the Spirit Management Team knowing that we needed to make some changes to succeed. Bob is a proven leader and was instrumental in helping us improve our operational reliability and our customer service metrics, all while strengthening Spirits position as the airline providing the best value in the sky. Bob retired at the end of 2018 and will remain on our Board. The entire Spirit team thanks Bob for helping us become an even stronger competitor.  Turning now to our fourth quarter 2018 results, yesterday we reported fourth quarter net income of $94.7 million or earnings per diluted share of $1.38. We were exceptionally pleased with the success of our initiatives during the quarter to drive higher passenger and non-ticket revenues. We also had a very strong fourth quarter operationally. Our on-time performance was 85.1% and our completion factor was 99.6%, an excellent quarter all around.  With that, here\u2019s Matt and Scott to discuss our results for the fourth quarter 2018 and our outlook for 2019 in more detail.\nMatt Klein : Thanks Ted. For the fourth quarter 2018 total revenue increased 29.5% year-over-year to $863 million. Total revenue for available seat mile increased 11.4% year-over-year on 16.2% capacity growth.  Our network reorientation, off-peak schedule changes, and ticket and non-ticket yield initiatives, all contributed to our strong fourth quarter revenue performance, additionally throughout the quarter we saw strength in industry pricing which was assisted by tighter inventory controls.  Turning to non-ticket, on a per passenger segment basis non-ticket revenue for the fourth quarter was $56.70, up 5.2% year-over-year, primarily due to our dynamic pricing initiatives and the continued improvement of our bundled services offering.  In addition to our initiatives that are still maturing, we have several new revenue enhancements that we plan to deploy this year. Our new website with improved merchandising capabilities is currently in the final testing stages and we are excited about its potential to drive additional ancillary revenue and increase conversions. We are working on a revamp vacation package program and expect to see the benefits of this new program begin to take hold later this spring.  As you may recall, last October we made some changes to our co-branded credit card offer on board the aircraft. We have seen a nice uptick in the number of applications since the changes were implemented.  Lastly, we are also working on overhauling our loyalty program to be more reflective of the value of our ULCC product provides to leisure customers. We are encouraged with our continued growth in non-ticket revenue per segment and believe that in 2019 we will again see year-over-year improvement. For the full year 2019 we estimate or non-ticket revenue per passenger segment will be between $56 and $57.  Turning to our network, we\u2019ve been very busy with new market launches and new market announcements. During the fourth quarter 2018 we began service to Callie, Columbia and Jacksonville, Florida and we announced we will start service to Austin, Texas on February 14. Next up after Austin will be Indianapolis service that starts next month, followed by Raleigh/Durham where service is slated to commence this May. We are excited to add these new cities to our network, bringing our low fares with customizable travel options to more people in more places.  As for 2019 capacity, our outstanding operational performance in 2018 has given us the confidence that without sacrificing any operational integrity, we can increase our aircraft utilization in the peak periods, which is when we typically capture higher than average unit revenue.  This change, together with some other minor adjustments to our WiFi installation schedule and a more refined view on timing of aircraft deliveries, rose up to a full year 2019 capacity growth of approximately 15% year-over-year. First quarter capacity will be up approximately 16.5% and we estimate capacity in the second, third and fourth quarters will each be up 14% to 16% year-over-year.  Now turning to our revenue outlook: Based on our current booking trends and customer buying behavior for ancillary items, for the first quarter 2019 we estimate TRASM will increase approximately 5% year-over-year. This includes an estimated 250 basis points drag on first quarter 2019, due to the shift of Easter to late April this year.  The demand in volume for both domestic and international remains strong. As you know, during the fourth quarter we launched the largest international expansion in our company's history. While we are pleased with the overall development of our portfolio of new international routes, they are still in their initial [inaudible] period which is a slight drag to our first quarter TRASM, but by the peak summer travel period they should be approaching steady state.  Overall we are very pleased with how well our ticket and non-ticket initiatives are performing along with the overall benefits from our network and schedule changes.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.\nScott Haralson : Thanks Matt and thanks to all of you for joining us today and thanks to our entire team for their contributions to our strong results. Our core cost structure continues to improve and I'm exceptionally pleased that for the full year 2018 our team once again delivered an industry leading cost performance with adjusted CASM ex-fuel decreasing 3.8% year-over-year, despite absorbing material increases related to higher pilot rates in connection with the revised contract ratified in the first quarter of 2018.  Turning to our fourth quarter 2018 results, CASM ex-fuel for the fourth quarter was $5.49, an increase of 5.6% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to higher salaries, wages and benefits per ASM, largely driven by higher pilot rates. This increase was partially offset by lower aircraft rent per ASM. We also realized benefits throughout the business from increased productivity and efficiencies driven by better operational performance.  Regarding fleet, in the fourth quarter we took delivery of seven new aircraft, ending the year with 128 aircrafts in our fleet. Thus far in 2019 we have taken delivery of two aircraft and have 14 additional deliveries scheduled for the remainder of the year. We plan to finance nine deliveries using sale leaseback transaction, five will be under direct operating leases and the remaining two deliveries will be debt financed.  Looking ahead to our 2019 cost guidance, our core cost outlook for 2019 has not changed. However rather than debt financing the majority of deliveries, we now plan to use sale lease back transactions to finance the majority of which of course means higher aircraft rent. The higher aircraft rent will largely be offset by lower depreciation and lower interest expense such that our pretax income is minimally affected by our financing decisions.  Our 2019 network plan has stage length decreasing 1% to 2% year-over-year. Together these changes add about a point of pressure to CASM ex-fuel. Incorporating these changes, we estimate our CASM ex-fuel for the full year of 2019 will be up 1% to 2% year-over-year. When you adjust for the shorter stage and the sale leaseback financing, this is in-line with our previous guide of flat to up 1%.  For the first quarter 2019 CASM ex-fuel is estimated to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year. On a per ASM basis in the first quarter, we will have pressure from higher pilot rates and higher depreciation and amortization. In addition, quarter-to-date we have seen a significant year-over-year increase in deicing expense driven by both rate and volume of deicing event due to the level and intensity of winter storms this year. These increases will partially be offset by lower aircraft rent per ASM.  For the second and third quarters of 2019 we expect CASM ex to be up 1% to 2% year-over-year and the fourth quarter up about 1%.  I'm very comfortable with our set-up for 2019 and how well our team is managing the various cost pressures in the business. Our goal is to get better every day, and while the comps are tough give our exceptional performance in 2018 the team remains focused on holding the line on costs and committed to finding ways to increase efficiency and drive productivity. With that, it\u2019s back to Ted. \nTed Christie : Thanks Scott. We are very excited about our momentum as we head into 2019. We continue to grow our network and are pleased to be adding Austin, Indianapolis and Raleigh/Durham to our list of destinations. Throughout 2019 we will continue to see growth opportunities in large domestic leisure destinations and near field international destinations.  In addition, as the opportunities present themselves to grow in large gate constrain metros, we will do so, as this is where many customers who have otherwise been priced out of the market with high fares live, and where many leisure customers want to go.  We are broadening and diversifying our network, but large cities attract many leisure customers. With our low fares, reliable operations and friendly service, we are the best airline to stimulate and grow the leisure traffic based in these markets.  Even though 2018 was a stellar year on many fronts, record on-time performance, improved operational reliability, record non-ticket revenue per segment, excellent cost performance and improved customer metrics and brand image, we are raising the bar for 2019.  Our top priorities for 2019 are to consistently deliver operational reliability, while increasing fleet utilization, continue to innovate and grow non-ticket revenue per passenger segment, further refine our network to support diversification, maintain our industry leading cost position and grow our relative cost advantage and deliver earnings growth for our shareholders.  These things together with an improving brand image and our low fares solidifies our position as the best value in the sky and provides us the leverage to deliver margin expansion and strong earnings growth in 2019.  With that, back to DeAnne.\nDeAnne Gabel: Thanks Matt, Ted and Scott. We are now ready to take questions from the analyst. We ask that you limit yourself to one question with one related follow-up.  Silvia, we are ready to begin. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Andrew Didora.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning everyone and thank you for the question here. My question is for Ted or Matt. There seems to be a lot of moving parts in 1Q versus 4Q RASM just given the stage length change of Easter shift, peak versus off peak dynamics. Can you maybe give us a sense of where you see the core underlying growth rate today and what types of tailwinds could you see as you move into more peak travel periods in 2Q? \nMatt Klein: Yes, sure Andrew. This is Matt. Good morning and thanks for the question. So one thing that we want to talk about is how we think about off-peak and peak periods and as we move from sort of the peaks that we saw over the holidays in Q4 into Q1 and then back into Q2, what we are finding generally and this has been something that we\u2019ve been talking about now for probably six months or more, is that the off-peaks continue to be what they are. They are off-peak periods; we continue to change our network to address that. A little more seasonality put into the network and as we\u2019ve talked about before, trimming some of the off-peak flying in some of the more weaker periods of the year.  And in the fourth quarter there was certainly a lot more of what we would call off-peak periods than we are seeing in the first quarter and in the second quarter we move out of that off-peak period into Easter and then a little bit of shoulder in May and then the summer peak really kicks in, Memorial Day weekend and then into June. So generally speaking, what we're seeing is a pretty good inventory control out there that allows us to also have pretty good inventory control around the peak periods and one other nuance that we want to talk about a little bit is that when you get into the peak periods, and every peak period is still a little bit different, they are not all the same. But peak periods also allow us to do a little bit more with our non-ticket yields, especially when it comes to our bundled services offering.  So the bundle services offering definitely kicks in a lot more when families are traveling together and they want to sit together on the aircraft, they are checking bags and the bundle offering that we put together for them also gives them then a couple of additional items that really seem to be have a pretty good up-tick around peak periods. So that\u2019s something that I think is important for us to understand.  And then additionally as we move from Q1 specifically into Q2, year-over-year our stage comes in from Q1 to Q2. So in Q1 we actually have a little bit of a stage expansion, but in Q2 the stage really starts to come in a little bit. That will help unit revenue in Q2 as well. Of course overall revenue performance is what really drives the unit revenue production, but stage definitely will have a positive benefit to TRASM in the second quarter. \nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you and just quickly as a follow-up Matt, did I hear you correctly in your prepared remarks that you think non-ticket could be up about 3% in this year to about \u2013 I think you said $56, $57 per trip, is that right?\nMatt Klein: Yes, so we expect to land \u2013 by the end of the year for the full year we expect to land between $56 and $57 for non-ticket. \nAndrew Didora: Okay, thank you. \nMatt Klein: You're welcome. \nOperator: Our following question comes from Jack Atkins. \nJack Atkins : Good morning. Thank you for the time.\nMatt Klein: Good morning Jack.\nJack Atkins : Matt, just going back to that last question there on non-ticket, you know the fall of 2%, 3% in non-ticket, you know given the multiple initiatives that you guys are targeting for this year, plus the maturation of your rent reactions in 2018, you know I guess why wouldn\u2019t that number be a little bit higher on a full year basis as you think about 2019, you know not-ticket per flight segment?\nMatt Klein: Yeah, thanks Jack. So a lot of the things that we started to put in place really a year ago and a lot of the initiatives that we are talking about require testing and learning and then the experience around revenue management. And we really, we've been talking about this for a while now, but a lot of the initiatives take time and it just takes time. You can't just implement new revenue management strategy and expect it to work overnight, especially for something for us that's new which is revenue managing ancillary products and services.  So we really saw \u2013 we thought the ramp up would take longer and it's a testament to our team, it\u2019s a testament to our IT group working with our revenue management group, putting new reports in place, putting new systems in place and we've really been able to ramp that faster and we saw a lot of that hit third quarter into fourth quarter.  So a lot of that we think we captured in third quarter and fourth quarter. And now yes, we are going to continue to improve, continue to make that better, but a lot of the big punch we think we captured late last year, so we'll just continue to improve on it. But now it's just the big step-up we think we may have taken on a couple of the products. \nJack Atkins : Okay got you, that makes sense. And then just following-up Matt for you on the international side, you talked about sort of the spool up of the international routes that you had in, you know in the fourth quarter. Could you just talk about you know what you're seeing in terms of uptake for those routes and how do you expect the revenue performance there to trend as we sort of get out of the first quarter into more of the peak travel periods later on this year. \nMatt Klein: Yes, sure. So our \u2013 the makeup of our network is changed quite a bit. So we were \u2013 I think on a year-over-year basis we are going from around 10% of our system capacity being in what we call international, which is really Caribbean, Latin America and from 10% to around 15%, 16% as we go through Q1 and Q2. So it\u2019s a much larger part of our network.  And a big benefit to these routes, once we get to steady state for them, it\u2019s not only again \u2013 we talked about our abilities to sell to what we call VFR traffic, visiting friends and relatives traffic and a lot of the routes that we've added are unique routes like that, that we service very well. Our model works very, very well for travelers of that segment. And as we get through Q1 into Q2, normally we like to think about routes taking maybe up to a year to really hit full maturation. However we started these routs on purpose in the fourth quarter so that by the time we got to the Easter period and then into late spring early summer, they'd have a lot of time under their belt.  Really a lot of these routes will have about six months of service before we hit peak Easter period, and we really think that that's going to help allow us to step up the results on those, maybe sooner than that full year would otherwise be the norm. And it\u2019s mostly about timing of when the routes came into the market. So we are very excited about what we are seeing now and a lot of these routes because they have a heavy, again what we call VFR traffic, means a lot of the guests are carrying bags and in some cases multiple bags. And again, this adds to our profile of our success in our international routes and something that we can take advantage of quite well. \nJack Atkins : Okay, great. Thank you again. \nMatt Klein: Absolutely. \nOperator: Our following question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth. \nDuane Pfennigwerth : Hey thanks, good morning. I wonder if you could just replay the fourth quarter a bit and the significant upward revision in your guidance. What was the biggest driver of that? Was it the behavior in the peaks and just that you know pricing was really, really firm? \nTed Christie: Yeah, so what we saw happen throughout fourth quarter is a lot of our network changes really, really works incredibly well, especially the calling of the Tuesday and Wednesday flying and what that allowed us to do was really take a different look as to the overall pricing that we needed to put in the market place in order to stimulate traffic.  So by pulling a lot of those Tuesdays \u2013 and I believe we had maybe nine or so weeks of the fourth quarter where we were able to pull out a lot of that Tuesday and Wednesday flying that in the past hasn't been real accretive to earnings or to TRASM.  So in addition to that, a lot of the things that we did pull were some of the long haul flying and I guess it\u2019s a bit of a testament to some of the issues we were having on some of that flying that we were able to pull some of that out and really look at the Tuesday, Wednesday flying and really be able to see a better uptick from a pricing strength perspective. We didn\u2019t need to go out there with fares as low in order to help fill Tuesdays and Wednesdays, therefore our shelf strategy, as we like to call it, for the whole week improved.  And so that really gave us a nice upper left. More than we expected obviously from our results based on our original guide. And we have some of that going on in the first quarter as well. We have that from about mid-January through mid-February. We did some of that pull down as well but it's just not as aggressive as we saw out there for the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s really kind of what helped push up fourth quarter.  In addition to that, we did have a strong industry environment for sure and that can't be left out of the conversation. Things were pretty healthy out there and they are good now too. It\u2019s not that they are not good now, they are. Just what we were seeing in the fourth quarter was an abundance of inventory control and as we move through February now and we have a line of sight into March, we are pretty happy with what we are seeing out there today.\nScott Haralson : Duane the only thing I\u2019d added to that is and Matt talked about it in one of his other questions was you know the success we are having with non-ticket initiatives really kind of you know accelerated through the end of the year and I think that was also a positive surprises as we headed into the fourth quarter, which again contributed to TRASM very productively. So that sets you up nicely as we head into the first and second quarters of this year to really capture a lot of that momentum going into that period too. \nDuane Pfennigwerth : Thanks for those comments and a follow-up maybe for Scott or Ted. Can you just expand a little bit on what you are seeing in the leasing market, lease rates, etcetera. You know why would the decision to tilt back to leasing, what is it that's really driving that, what has changed in that market? Thank you. \nScott Haralson: Hey Duane, this is Scott. Hey, we entered 2018 with 64% of our fleet owned, which a quarter of that was owned out right. So we feel like now we can look at financing from a balanced approach and really be opportunistic. I mean the leasing market has closed the gap to the debt side, WTC and bank side, so we feel like we can take advantage of that today. I like the idea of being able to look at the different funding sources and just sort of move where the economics are most favorable and that's sort of what we are doing here. \nDuane Pfennigwerth : Okay, thank you. \nOperator: The following question comes from Joe Caiado.\nJoe Caiado: Hey, good morning, thanks very much. Matt, first question for you on RASM and on some of these new revenue enhancements that you mentioned, you know have the new website, the new app and all kind of the related functionality that comes with that. How should we think about the ramp-up to a run rate revenue contribution from those things? Just trying to calibrate how much of that is driving the $56 to $57 non-ticket target for this year, or if it's because of the learning that's involved if this is a little bit more of longer term contributor? \nMatt Klein : That's right. Actually, that is correct. So just like all of our other initiatives, as we get new functionality, we have to learn the best way to use it and we have really great people here with experience that know how to use these kinds of technologies and merchandising capabilities in general. But once we get the new functionality in place, then we\u2019ll learn how best to apply those thoughts and processes to our product and to what we are seeing from our customer base. So it is something that we expect to have a benefit this year for sure, but it's going to be more of a longer term benefit, which actually works out pretty well from my perspective, because as we continue to get better at revenue management of our existing services, that will help us as we then will be able to test and learn on some of the new functionality coming in, that will then be able to monetize as this year progresses, but really by the end of this year and into early and into early next year is when we should start to see a real benefit from that, not unlike a lot of our other initiatives that took about a year to kick in and then when they kicked in, they kicked in really well. So we are expecting to follow a similar trend. \nJoe Caiado: And that's helpful thanks. And then just a bigger picture fleet and cabin question for Ted and Scott. So operating a single fleet type has been an important driver of your low cost structure. You\u2019ve got an RFP out there and you are evaluating a new aircraft order to kind of support your growth plans beyond kind of 2021. I think you said you expect to make a decision this year. Without asking you to get into specifics on that, I just love to get your bigger picture thoughts on the importance of that strategy and kind of the core LCC tentative of operating a single fleet type to keep costs low, as you think about Spirit\u2019s future and kind of retaining your cost advantage into the future? Thanks. \nTed Christie : Hey Joe, it's Ted. I\u2019ll make few comments and let Scott add in too. You know I think you hit all the points. What\u2019s core to us is low cost structure, efficiency utilization, all of those things. Clearly in historical perspective, while it would be natural to assume that a single fleet type is the most efficient use of aircraft, there are examples in our history where that\u2019s not true.  We are very, very low cost carriers like AirTrend for example operated multiple fleet types and did sell at the lowest cost in the business and what you really have to solve for is the mix between operating costs and upfront expense on the airplane. And so it\u2019s in our best interest to drive the best deal and we want to make sure we are ticking all the boxes. So we are happy with our customer today, but we got to evaluate all the options available to us. Scott, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything more. \nScott Haralson : No, that\u2019s exactly right, and even just from a status update for you Joe, I mean we are in the early stages of the RFP today. We have gotten the first responses back. We are evaluating those as we speak, but we are on path for the timeline that we set out to sort of mid-2019 you know end result. \nJoe Caiado: I appreciate that. Thanks very much. \nOperator: Our following question comes from Hunter Keay.\nHunter Keay: Hi, good morning. \nTed Christie : Good morning.\nHunter Keay: Ted you mentioned, you know you\u2019ll be looking at adding services on the large metros, gate constrain specifically that you mentioned. How do you do that, how do you get into some of these gate constrained airports and when you do, how has your thinking maybe evolved over the last few years about how you market service, both to and from those major metros?\nTed Christie: Sure, you know it's a game of patience to be honest Hunter. We have for the better part of a decade been you know evolving the network and I think it's kind of the hidden story around Spirit, is the network development over the better part of a decade showing where we deployed the choices we've made and in doing so we've been extremely vocal about and patient with our decisions around where it is we've grown.  In fact over the last two years, the vast majority of our growth has been in Orlando and Vegas, because they are very, very good leisure destinations. They've been extremely accretive to us, but at the same time when available we've been able to grow in Los Angeles and in Chicago and in Houston and Dallas and New York and a lot of large metropolitan areas to, because that's where people live and it is also where people want to go?  So I think it\u2019s a balanced approach always and remember that we\u2019re \u2013 when we go into a market from a marketing perspective, the primary marketing value is our low fares and we stimulate additional traffic to the market, and that's a proven data supported claim that the market gets bigger when we go into the market.  So we are clearly interested in bringing back customers who have been priced out with low fares. From a targeted marketing perspective we use very efficient low cost type methods to attract our new customers and turn them into guests, and that doesn't really vary that much to be honest depending on the size of the metropolitan area. But I guess that that's the key theme, is we put our name out there and we got to be patient and we grow. We think there is tremendous opportunity in all three pillars of our network, which is you know big origin cities, large leisure destinations in the international. I think we are picking those off in the order we like. \nHunter Keay: Got it, thanks. And then as you think about adding some utilization carefully as you mentioned and adding back some peak capacity, are these flights that you are kind of adding back in, in airports that you cut back because they were operationally challenged because of you know just air space or congestion or was it more scaling back some of that peak stuff because of competitive factors or inability to price. I'm trying to think about that in the context of what you are going to be adding back going forward? You got the question. \nTed Christie : Yeah I mean, I'll give you my thoughts. Matt you can obviously add as well. You know when we are looking at where we think we can and to your point, carefully add additional utilization to the peak and we've been talking about that for the better part of the year, we think it's one of the opportunities we have as the operation has improved and we've gotten our legs underneath us, which clearly we have at this point.  We think we can exploit more RASM accretive flying in to peak periods, and I think it's going to very. I think you are going to see it in \u2013 clearly in some times of year in the peak it will be in Florida, because Florida is the peak and that's happening right about now as we head into spring break in into the Easter holiday, and then as the network kind of moves to more East West into the summer, there's more opportunities in certain other metropolitan areas. So I don't know that it\u2019s specifically to answer your questions tied to whether or not we are trying to trim for operational integrity or competitive action. I think we are just now looking at opportunities as they sit and picking off the ones that probably meet the best you know, the best thresholds depending on the season. So Matt, you want to\u2026\nMatt Klein: Yeah, that\u2019s right. And one note Hunter about that is with our change in our WiFi insulation schedule, we had a bit of a delay due to the government shut down. So with a couple of certifications we had to get put in place.  So we definitely also had a couple of late ads that normally you wouldn't see something like that from us, as late as they were loaded. But that\u2019s a bit of why some of those ads came in later. And in that case as Ted mentioned, we are looking for the routes that we believe we can drive a lot of demand late and get it in an extremely unit revenue and P&L positive way. So a lot of it has been really maybe adding a second trip on top of the really good market. It\u2019s not necessarily putting anything back in where we thought there is issues in the past. We are looking for where we see strength or take some chances on the thought that some demand will come in pretty late at yields that we think are earnings accretive. \nHunter Keay: Okay, thank. \nMatt Klein: Absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker.\nHelane Becker: Thanks operator. Hi team, thanks for the time. I'm still not sure who wants to answer this, maybe Matt. Have you noticed a change in international bookings and demand from international passengers or is your focus more U.S. origination? \nMatt Klein: So our focus was \u2013 so Helane, great question, because it's going to depend on the route. There are certainly going to be routes that we add that we believe are going to be heavily leisure based when you think about when we fly to Cancun and most of that traffic originates in the U.S. and the way that we promote and market that service is going to be different than perhaps someone you know in Fort Lauderdale who's going to Honduras or vice versa and we've set up a pretty, I would say unique distribution network in a few key Latin American countries for us where we can do business there and it supports our model and it supports the way that we distribute there as well. So we have some pretty tight relationships in place.  That really helped customers on both sides of the journey. So I don\u2019t know if that answers your question perfectly, but that's the way that we think about distribution and how we go after that kind of traffic, which we believe again is a little bit unique for us in the way that we think about how we carry guests, especially in this VFR kind of market. \nHelane Becker: Okay, no that's actually very helpful. And the other question I had is sort of unrelated Scott and maybe you\u2019ll answer this. As we think about the go forward for financing aircraft, should we just think like 50-50 you know forever or 50-50 for four years, you know that kind of thing, or will it just be more dependent on existing market conditions. \nScott Haralson : Yeah, hey Helane. I think the latter is probably right. Look, I mean I think we feel good about our capital structure today and we think we can be opportunistic, so we can play on either side and it will sort of be where the economics blow. \nHelane Becker: Great, thank you. Alright, thanks. Well, thanks for your help. \nOperator: Our following question comes from Savi Syth\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. \nTed Christie: Good morning Savi. \nSavi Syth: Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about you know the 1Q and the 2Q dynamic here from a unit revenue standpoint. Just kind of curious, on 1Q you know just if you can kind of talk about some of the drivers that are you know causing it to be up at 5% year-over-year and your confidence given that you know it's much more heavily weighted to March and kind of your confidence level around that.  And then also, just a little digging, a little bit more into your 2Q comment rate, is that \u2013 I mean is it fair to assume that we should see an acceleration from 1Q to 2Q and what can that magnitude be? \nMatt Klein: Yes Savi, so I think in terms of what we are seeing for first quarter in general, we're still definitely lapping in industry environment. That was a tougher environment in 2018, so in 2019 this quarter we\u2019re lapping some of that tough environment last year. It\u2019s a little bit better environment this year, so that's a piece of why we have confidence in the number.  We also in January specifically just to give you some color about January, is the New Year's holiday and the return from New Year's was very strong, not unlike what we saw for Thanksgiving and Christmas, which we've already talked about in the past.  But what we saw in New Year's also carried through and in addition to that, this is going to be very nuance, but the placement of Martin Luther King Junior holiday this year was actually on the calendar. It's always the third Monday in January, but it was pushed to the latest they could possibly be this year and that gave some nice separation between the New Year's return and that holiday weekend.  Now granted we had some weather and some other things going on that weekend, but it created a nice separation and it allowed some people, at least from our results anyway, some people to be able to take multiple trips.  And then heading into President\u2019s weekend which is coming up soon, we're really pleased with how we set up our inventory control for that weekend and it looks like it's going to be paying off much like it did in the peak holiday periods in the fourth quarter.  So we're just trying to take a really pragmatic approach to how we think about yield management in general, that the off peak periods are still off peak and they will likely always be off peak. And the peak periods, I think we're just getting better and smarter as time goes by and the process and the people that we put in place are just getting better and that just happens with time and experience.  Revenue management in general is not something that just flips on and off. It takes time to learn and for us we came from a position a few years ago where we always just wanted to have the lowest fare in the market all the time, period. Now we can be a lot smarter and recognize that things like time of day matter and things like outbound and return matter and how we think about different periods.  Not all Florida is created the same, even though it's all in Florida, different cities in Florida act different ways and as Florida becomes a bigger piece of our network, we are able to harness that and think about yield management better. So that's how we think about Q1.  In terms of Q2, I don't think we're ready to talk about Q2, specifically other than the Easter shift. What we have mentioned already right is the Easter shift is definitely going to push revenue into April and international, especially a lot of our international expansion being a larger part of our network should also peak up Easter for us more, meaning that there's even \u2013 there should be an even bigger push around Easter for us, just because the network is a little different this year than last year. \nSavi Syth: That\u2019s helpful and if I might just on the fuel efficiency side, you do see kind of that your guiding to a decline in fuel efficiency. Is that completely the results of the kind of decline in face length or how should we think about it? \nScott Haralson : Yeah, hey Savi, this is Scott, hey. Yeah, we do expect the ASMS per gallon number to come in a bit, obviously due to stage, but also due to the price of fuel. So the way our routing optimizer works is it takes a number of inputs, including fuel price. So over time we would tend to fly a little faster and it might have a slight drag to the ASMS per gallon number, but it's fairly small. \nSavi Syth: Thank you. \nOperator: Our following question comes from Dan McKenzie. \nDan McKenzie : Oh hey, good morning. Thanks guys. Just a house cleaning question here on the growth for the first quarter; the growth is up 16.5%. What's the growth rate in off peak versus peak capacity, you know since you've talked about that. So if we could just break those two types of flying out, is that you know a 25% growth in peak flying versus you know a 10% in off peak to get to that 60.5. I'm just working if you can provide a little bit more perspective on how you are handling those two aspects of the schedule in the first quarter. \nTed Christie: Hey Dan, its Ted. Yeah, I don't think we would have broken it out exactly that way in advance. I think directionally the way you're thinking about it is correct, that obviously we've crammed Tuesdays and Wednesdays in a lot of the periods post New Year\u2019s, all the way up through quite frankly the President's Day holiday and so that's going to bring down your year-over-year comp in those areas and then it's going to you know raise the percentage artificially in the spring break and the holiday weekends that sit in the quarter. So I don't know what the exact numbers is, but I think directionally the way you are thinking about it is a blend. \nDan McKenzie : Understood, okay. And then you know I had a follow up question on the non-ticket initiatives as well. So man, if we look back say two to three years, you know what has changed the most? What hasn't? And you know maybe if we could take hotels or car rentals for example, are these being dynamic offered you know today versus you know two to three years ago? Is there upside potential in this revenue vertical and I guess I\u2019m just wondering if you can provide you know some more transparency about you know how you are thinking about the opportunity in the non-ticket part of the revenue structure. \nTed Christie: Yeah Dan, so our \u2013 what we call vacation packaging, which is really the adding of hotels and/or cars to the itinerary has definitely been performing below what we would want to see. We are making some changes there from a technology perspective, as well as from a content provider perspective and we expect to see some benefit from there, but it's going to come in stages.  First piece is getting new technology and new content in place and then the second stage is starting to then be able to merchandise better and starting to get more thoughts and this is something that will take time as well, to get more thoughts around when different customers are shopping for different kinds of destinations, how do we offer up the proper offer at the right time to the right customer. So that's a piece on the vacation packaging.  We've also talked in the past. I can just add in now also about our loyalty program and about our co-branded credit card program, where we\u2019re also under performing on a rate basis where we were in the past. And what I mean by rate basis, it's not necessarily from an economics perspective that we have with our partner Bank of America. It's more about our program quite frankly has become a little bit dated and it's not reflective of the ULCC model and the value that we provide and how we provide it.  So later this year we're going to be putting changes in place for our loyalty program and that's something that we believe will have a positive benefit. We do know that we have leisure customers who want a better loyalty program from us and it'll take into account more things that are part of who we are, part of our ancillary model and part of our low fare model.  So those are pieces that have opportunity for us in the future. I'm not sure if I totally covered what you are looking for in that question, but I think that\u2019s some color there. \nDan McKenzie : Yeah, well that's helpful. So you know the timing for the new technology on the vacation side and then I guess I'm just you know assuming that the $56, $57 non-fair you know sort of guide that you've laid out there for the full year probably doesn't factor in the upside from some of these developments, if you know maybe we could add some additional perspective there. \nTed Christie: Well, if we have upside on that, it's going to come from delivery happening sooner than we expect and based on the prioritization of how we\u2019re putting things together, I'm pretty comfortable with when we think the programs are going to launch and then taking into account some of the learning that has to happen and take place. So like I said earlier in one of your other questions, I believe we are going to see results from it this year, but it's going to be just like other non-take initiatives. They take 12, 15, 18 months to really hit steady state, because it just takes time to learn how to use the new technology. \nDan McKenzie : Understood. Thanks for the time. \nTed Christie: Absolutely. \nOperator: Our following question comes from Michael Linenberg. \nMichael Linenberg : Yeah hey, good morning, everyone. Hey Matt, a question to you as it relates to route selection since it's been you know real integral to I think you\u2019re out performance over the last year. If I take a market like Raleigh to New Orleans, which I know you are going to start in May, you know it looks like Allegiant\u2019s going to be on that market, Frontier is going to be in that market and that\u2019s a southwest market. I think Delta\u2019s going to add service and when I think about you know how Spirit differentiate yourself, it does look like you are going to start with a superior schedule you'll be daily. You clearly have improved your ops.  Is that \u2013 you know as we think about you know a number of players moving into a particular city pair is \u2013 you know is that how we think about you know sort of longer term you\u2019re staying power, you know because of the superior schedule, the ops, maybe a better product you know as you talked about improve loyalty and even improvement on the credit card, etcetera. \nTed Christie: Yes. So Mike, yes that\u2019s correct. We definitely come in the markets and when we do route selection, we are looking for places that we think are overpriced and underserved and sometimes that includes markets that have a lot of players in them already and we believe that the items you mentioned is what we bring.  We are amongst the best in on time performance, that matters to the customers and in addition to that, one thing that Ted talked about in his remarks and one thing that I can add on to a little bit, is that in some cases there's also going to be real estate or gate situations in certain airports that basically say to us, \u2018Make a decision Spirit. What are you going to do? How are you thinking about your network opportunities? And when are you going to go grab them?\u2019  So in some cases we will advance ads if we think that's the right thing for us to do, because of the city that we want to be in and it's a place that if we don't move soon, then we might not be able to go back in there for a couple years. So in some cases you are going to also see that from some of our route selection, but by and large we are not going to do that if we don't think it's a good opportunity at the right time for us anyway, so that's kind of how we think about route selection.  And then just going back to what we do with our international expansion out of Orlando, there's a number of routes in there that no one else serves. So it\u2019s not that we are looking to go into routs where others already exists or a market is there. We will definitely look for places that we think is best for us to bring our low fares and our high quality service to that market. \nMichael Linenberg : Okay great, and then just as a related follow-up, how do you think about you know maybe your penetration into you know going after price sensitive business passengers? Is that something that you track and the reason I also throw this out there is, when I look at like Raleigh and some of the other markets that you've been adding service recently.  You know Raleigh, Baltimore for example, you're going in initially with double daily service and what looks like a very competitive pattern on both ends that would be attractive to at least a price sensitive business passenger. And again, I know you've stayed away from that segment for some time. So one \u2013 are you looking at that, and two, can you maybe even give us a rough feel for what percent of your passengers today that you at least believe may be traveling on some sort of business, maybe mixing business and pleasure, thoughts on that? Thank you. \nTed Christie : Hey Mike, its Ted. You know as you know we are a leisure airline, we focus on that and so there is no really concrete way for us to measure the question that you are asking. We do expect that there are people who are traveling on us for business. Usually they are people who are paying for their own ticket. So it\u2019s going to be small business, it\u2019s going to be sole proprietorships, that sort of thing, and then maybe mixing that trip with a leisure weekend or something to that effect.  But the vast majority of the traffic we carry is going to be stimulated, and that's true across the board, so however you want to label it. We're trying to build a network and I think it's been and again I said in a previous answer, you can now look at the where the company flies and see an actual network. And I think the idea there is we are targeting those types of customers that have been priced out in a variety of different origin and destinations. So your example is one, where we think that there's just under service there at our price point and we are going to go in and be able to carry that traffic. \nMichael Linenberg : Great, thanks Ted, thanks Matt. \nOperator: Our following question comes from Brandon Oglenski.\nMatt Wisniewski: Hi, this is actually Matt Wisniewski for Brandon, thanks for taking my question. You know I was hoping we come back to the network improvements and kind of expand on that a little bit more. You know first should we be thinking about this as an structural improvement, kind of would this be to assume that you\u2019re holding all of this constant, but this should be realized going forward next year. And then second, is there opportunity for material improvements going forward, kind of what you saw towards the end of last year. \nTed Christie : Yeah, this is Ted. So I think some of the network improvement you are alluding to is that we made a couple of adjustments. We looked at some longer haul flying and decided to redeploy towards the latter half of last year into slightly shorter stage, more core Florida for example and then we also made some network moves around peak and off-peak flying that reallocated aircraft into better places to be honest with you. So they moved better gauge into different places, but also trim capacity in the off-peak which moves demand into the peak periods. And as Matt alluded to and talked about in his comments, that continues as we head into the first quarter. Now our objective and the network team\u2019s objective is to continue to optimize within that band. So you will see us continue to do things like that, depending on the season, depending on the competitive behavior, depending on a variety of different things. And so I think that that we're just sharper about that today, plus we have a much broader reach than we ever did and I think that gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility with regard to what we do depending on the season. \nMatt Wisniewski: Okay great, that's all for me. Thank you. \nOperator: Our following question comes from Joseph DeNardi.\nJoseph DeNardi : Yeah, good morning. Ted in your slide deck, you refer to your cost advantage as Spirit\u2019s most valuable asset. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve ever given any thought to quantifying what the asset is worth. I mean the cost advantage as grown pretty substantially over the past few years, but stock price and your multiple obviously not moved to tandem. So the market is not really seeing it as an asset. Maybe it would help if you could quantify it a little bit. Have you ever given it any thought?\nTed Christie: That\u2019s an interesting question and a very obscure -- you know what I mean, like a concept to be honest. I don't know how it would explore and Scott can think about it too or jump in here buddy. But you are right, Joe. I mean we are extremely protective about that cost structure because it is an important part of who we are and going forward one thing will always remain true, is that's going to be core to whose Spirit is, is maintaining and widening that advantage.  Because it is core to the fair strategy, its core to the non-ticket strategy, its core to the network strategy and so how we quantify that, not sure, other than you can look at two different cost structure and try to figure out what that means to us from a dollars perspective. But it is definitely the one thing that we are extremely productive about, and I think you know Scott make his comments in his prepared remarks that we are extremely pleased with the performance the company had last year.  We are very, very excited about what we have going forward. Timing over a calendar period you know is to us interesting, but it's not what's most important. As we look at the trends of the cost structure, we look at the advantage that we have and watch it widen, that's what's most important. \nScott Haralson : Yeah, we agree with that. Hey Joe, this is Scott. So just one further comment is obviously we are very protective of the unit cost advantage we have and I think it's a little bit unfair to say that the valuation has moved, which means they don't think the unit cost of the value. I think there's a lot of other variables that have come into play there. I think the unit cost is an extremely valuable component to our, not only our company, but our investment thesis. So I think that maybe a little unfair to say that. \nJoseph DeNardi : Yeah, no I think I agree with you. But just on the loyalty program Ted and Matt, it feels like you are kind of indicating that maybe it\u2019s gotten overlooked a little bit, given some higher priorities elsewhere. How many people currently work on the program? Like what\u2019s the size of that staff?\nMatt Klein: So Joe, we -- I don't think I\u2019m going to actually answer that question directly. I would just tell you that it's something that a number of us, including myself pay attention to, and we talk about frequently and we are in the midst of finalizing what our new program is going to look like. And we\u2019ve done a lot of work on understanding lifetime value of leisure customers and we've done a lot of work behind it and we've been talking about it for a while and the only reason why we haven't rolled something out yet, is because want to make sure that we get it right.  You don\u2019t get many chances to change your loyalty program and we want to make sure that we roll it out correctly, that we are putting the right program together and I'm really excited about the opportunity that we have there to make it more reflective of a program that our leisure customers are looking for?\nTed Christie: Yeah, I would add that you know the precursor to all of this, to guest improvement, to customer service metrics, this all started with us running about a better airline and we needed to know that we were going to do that consistently and regularly. And to Matt\u2019s point, we want to make sure that we \u2013 when we talk to our guests about how they're getting value from us, we can back it up and I think that was the first step and something that now we've proven. And so now we've we can really let the guest focus people really, you know turn loose to focus on what is going to be best for a Spirit customer. \nJoseph DeNardi : Thank you. \nDeAnne Gabel: Are there any more questions in the queue? \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani.\nRajeev Lalwani : Hi, good morning. \nTed Christie: Hi Rajeev. \nRajeev Lalwani : Actually I wanted to come back to the CASM discussion. I'm not sure this is for Ted or Scott, but can you just talk about general trends that you are seeing on unit cots. I think the foresee numbers maybe came in a bit live. I guess the geography moves around 2019. But there's just been a lot of data points out there about just lots of pressure is on cost and maybe relating to that anything that think about as far as labors concern, now that pilots are behind us as far as other groups or types of employees that may need step-ups. \nScott Haralson : Hey Rajeev, this is Scott. Hey as we mentioned in the update in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve adjusted financing mix for \u201919, we\u2019ve lowered stage. So look in reality, looking at the calendar view year-over-year does create some awkwardness.  We have some timing of the pilot contract, timing of the A319 purchase in 2018 and even maintenance of its timing. In fact if you had signed the pilot contract in 2018, January 1, we would be down unit cost in Q1 and it would have a material impact to the full year and probably wouldn't even be talking about unit cost at this. So the timing does make it a bit awkward.  So we feel good about where we sit today, we feel good about our growing CASM advantage, and we said earlier we are very protective of the unit cost advantage and always looking for ways to widen that gap versus the industry. \nRajeev Lalwani : Matt, a quick one for you. Are you seeing any signs of lower fuel making its way to the revenue environment, whether its pricing behavior or capacity. Any data points and that\u2019s a couple of years ago is one of the first to see some of the pressures that we\u2019ve noted back in \u201915, \u201916 or so. \nMatt Klein: Rajeev, no, we are not really seeing evidence of that. The only thing that I would mention is that off-peak periods are still off peak and that really hasn't changed much and that's when fuel was elevated last year and that's when fuel came down in the fourth quarter and where we are now. It\u2019s sort of where the off-peaks are the off-peaks and we are feeling pretty good about the peak. So I think the answer to your question directly is, no. \nRajeev Lalwani : I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. \nTed Christie: You\u2019re welcome. \nOperator: Our following question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien : Good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. So maybe first as a quick follow up to the question Savi had earlier, it sounds like with the ramp up of your new international service, you are expecting maybe a larger tailwind from Easter versus the 250 basis point headwind you mention for the March quarter. You know is some of that just the timing of the holiday, one of your peers mention they were expecting a larger June Q benefit or is it really just like this international boost that you didn\u2019t have last year that that's driving maybe a larger Easter tailwind? Thanks. \nTed Christie: Yeah, I think generally speaking the tailwind for Q2 when the Easter shifts is going to be about the same as if there's a headwind in Q1 or vice versa depending on how Easter moves around. So when we get into the Easter period, we are going to be able to obviously see a lot more on close and demand and how that's going to materialize.  Is it possible that the tailwind would be greater in Q2? Sure, it\u2019s possible. I don't know that yet and we\u2019ll know that as we get closer to the period itself. I would just tell you the overall we are feeling pretty good about the peaks and just to reiterate, we do believe the international routes are going to be really beneficial to Q2 as we move forward. \nCatherine O\u2019Brien : Okay, great, and then just another one. So Spirit used to talk about getting to 50/50 for the ticket revenue and non-ticket per passenger and in this quarter you are very close. So first, is that still a goal and then second do you think that gap continues to close or do you think at the current demand environment holds your fair revenue per passenger should continue to recover back towards you know close to 2014 levels. Thanks. \nTed Christie: Yeah, sure. So as you mentioned there at the very end, we do know where the ticket fair resided in the past and there's a lot of upside and opportunity to keep pushing our ticket revenue up. We don\u2019t set a goal to say that we should have 50/50 non-ticket and ticket. Sometimes it comes out that way, because of seasonality or what's happening in the industry, but really we are just \u2013 we are out there trying to maximize unit revenue, how we get it and when we get it, and that's what we are always going after. \nCatherine O\u2019Brien : Great, thanks for the time. \nDeAnne Gabel: Silvia, this is DeAnne. I think we are out of time for questions today, but thank you all for joining us and we'll talk to you soon. \nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Scott has over 18 years of industry experience. This experience, together with the knowledge gained from serving as our Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis for the past six years made him an ideal choice to succeed Ted Christie as Chief Financial Officer. \nScott Haralson : Thanks Bob. This is Scott by the way. I'm excited about the new role. We have a great management team and I'm glad to be a part of it. For all of the analysts and shareholders on the call, I look forward to meeting you in the coming months. Thanks again Bob. \nBob Fornaro: So turning to our results, yesterday we reported third quarter 2018 net income of $100.5 million or $1.47 per diluted share. We are very pleased with our third quarter TRASM result of up 5.5% year-over-year, which significantly exceeded our expectations. We are also pleased with our continued strong financial performance. For the third quarter we achieved a completion factor of 99% and a DOT on-time performance of 76.6%. Year-to-date through last Sunday we have a completion factor of 99% and a DOT on-time performance of over 80%, which ranks us number four of 17 reporting carriers for on-time performance. Excellent teamwork all around.  Our revenue trajectory is improving and so is our operational reliability. Together with our continued focus on delivering excellent cost performance, we have a solid platform that positions us to deliver earnings growth in 2019.  With that, I'll turn it over to Matt and Ted to discuss our third quarter in more detail. \nMatt Klein : Thanks Bob. For the third quarter 2018 we reported total revenue of $904 million. Total revenue per available seat mile increased 5.5% year-over-year, materially better than our initial expectation of up 2% to 3%.  We are seeing measurable benefit from the enhancements we've been making to drive passenger yield. On the passenger revenue side we have restructured our pricing and revenue management teams, added resources and have been developing processes and using enhanced data analytics to better optimize passenger yield.  We believe these internal improvements have sustainable future benefit and especially so in strong demand environments when they give us increased leverage to manage yields up as they did in the third quarter 2018. In addition, post Labor Day we cut many underperforming long haul routes.  Over the last two years we have made a lot of network changes and now have 10 key cities with 20 or more daily departures. This, together with improved capabilities of our reservation system has helped to drive more connect itinerary opportunities resulting in higher load factors. These actions, as well as a strong demand environment contributed to our third quarter revenue result.  Turning to non-ticket, on a per passenger segment basis, non-ticket revenue for the third quarter was up $1.86 year-over-year to $54.44, in part due to our dynamic pricing initiatives and our ancillary bundle offering. We remain on track to achieve our goal of $55 in non-ticket revenue per segment by year end. In the coming months, in addition to continued momentum from our current offerings, we expect we will begin to see additional benefit from enhanced merchandising opportunities and recently we and our partner Bank of America made some changes or our co-branded credit card offer onboard the aircraft.  These changes are designed to drive more applications, have higher attachment rates and promote additional use of the card itself. These initiatives, along with others that we plan to implement over the next two to three quarters give us confidence we can continue to drive increases in ancillary revenue per segment.  Turning to our network, since our last earnings call we began service to both Greensboro and Asheville, North Carolina and we've also recently announced Callie, Columbia and Jacksonville, Florida as our newest destinations, which begins service later this quarter.  Also in early October we launched service from Orlando to seven destinations in Latin America and the Caribbean with four more to start in early November. We are very excited to have the opportunity to expand our international footprint.  In addition to being a city with high demographic affinity to Latin America and the Caribbean, our Orlando service is a perfect complement to our existing Fort Lauderdale service as it provides greater schedule utility for our connecting passengers. By year-end our international capacity will account for nearly 15% of our total capacity.  Now, turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter 2018, as we announced last night we expect [indiscernible] capacity to increase about 15% year-over-year. Additionally in terms of our revenue guide, based on our current booking trends and considering how well our internal initiatives benefited us in the third quarter, we estimate TRASM will increase approximately 6% year-over-year.  Before I hand it over to Ted to discuss our cost performance, I want to add that the improvements we\u2019re seeing on both ticket and non-ticket metrics are a direct result of a company-wide effort to improve our revenue performance. We have a lot more work to do, but the results thus far are clearly encouraging.  And with that, I'll turn it over Ted. \nTed Christie : Thanks Matt. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Now turning to our third quarter 2018 performance, network optimization and improve yield management, combined with our teams continued focus to drive ex-fuel costs down produced an operating margin of 16.1% for the third quarter 2018, nearly flat year-over-year despite a significant increase in the cost of fuel and higher pilot rates in connection with our new pilot agreement approved in the first quarter of 2018. I thank all our team members for contributing to the strong performance.  CASM ex-fuel for the third quarter was $0.0522, a decrease of 3.7% year-over-year. Better operational performance was a large driver of this improvement, as well as improved labor productivity and efficiency, which helped to partially offset the impact of higher wage rates. Aircraft rent per ASM was also lower year-over-year.  Regarding fleet, in the third quarter we took delivery of two new A320ceo aircrafts and ended the quarter with 121 aircrafts in the fleet. In the fourth quarter we are scheduled to take delivery of five new A320ceo aircrafts and three A320neo aircrafts. In 2019 we have 15 aircrafts scheduled for delivery and estimate our capacity growth for 2019 will be about 14%. We are evaluating debt financing, as well as sale leaseback options to finance these aircraft; however, for cost guidance purposes, we are assuming we will debt finance them.  On a full year basis we are solidly on track to achieve 2018 CASM ex-fuel of down 3.5% to 4% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter 2018 CASM ex-fuel was estimated to be up 5% to 6% year-over-year. As you may recall, our 4Q CASM ex-fuel last year was down 4.4%, which was partially due to favorable group health expense and timing of supplemental rent. It creates a challenging comparison for this year.  In addition, we have yet to lap the pressure from higher pilot rates in connection with our new pilot deal ratified on March 1 of this year and we have some headwinds related to the timing of heavy maintenance events.  Regarding fuel, based on the trends quarter-to-date and the forward curve, we estimate our average fuel price per gallon in the fourth quarter will be $2.46. At these elevated fuel prices, it is more important than ever to drive continued fuel efficiency. We already have one of the youngest most fuel efficient fleets in the industry and over the next year our fuel efficiency should get even better as we add more new aircraft, most of which are neos that consume between 15% to 20% less fuel.  We are also leveraging technology to help us drive more fuel efficient routings and to optimize cost indexing and aircraft speed. In fact, on a per seat mile basis, we have a 30% advantage against the industry average in fuel burn, which actually helps expand our absolute cost advantage in times of rising oil prices.  Looking forward to 2019 non-fuel costs, we are still in the early stages of our 2019 budget planning process. We were comfortable reiterating our 2019 CASM ex-guide of flat to up 1%.  In closing, we are enthusiastic about both our revenue and cost trajectory as we look ahead to 2019. We are addressing higher fuel prices by adjusting our network and pushing pricing where we can. Our yield management initiatives are just beginning to bear fruit and should drive additional benefits as we further refine processes.  Our non-ticket initiatives remain robust and on target to produce higher non-ticket revenue. Together with our continued cost discipline and improved operational performance, we are optimistic about the potential outcome for earnings growth in 2019.  With that, I'll turn it back to Bob.\nBob Fornaro: Thanks Ted. We made a lot of improvement at Spirit over the past few years, and all our hard work is starting to pay off. We've improved our operational reliability and made great strides in improving our service metrics. We have an industry leading cost structure and a cost gap to our competitors that we believe will continue to widen.  Our key labor agreements are in place for the next several years. We have refined and improved our revenue management processes. We have made measurable improvement in non-ticket revenues and see further upside and we have broadened and diversified our network. And in the future we see plenty of new route opportunities. And of course, none of this would have been possible without our talented and dedicated team members. For all these reasons and more, we are confident about our future success.  With that, back to DeAnne. \nDeAnne Gabel : Thank you, gentlemen. We are now ready to take questions from the analysts. To allow everyone the opportunity to participate, we ask that you limit yourself to one question with one related follow up. Paulette, we are ready to begin. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Kevin Crissey. Please go ahead. \nKevin Crissey: Hi, thanks for the time this morning. Can you talk about what it is about the international market that is attractive from Orlando and how the cost structure advantage plays out in those international markets as compared to domestic markets? \nMatt Klein : Yes, sure Kevin. Good morning, this is Matt. In terms of Orlando, a lot of things that we\u2019ve learned in Fort Lauderdale and how we serve the market tends to be unique. We have a great ability to carry customers that wouldn't otherwise be able to go, and that's what our cost structure allows us to do.  What we\u2019ve learnt in Fort Lauderdale is that there's a lot of traffic back and forth that is visiting friends and relatives and that kind of traffic or that kind of customer base are people that we serve very well and Orlando has similar affinity to Latin America and the Caribbean. Not exactly the same as South Florida, but it has a lot of the same characteristics and as we continue to build out our network in Orlando, we're creating connect opportunities that allows us to flow traffic over Orlando as well.  So it actually creates really good opportunities for our guests out of the Northeast, specially or rather any city really that can connect through either Fort Lauderdale or Orlando gives them better ability to create an itinerary that meets their needs. \nKevin Crissey: So what level of connectivity are we talking about? Are we above 10% connectivity from either of those cities at this point? \nMatt Klein : Yes sure. So yes, to answer the question. And in Fort Lauderdale we've done some things from a scheduling perspective that promotes the flow of connect traffic and it\u2019s one of the few places in our network where we do have some banking that takes place there as well. And we don't have the same exact structure getting set up in Orlando right now just because the size is smaller, but over time we expect that we\u2019ll continue to build out Orlando to act similarly to Fort Lauderdale, not exactly the same, but similarly. \nKevin Crissey: And I guess why \u2013 I understand why that \u2013 how should we think about that for a low cost carrier? To what extent is that a traditional practice? I know that Southwest connects more than people think. How does that differ from the historical practices of an ultralow cost carrier or maybe it doesn't?\nBob Fornaro : Hi Kevin, this is Bob. I don't think it does. Again, we have to look at the nature of the operation; it's got a lot more - we are not flying out of Transatlantic with twin aisle airplane. This is the narrow body operation and we're generally talking two or three hour flight. There is \u2013 for the most part the costs are not dissimilar. There\u2019s some customs and things like that, but generally you get compensated for it. You are able to run relatively high utilization because many of these markets you can serve with red eyes and evening flights. So it\u2019s actually in many ways it\u2019s highly complementary to domestic operation, because we're actually using airplanes at night that quite frankly, but no other place to go, so it really extends the network.  It\u2019s just a matter of how you want to view the globe, but the reality is that you know if there were more cities south of Fort Lauderdale we would be flying there. They just happen to be international. But it's \u2013 I think conceptually it's the same and quite frankly it helps us. Because of our geography and a large \u2013 we have almost 57%, 58% of our operation touches Florida, the Caribbean, Latin America, it allows us to increase our utilization actually quite a bit. So I think it's kind of a natural for us. \nKevin Crissey: Okay, thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead. \nDuane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. In terms of revenue management improvements you have made and pricing clean up, can you expand on what new tools you have deployed? You know what exactly it is you're doing and how would you characterize what inning are we in, in terms of the recovery of those base fares?\nMatt Klein: Hey Duane, this is Matt. So we\u2019ve \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going into too many details of exactly tools that we\u2019re using. We\u2019ve done some things internally and we are building out some new processes.  I think you've heard me say before how we have a tremendous amount of data just like every airline generates and one of the keys is not just the collection of the data, but thinking about the right way to use that data and that's exactly what we're doing now.  And in terms fares and what inning we are in, you know I just like to think of it as every flight every season, off peak, peak, they're all going to act a little bit differently and they have a lot of reliance on just what's going on in terms of the economy and the industry in general. So sort of a continuation of what we saw throughout the summer and into the fall is not that different. We are seeing pretty good strength around the holidays and the peak period, and the off peak periods have recovered pretty well. We\u2019ve done some things from a network perspective that have created more sort of peaking even within a week. So we've eliminated bad flying on Tuesdays and Wednesdays that we don't think is accretive to what we're trying to accomplish and that in general helps overall pricing trends for us. If we are not having to do a lot of extra discounting on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, then it just helps the overall week in general. So I\u2019ll kind of leave with that. \nBob Fornaro: Just to go a little further, I think we are in the early innings and I think \u2013 and the revenue improvements will come. Some will come from the industry environment, you can't escape that and someone will come from our own initiatives and you know fortunately we're getting a lot more from our initiatives. You know it takes a while to get this stuff going and finally like I said, it always takes a little more to get these systems up and running, but we are finally seeing the benefits. Again, we got a whole new team in that area.  So like I said, I think generally in the early innings we are way down from the real peaks of 2014 and 2015, that's kind of obvious and some will be tied to industry [evolution] [ph], but we feel good. A lot of things now are more in our control than perhaps a year or two ago. \nDuane Pfennigwerth : That's great and then maybe you know an industry question. As you think about your fourth quarter outlook and seasonally stronger periods late in the quarter. Could you contrast your visibility into 4Q revenue versus the visibility that you had into 3Q revenue?\nBob Fornaro: Sure. So at this point of the booking curve we're pretty good with what's going on in October obviously. And then as we look forward, the holidays, we have pretty good visibility as to what's going on. I think we're set up really well. I think we've done a really good job in understanding demand patterns and what we're seeing out there from a pricing environment perspective and it's really no different that we talked about on the last call, which is we're continuing to drive loads as much as possible in the off-peak periods.  We've eliminated some bad routes and we\u2019ve eliminated off-peak flying on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which is helping in general, and the trends are moving in a relatively stable way, which is what we like to see. So it\u2019s a little easier to predict what's going on right now, but you never know what will happen as we move through the quarter. But as of right now we think we are pretty good on what we are looking at.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Thanks, I would have guessed that you would say we are ending on a high note as opposed to September, but thanks for taking the questions. \nBob Fornaro: Alright. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead. \nDan McKenzie : Yeah, hey thanks. Good morning guys; a couple of questions here. I'm going to try a first on third quarter revenue/pricing. I'm just wondering if guys later followed any of the industry actions in the third quarter?\nMatt Klein : So this is Matt again. In terms of actions overall, we are making pricing changes and yield management changes on a daily basis. We tend to not take really big broad actions all the time, because that doesn't necessarily benefit us. We are much more surgical in how we look at our data and understand where do we see opportunity to increase fares we will, and where we see the need to reduce fares will be a little more sale promotional, we\u2019ll do that. And in fact the same market may exhibit those two characteristics at the same time depending on travel, season or any unique events that are occurring in certain cities. \nDan McKenzie : Very good, and then now I guess while I have you here, the $55 target for non-ticket revenue per passenger. First, you know what is the next target, how are you thinking about that? Is $60 reasonable next year and what is the pathway there? I believe there's a product refresh that's going on. I\u2019m just wondering if that's enough in and of itself to get you in the next round or you know what are the big drivers as we look ahead? \nMatt Klein : Yeah, so Dan we haven't put a stake in the ground for sort of a next publicly stated goal that we want to get to. We are looking at that now; we are assessing all of the different opportunities that we have. I think we have mentioned before, and I have no problem mentioning it again, that we know that we have opportunity to improve our co-branded credit card program, which we are working on with Bank of America now.  We know we have opportunity to improve our packaging business, which we think of as selling hotels and cars in addition to air and we have some new technology coming in place later this quarter and into next year. That should help us with better merchandising and continuing to sell what we're selling today, but in better ways. So we have not stated exactly a target beyond the $55 at the end of this year, but it is something that we are looking at as we think about 2019 and beyond. \nDan McKenzie : Okay, thanks for the timing guys. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Baker. Please go ahead. \nJamie Baker : Hey, good morning everybody. You\u2019ve had several months now to live with the new pilot contract and at the same time you know the growth rate based on ASM\u2019s is decelerating pretty meaningfully. If I were hired as a first officer today, which would be a bad idea obviously, but what would your best estimate be in terms of how long it would take me to move to the left seat. In two years ago at this time what would your answer have been roughly speaking? \nJohn Bendoraitis: Hey Jamie, this is John Bendoraitis. So right now we're running about \u2013 it ranges from two years and eight months to about three years depending on you know when you want to make the move, so we just kind of round it to three years and it's been pretty consistent in my time here. So it's been hovering right around that three year mark, so give or take a few months on either side. \nJamie Baker : And going forward, that's true even with the slower growth rate? \nA - Bob Fornaro: But the block hours are, you know you got to look at we're getting bigger. So even though the rate is going down we\u2019re in it. \nTed Christie: And I would say the move Jamie; it\u2019s Ted. The move off of this, there may be you know rounding a little bit, but it's not going to be material shifts. We\u2019re still going to be an extremely attractive place to work for pilots while we continue to grow even at mid-teens rather than \u201821, in \u201921. It's still going to be one of the best in the industry. \nJamie Baker : Okay, got it, that was the point of the question. And second, have you on any of your own simulations \u2013 would you be willing to run any of your own simulations you know at the currency pitch, just to be absolutely sure that you still hit the 90 second evac rule? \nTed Christie: Yeah, I mean look, all of the airplanes that fly today have already been certified safe for exit, you know be it because of the original certification or many evac as it relates to whatever the configuration is. So we're comfortable that our airplanes meet those requirements and I think the FAA is already publicly opined on it to be honest. So I don't think there's an issue there and I think we are comfortable to say that our planes meet those mandatory requirements. \nJamie Baker : Excellent! Thank you very much everybody. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Hunter Keay. Please go ahead. \nHunter Keay : Hi team, good morning. \nA - Bob Fornaro: Hey.\nTed Christie: Hi.\nHunter Keay : Hey Ted, when you gave 2018 CASM ex last time you said zero to one, but you hoped to do better. This time you just said zero to one. Kind of curious to know why you chose to drop those words and do you still hope to do better and if you do, what's going to make that happen? \nTed Christie: No, I always hope to do better, which is why we hired Scott. No, that's not an oversight. Look we go into the planning process always aggressively. I don't think you should read anything into that. Our objective is always to do better. We're still in the midst of it, so I'm not prepared to update beyond where we've always been, which is flat to up one with the intent to always do better. \nHunter Keay : Right, and the second part of that question was what's going to make that happen? Well, what is the \u2013 what's the \u2013 is it the budget, is it the utilization, I mean\u2026\nTed Christie: Yeah, I mean look you know, as we\u2019ve said the leverage we pull around here are going to be you know \u2013 how do we best optimize assets, that's always the case. So peak utilization is a primary objective and you and I've talked about that as we have publicly that you know over the last few years our utilization has come off a little bit and we see that as an opportunity to improve asset utilization.  We don't \u2013 you know we don't have to pilot a deal until the first quarter, but obviously you know so there's a little bit of pressure there, but we still have the aircraft purchases that we did in the middle of this year. We don't lap till midway through the year, so that helps us too and so you know there's always maintenance timing, there's always a bunch of other things that we work our way through.  But this company's got you know a pretty unified objective to maintain our cost structure and expand the cost gap and we've done that for the last seven years and it will continue and you know I think if anyone were to ask us at the beginning of this year as to whether or not we are going to deliver flat to down CASM in a pilot year we would have been called liars and we did it, and so you know that's kind of the way we're approaching next year too. \nHunter Keay : Liar is a bit harsh, but \u2013 So this is a question for Matt. So as you build the schedule debt, you know you mentioned obviously the benefit of more connecting itineraries and you even talked about banking Orlando a little bit, but are you finding it a little bit harder to raise local fares in those markets because of the additional frequencies that effectively mean you're competing against yourself, you know because you also compete against ULCCs when you do that you know. How are you finding that dynamic of pricing improvements locally where you\u2019re adding depts.? \nBob Fornaro: Yeah Hunter, that's a good question. We're actually finding the reverse to be true, that as we add more optionality to our customers, we actually have the ability to carry them in both directions on a much better schedule, which in fact helps us on yield and helps us on pricing power in the market place.  So I know, I understand your question, but in fact what happens is that the benefit to pushing up yields, largely because we don't have to necessarily do some things to help drive added traffic. The traffic will just naturally flow over.  And then in terms of the local markets themselves, right now we believe the environment is strong. We know what happened last year. Pricing is still out in the marketplace, but inventory control are things that we\u2019re practicing more and more of and I think it's showing up and I think that the ability to drive traffic has never been an issue for us. It's been more about can we get that at the right yield and right now we're not having any issues with it. \nBob Fornaro: Let me just go a little further Hunter. If you just look at our route network, we got about a quarter of our routes where we have more than one flight a day. But yeah, you've got a look at networks completely differently and you can look at a legacy carrier network, so we're relatively small, but we've got a series of cities where we got 20, 30, 40 flights. Again, we\u2019ve got you know 20 flights in about 10 cities and some substantially bigger and quite frankly we can add more servers because we're kind of gaining scale in key places and as Matt said, when we got better time of day coverage, we got a great cost structure, the product is better.  The differences in coach compared to carriers is tiny and we wanted to dramatically better airline before. So we do pretty well on those routes and then we operate against the larger carries and we can have a 50%, 60%, 70% cost advantage. So I think it's kind of hard to really what we do. About I think 50%, 60% of our routes we have once a day and we have 15% where they are less than daily. So we vary our strategy by the route and by how we perceive our own you know strength of the city and I think right now I think we're in a pretty good spot. \nHunter Keay : Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth. Please go ahead. Savi, your line is now open.\nSavi Syth : Hey, good morning. Sorry about that.\nBob Fornaro: Good morning.\nSavi Syth : Americans going to change their basic economy product offering a bit recently and I was wondering if you\u2019ve noticed any difference, just when kind of you\u2019re a legacy competitor now and you know in the future you will have some of the competitors with this basic offering. Is it different in kind of the product where they include the carry on or not and if you\u2019re seeing anything different with this change? \nBob Fornaro: I\u2019ll start off and Matt can finish. Everybody now has basic economy. So they say, this is all tied to have people want to manage their revenues. We really don't care what they're doing. You know the industry competes in a lot of different formats and I\u2019m guessing that maybe we\u2019ll get four or five carriers doing it.  This is just a market place adjusting and adapting and the key thing is ultimately is how many seats do you sell at a certain price. That is by far the biggest driver and like I said, we're very comfortable with the direction of our earnings. Some of it's tied to what the industry does, but well more than half is tied to things that we're doing and obviously as you know we're pretty comfortable with our ancillary structure which doesn't fluctuate with industry activities. Matt?\nMatt Klein: Yeah sure, that's right Bob and I would just add Savi that the idea of customer segmentation by using base economy is one that makes sense. I think anyone, the core principles of revenue management suggests that customer segmentation helps you price more effectively to the customer segments that you are putting together.  So I guess from my perspective allowing like American exchange that you had mentioned, they are going to change their product to see how \u2013 to what they think is best, to the extent that it blurs the line on segmentation. To me it would mean like they have to sell less seats because they are blurring the segmentation. So in fact in that case our overall statement in the past still holds, that we expect all these products to be neutral to slightly beneficial to us, because anything that helps the segment is beneficial and then at the end of the day if there is a line that\u2019s getting blurred on that, then our competitors may have to sell even less of those price points in order to maintain what they see as important segmentation. \nSavanthi Syth: Very helpful answer, thank you. And if I just might make a quick follow-up to Ted, you talked about fuel efficiency improvement. This year it kind of looks like it had improved about 3%. Does that moderate as we go into the following year? How should we think about that level of improvement?\nTed Christie: Yeah, it\u2019s a good question Savi. I don\u2019t know if I can say for sure exactly what's going to be the impact going forward. I mean neos will have a notable improvement. They will drive considerable improvement going forward in just that fuel burn line. So I don't think we're done improving on. I assume that percentage was on an ASM basis and I don't think that improvements necessarily done. You know as the fleet gets bigger it will round over time, there\u2019s no doubt about it, but we\u2019re just not quite sure yet how much neos will offset any other aging pressures that we have. \nSavanthi Syth: Alright, thanks for the figures.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Didora. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning everyone. Ted, maybe a little bit of a follow up to the Savi\u2019s first question, but look, as you enter your new role when you look forward for Spirit, how do you view the phased competitive position in the market as the Legacy Airlines continue to strengthen their cabin segmentation initiatives and I guess what do you think are the biggest network opportunities for Spirit over the say next three to five years, Thanks?\nTed Christie: Sure. So I think Matt addressed our collective views very well on how we view the strength of our product. It\u2019s tied to our cost advantage; it's tied to the design of the model and the attractiveness of a-la-carte pricing for our customer base. We know that's what they want. We survey them and that's what they get. So we feel very good about the way the product is designed.  I think what you hit upon is where my focus is for the next three to five years is on network and design of that network and the value as we build out the opportunities that we see and we put them in to bucket right. We talked about big city opportunities, we talk about large leisure destinations and we talked about international and in fact, if you look at the past year and you just look at the routes that we added over the past year, in rough numbers depending on categorization it's about a third, a third, a third is what we added last year. About you know some big city stuff some large leisure destinations and plenty of international.  And as the network matures and evolves, those opportunities become clearer to us rather than foggier. And so what we are excited about over the next three to five years is how are we going to optimize those opportunities and it ties into some of the commentary Matt made earlier about what we do with kind of intentional connect opportunities and how we time our aircraft in various markets, will have an impact on our ability continue to drive yield improvement.  And with a quality product, a clearly improving product and a very high quality product for us, we think we have a tremendous amount of advantage. Good costs, high quality product and an evolving network, that's where my head\u2019s at and the management team for the next three years.\nAndrew Didora: Thank you for that Ted. And then just a follow-up there, are there other markets outside of non-South Florida that could be another source for connecting traffic?\nTed Christie: So we do connect some in non-South Florida markets today, it's not big and so there are a handful of opportunities for us to continue to optimize that and we do see markets that will flush out over time where that \u2013 again, I don't want to over emphasize the concept of connect. We\u2019re never going to be a true banking airline in large kind of metropolitan areas. What we are going to do is optimize our fleet and the network opportunities, so that we drive appropriate amount of yield opportunity and that's going to come some from connect and largely from local and so we do see opportunities beyond just South Florida, but that\u2019s going to have to flush out over time.\nAndrew Didora: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker. Please go ahead. \nHelane Becker: Thanks operator. Hi everybody. Thank you for the time. So Bob, I don\u2019t know if Bob or Ted want to answer this or Matt even. But as you think about all these improvements that you have made and you have seen really great improvement on the operations, two questions; one, what\u2019s the cost association with getting to 99% completion factor or should we be thinking of it more as a cost savings rather than a cost spent? And two, how has that translated into your net promoter score if that\u2019s a number you look at?\nBob Fornaro: So we\u2019ll break it into two and I\u2019ll let Matt talk about the net premotor or at lease comment on it. But we want to start with the operation, so philosophically if you try to fix an operation in six months or six weeks, you could also get cost structure very quickly? So we basically, we said we got a couple years and we're going to be very diligent, because the goal was to make sure the cost gap for the industry was lower. So we started with a little bit of luck, we made some adjustments on our routings, got through all our turns, we went into excruciating detail and we took some utilization down.  Really what we found was, we really wanted to get out the completion and the cost of disruption because that number \u2013 for us the cost of disruption is higher than other carriers who have a lot of frequencies. And so we've actually saved a substantial amount of money, and we're now at a point where we think we can begin to flex up the utilization again, so now we have control.  Again, so if you have an operation where we are, you don\u2019t fix eight things at a time, you create the stability. You create a stable platform and we think now we can start improving our utilization again.  Again at the same time, I think our labor agreements are substantially better. I think our pilot deal is a win-win for the pilots and for our customers, because we have a lot more flexibility to you know manage our airline and the bulk of our operation is from the Midwest to the East Coast, so we have a lot of ATC issues. We manage these things dramatically better today than we did a couple of years ago. So we're at a pretty good spot. I think we already are around 80%. I think we are running a good airline and I think we can now actually begin to squeeze some additional cost improvements out of it without really having a negative impact on our operation.\nMatt Klein : Yeah sure, and in terms of net promoter score, we don't publicly comment about what the actual numbers are. I can tell you that directionally we are very pleased with the trajectory. As you could imagine, running a much better operation in terms of on time performance, in terms of completion factor, just to get the plug in for operations group, we have the best bag handling rates in the industry and we're also seeing in a reduction in our DOT complaint level as well. They are at all-time lows for us as well and trending in the right direction. And when we talk about the operation, it's not just about the aircraft taking off and landing. It\u2019s also about what happens at the airport from an experience perspective. So we spent a great deal of time looking at our data, which you\u2018ll hear me say a lot, and analyzing where the pain points are and working very closely with our operations group to understand how to make the guest experience better at the airport.  I think it's playing through in a very smart way. Instead of having to swing really crude weapons around, we can go in very surgically and attack pain points that we see our guests experiencing and can alleviate them. And all that shows up on our NPS at the end of the day and we also know that the better we get scored on an NPS basis, the better we see repeat our purchase rates from our guests as well. So it all plays in together. \nHelane Becker: Matt, can you say what that repeat rate is and what it is compared to?\nMatt Klein : No, again Helane, we haven\u2019t really talked about that one publicly. I don't think we are prepared to do that right now. But I can tell you that it's moved up nicely and it's not just moving up in terms of repeat rate, what we're also seeing is that the better the NPS score is then we also know that our guests spend a little bit more on ancillary purchases as well. So again it's on purpose. We view this as an investment into how we view the future revenue streams of the company. \nHelane Becker: That's great. Okay, thanks for your help. I appreciate your answer. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead. \nMichael Linenberg : Yeah hey, I just \u2013 not to beat a dead horse here on the connections. But I know a lot of the conversation around connectivity has talked about improving yield and I'm just curious to structurally, do you by taking a connecting passenger, do you preclude capturing as much ancillary as you would like \u2013 as you would typically receive if you had two local passengers and look I've flown Spirit before, but I've never flown on a connecting base.  I mean can you charge the same passenger twice for a carryon bag for example? Or are the yields in the connecting itineraries sufficiently high that they more than compensate for whatever ancillary that you would forego, if you were taking two local passengers as opposed to one connecting?\nTed Christie: Hey Mike, it\u2019s Ted. Yeah, so look we're still a local airline, okay, so the primary focus on us is pushing local traffic. The design of the ancillary model favors that, but we will price connecting opportunities to optimize all in yield and by that I mean TRASM, okay.  So we're always looking for opportunities to drive TRASM. We measure ourselves based on T, not on the separate distinct items and so it's just one component. It\u2019s one weapon or tool in the tool kit that we think we have more opportunity to use today than we did three or five years ago, that's all. It\u2019s just because we are 121 airplanes rather than 21 airplanes and that will just continue to refine over time. \nMichael Linenberg : Okay, and just a follow up on you know about percentages of connecting passengers. I'm not sure if Matt actually said the number, but if I approached it differently and said what percent of your Latin itineraries involve a connection. Would you have that number even a rough approximation?\nMatt Klein : Yeah Mike, we do. So in terms of running through Fort Lauderdale, it\u2019s about half of our international traffic connection at Fort Lauderdale and the other half is local, out of Fort Lauderdale. Most of our other international flying right now is going to be more of the local point-to-point nature and I don't want \u2013 I want to make sure that we don't over rotate on this idea of connective.  Like Ted mentioned, it's important and it helps add to the network, but it's really augmenting what we already do. We are very careful about utilization and we're not going to do things that\u2019s going to hurt utilization in order to try to carry one or two more connect passengers. So I just want to make sure we are clear on that. \nBob Fornaro: It\u2019s really nothing new. We\u2019ve been doing it, the company\u2019s been doing it for years. We are just bigger and Fort Lauderdale serving 50 flights where we were two or three years ago, whereas that was in the 70s. But you know it's one of our key airports with the places like Orlando and Las Vegas or you know close second and third. \nMichael Linenberg : Yeah, but Bob you said though, you're now in 10 cities, you're over 20 departures a day. So it will become a byproduct and it sounds like it's going to be an accretive byproduct from a profitability standpoint.\nBob Fornaro: It would be and it\u2019s just the matter of size and there is generally more competition in local markets today. In actually connecting markets the fares are actually relatively higher. That's different than where we were eight to 10 years ago. So again there is opportunities that actually come with size. We've done things with automation and it will also vary by season, because we have bigger opportunities in September and October than perhaps to carry connections versus the summer where you can try to maximize local?  So again, as we get size and as the network evolves, it\u2019s just all networks are different and ours evolves in a differ way and I think quite frankly you know we can \u2013 you know a lot of experience carrying connections and we can run an exceptionally low cost airline. Especially when you're dealing with narrow bodies the way we are other than customs, the operation is remarkably similar. So we don\u2019t over complicate it.\nMichael Linenberg : Great! Thanks everyone. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead. \nJoseph DeNardi : Yeah hi, good morning. Matt I think in the past you kind of characterized the ancillary opportunity as maybe $1, $2 you know per passenger. I\u2019m wondering now that the credit card as an opportunity if that's changed. Are we still looking at dollar increases or is the opportunity more significant over the next say 12 to 24 months?\nMatt Klein : Yes. So Joe, thanks for the question. We have and we\u2019ve report some of this publicly. And so we know what the opportunity is on credit card. I'm going to probably give you a little bit of a non-answer here, Joe so I'll just tell you in advance, but we know what the opportunity is. \nJoseph DeNardi : Just on the credit card question. \nMatt Klein : Yeah, so specific to the credit card, we know where we've been. In fact our credit card program is under performing right now compared to where we were a year ago and we're bigger. So right there shows you some opportunity. I think we filed some numbers in the Q and you can see the opportunities there, and not only do we know that the opportunity is there, but it's also in conjunction with how we think about the loyalty program, which as you know those are clearly tied together.  So together we believe there's really good opportunity there and we also have one thing that we don't talk about a lot, but we talk about from time-to-time is that just as we evolve and as our customer base evolves and flies with Spirit more often, there are some challenges that we have with that that or not heavy challenges, but there is things that we have to understand which is when our customers start to fly us with a higher repeat rate, then they start to learn the model a little bit and then they'll join our $9 Fare Club, right.  So when they join the $9 Fare Club we get added revenue from that, they get some discounts on their bag charges. So we\u2019ve created programs that help to take advantage of a repeat rate. I want to encourage repeat rate and what you'll see next year as we come out with our new loyalty program, it's going to be an extension of our overall product.  Right now our loyalty program and the credit card for Bank of America associated with it was developed years ago when our model was a certain way and where we are today, it doesn't fit. It doesn't our customer base and we see it and they are telling us with their behaviors that it doesn't fit for them anymore, and that's one of the major reasons why we are looking to change it and the opportunity I think is definitely there for us. \nJoseph DeNardi : Okay, that's interesting Matt. And then Ted, a question for you. If you had formulated the capacity plans for 2019 without Bob sitting next to you, would Spirit be growing at a faster rate? Just trying to understand if you think the right rate of growth for Spirit is higher than Bob does?\nBob Fornaro: I want to hear this.\nTed Christie : No, we're pretty unified on how we view the business. You know we've always known and in fact we talked about this even before Bob took over as CEO, that as the airline got larger the percentage growth was going to round. It looks weird admittedly this year that we go from 23 to you know 14 or whatever, but remembering the 23 really should be around 18 or 17 or 18 when you figure out the problems that existed in 2017.  So I think we are on the right path. I think we feel really good about that growth rate. We are always going to look for opportunities within each individual year to optimize utilization of the fleet, to take advantage of opportunities principally in the peak, but around and quite frankly in times where it's not as good, you look to kind of draw down a little bit of your off peak flying to compensate. But nonetheless I think we're very comfortable, and have established a delivery profile that matches that, that's not a coincidence. \nJoseph DeNardi : Thanks Ted. \nTed Christie : Sure. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead. \nMatt Wisniewski: Hi, this is actually Matt Wisniewski on for Brandon. Thanks for talking my question. Quick one for you. You talked about the operational improvements due to the new pilot contract. So I was hoping you kind of expand a little bit on that. You know obviously it seems to be working so far. Should we expect continued improvements? Is there something that could spool up over time?\nMatt Klein: Yeah, I think we're still collectively learning our agreement and you know as I mentioned \u2013 as we mentioned before, the principal benefits come in our ability to recover in times of disruption and I think that's where you see some of that benefit today.  As we've also mention next year, we anticipate we will be deploying a preferential bidding system that we think should have some we hope benefit as well. We haven't quantified, but we are looking at that happening in the late first quarter, early second quarter we hope.  So while we've shown operational benefit today and we're running a much better airline, we're still you know making sure that we\u2019re optimized and I think that his gives us an opportunity to continue to kind of tweak the knobs going forward from here. \nMatt Wisniewski: Okay great, thank you. \nDeAnne Gabel: Paulette, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Jack Atkins. Please go ahead. \nJack Atkins : Thanks for squeezing me in here guys. I appreciate it. \nBob Fornaro: No problem.\nMatt Klein: Good morning Jack.\nJack Atkins : Good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions here. You know Matt going back to what you're saying on the credit card underperformance a moment ago, I mean is that something that gets resolved in the next you know couple quarters or is that something that's really more of you know a couple years out in terms of getting that fixed. What\u2019s the timeline there, if you can sort of help us think through that?\nMatt Klein: Sure. So we will see improvement on this starting in next year, but overall it will probably take around 18 months where it\u2019s all kind of flowing through and become annualized. So as we \u2013 right now we\u2019ve done some things to help. We\u2019ve increased the sign-up offer onboard the aircraft, so we've improved the offer.  We are working very closely with our flight attending group on creating better strategies to drive more flight attended engagement on the program in general. And then as we mentioned, next year as we look at our loyalty program revamp, that will have an additive effect as well and side note which I mention just recently, previously as well, is we expect our $9 Fare Club program to benefit from all these changes as well. \nJack Atkins : Okay, that's good to hear. And then just as a follow up to sort of the broader conversation around you know the optimism for the earnings growth in 2019. I mean Ted I would just be curious to get a sense for your level of confidence around you know pre-tax margin expansion next year.  Because I guess as we sort of think about the significant revenue momentum in the business as we are exiting the year, you know fairly the comps in the first half of the year and then you know pretty modest unit cost growth in terms of the outlook. I mean it seems like you guys are really well positioned to expand margins but you know I was just curious if there were any puts and takes around it. Thinking about it just to know what you\u2019re level of confidence is?\nTed Christie : No, it\u2019s a great point Jack. Look, if we take a step back, we talked about this as we look at the broader opportunity set for this business and the markets that we look to tackle. We\u2019ve always used the mid-teens target and today \u2013 and that's on the op line by the way, and today obviously that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re a little below that on average.  Obviously this quarter was good, but on average and so we believe that over time that we revert to a mean, we may have in certain years over performed that target and underperformed in others, but over time it kind of focuses around a meaning on purpose and that's the targeted number.  So our objective always is to drive further margin expansion and earnings and we feel very good about the set up for next year because of all the work that's been done over the last few years, all the things that Matt talked about in the revenue line and our continued discipline on cost. We just feel like the setup has inflected in the right direction. \nJack Atkins : Okay great. Thank you again for the time. \nDeAnne Gabel : Thank you everyone for joining us today. That\u2019s a wrap. \nA - Bob Fornaro: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

My name is Ellen and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to DeAnne Gabel, Senior Director-Investor Relations. Ms. Gabel, you may begin.\nDeAnne Gabel - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thank you, Ellen, and welcome, everyone, to the Spirit Airlines second quarter earnings call. Bob Fornaro, our Chief Executive Officer, will give a few brief opening comments followed by Matt Klein, our Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, who will review our revenue performance and outlook, followed by Ted Christie, our President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our cost performance. We'll close with \u2013 Bob will have some closing remarks before we begin the Q&A session for sell-side analysts following our prepared remarks. Also joining us in the room today are Thomas Canfield, our General Counsel; John Bendoraitis, our Chief Operating Officer; and other members of our senior leadership team. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call will be archived on our website for 60 days. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent the company's current expectation or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance or results and are based on information currently available and are management's belief as of today, July 26, 2018. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our second quarter 2018 earnings release which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. And with that, let me turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thanks, DeAnne, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2018 net income, adjusted for special items, of $75.7 million or $1.11 per diluted share, and our operating margin was 13.3%. Despite materially higher fuel prices, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations due to strong ancillary revenue production and better-than-expected cost performance primarily driven by excellent operational performance. For the second quarter, we achieved a DOT on-time performance of 79.6%, our best second quarter performance in the company's history, and our completion factor was 99.4%. I commend and congratulate our team members on these achievements. The hard work and effort shown by the Spirit team has really begun to reap the benefits we expected. We are achieving better operational reliability and improved customer satisfaction, and we are doing this while improving our cost structure and driving ancillary revenue performance. All these things combined make Spirit a very strong competitor. With that, I'll turn it over to Matt and Ted to discuss our second quarter in more detail.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. For the second quarter of 2018, we reported total revenue of $852 million. Total revenue per available seat mile decreased 6.8% year-over-year. Our second quarter 2018 TRASM result was negatively impacted by a year-over-year increase in our average stage length and by the calendar shift of Easter. Normalizing for those factors, we estimate TRASM would have been down 1.6% year-over-year. Although we have yet to lap the passenger yield pressures from the competitive dynamics we experienced in the third quarter last year, we did offset some of the headwind with stronger non-ticket revenue. Non-ticket revenue per passenger segment that is non-fare passenger revenue plus other revenue for the second quarter was $54.57, up 3% year-over-year. This improvement is attributable to both higher take rates of certain items such as combos, bags, and big front seats, as well as our dynamic pricing initiatives. This trend gives us confidence that we can continue to drive year-over-year increases in non-ticket revenue per segment and we are on pace to achieve our target of $55 per segment on a run-rate basis by the end of this year. Another component of driving ancillary revenue is how we develop our network. For the last 18 months, we have been growing and diversifying our network, focusing our growth in three key areas: big cities; large leisure destinations; and international cities. Building a diverse network with a few key areas of concentration helps with our schedule flows and gives customers broader access to our entire network. During the second quarter, we announced that in September we will begin service from Asheville and Greensboro to three of our Florida destinations: Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, and Orlando. We also announced an international expansion from Orlando to 11 destinations in Latin America and the Caribbean as well as some additional international service from big cities in our network. By the end of the year, international capacity will account for approximately 15% of our total capacity, compared to only 9% at the beginning of 2018. We continue to be excited about the opportunity to expand our international footprint. Additionally, as we discussed last quarter, in our post-Labor Day schedule, we've cut a lot of underperforming long-haul routes and have redeployed these aircraft on shorter-stage routes throughout our network. Turning to capacity, we estimate ASMs for the third quarter 2018 will increase approximately 24.5% year-over-year. As you may recall, in third quarter 2017, we canceled nearly 1,700 flights due to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. On a schedule-over-schedule basis, our ASMs are up 21% year-over-year in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect our capacity to be up about 14%, which is 250 basis points lower than our estimate at the beginning of the year. Now turning to our revenue outlook for the third quarter 2018; as anticipated, overall passenger demand for the peak summer period is strong and we have taken action using both price structure adjustments as well as revenue management techniques in an effort to drive yields higher. While our international region is performing well overall, we started to see signs of softness in Cancun in the second quarter. This was a slight negative to our second quarter results, but we do estimate it will impact third quarter TRASM by about 100 basis points. We have made select capacity trims to Cancun beginning in the fall and have postponed some new additions to Cancun. We continue to monitor the travel advisory situation, which started to become an issue earlier this year, its impact on our demand for travel to Cancun, and we will review further adjustments as necessary. Based on the current industry pricing and inventory control trends we are seeing, we estimate our total RASM for the third quarter 2018 will be up between 2% and 3% year-over-year. This takes into account a 170-basis-point drag related to a 3.4% increase in stage length as well as a 100-basis-point softness attributable to Cancun. With that, here's Ted to discuss our cost performance and third quarter cost outlook.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thanks, Matt, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I join Bob in congratulating our team for their achievements in the second quarter and thank them for their dedication and commitment in providing excellent service to our guests. Based on survey results and the number of compliment letters we now receive, our guests are also noticing how we have improved. So, kudos to our team. Moving on to our second quarter 2018 cost performance, CASM ex-fuel was $0.0517, a decrease of 11.3% year-over-year. Better operational performance was a large driver of this improvement and resulted in lower passenger re-accommodation expense and lower crew disruption expense per ASM as well as improved labor productivity and efficiency, which helped to partially offset the impact of higher wage rates. Aircraft rent per ASM was also lower year-over-year primarily due to the elimination of lease expense related to the 14 A319 aircraft the company purchased off-lease during the quarter. With the purchase of these A319 aircraft, we now have 22 aircraft in our fleet that are unencumbered. At this point, we aren't planning on any near-term aircraft retirements, but having these unencumbered assets creates flexibility as we plan what our future fleet will look like. We are in the midst of evaluating the options for deliveries beyond 2021 and anticipate having an update on that front by year-end. As for our cost outlook, for the third quarter 2018, we estimate CASM ex-fuel will be down 3% to 4%. We are projecting CASM ex-fuel will be up mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. Along with continued pressure from higher pilot rates, during the fourth quarter, we have headwinds from higher scheduled maintenance as well as timing of flight attendant and pilot training as we prepare for the 2019 peak schedule. Nonetheless, we are on track to achieve a full-year 2018 CASM ex-fuel of down 3.5% to 4% year-over-year. We are just beginning our bottoms-up planning process for 2019 which starts with determining our level of operations. As we consider how well our operation has been running we are gaining confidence that we can maintain a high level of reliability while increasing our utilization in the peak periods next year, which we believe is the best time to push our assets as that is when demand is the highest. Together with our higher completion factor trends, this means our capacity growth for 2019 will be up about 14%. As it relates to 2019 CASM ex, we've updated our initial high-level estimate to include operational trends in line with what we've recently been experiencing, and we now expect CASM ex-fuel to be flat to up 1%. There may be some improvement to this range once we go through our detailed refinement. We'll update you again on 2019 once we complete our formal budgeting process. In closing, we are dedicated to driving earnings growth and, while higher fuel prices make this goal more difficult, we are taking action by adjusting our network, pushing pricing where we can, and producing higher non-ticket revenue. In addition to maintaining our commitment to non-fuel cost discipline, we remain focused on running a reliable, on-time airline. The benefits of doing so helps the business across the board. Our guest experience is better, our team member experience is positive, and our cost structure is strong. With that, I'll throw it back to Bob.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thanks, Ted. Spirit is evolving. We are making service enhancements and our operational reliability is much improved. Our cost structure remains intact and likely to widen versus our competition. Our labor agreements are set for a number of years and we believe opportunities exist for more efficiencies. And the network has evolved as well. It is much more diverse today than it was several years ago. We have more than 20 cities in excess of 20 departures today. We're well established in key big markets, and we are now leveraging traditional leisure markets like Las Vegas and Orlando. And we have a strong international operation in Fort Lauderdale. And finally, we see plenty of opportunity in mid-to-small markets. So, if you add that all together, we see the potential for margin improvement in the future. And as you know, the ride isn't always smooth and predictable, but the trend is slowly taking shape. With that, I'll turn it over to DeAnne.\nDeAnne Gabel - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thanks, Bob, Ted, Matt. Ellen, we are ready to begin the question-answer session. We do ask that everyone limit themselves to one question with one related follow-up. Ellen?\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is from Jack Atkins.\nJack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess to start off here with Matt; clearly, you all have been very successful over the last few quarters on the ancillary side with new product rollouts and more dynamic pricing there. Matt, I'm just curious if you could maybe comment for a moment on sort of what's left to come this year as you look at further product rollout and sort of what else you could maybe pull from a lever perspective on the dynamic pricing front this year.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Great. Thanks for the question. So, as we continue to move \u2013 as we move through this year and continue to move through the rest of this year, we've been able to put some \u2013 continue to put some newer technologies in place, allow us to make changes to some of our thoughts around how we yield manage and how we think about things like our combo of bundled products that we have on our website today. And that's an opportunity that we see for us as we learn more and think about how we offer products to our customers. And it's not necessarily on like an individualized basis. We're thinking more in terms of how customers have similar traffic patterns. So, as customers themselves may group themselves in traffic patterns, we learn about how size of the record matters or the length of stay that the party is going to stay or where they're headed. All of those come into play from an ancillary revenue perspective and what those customers may want in their offering. So, it's more about how we think about when to offer and how to offer. Everyone gets the same offer. It's more about the right way that we present it to them and act more as a retailer and merchandise our products. As we think about the rest of this year and then into next year as well, we're not at this time going to be committing to a target for next year, but we do know that we have opportunity in a couple of key areas. Things that we're addressing now but they have longer lead times. For example, our affinity card relationship we have right now is one that we know that there's upside on that, that when we created that program a number of years ago, it was disruptive and worked really well for the model and the industry as we competed in it at that time, and now it needs to be refreshed. And those are the kinds of opportunities that we know have tangible opportunity for us. Some of those have longer lead times, so it's going to take a little while for us to recognize all that. But when we think about 2019, that's where I see some exciting opportunity for us to continue to build on the trends that we put together this year.\nJack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: That makes a lot of sense, Matt. Thank you. And then kind of just following up on the revenue environment, as we think about the progression on the TRASM side for the rest of the year, clearly turning positive on a year-over-year basis with TRASM in the third quarter is a great step. But looking at the fourth quarter with capacity growth coming down significantly and just thinking about normal seasonal revenue trends 3Q to 4Q, is it right to assume that you should be seeing, all else being equal, continued momentum on the TRASM side as we move forward into the fourth quarter?\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: So, actually, we do anticipate that we're going to continue to have good momentum. The question is really going to be on what kind of incremental basis are we talking about. We really like what we've done with the route network, how we're redeploying. We do have less growth on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, but there's a lot of puts and takes in there. I think, Ted, maybe you have some color to add to that as well.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah, Jack. The only point I would make is \u2013 by the way, we're very bullish on the trends we see, specifically in the peak, but the traction that we just discussed in Matt's prior answer that we see on ancillary gives the company a lever that we're excited to pull. As we head into the fourth quarter, sequentially, the comp is a little more difficult. The third quarter last year was a tough quarter, I think, for the industry. And then, as you may recall, we reported some pretty strong revenue performance in the peak last year. So we faced that as a headwind sequentially going into the fourth quarter. So I would \u2013 while we're excited about what we see and, as Bob mentioned in his preamble, the improvement we're going to see will probably come in bites, right? You'll get some movement in the right direction and we're definitely seeing it turn. And I think, by the way, regardless, the move to positive is happening in the third quarter and we feel like that will maintain itself into the fourth. And so, we're definitely going in the right direction.\nJack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: That's great to hear. Thanks again for the time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Susan Donofrio.\nSusan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yes. Good morning, everyone.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Good morning, Susan.\nDeAnne Gabel - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Good morning, Susan.\nSusan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah, my question is on technology. Could you give us an update on where you are with some enhancements to your website? And also, I know you had started to do a little bit on your app.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah, certainly. So we've been deploying updates all year really to our website and that includes also better optimization of our mobile website as well for people that use their smartphones or tablets. So we've been deploying that throughout the year. We do have more deployments taking place closer to the end of this year and that will continue to give us more flexibility on our site. From an analytics perspective, I'm very excited about the analytic opportunities that we're also going to be adding to the site, which will also be a double positive. On the one hand, we're also besides becoming more modern in the way that we deploy the website, we're also going to have the ability to do a lot more test and learn on the website as well. So, again, something that we think is going to have a big impact, not just on conversion of selling the ticket itself, but also how we learn about how better to merchandize our ancillary products. And then in terms of the app, we did put out our app last year \u2013 late last year, which was really just a first generation tool for our guests to be able to have a more seamless flight experience, airport experience. And what we're going to be rolling out also later this year in about \u2013 in a few months actually is going to be the ability for us to go a little bit further. Again, you're going to hear me say a lot of times about merchandizing our ancillary products. Today, we do a really good job of taking orders from our customers; what they want, we can sell them quite well. In the future, we're not only going to be able to do that, but we're also going to be acting more as a retailer and presenting the offers to them in a smarter way, maybe in a better way that we time the offer and then how we talk to our customers after they've already purchased tickets on us.\nSusan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: So we should start to see more specialized offers pushed out, you think, more towards the end of the year?\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah, towards the end of the year. It's not so much that they'll be specialized. It's more about that we're going to be able to better merchandise what we already have out there. So, for example: presenting opportunities to buy the seat assignment into our Big Front Seat product. Getting that offer out to guests who are using our app, we'll be able to get that out to them when we have open availability. We'll be able to merchandise to them in a much more efficient way and just letting them know that that opportunity is out there for them. Today, a lot of times, you may have a seat or two that's available, people get to the airport, and then just under the normal airport experience, you may or may not be paying attention to what's going on, just the normal guest experience includes all kinds of activity at the airport. Now, we'll be able to message the opportunity to those guests and we expect the take rate to improve. That's just one example that we have out there.\nSusan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Certainly.\nOperator: The next question is from Savi Syth.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Good morning.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Good morning, Savi.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. First question was on the trend. I'm just trying to understand. I know the peaks have been strong and I know the off-peaks have been somewhat softer. So, are you seeing changes in how the industry is thinking about capacity as well as the adjustments that you're making that's maybe making that incrementally better? Or as you look into the fourth quarter, is it really more what you're contributing on the ancillary revenue that's driving the increase in optimism?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Well, Savi, this is Ted. I'll do my best to dive in there. Maybe Matt can jump in as well. So, it was a little bit tough to hear you, but it sounds like the question was around how we feel about revenue performance heading into the peak and off-peak and whether or not it's just ancillary contributing or the capacity moves the company's making also assisting. I think our view is that the peak performance, like we said before, has been pretty consistent. We're using revenue management and inventory management techniques to lever that yield. In the off-peak, what has been a problem before is probably the supply/demand balance shifting in favor of the consumer more in the off-peak than in the peak. The trajectory, however, and the commentary around broader domestic capacity would be positive to that type of setup. And we've made our own moves. We obviously previously discussed them. But we still see a large growth opportunity. So we're managing the balance between seeing a pretty sizable upside from a growth perspective and managing our own capacity to make sure we're deploying it at the right rate. So, I think it's probably contributing, Savi, to be honest with you. But I think we're just at the beginning phases of seeing that capacity move feather through everyone's schedules into the fourth quarter.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: And maybe just to reiterate, again, if you kind of dig through some of the detail of our schedule changes, there's a number of routes that, let's say, we're flying less in that shoulder period than we did last year. We're just anticipating the demand won't be there in a number of long-haul routes that we flew throughout the year. They're just going to be seasonal. And there's an opportunity to recapture some of that business. We have many more connecting opportunities in our network today than we had a year ago. So, we see some \u2013 so it's a combination of things the industry's doing, combination of things we're doing ourselves.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you. And if I might, I know it's probably a little early for 2019, but how should we think about stage length versus new market, the mix there versus what you saw this year?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: You asked about stage. I think it is early to set up. Our stage, historically, has hovered between 950 miles and 1,050 miles. And I think, as we indicated before, and Bob just alluded to it, longer-haul flying with little bit higher fuel is probably not as attractive as it was before. So wouldn't be surprised if the incremental adds come at slightly below average stage, which may be some of what you'll see into 2019. But we're not going to have dramatic swings in the average stage of the business going forward.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right, very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Hey, thanks. Was wondering if you could speak a little bit to the network changes and, specifically, the opportunity that you see out of Orlando internationally, how you're seeing RASM trends there, how much of that was flowing through Fort Lauderdale, et cetera.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Duane. So, as we think about Orlando in general, it's now \u2013 by the end of this year, it will be our second largest station along with Las Vegas, up there sort of neck-and-neck for second, third largest station, Fort Lauderdale being our largest station. We've had a big focus on Orlando as well as Las Vegas and continue to grow in large leisure destinations in general. You see us add more to Myrtle Beach. We added a bunch to New Orleans as well. Those kinds of destinations work really well for us. It's where a significant percentage of vacation travelers want to go, and we're quite comfortable carrying that traffic at profitable levels. So, you'll see us continue to think about those kinds of destinations as key areas of growth for us. In terms of international out of Orlando, the booking curves are kicking in. Just like any new routes there's some spool up in some routes that are a little slower; some are exceeding our expectations in there. So, on average, we're happy with what's going on there. It's really early in the booking curve in general, so any of the areas where we think we need to put a little more promotional work behind, we're working on that right now. But, overall, we're happy with it. One of the decisions that we made to think about from an Orlando perspective is understanding the traffic that we were carrying through Fort Lauderdale on a connect basis already. So, we saw the opportunity in front of us, we're able to carry a lot of that traffic now on nonstop out of Orlando, and then we'll be able to back fill the Fort Lauderdale seats with other flow throughout our network as well as the Fort Lauderdale local passenger. So, overall, it's a big incremental push to the network. And what it also allows is for customers to be able to piece different kinds of itineraries together. They can go nonstop out of Orlando south and then maybe connect through Fort Lauderdale going home if that's how their schedule meets for them. One last thing I'd like to say about that is, as we start in Orlando, we're starting it off to the international destinations in the same way we start off a lot of routes, which is some of them are day of week where we're not going every day to most of these destinations. That allows us to build the network, build the presence, and allow us to grow off of that in future periods. So that's sort of the strategy behind how we came up with that and, right now, we like what we're seeing.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Thanks. And then just for my follow-up with respect to the 2Q CASM ex performance relative to the initial guidance. Obviously, you had an easy comp there and maybe some conservatism. But could you provide some detail on the line items that actually surprised you to the upside given a better operation? Thank you.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Sure, Duane. So, as we mentioned in our investor update, about 100 basis points of the improvement is shift going to the fourth quarter. But, beyond that, we saw market improvement across the lines in the income statement due to better operational performance. So, first of all, as you deliver on the top line ASM production from a completion factor perspective, which this operating group did better than we've ever seen, you're just going to get better unit throughput across every line. And then, with less and less disruption, we see improvement in overtime, so salaries, wages, and benefits. We see it in ground handling related expense, which follows through our other operating line. We see it in interrupted trip related expense, which is in our other operating line. We see it in maintenance and repairs because we have, at times, had to ship parts throughout the system and pay freight when we're avoiding that type of expense. And so, it's really \u2013 we've alluded to this before. It has tendrils throughout the cost structure. And better operational performance is going to drive better cost performance across the board. And Bob said it earlier; this is the kind of setup that we believe translates well into the future. We still have room to improve this as we refine our own staffing models, the way we look at bases, the way we look at training, all of those things now, we have a better handle on how this operation can work and it's going to help us deliver on cost line going forward.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Helane Becker.\nHelane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: Great. Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Ted, that was actually a really good response to part of my question, which was actually related to as you think about expanding operations next year, right? You're talking about adding growth and maintaining that strong operational performance. Can you do that? Have you thought about how you'd do that successfully?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: We have.\nHelane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: I mainly ask because, once before, you guys went down this path of focusing on improved operations and then you kind of slipped back. So, just making sure you're not going down that path again.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: No. Appreciate that, Helane. Okay. Bob wants to...\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: We'll go back to the beginning. We did have an issue last year, but that was almost all tied to labor. We have made since May of 2016, basically, every month has been better than the comparable month adjusted for that period of two months last year. And it's not just words. We actually had to reduce our utilization initially to begin to make the improvements we had and establish a baseline in the airline. And again, when you're generally not running \u2013 when you're running in the 60s or low 70s, there's a lot of things that are not right ultimately and it creates a lot of adverse cost. And once you begin to create stability, quite frankly, then all of a sudden, you can start to fix and make fundamental improvements. And we're only about halfway through the process. We just implemented the new agreement \u2013 new pilot agreement in the first quarter. We haven't implemented the pref bid system yet. That's still many months away. And quite frankly, what we're finding is, as we become better planned, we were using one less spare this summer than we thought we needed because we see more quality in the operation. Certainly, not all months will be good depending on weather can drive big changes. But I think we've made fundamental shifts in what we have in terms of what we have for people. Our OCC environment is dramatically different in terms of how we operate, in terms of the tools, the standards that we have. It's \u2013 I think if you kind of go back, Helane, to some of the stuff in my past, it becomes a habit of running well. And you can always have a bad month. But, ultimately, once you put the ingredients in place and once you have standards in place, I think this trajectory should continue. Very confident about that. Again, it's not accidental. We said we were going to do it and its happening. And like I said, the only surprise is it probably took us six months longer because we had to go through a few operational issues last summer tied to some labor issues. But the trend is well intact.\nHelane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC: That's great. Thanks, Bob. Excuse me. Sorry. I don't know what's wrong with my voice. Thanks very much. I appreciate it the answer.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Linenberg.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Two ones here. Bob, on some prior calls, I know you had mentioned that part of the operational constraints that you saw in some of your big airports was the fact that you didn't have enough gates. And as I recall, you started to rattle off airports where you saw an opportunity to get additional gates, one to improve the ops. And I'll point to Orlando. That was one that, for a very long time, you were targeting additional gate space. It sounds like you got it since you're going to do the build-out this fall to, I guess, 11 plus markets or so. So, where are you now? What airports do you feel like you're still constrained and can't get space? And as we look out over the next year, what airports do you actually see where you're going to probably get up some additional space?\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: So, generally speaking, let's just say in bigger airports, gate space is really tight. And if you look at places like O'Hare or Atlanta or even at Dallas, there's not a whole lot of gates available. And maybe there's one here or there before the next construction project. I think the biggest constraint for us is New York. We have a gate in Newark. And so we can only get so big there. We have two in LaGuardia. We'd like to be bigger in New York, New York. It makes a lot of sense because if you have additional flights in New York, you can do a lot more things outside New York. So those become a key. Fort Lauderdale is a growth opportunity, but it's also tight. I think if you listen to a lot of calls, there's a lot of carriers talk about growing Fort Lauderdale. There's not enough real estate there for everybody to do what they want to do. And it's part of the reason why our initiative in Orlando becomes even more important. So, right now, what we do like the fact is we don't have all our eggs in one basket. It's kind of by design. We have \u2013 again, we have 20-some odd cities with more than 25 today, some much more than that. And we have a few others that's kind of knocking on the door. So we have an opportunity to pick and choose. And that's what we plan on doing. So, again, and sometimes you have to wait to get the next gate at an airport in maybe three years. And what we do like is the fact that we find in a number of opportunities. An opportunity that we didn't use in the past was that we used to fly mostly single daily, but we have quite a few markets today where we go double daily because that may be the better opportunity than a new market. So we feel pretty comfortable about the diverse nature. And, like I said, we like the optionality because of the size of the network. Okay?\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Great. Just one quick follow-up just to Matt. You mentioned Cancun. Did you say that that was 100-basis-point headwind to RASM in the third quarter? And I was just curious like how much \u2013 what does Cancun represent of your system? Like percentage of ASMs or seats? It seemed like...\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Mike. So \u2013 yeah. You did hear that correctly.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: It's about 2% of our overall capacity. So, what we're seeing right now is a different booking curve. We are seeing a different passenger makeup there as well. And what's happening is demand, at least for us, demand is coming in but it's coming in late and it's basically not willing to pay the prices that it's paid in the past right now. There's been a lot of travel advisories for Cancun and other Mexican destinations. But, for us, the most impactful is Cancun for sure. And those travel advisories have been out there all year. They've been updated up and down. But it continues to be an issue for us and it's something that we think will eventually resolve itself, but it is that much of a drag on our third quarter expectations.\nMichael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Certainly.\nOperator: The next question is from Hunter Keay.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, good morning.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Hey, Hunter.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey. So, are you seeing a relationship between an improved product or brand or general sort of likability of Spirit and how far out your customers book tickets? Maybe you're not being viewed as like an airline of like last resort, like a backup option for people. I'm kind of \u2013 I have a follow-up for that too. I'm kind of curious to know if there's a relationship between sort of like the duration or length of the booking curve and how you're perceived from a brand perspective.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Hunter, I'll make a comment. And we've said this before. We know there are instances and it's been more noticeable of late where our price point is no longer the lowest price point in the market. And we're selling at those fares. So that would indicate to me that our product and our timing of the flight and our reliability is lending itself to a certain consumer. Remember that the drive all along was always to improve operational reliability to drive cost savings and deliver a quality good. The upside from a revenue perspective may be there. And there are at least indications that it's true. But, beyond that, it's tough to see direct effect on booking curve. It's just tough to measure.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah. And I also know you made some strategic choices around driving loads last year at this point, so maybe that's making that noisy a little bit, but I guess, the nature of the question is, if you get more people that like your product and they're willing to book a reasonable fare that they think is a fair value early in the thought process of taking a trip and you fill up your plane a little bit earlier, does that give you more tactical ability to manage closing yields as...\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Absolutely.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: ...you have an improvement in your brand? Okay.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Absolutely. Yeah. That's true regardless. And I think that is a lever point. I think Matt maybe wants to add a comment here.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah, Hunter, one of the things that we \u2013 I know this going to sound a little bit from a marketing answer, but the reality is, we think our guests think about the value they receive as the experience the receive divided by the price. So, as the experience improves and the experience goes up, that would allow the price to float up over time because the value they're receiving will be improving along the way. So I know that's a bit of a marketing answer to your question, but that's how we think about it and that does allow for different kinds of customers who wouldn't \u2013 we wouldn't have been in their \u2013 even in their consideration set in the past. We're now in their consideration set. So, it'll take time. Brand reputation repair takes time for that to flow through to everyone. But it's happening and we're seeing some early signs of that in the way that we see our customer satisfaction numbers.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah. And you feel you have the RM tools set from an IT perspective to take advantage of that changing dynamic?\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah. So that's a great question. So, we are actively and have been for a couple of years and, really, in the last six to nine months, have really been able to hone in better on how we think about revenue management in this environment. And the environment, as Ted alluded to, is one in which, at times, we're now able to sell higher price tickets than our competitors. And that's got to be reputation and brand related. And for us to be able to do that means we have to have different thoughts around revenue management, taking risk and making sure that we're confident in taking that risk. And we're building tools and putting the right people in place to be able to really leverage that. And that's the improvements that we've been talking about. We're now starting to see some of that come through.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks, Matt.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jamie Baker.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning. On the international push, are you prepared to say yet whether international is more profitable than domestic? The reason I ask is that I would imagine ex-Cancun that it very well could be. I'm just trying to think about how margins progress over time as the international component continues to grow.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Sure, Jamie. It's Ted. Yeah. The reason we've had a decided effort to find more international gateways and build out the international network is the international markets generally do better these days, and we've been pushing to find those opportunities in Lauderdale. But, obviously, Orlando is complementary to that, and Matt discussed earlier. And then we're finding one-off and two-off launching pads elsewhere in the network as well, be it Newark or Detroit or Chicago or those kind of things. So, yes, I think that has been a deserted effort to push the percentage of flying towards international because those markets do very well.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Helpful.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: And Jamie, the only other piece is actually \u2013 I get it. They're going to \u2013 there's a limit to the size of it. But, structurally, we're actually better to compete because we actually \u2013 our network looks more traditional in a sense, and we can really, ultimately, carry a lot more connections of like, let's say, Fort Lauderdale. I mean the predominant number of our connections ultimately go through Fort Lauderdale. So we also \u2013 not only do we \u2013 are we able to do it with a low cost, we kind of get a structural benefit of flow, which creates a lot of optionality from a revenue perspective.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah. That's right. And if I could just add to that, Jamie, at the end there, is it's also how we've established our international footprint over time. It's not something out of Fort Lauderdale that we just threw down. It's been developing over time. We're reaching communities and joining communities together with a lot of what we call VFR traffic, visiting friends and relatives traffic. That is also going to be a little less seasonal and a little less constrained by economic environment as well because that kind of traffic wants to go back and forth to see friends and relatives. So it's something that we really positioned our self well here in Fort Lauderdale. We know there's a tie between Orlando and a lot of these communities as well in Latin America and the Caribbean. And we think we're positioned uniquely to be able to take advantage of a lot of those opportunities that perhaps others may not have the same kind of success rate on.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Excellent. And just a quick follow-up. Just over the last couple of months, has the competition you face in OA hubs changed at all? And I'm not asking you to name names. I'm just wondering if the competitive behavior is the same in each hub regardless of who dominates it or if there's been any divergence recently. One airline might compete with you in its hubs versus how another airline does it in their hubs. Or is it just all uniform?\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Right. So, it's the summer and everything's relatively strong with summer demand right now. And we're most concerned about what are the selling fares that carriers are offering. Having said that, there's definitely some personalities within each hub and it can be across different carriers as well. So I do think that there is concerted efforts going on to think about peak demand. And as we get out of the peak and as we head into the shoulder, we anticipate there will be some changes. And I know there's a lot of pricing activity that's been going on. I think a lot of it's been constructive from our perspective in what we're seeing. And then, as we get out of the peak into the shoulder and into the off-peak, we'll then see how the inventory trends may change by hub. So, it's sort of a \u2013 there's a lot of pricing activity going on, Jamie, but at the same time, there's a lot of inventory constrain that we're seeing in the peak right now.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Thanks very much for the answers. Appreciate it, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Crissey.\nKevin Crissey - Citigroup: Good morning. Thank you very much for the time. I wanted to follow up on basically your answer there. It's more of a general question, but I guess, obviously, you'll answer it from Spirit's perspective. But do airlines staff and fleet to their peaks and then kind of use the assets and people to kind of look at off-peaks as cheap utilization? Obviously, I'm hoping that you're not really doing that, but if you look at the way the capacity changes are made industry-wide in the face of higher fuel, the responses are all in the off-peak periods. Everyone protects their revenue in the peak periods. And I'm just wondering whether the cost structures and the businesses are built around peaks or are they built around the average for the year. Thank you.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah, Kevin, it's a great question. We can speak specifically to ourselves because I think we're better suited to. I think the way \u2013 as a growth airline, it's not as black and white as it would be for a more stable operation, which is the idea that you're espousing, which is hiring to the peak or the shoulder. We're growing and so we're adding \u2013 we're having to add the necessary resources to fly that next possible 15% of opportunity at all times. I think what we do is we flex efficiency more in the peak to \u2013 which would imply, by the way, that we're not hiring to the peak. We're pushing our assets harder in the peak and the resources around those assets such that we don't suffer as much from a cost perspective in the off-peak. And so the implication there is that we tend to target more of an average. It's harder to draw the line because we are a growth airline, but remember, that our primary asset and our primary focus is our cost structure. And that's true in September, and it's true in July. And so that means we have to be a little bit more efficient with what we're flying in July such that we can make September work. And hopefully, that at least gives you some perspective as to how Spirit addresses the issue. I can't speak for slower growth airlines, however.\nKevin Crissey - Citigroup: Yeah. Thanks. I can appreciate the difference. I guess then why don't airlines cut their capacity in the summer? I get that they're fill and worried about spilling traffic, but it seems like that is a protected sacred cow, you can't do it. Is it just that's so wildly profitable that you, the industry is willing to absorb lower margins in those periods?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: The answer is yes. The summer is wildly profitable and does well, and so there would be no reason, at least from our perspective, to be trimming capacity in the summer. Remember that there's a lot of things that influence how we add our resources, the timing of those resources. Our delivery timings can have an impact on that. If they're all bunched together at one particular time, it forces us to do certain things. And so, the idea here is for us to drive earnings growth. And we do that definitely in the peak, and we manage through it in the shoulders and the off. And that's the way we think about our business.\nKevin Crissey - Citigroup: Thank you so much for the time.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Joseph DeNardi.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, hey. Good morning. Ted, just want to talk about some of the capacity plans for next year. You just mentioned that, I guess, your cost structure is one of your most valuable assets. Is that influencing kind of your rate of growth and what gives you confidence that that level of growth isn't going to lead to kind of these very choppy, unpredictable revenue environments that we've seen over the past couple of years? Acknowledging that it's slower growth than what you've had recently.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah. The answer is no. We grow into the opportunity and we think a lot, Joe, about the rate and pace at which we tackle that opportunity. And I think reflective of that is this look at 2019, which admittedly is less than we've been growing over the last six years. I think if you just took a straight average of the last six years of our growth rate, I think you'd come up with a number that's around 21%. And so, we take into account all factors when we think about our growth rate. We're a bigger airline today than when we were six years ago. We have a good feel of our ability to deliver the growth, to train the people, to select the markets. And so, when we take that all into account, we arrive at a growth rate based on the opportunity. We manage our costs regardless. And I think that's indicative of our view on next year. We're going to grow considerably less next year than this year and we're still targeting around up 1% to flat CASM. And that's the way we manage our business. So it's opportunity and then management costs around it. And that's \u2013 I think that's the difference, by the way, between a low-cost carrier and not one.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Yeah. I'm tempted to ask Matt about the credit card opportunity, but I just want to follow up with you, Ted. Even with slower growth next year, your CASM advantage relative to the industry is probably going to grow again. Is there a point at which it gets wide enough so that you start to manage capacity for your CASM to grow more in line with your peers and that would allow you to get a little bit more control over the pricing environment?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Well, it's a great point, Joe, and one that I've talked a lot about as the airline matures. And I don't know exactly \u2013 you've heard me use that word before. I don't know exactly when we hit it. But, at some point, we will reach a point where our growth rate will \u2013 it will continue to taper as the airline gets bigger and our objective over that time was to manage to be a low-cost business. And once that's true, any growth, any marginal growth, that doesn't eat up all inflationary expense just moves you in line with the rest of the business. We're just going to be dramatically lower than everyone else. And that's the starting point that we're setting up. So that's not next year, that's not the year after, that's not for a while because the opportunity's too big. But that's the objective is to be a long-term, low-cost business that can maintain a wide and widening advantage against its peers.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan McKenzie.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. 22 unencumbered aircraft. What is the right number to have as you think about your fleet?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Well, right now it's 22. So, we made tactical decisions here, Dan, to purchase aircraft off-lease for a variety of reasons. We thought it was a good capital deployment decision, we thought it was a good CASM decision, and also we thought it was a good flexibility decision. These were all aircraft that are reaching towards the end of their original lease term or extended lease term and it creates the flexibility we want. And as we've alluded to earlier, we're in the midst of a fleet evaluation process right now that will outline what the fleet looks like beyond 2021 and I think these aircraft act as swing airplanes during that process, at least them alone and perhaps others, but these specifically because we now have direct flexibility. We can choose to keep them or not and we are not encumbered to anyone else. And so I think we feel good about that number, by the way. And we will evaluate other opportunities to change that, either to reduce the number or to increase it. But, right now, this is the right spot to be.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then just going back to some of the earlier questions, the plans for 2019, increased utilization, how many percentage points of growth is it adding? And just separately, as we think about the CASM-RASM relationship, how do we size that margin contribution at the system level?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Well, I'll try to \u2013 from a utilization perspective, Dan, we really bottomed out from a utilization perspective towards the second half of last year, and we talked about improvement to that number, and we're seeing it right now. Fleet utilization now is, on a trailing six, I think we're above 12.3 or 12.4 hours per day. And I think there's further opportunity. You can just take percentage points off of that. Our previous peak utilization was in the very high 12s. I don't know if we ever get back to that, by the way. But, at some point, it's a percent in utilization is a percent in capacity. And so, I wouldn't slice and dice the 14 hours per day that we're looking at next year in the utilization or deliveries yet because that's all still getting kind of sifted out. So that's the way it would work. That's the math.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And the CASM-RASM relationship, the margin contribution?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Can you clarify the question, Dan?\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah. As you flex utilization flying, obviously, it helps drive down lower non-fuel costs, also results in lower unit revenues, and as you just kind of think about that dynamic, the incremental profit that it generates, how do we think about the materiality of that at the system level?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Well, the premise is generally true, by the way. Higher utilization is going to come with CASM advantage and RASM dilution. The only caveat I would add to that is that when you can add peak utilization, it's theoretically not necessarily going to be as dilutive or dilutive at all to RASM because you're flying when your RASMs are above average. And that's where we're focused, is how can we get more and more utilization in the peak? Admittedly, the goal overall of this business is to get the earnings to grow. And off-peak flying contributes to that, by the way. We do it today and we will continue to look at it. So, I think the trade-off that you just mentioned is a quick summary of how you evaluate peak and off-peak flying. And as long as it's contributing to EPS in the right way, we will do that. And we do it today and we adjust accordingly. So, the only caveat I'd say is that utilization flying doesn't necessarily have to be dilutive to RASM.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Just to beat this to death, we could run our utilization dramatically higher in a month like September, dramatically higher. In fact, the primary reason why our long-term utilization won't get back to where it was five years ago has nature of competitive dynamics. But September is a less-than-average revenue month and in those kind of months extra capacity can be very dilutive at the end of the day. And I think, what we're trying to do, we're trying to do a better job and we thought we were doing a better job last year, but didn't do it as well as we thought. We think we'll make many more improvements in the off-peak this year that will have a \u2013 we'll be better close to the right mix this year. And if you watch what we did with our schedules, I think it was pretty comprehensive what we did. A lot of east-west flying that didn't work out all that well for us. And a lot of new capacity went into, let's say, the southeastern part of the U.S. and an international expansion, which is probably much greater both short and long term opportunity. Okay?\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Brandon Oglenski.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I'll just keep it to one. But, Ted, given the fact that you've committed to, call it, growing in the low-teens next year, and I think you said at a conference recently that you target a mid-teens profit margin longer term, should we be thinking that you're managing towards that level of profitability in the 2019 plan? And if not, like, what are the headwinds that remain in the business?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Sure, Brandon. What we've said, and I believe I've probably reiterated at a conference, is that we target opportunities with mid-teens margin opportunity. The prevailing market, the competitive environment, fuel prices, always have a discrete effect on those. But we're building this business for the long term and we still target those opportunities with mid-teens and whether or not they materialize in the first month will depend on the competitive environment and a bunch of different inputs. So, objectively, we're always looking to push the organization forward from a margin perspective. I think Bob alluded to the fact that we like the trend that we're seeing. It may come in nibbles and bites, but it's definitely headed in the right direction. We have understanding of and stability on the cost side now that I think we didn't fully have over the last couple years, couple three years. And so now we can say with confidence this is the business we're running, these are the opportunities we're looking to tackle, and how do we optimize at the margin? Which comes with some of what we were describing in the prior answer, which is network flexibility, seasonality adjustments, off-peak and peak flying changes. And so, we're pushing the organization for the margin and earnings growth. And I'll say that again because that's where this business has to be. We've got to be focused on delivering on that line.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Appreciate it.\nDeAnne Gabel - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Ellen, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Question comes from Rajeev Lalwani.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Good morning.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Hey, Rajeev.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Matt, I actually have a couple of questions for you. On the RASM side, I think you're something like 15%, 20% below your prior peak and correct me if I'm wrong there, but the question is, with fuel where it is now, with competition starting to maybe ease a bit, is there an opportunity for you to recapture that over the next year or two. It seems like the legacies are making some pretty good progress there. Just trying to figure out if it's a realistic goal or not.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Rajeev, so the way that we see the industry and some of what we're seeing from capacity moves and some of the things that we anticipate that we're going to see out there is that we'll continue to see some incremental improvements. I think we probably talked about it a little here on the call this morning, which is thing \u2013 we like the momentum, we like how things are moving. I cannot predict exactly what the environment's going to look like in the future. I know what's in front of us now and I know what we anticipate to see. But to understand what things are going to look like two or three or four years from now is really difficult for me to understand. So, I don't know that I can really fully answer your question that way.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Maybe the other way to approach it. What sort of environment do you need to see to get back to where you were before? Do we domestic capacity growth of 2% a year, oil of $100 or so?\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: So I think, Rajeev let's just go back. We had an environment, I'm not sure you can pinpoint what created it, but basically, if you go back 2014, there was no price matching in the industry. None. And if you just kind of look at what was taking shape, United Continental was struggling through that combination. They're doing a much better job now. American had just got in the back \u2013 they're just kind of getting reorganized. Southwest was going through its digestion of AirTran. It was a completely different business. And we're not planning on that business taking place. The fact is we don't need numbers like that. $2 in pricing is big. $3 or $4 is a couple of margin points to begin to see improvement. And that's the way we're kind of looking at it. When the costs are stable, we can always debate where oil will be. $2 will make a huge difference and anything beyond that is really just gravy at the end of the day. I would make the point the route network is pretty well intact. We've got the key pieces in place. We're much improved. We had a lot of avoidance; the avoidance is disappearing. We've got positive flyers. So we have a lot of things moving for us and I think, at this point, the industry is going to start making its moves. We've got through a two and a half year change in how we do business and I think you're going to see other airlines do the same thing. And at some point, I think you're going to see positive improvements. And at the pace, we'll decide that, but I think I said we're happy with this kind of two and a half year journey we've gone through and we think we're set up pretty good.\nDeAnne Gabel - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: That's great. Thank you, Bob. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. That concludes our call for the day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. DeAnne Gabel. Ms. Gable, you may begin.\nDeAnne Gabel - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thank you, Elda, and welcome, everyone, to Spirit Airlines first quarter earnings call. Bob Fornaro, our Chief Executive Officer, will give a few brief opening comments; followed by Matt Klein, our Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, who will review our revenue performance and outlook; followed by Ted Christie, our President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our cost performance. We will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts following our prepared remarks. Also joining us in the room today are Thomas Canfield, our General Counsel; John Bendoraitis, our Chief Operating Officer; and other members of our senior leadership team. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call will be archived on our website for 60 days. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance or results and are based on information currently available and/or management's belief as of today, April 26, 2018. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our first quarter 2018 earnings release, which is available on our website, for the reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thanks, DeAnne, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Earlier today, we reported first quarter 2018 net income, adjusted for special items, of $29.9 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, and our operating margin at 7.3%. We ran a very good operation in the first quarter 2018, despite numerous winter storms. We achieved our best-ever first quarter DOT on-time performance of 83.4%. And we also achieved a record high March DOT on-time performance of 85.1%, an increase of 10 percentage points year-over-year. I congratulate and thank the Spirit family for delivering this operational excellence. During the quarter, we finalized a new five-year contract with our pilot union. The new contract provides pilots increased benefits and wage rates and gives the company a platform for further improved operating efficiency and reliability. Our team has done a great job delivering improved reliability over the last several months, and we are committed to delivering strong operational performance on a consistent basis going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Matt and Ted to discuss our first quarter in more detail.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. From a revenue perspective, the quarter generally played out as we had expected. For the first quarter 2018, we reported total revenue of $704 million. Total revenue per available seat mile decreased 2.4% year-over-year, primarily driven by a 1.7% decrease in operating yields and a 4.1% increase in average stage length. The calendar shift of Easter benefited first quarter TRASM by approximately 200 basis points. Non-ticket revenue per passenger segment improved 5.9% year-over-year in the first quarter to $55.29. The largest driver of this year-over-year improvement in the first quarter was our bundled services offering. We are still in the early innings with our rollout of bundled services, introduced late last year, and we are very pleased with how well the offers are being received by our customers. We have other initiatives in the pipeline that we expect to deploy throughout this year and believe we still have upside from dynamically pricing existing ancillary items. As a reminder, as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidelines, non-ticket is comprised of non-fare passenger revenue as well as other revenue. A reconciliation of non-ticket revenue per passenger segment is provided in the tables in our earnings release. During the first quarter, we opened three new cities, including: Columbus, Ohio; Richmond, Virginia; and Guayaquil, Ecuador. As these new cities demonstrate, our goal over the next few years is to continue to diversify our network. We'll continue to have some growth in big cities, as that is where many of our customers live or want to visit. But we expect to be largely focused on adding service to popular leisure destinations. Additionally, there continues to be some near field international opportunities that our ULCC model allows us to uniquely serve in a profitable manner. The published fare environment remained similar to what we've been seeing over the last few quarters. However, as we head into the peak summer travel period, passenger demand looks strong. And we have taken action, using both price structure adjustments as well as revenue management techniques, in an effort to drive yields higher. Turning to capacity, we estimate ASMs for the second quarter 2018 will increase approximately 29% year-over-year. Given the significant increase in fuel of late, we are planning to redeploy several lines of flying after the peak summer period in a manner that we believe will allow us to better capture revenue to help offset increased fuel costs. These network changes will reduce our ASM production in the last four months of the year. Including these changes, we estimate a year-over-year capacity increase of 26% in the third quarter, 13% to 15% in the fourth quarter, for a full-year 2018 estimate of about 22.5%. Now, turning to our revenue outlook for the second quarter 2018, as a reminder, we are facing a relatively tough year-over-year unit revenue comparison due to holiday timing. Based on the current trends we are seeing, we estimate our total RASM for the second quarter 2018 will be down between 6.5% and 7.5%, year-over-year. This incorporates the couple of hundred basis point impact related to the calendar shift of Easter as well as a 350 basis point impact related to our 7.7% increase in stage length. In addition to diversifying our network and adapting to changes in the operating environment, we remain focused on driving non-ticket revenues higher. And we are confident we can continue to grow our non-ticket revenue per segment over the next couple of years. With that, here's Ted to discuss our cost performance and second quarter cost outlook.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thanks, Matt. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a busy first quarter, and I want to thank our team members for their contributions to our results and encourage them to keep up the good work. First quarter 2018 CASM ex-fuel decreased 5% year-over-year to 5.33 cents. The decrease year-over-year was primarily driven by lower aircraft rent per ASM. As Bob mentioned, throughout the quarter, we had outstanding operational performance. And this contributed to a better-than-expected outcome for CASM ex-fuel for the quarter. One area of improvement I'd like to highlight is our reduction in interrupted trip expense, which was down almost 30% year-over-year on a dollar basis, or down 42% on a per ASM basis. Regarding fleet, we took delivery of five new A321ceo aircraft and one new A320ceo aircraft, ending the quarter with 118 aircraft in our fleet. Recently, we announced that we are purchasing 14 A319 aircraft off-lease and terminating the underlying lease agreements, many of which extended into 2022. Effective March 31, 2018, the lease agreements associated with these aircraft will be classified as capital leases on the balance sheet, until the closing of each individual sale. All transactions are anticipated to be completed prior to June 30, 2018. Given the current fuel and operating environment, we are now targeting to grow at the low end of our 2019 guide or about 13%, and have secured seven additional A320neo aircraft delivering in late 2018 and early 2019 to support that target. These fleet moves give us the necessary aircraft and flexibility we need to pursue our growth through 2021. As for our cost outlook, for the second quarter 2018, we estimate CASM ex-fuel will be down 7.5% to 8.5%. For full-year 2018, we are projecting CASM ex-fuel will be down 3% to 4% year-over-year. We estimate CASM ex will be down mid-single digits in the third quarter and up low single-digits in the fourth quarter. Outstanding cost performance in 2018 creates a slightly tougher comparison for 2019. Nonetheless, when you look at the two-year performance, we expect to deliver down CASM ex over a two-year period that includes the pilot deal and lower growth rate in 2019. I'm very happy with that result. In closing, we are committed to generating earnings growth, regardless of fuel price or competitive environment. Our goal is to build a business that makes us an even stronger competitor. The team is doing a great job sourcing additional ancillary revenue. And we continue to hold the line on non-fuel costs, all while delivering improved operational performance and better customer satisfaction metrics. In addition to basic blocking and tackling, I believe these fundamentals provide the platform to compete well in any environment and to drive earnings growth. With that, I'll turn it back to DeAnne.\nDeAnne Gabel - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thank you, Bob, Matt and Ted. Elda, we are now ready to take questions from the analysts. We do ask that you limit yourself to one question, with one related follow-up.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Hunter Keay.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, good morning. Ted, I'm going to ask you two questions. The second one's a follow-up because I just want to clarify something I heard. But also, did you say that you are dedicated to driving earnings growth? Is that a new line that you guys have inserted into the script? I don't recall you talking about that before. Is that something you're going to plan on going forward from here on year-in, year-out?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Oh, no, Hunter. That's not new.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Oh, right, sorry.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: We talk about that all the time. So, go ahead, yeah.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: You talk about it all the time? Okay. Great.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Well then, never mind. And then, did you say the 2019 and 2018 CASM ex together would be down year-on-year? I'm sorry.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah, that is what I said, exactly what I said. So, as I said, the guide for 2018 is down 3% to 4%. And we have been having a great operational performance thus far, and we expect that to continue. So that does improve that, meaning that baked in there is a better operational airline. So, it makes the comp a little bit tougher for 2019. But that factoring in, plus the fact that we've done this aircraft-related transaction, which we also know contributed to the benefit. So, you start to lap some of that next year. Net-net, we're still going to be down over that period. And I feel really good about that.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: I just want to make sure nothing got incrementally worse about the 2019 outlook. You're just saying that the comp got a little bit harder, which is why you're putting it that way.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah, that's right. That's exactly right.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Okay, I'm good. Thank you.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: You got it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.\nMichael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hey. Two questions here, so, when you look at the sort of the non-ticket revenue versus the passenger revenue or the fare, ancillary versus the fare, it does look like that's higher. And I'm not sure if this is the first time it's higher. And I was just curious. Is that being driven by just the change in accounting? Is that part of it or is that really we're seeing an inflection point in that area? And, as you mentioned, Ted or Bob or Matt, the strength of the bundled product starting to have an impact on that number.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Right. So, generally speaking, the ancillary number, the non-ticket number, is moving up with not only the products, like we mentioned, but also the revenue management techniques we're applying to non-ticket as well. Ultimately, our goal is to also keep pushing up, where we can, the passenger yields as well. So in the meantime, that's how the breakdown is shaking out. But we expect there is upside on both of those numbers in the future as the years go by.\nMichael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: And, Mike, so just to summarize, I think the ancillary number had been dropping since about 2015. And it's finally started to turn. It's been mostly new initiatives. And I think we've said somewhere that we expect the full-year to be above $55 and maybe that \u2013 so in every quarter, but we'll end the year certainly above that number. So, I think you're going to see a healthy increase throughout the year.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: And, Mike, one clarification, this is Ted. The accounting impact is almost zero, little to nothing. So this is really just raw performance. It doesn't have to do with that.\nMichael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Great. Thanks. And then, just my second question and this is little bit of a mirco airline question. Bob, I'm going to address it to you. You look at the market Akron-Canton and that's a market that you guys went into, I don't know, a year, 1.5 year ago and we saw both Allegiant and Southwest leave that market. And I just thought it was interesting a market that you know very well more recently, it did look like you were scaling back pretty materially in that market. And I'm curious. Have the dynamics in that market changed or is it just the availability of ultra-low-cost carrier competition in markets nearby, like Cleveland, maybe sort of permanently reducing the long-term demand opportunities in a market like Akron-Canton. Because I know when you went into that, the fact that your two competitors left, it seemed like that there was huge upside there. And it just seems like that it hasn't played out as at least from sort of the superficial perspective, it hasn't played out as maybe as what we thought it would. What's your thoughts on that?\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: I think it's a good question. You've got a lot of the pieces right. I think Southwest was leaving anyway. And they barely had any service in there. And I think their exit from Akron-Canton was planned well before we announced our service. I'm just guessing there, but I think I have to say when there is that much low-fare service in Cleveland.\nMichael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: A little bit by Allegiant, a lot by Frontier, and a lot by Spirit, there's just too much low-fare. And we weren't willing, even amongst ourselves, to drop the Cleveland service. So I think it was a situation where, historically, there is an area \u2013 there is an overlapping service area between those communities. And with all the low-fare service, including ours, in Cleveland, it's shifting the market back towards Cleveland. And it was impacting our results in both cities. So our plan is to stay in Akron at a reduced level and make more adjustments. And so that's the way it's going to end up. It's, again, I can just chalk it up to an overwhelming supply of low-fare seats in Cleveland. Okay?\nMichael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, that explains it. Thanks. Thanks, everyone. Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Hey, thanks. Your 2019 growth rate, any thoughts on that and do you have the order book in place with the extension of these 319s to deliver that growth rate?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Hey, Duane. Yeah, the growth rate we're targeting right now, around 13% next year. And, yes, the answer to the question is, with the addition of, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, seven aircraft scheduled to deliver in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year. That, coupled with the ongoing fleet that we have and the adjustments we've made, puts us in line to deliver upon that growth target.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: I think I just would add one question there. I'd say, prior to oil moving up to $70, we'd probably been on the higher end of that. But we think this is a more appropriate number, where we're heading with fuel prices down slightly.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Thanks. Any early thoughts on 2019 CapEx, given that outlook?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Nothing to share specifically right now. But as we get closer, as we normally do throughout the cadence, give you an update on that. As I mentioned, the new aircraft that we've added to the fleet, those are operating leases delivered from a lessor. So no change in formal CapEx as it relates to those.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: And then just to stay on the A319s, did you have maintenance deposits? Obviously, we see the headline figure for the consideration. But did you have maintenance deposits accrued against those aircraft? So, what was the net purchase price? I'm not sure you've disclosed that.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yes, we did. We had maintenance and other deposits on with that lessor. And you're right. We haven't talked about it specifically. But I can tell you there is an amount, and it's not insignificant, that gets applied against that purchase price. We're still going to have an incremental amount that we're going to look at potentially financing. We haven't discussed the vehicle we add for that. But more to come on how we decide to do that and what it is. I think the net effect, though, from a leverage perspective, is the way you calculate operating lease as part of your overall leverage. Right now, the way we see things, it's neutral to positive.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thank you very much.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: All right.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jack Atkins. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Matt, just to kind of go back to the non-ticket side for a moment. You're obviously very encouraged there. It sounds like there's more to come. I guess, when would you really expect to see the initiatives around more dynamic pricing really begin to kick in there to sort of drive incremental upside to what you've been seeing earlier this year?\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: So Jack, thanks for the question. We're already seeing some of the benefits of it. But we're in the early stages of it. So just \u2013 it's a little nuance. But as you talk about revenue management techniques, there's a lot of testing and learning that goes on. So I think we're starting to recognize and realize some of those benefits now. As we move forward, and as our technology and thoughts around the overall process continue to improve, I'd expect we'll continue to see improvement there. So, I'm not going to pin down on an exact date, because it's really a fluid kind of learning experience. As you get better at it, then the numbers improve.\nJack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Got you. Okay. Great. And then, Ted, going back to the 14 A319s that you guys bought off of lease, are there other opportunities to do that with the fleet, as you look forward over the next couple of years, just some low-hanging fruit there that you guys can capture, as you look out?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Well, over the last two years, we've taken advantage of a couple of opportunities. I think we have eight aircraft today that are on the balance sheet unencumbered. And so, we've dabbled in that market for a while. As I mentioned to you guys at length, we're a much smarter acquirer of and consumer of aircraft capital these days. And we have a good feeling for residual value and how we plan to use those aircraft. And the flexibility that having those aircraft on our balance sheet creates is a good thing. And so, the answer to your question is, we're always going to evaluate those opportunities. Of course, there has to be two to tango. So someone has to be a willing seller. But we think over time, and I wouldn't put a date on it either, there are still opportunities to do more of that, yes.\nJack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brandon Oglenski.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. So, Ted, I guess this is just more of a longer term view on the business, but given the fact that your costs have come up on the labor side, and we're facing higher fuel this year, but do you think long-term profitability in this business, at least for you guys, can go back to mid-teens or even higher in terms of EBIT margins or are we structurally lower in terms of profitability looking forward?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Well, it's a great question. And clearly, we're not hitting that target right now, where things sit. But the way we evaluate market opportunities, Brandon, is that we're always looking to target that type of opportunity. And so, to us, and I've said this before, the opportunity that exists is large, but the rate at which we consume that opportunity, the rate at which we deploy into it, is important. And because it affects your spool, it affects how much drag that new market may have or how long it is spooling. And so, we're going to tinker with that. And I think that active management will help us drive at the margin. And that coupled with, of course, the continued focus on ancillary, the continued focus on cost structure, gives this group a lot of confidence that we can actually start to push the margin back in the direction where we think those markets are targeted. And I don't know \u2013 it's not a boomerang. But we're optimistic about what we see over the coming years.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Well, Ted, I appreciate that, but I guess, if I interpret what you said, then maybe you're saying you need to address those opportunities a little bit slower going forward, and maybe not grow as fast. Is that the right takeaway?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: That's right. Yeah, I mean, we're growing 23% this year. Some of that is because of an easier comp, I guess, if you want to look at capacity that way, from what we faced last year with storms and some pilot disruption earlier in the year. But a 13% growth rate in 2019, I think, is going to be indicative. And we've already indicated that low to mid double digits is sort of target, falls right in line with that. I think that's less. If you just took a straight average of our growth rate over the last five years, it's around 20%. So, the answer to the question is yes.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: So, but, Brandon, just to go a little further, if you want to take \u2013 and this would be my reflection on this one. And so, you take the earlier part of the decade, where we had virtually no capacity increases across the industry, a lot of restructuring, a lot of putting companies together. Again, it was virtually nil almost over a many year time. And I view that as not permanent. Maybe perhaps others did. Now we're in a situation where domestic market is growing 4% to 6%, which is elevated. I think we're going to find a spot somewhere in-between those two. And that's where you're going to see improved profitability. I think either one of those ends, 4% to 6%, where we are now domestically versus nil for almost four years, neither of those were stable. And I think we're going to eventually move to a spot in-between. And, as Ted said, we've been growing for many years 20%-plus. We made a decision to grow in the low to mid-teens. So, we have the flexibility with our aircraft, particularly these A319s, to make adjustments. So, I think we have a lot more flexibility going forward in what we're going to do. And we are beginning to respond to the realities of the marketplace.\nBrandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Crissey. Please go ahead.\nKevin Crissey - Citi: Good morning. Thank you for the time. Can you talk about the characteristics of the markets that are doing better than those that are maybe doing less well?\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Sure, Kevin. This is Matt. Generally speaking, just like everything that we see from a supply and demand perspective, is generally the supply and demand is going to drive what's going on from a pricing perspective. And where we see elevated supply, in general, our results aren't quite as good, as we're seeing with less of a supply or capacity deployment. Not just from us, but from the industry in general. So generally speaking, it's not really a direct answer, but that's generally what we're seeing. What I'm not comfortable commenting on is specific markets or specific regions, per se. I think generally, though, you can probably take a look for yourself and see where capacity is elevated. And that's where we're going to have a little bit of an issue relative to other markets.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: And more broadly, when you think about it, we see a lot more competition, virtually everywhere today in comparison to a couple of years. So really, all markets are impacted when you have a generally more competitive industry. And I think you see, also in addition to that, new routes will build slowly. And so, that's a reason for slower growth as well. So, it's a combination of all markets and, again, a broader capacity increase, maybe we can call it excess capacity, all markets are impacted. And new markets take longer to hit their potential.\nKevin Crissey - Citi: Okay. Thank you. And as we think about you slowing the growth rate next year, how should we think about those new markets? Because I am of the opinion that many people underestimate the challenges created by new markets in terms of the financials and how long it can take to spool up. But a slowing growth rate could significantly have more routes maturing. Could you talk about your mix of new markets next year versus those that are maturing?\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: So, Kevin, you're hitting it right on the head. That's exactly how we think about it. And that's why we are looking at slowing slightly. Making sure that we have more of a mature mix into our route network, will improve our overall numbers, so, as Ted mentioned earlier, as we look for opportunities, they're out there. The question just is, what is the best way for us to consume them and what is the right cadence for us to do that.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: And also, I guess, as we think about routes as we go forward, it's not necessarily new routes, we may do less off-peak flying than we did in the latter part of 2017 going into 2018, because in a more aggressive capacity environment and oil getting higher, it perhaps may be some long-haul flying on our part may be too excessive. So, we're taking a look at all that as well. So, it's a combination of new routes. And it's a combination of some of the things that we were doing. We think there's always opportunities to improve on what you did and we think there's a number of them.\nKevin Crissey - Citi: And your stage length shouldn't have that year-over-year type of change again, right? Is that fair?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: I think, if anything, Kevin, it starts to come in. As what Bob just mentioned, some of the things we evaluate will be new route deployment. The peak, (29:32) obviously, next year is going to be a natural tailwind if you think about how many new routes you're deploying. But then also, as we look at some of the long-haul stuff, that's probably one of the areas we're going to be focused on. So I think, if anything, it'll come in some.\nKevin Crissey - Citi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Steven (sic) [Susan] (30:06) Donofrio.\nSusan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yes, good morning, Susan Donofrio.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Hi, Susan.\nSusan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hello, everybody. Just a quick question here on \u2013 just want to follow-up on your bundled offerings. You said they're selling well. I was just wondering if \u2013 should we be looking out for more partnerships, let's just say, with hotels or car rentals to maybe further drive this or am I not thinking about this right? And I'm just wondering where you are with your app, in terms of upgrading it and really driving revenues off of that?\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thanks, Susan. It's Matt here. So, we do believe we have opportunity to do more on we call the packaging side, when you think about hotel and car offerings. We do relatively okay today. But we do think there's opportunity there to do more. And when we think about bundled services, that has a lot to do with other pieces that we've unbundled in the product years and years ago. And one of the things that we talk about internally is making sure that we think of ourselves as a merchandiser and retailer of products, not necessarily just being an order taker of what do our customers want to purchase. So, we think there's opportunity there in thinking about how we merchandise on site. And then, I think your other question was regarding the app. So, our rollout of our app started fourth quarter last year. It has a lot of the basic functionality in it that we know our guests would like to utilize to help get through the airport experience faster. We also know that there's opportunity there for us to do a lot more with our app, again, thinking about how we merchandise in retail through the app, how we notify customers of opportunities. And there's examples of that as well in how we think about retailing, say, our BIG FRONT SEAT product. And when there's opportunity there, how we get those offers in front of our customers at the right time, it can be augmented quite well through the use of the app, as app adoption continues to improve as well.\nSusan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Certainly.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Good morning.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Morning, Joe.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Ted, if you were to look out over the next four to five years, what's the slowest rate at which you can grow and keep CASM ex flat? And I'm guessing that that rate is less than 13% to 15%. So, why is that rate not the kind of optimal growth rate for you that would allow you to kind of maximize margins and earnings?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yes. I understand the question. Thanks, Joe. Again, as I said earlier, we're seeing available market opportunities. We're looking to pursue those in whatever the right cadence is, depending on the market. So in boom times, obviously, we grew a lot faster, and we're managing that going forward. We don't grow to manage costs. We grow because there's an opportunity to pursue. And so, we're trying to optimize that from a return perspective. I think you're right, by the way. I think we could manage costs at a lower growth rate, if we wanted to, because...\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Do have a sense for what that is?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Well, I think it's dynamic, to be fair, because that's the way we manage our business. You could mathematically arrive at something, which I think would be irrelevant because we would adjust. We always adjust based on the input conditions of the business and what we're seeing from a competitive standpoint. So what's most important to us are two things. One is that we're growing in a manner that we think digests markets that are accretive to the business and delivering return. And so, making adjustments to that, which you're seeing us do right now in real-time, is an effort to kind of reflect what's happening in the competitive environment. And what's also important to us is managing the cost structure in a way that keeps us competitive. And that's clearly a focus on expanding our relative advantage against everyone else. And so, quite frankly, and I'm not suggesting this as an outcome, by the way, but if we felt that it was appropriate, we may grow in a way that might produce pressure on CASM ex, but we feel like that might be a really good thing from a return perspective. So that's why I say, what's most important to us is we're tackling markets in the right speed, in the right matter, that's delivering return. And so, I think, look, to answer your question, there's a mathematical answer as to what growth rate would produce a neutral CASM. But I think that, from our perspective, we're much more dynamic in the way we evaluate it. So, I wouldn't put a number on it.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then, Matt, it seems like maybe the messaging around which type of markets you guys are going to target over the next couple of years changed subtly. You talked about not as much large markets, more leisure destinations. Can you just maybe flush that out a little bit? Thank you.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Well, yeah. We can. It's going to be really a continuation of where we've seen strength and where we've been growing already, say, this year our growth to Orlando is notable. Our growth to Las Vegas is notable. We continue to grow in New Orleans. And we also see opportunity in some new, say, some new international destinations that we feel have opportunity for us as well. Our model allows us to really look at some destinations that we call near field international. We know the market here in South Florida really well. So, we know how to penetrate the market. We know our customer base here extremely well. And it allows us the opportunity through our network in Fort Lauderdale to really have opportunities that we feel are out there for us to exploit and look at growing into as we move forward. In terms of some of the longer haul flying that we put in place, as we look where fuel is today, some of the flying that we put in place works really, really well in the peak season. But once you get outside of the peak season, as the overall CASM moves up, if we can't push those costs off onto the passenger fare, then we have to reevaluate if that's the right place for us to put our assets. So, it's really as simple as that in terms of when we think out past the summer on how we're thinking about some redeployment and some of the route and how our network may change a little bit.\nJoseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning. With the pilot contract behind us, can you give us an update on timing, in terms of rolling out a preferential bidding system. I seem to remember that the contract gives you up to a year to choose the vendor. So, if that's correct, that implies that maybe the benefits are more of a second half 2019 event? And are said benefits already captured in the ex-fuel CASM guide that you gave? And thanks for clarifying that two year stack on that topic?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Sure, Jamie. John Bendoraitis is here, our COO. I'm going to have him answer first question for you.\nJohn Bendoraitis - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Hey, Jamie. You're correct in that we have about a one year target to implement the PBS. We've already formed the working committee, and they've already begun conversations with the various suppliers. And we hope to make a selection actually relatively soon from there. The group will be working together on the details and the rules of how we're going to implement the PBS. And so, I think in the industry, this kind of is a, call it, nine to 18 months window, depending on the carrier.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.\nJohn Bendoraitis - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: And I think we're very capable of doing 12 months or inside 12 months.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Perfect. And yes, go ahead, sorry.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: And then, Jamie, I think your second question was the benefits that are contemplated in our CASM ex. Is that correct?\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yes, so the answer is, yes. I will caveat that and say, to the best of our ability. So what I mean by that is, we have an expectation of what sort of incremental benefit we expect with regard to a pref bid system. But we also anticipate, and I've said this before, that we are running today and will run over time a better airline. And the benefits associated with that flow through multiple line items in the P&L. And we've done some investigation modeling. We understand our airline works pretty well in an attempt to reflect that. But I think that improves over time, to be honest with you. And so, it's hard to say for sure exactly when and what amount. But our expectation is that we've run a very challenged airline. We've done a great job with a difficult network. And now, we're able to run one with maybe both hands. And I think that's going to provide us with some natural benefit over time.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's excellent. And can I just confirm that there was no material pushback to last week's fare increase? Not asking about future pricing, obviously, just trying to confirm that the increase was taken by your competitors?\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Hey, Jamie. It's Matt. Yeah, we raised fares $3 late last week. And for the most part, from what we can see, our competitors also increased fares as well from a publicly fare available kind of data information.\nJamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Cool, just checking. Thanks a lot, everybody. Take care.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rajesh (sic) [Rajeev] Lalwani. Please go ahead.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Matt, a question for you, and I guess in basic economy, we've had them on the system now for about a year or so, can you talk about your ability to sort of get fares, do well with that sort of product out there? Is it keeping you from participating in some of the strength in close-in fares and the upside that some of your peers are seeing? Just some color there would be great.\nMatthew H. Klein - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Sure, Rajeev. It's Matt. So, let me go back to almost before basic economy was in the marketplace, is the low-fare environment has been in place for quite some time. The fact that basic economy got introduced by some of our competitors didn't really change the fare environment, per se. So what really has the impact from a booking perspective, not just for us but for anybody, is what fare levels are in the marketplace. And, for the most part, those published fare levels really haven't moved much by our competitors. How they price and how they make the decisions is completely up to them. I can tell you that, from our perspective, we are extremely active in making fare adjustments, in canceling fares that we don't want in the marketplace, that we don't think benefit our revenue production, we'll cancel those fares. And we do that frequently. And we'll also make other kinds of price adjustments, as we feel appropriate, to help us and help our revenue production. So, I think I should leave it there for now.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, Ted, a question for you, on the leverage side, I mean, your metrics have creeped up quite a bit over the last couple of years, just given ongoing CapEx and then what we're seeing in the fare and fuel environment. Do you have any thoughts going forward as to whether or not we sort of plateau from here? Does it continue to go up? And maybe any thoughts on like a target level?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Sure. So the leverage, it's really, there's three things impacting it. One is the numerator. The other is the denominator. But more importantly, also there is a bit of a mathematical optical effect of taking aircraft on balance sheet versus using operating lease financing. And for a company like ours, which, prior to 2015, really, we were exclusively financing our fleet using operating leases, to shift now to the point where we're a little bit more than half of the fleet is owned. And during that transition, it actually has a massive headwind to leverage. So I think that that's mostly optical, because the financing of CapEx is part of our growth strategy and how we choose to do it is based on return and investment. And so, in fact, if you kind of tried to unwind the way we finance our aircraft today and you just said, wow, and said we were going to use all lease financing, the leverage number's about flat. And so there is an impact to both sides of it, so I'm not suggesting there hasn't been an EBITDAR effect, too. But I think what's most important for us is trying to find the best possible source, from a cost perspective, in financing our aircraft. So going forward, we're clearly very comfortable at this leverage point, by the way. And I think that would've been true three years ago. And I think it's going to be true going forward, because of the vast majority what we do today is based on our growth. So it's based on our aircraft. And I don't put a hard cap on what the number is, but I can tell you that, based on what I know today and looking forward, we're going to be very comfortable from a leverage perspective, based on what the business can generate.\nRajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Daniel McKenzie from Buckingham Research.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Oh, hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, I'm wondering if you can put a little finer point on the growth opportunities. So, maybe a similar question asked a little bit differently, and I guess at the outset, I hear you with respect to less focus on the larger cities, less long haul, maturity in the core markets, ancillary, all things looking to drive margins here, but you throw in higher fuel and what does the actual opportunity set look like over the coming five years? And just with respect to that, I'm wondering if the spool is something like 15 new markets a year or 30? And the reason I'm asking this question is you had mentioned potentially network redeployment. So, I'm just curious if you could kind of help tie those loose ends together here.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah, certainly, Dan. This is Matt. So, the opportunity set is large and continues to be large. I don't really feel comfortable describing exactly where we're thinking about flying into, other than some of the high-level points we've already talked about, just from a competitive perspective. However, one of the things that we will continue to do, and we've been doing this, we're just going to do more of it, is think seasonally and think about how much we deploy in terms of how many departures per week we think about in certain markets. So there's opportunity for us to grow into more routes, grow into more markets and do that in a more diversified way and really a more risk-averse way, quite frankly. And that's one of the things that we think in this environment right now, as we adjust and make sure that we're thinking about what's happening in the industry, think is an appropriate pace for us to move and also an appropriate way for us to think about the opportunity set that's out there. So just to reiterate, the set's large. The question just is how quickly do we want to consume them and how do we enter the markets in a way that diversifies the risk and really mitigates the risk in terms of from the spooling up and getting to maturity faster.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. And if I could just maybe go back to your response and focus on one part of it and that's the seasonality, one thing that I don't think investors have thought about is sensitivity to a non-fuel CASM to utilization, but is there some degree of off-peak flying that you could trim, say, 15% or 10%, and still keep non-fuel costs flat or down or is that utilization flying in the off-peak period really a critical component to maintaining the non-fuel cost outlook?\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: So I think that's a pretty good question. And I think we're going to start, especially as oil moves back up. Utilization, at all cost, doesn't make sense. As you move into July, you could fly pretty much whenever you want. You'd want to maximize it in peaks, but I think you're going to seeing us be much smarter about utilization by month. And I could say when we talk about some of the off-peak flying, I guess, if you can replay what you did, we would have done less last year, at least in certain markets. So, it's hard to put a number on it, because you really want to look at the math, but I think you'll see more opportunities and less than daily. And if you look at the way we fly, we have some very strong routes. About a quarter of our airline is in multiple frequency routes. And then, the large bulk is daily. There are plenty of opportunities, and infinite more opportunities, in less than daily. And, by definition, some of the less than daily is less competitive risk as well and there's less spool-up risk. So when the growth rate slows, and you're not deploying a higher number of airplanes, some of this stuff actually gets easier, because, again, there's simply less routes and, on average, the planes are slightly bigger. So some of the growth is also coming from the assessment, but I think you're going to see us be much more tactical. The environment is what it is. The peak months are good and the off-peak months are challenging. And you basically have got to change of airline every couple of months. So, I think you'll just see more changes, but to put a number on whether it should be 10% or 12% or minus 5%, I think you build it in a more micro way, which is the way we will do it.\nDan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Very helpful. Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: The next question comes from Savi Syth. Please go ahead.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Good morning.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Morning.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: On the unit revenue trend that you're seeing, for second quarter, as I can adjust for Easter and kind of the stage length, it looks like core is down 2%. Could you help me understand maybe as you go through the quarters this year, just what that stage length headwind would look like? I'm just trying to get a sense of what we can expect for the core to do as you kind of walk through the year, assuming no changes in the industry?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Savi, it's Ted. I think, as we headed towards the end of 2017, that was when the stage really started to walk-up. In fact, by the fourth quarter, yeah, it was up 5%. So, as we get closer to the back half of this year, it's going to be less and less of an effect. I don't have the actual kind of headwind, tailwind numbers at the top of my head, but I can tell you that the stage was already feathering in by the time we hit the fourth quarter of last year.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. And, Ted, if I might ask on the unit costs on 2019, I just want to clarify. When you talk about that two-year stack, are you trying to say that it's most likely to be up slightly next year just because of the tougher comps or is there an opportunity for it to be flat or down next year?\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah, there's an opportunity. And we're always very thoughtful and careful about the cost structure. So I've said that before. And that's why I'm confident right now saying \u2013 because we thought about this year, given all of what's going on this year, with a new pilot deal and the kind of growth rate that we had versus what was happening last year, along with the fact that next year is, obviously, going to be a more normalized growth number, given our long-term guide, we've always thought about this as kind of a two-year period. And that's why we're comfortable saying it's going to be down. The question is heading into next year, what are we going to tackle and what are we going to do. And so, there is always an opportunity for us, in any given year, to kind of push the cost structure harder, and be thoughtful about those things, but I think I've thought about it more over a 24 month period.\nSavanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. All right, that's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Hey, thanks for taking the follow-up.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Sure.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: So, Bob, you have some long-term perspective on this industry. Let's call it experience. You've participated directly in a consolidation event, which was very shareholder-friendly. I think a lot of CEOs would not have made the same call. Some larger peers are generating very meaningful substantial free cash flow. And yet, we have all these questions about basic economy, which are just not that interesting, right? It's semantics. In some cases, it feels like another name for pricing below your cost structure. I'd love to get your perspective on the prospects for consolidation from here. Maybe the industry just lacks the creativity of, say, a Willie Walsh. Thanks for taking the questions.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Well, there's more than one question in there. And one about consolidation and one about basic economy. Let me kind of break them into pieces.\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Consolidation is really what I'm curious about.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: You're going to get a little bit of a stock answer here, because you know we can't speculate on this stuff, other than, I think you know, at least personally and as a group, we will evaluate opportunities as they come. And I think there have been benefits for this industry in consolidation. And I think, for us, it's always a matter of trading off what your standalone opportunities are versus how they would be with a combined environment and how they would impact the entire landscape. And, again, those things are ongoing. There's a lot going on in the industry. And to some degree, again, may be the industry over-earned perhaps four years ago, and now it's under-earning. And it's all about excuses about why things need to happen. And like I said, I think at least you've heard us \u2013 we've stopped really talking about the industry pricing environment. It is what it is. It's aggressive. We lead most of the time. We're undercut from time-to-time. You've got carriers whose cost structures are double ours, who under-sell us. And then they complain about our prices. We're in the low fare business. That's our business. And there is a strong niche for it. There's a lot of classic leisure markets that we should fly. In fact, most of our growth the last two or three years has been in Fort Lauderdale, Las Vegas and Orlando, which are, you said, they're classic low-fare destinations. Many of the high cost carriers are growing in there as well. There is really room for us in a broader way and, like I said, so we have to manage the opportunity. Right now, we see the opportunity for growth either on flying on a daily basis, we think a great opportunity for us is more international. And we have the opportunity to seize on that. We will make our adjustments and react to the environment. And like I said, Duane, we're interested in trying to make \u2013 we can influence what we do and we can have a broader impact on the industry. And I think you just need to assume that our practice is to evaluate the opportunities, either internally or externally. Okay?\nDuane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thanks for the perspective, kind of an unfair industry question to you. Thank you.\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Okay.\nDeAnne Gabel - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Elda, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: It comes from Hunter Keay.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Thank you. I actually have a couple of follow-ups. Bob, when we were talking about fuel and the impact on some of the longer stage length flying, you said, you were taking a look at that. Is that already part of the modest capacity reduction you announced today or are you implying that that's sort of like an ongoing process that as you look at post-Labor Day schedule, if fuel stays at or above these current levels, there's potential for some incremental capacity reductions?\nRobert L. Fornaro - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: So it's both. It's part of in the presumption that some of it will change. And we're just not complete. It's a little early for us and we're kind of way out. You'll start seeing the bulk of the September and October changes as we move into early June, that timeframe. But it's in anticipation of what we at least expect, even a modest measure of what we're planning on. Okay?\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah, that's good, Bob. Thank you. And then a little bit more on utilization, I did notice that your utilization was up for the first time in two years this quarter. How should we think about the 2019 13% capacity growth in the context of if you want to make it simple, how much of that 13% is coming from higher utilization? Is it four points of the 13% or whatever? I mean, if you want to split it that way, that'd be easy.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Yeah, I hear you, Hunter. I don't know that I have the breakout, but right now, as we said before, 2017 was an unusual utilization year. So, it was depressed. And as we start to lap that, our utilization is going to look better year-over-year. We get passed the pilot-related issues in the second quarter. You pass the hurricanes in the third. That's going show year-over-year improvement in utilization. I think for now, you should assume that whatever we produce this year is kind of what we're thinking about going into next year. Where we can push utilization clearly in the peak is our primary focus. And I think that having our labor issue settled and having a good understanding of the working parts of that agreement, I think is going to help us as we head into peak periods, which is when you really want utilization. And that's the focus.\nHunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nEdward M. Christie - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: You got it.\nDeAnne Gabel - Spirit Airlines, Inc.: Thank you all for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."}]
