Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Marcy Morita, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMarcy Morita: Thank you, Ryan. Hello, everyone and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings third quarter 2023 results conference call. Here with me in Honolulu are Peter Ingram, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Overbeek, Chief Revenue Officer; and Shannon Okinaka, Chief Financial Officer. We also have several other members of our management team in attendance for the Q&A. Peter will provide an overview of our performance, Brent will discuss revenue and Shannon will discuss costs and the balance sheet. At the end of the prepared remarks, we'll open the call up for questions. By now, everyone should have access to the press release that went out at about 4 o'clock Eastern Time today. If you have not received the release, it is available on the Investor Relations page of our website, hawaiianairlines.com. During our call today, we refer at times to adjusted or non-GAAP numbers and metrics. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers and metrics can be found at the end of today's press release posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. As a reminder, the following prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, include statements about our future plans and potential future financial and operating performance. Management may also make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future performance and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer you to Hawaiian Holding's recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. These include the most recent annual report filed in Form 10-K as well as subsequent reports filed on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Hello, Marcy. Aloha, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I want to start-off by thanking our dedicated and compassionate team members, who continue to deliver outstanding hospitality to our guests in an ever-changing external environment. This quarter, as tragic wildfires destroyed parts of Maui, my colleagues once again rose to the occasion and answered the call for our guests and the communities we serve. And even as we face more than our fair share of challenges, our team remains focused on important initiatives that make us a better airline, including the debut of Amazon Freighter flights early this month, the unveiling of our 787 interiors and the successful first of type installation of Starlink Wi-Fi on an A321 aircraft. I'll talk more in a few moments about each of these initiatives. Before that, I'll delve a bit more deeply into the events in Maui. While today we will necessarily address the economic consequences, we must not lose sight of the enormous human cost of the tragedy. We're a Paganic community and everybody at Hawaiian knows someone whose life was touched by this tragedy. For the first 3 days following the fires, we had a very focused mission with 3 essential elements. As the largest provider of passenger transportation to the islands, we took the lead in the evacuation of displaced visitors and residents and getting first responders to where they needed to be. We made sure that we supported our team on the ground in Maui Airport, with whatever resources they needed. And we confirmed that each of our 500 plus teammates who live or work on Maui was safe. Each of these objectives was achieved in the 72 hours following the fires and we continue to support what will be a long recovery for the community through charitable giving and the volunteer activities of our team. In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, new bookings to Maui slowed to a trickle and we saw large volumes of close-in cancellations for Maui trips. A portion of this close-in business shifted to other islands, notably Kauai. Booking trends stabilized in the weeks that followed and cancellations have abated but it will be a while yet before demand fully returns to the robust levels we saw earlier in the summer. Load factors, both on our North America and Neighbor Island flights to and from Maui, remain below typical levels but are improving. October will be better than September which at a low point in load factor's and the trajectory we're seeing is encouraging. In the current environment, accommodations inventory has not been a constraint. Rather, it has been the hesitation of travelers about coming to Maui in the wake of the fires. It is important to note that almost all of West Maui's hotels were physically unaffected by the fire and the phased reopening of properties nearest to the wildfire area began earlier this month. Yesterday, Maui County announced that this phased reopening will be extended to all of the key West Maui resort areas on November 1. On September 5, we updated our guidance to incorporate the impact from the wildfires to revenue for what we knew at the time. And later in this call, Brent will provide more details on the current outlook. The other significant near-term challenge we've been navigating is the availability of our A321 fleet. Just before our last quarterly call, we learned of new inspection requirements for the Pratt & Whitney engines that power these aircraft. The impact is understood at the time was incorporated in our September 5, investor update. Since then, in addition to receiving more details about inspection requirements beyond the end of this year, we have also seen a number of engine removals not associated with the powder metal inspection issue. These removals contributed to an elevated cancellation rate in the early days of the current quarter. We currently have 2 aircraft grounded which is an improvement over the earlier part of this month and expect to have between 2 and 4 aircraft out-of-service at any point in time over the next few months. In response to the most recent engine removals, we have adjusted our schedules to accommodate up to 4 out of service aircraft through 4Q and into the beginning of next year. We expect the situation for 2024 will improve, as our engine inventory will be bolstered by the return of several engines that are already in the MRO pipeline. We have reached terms with Pratt & Whitney on short-term compensation for their failure to provide required engine spares over the course of the past several months but this interim agreement will expire later this quarter. We're in ongoing discussions with Pratt on further compensation beyond the scope of the short-term agreement and most importantly, to provide more certainty about engine availability so that we can plan more effectively for the medium and long-term. After some external challenges to reliability in the first half of the year, our on-time performance steadily improved from July to August to September. The latest published DOT report for July showed us reclaiming the number one spot in the industry on-time performance. And I expect our August and September results to be at or near to the top of the pack. In October, as I noted earlier, we have experienced a bout of cancellations primarily driven by the A321 fleet. That underscores the importance of getting more certainty about the availability of engines. We are encouraged by the improved performance in the third quarter and will not be satisfied until we are once again consistently at the top of the industry for operational performance. I'll now touch on a few highlights of our commercial performance that Brent will address in more detail. Up until the wildfires on Maui, our revenue was tracking ahead of the expectations we had entering the quarter, with particular strength, from the U.S. Mainland to Hawaii. Sydney and Incheon continue to produce strong results. International performance was not materially affected by the Maui wildfires. On the Neighbor Island front, we continue to comprehensively outperform Southwest by wide margins in terms of load factor and unit revenue. These facts reinforce our conviction that the way we take care of our guests and deliver authentic Hawaiian hospitality makes us the clear carrier of choice for travel between the islands. In Japan, the encouraging trends we noted during last quarter's call continued through the summer. Since May, we have seen a sustained recovery of Japan point-of-sale bookings on top of the ongoing high level of U.S. point-of-sale demand. In the coming quarters, we'll see an increase in supply in the Japan to Hawaii market as relief from use it or lose it requirements for slots and route authorities expire at the end of this month. We'll need to see continued recovery in Japan point of sale demand to keep pace with this increasing supply. But the trend is encouraging and certainly a welcome change from where things stood at the beginning of the year. We also aren't slowing down on our execution of initiatives as we take important projects across the finish line and achieve major milestones on others. On October 2, we flew our first A330-300 freighter revenue flight from Cincinnati to San Bernardino. As a reminder, this is the beginning of a contractual relationship that envisions initial growth to a 10 aircraft fleet in the months ahead. The first flight this month was a significant milestone as we embark on this new venture to provide important diversified growth for our business. Continuing on a positive note, we announced the initial route deployments for our new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The aircraft will debut on our April 15 flight from Honolulu to San Francisco before transitioning to flights between Honolulu and Los Angeles, as well as Maui and Los Angeles in May. We have firm orders for 12 787 scheduled between early next year in 2027. We also have several A330 passenger aircraft leases ending in this timeframe, giving us options to balance growth and replacement. We're excited to get this fleet in the air next year. It's not only the vehicle of growth for our passenger business for the next few years but the larger 34 seat premium cabin allows us to expand this high performing margin enhancing element of the business. Earlier this month, we completed the installation of Starlink connectivity on an A321. The installation and testing was successful and we are currently completing the FAA certification process before installing the technology on the rest of the A321 fleet. We'll go through the same process with the A330 fleet next year. As a reminder, we're the first major airline to deploy this product and it will be the fastest, most capable Wi-Fi available. Our award-winning hospitality already makes us the preferred carrier in the markets we serve. Complementing this with an unparalleled Wi-Fi experience will further set the Hawaiian experience apart and grow our revenue premium. I'm immensely proud of what our team is accomplishing and the dedication of our employees. They're aloha for one another and the unmatched hospitality they extend to our guests and the communities we serve will ensure Hawaiian success in the years ahead. In a few weeks, we will celebrate 94 years of service to Hawaii. As I reflect on this 94th year which has had its share of challenges, I know that all of those challenges, whether engine issues or market issues or otherwise, are near-term and transient. The core strength of our brand and business model and the effect of the major investments we are making now will be durable and create value into the future. Now, let me turn it over to Brent to go over our commercial performance and outlook in more detail.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter. Aloha, everyone. In the third quarter, system RASM was in line with our revised guidance, down just under 6% year-over-year. Total revenue for the quarter was down about 2% and we operated 4% more capacity versus the same period in 2022. Our capacity came in on the lower end of the guidance due to the reductions made to accommodate the Pratt & Whitney engine shortfall. As Peter mentioned, leading up to the Maui wildfires, demand was strong and revenue was trending positively, with RASM slightly ahead of guidance. Immediately after the fires, demand and market pricing to Maui rapidly declined, resulting in deceleration of RASM momentum, disproportionately concentrated in the Maui market. The impact from the wildfires amounted to approximately $25 million in lost revenue and for context, leading up to the fires, the Maui market represented approximately 22% of our system revenue. In looking specifically at the North America entity prior to the fires, demand was strong and unit revenue was up about 3% year-over-year. Following the Maui fires in early August, there was a sharp deceleration in demand for Maui travel over the remainder of the quarter. This resulted in North America entity PRASM finishing down 10.5% year-over-year for the post-fire portion of the quarter. And PRASM was down 41.7% year-over-year for the Maui markets in the same period. On our Neighbor Island routes, the fires had a significant impact on both demand and average fare. Third quarter load factor was 74%, down 5 points year-over-year, on a 9% increase in capacity. The competitive dynamic in the market remains the same. We continue to compete strongly for volume and have maintained our significant lead over Southwest in load factor and PRASM. The most recent DOT statistics for the second quarter show us at a 75% load factor compared to 47% for Southwest and a PRASM of $0.301 compared to a $0.15 PRASM for Southwest. These results demonstrate clearly that we are the inter-island carrier of choice. Although, we are now lapping Southwest's $39 fares with last seat availability from last year, the Maui wildfires had depressed average fares for a period of time. That said, we are seeing recent improvement in average fares, signaling that the low point for yields is likely behind us. We saw a tangible recovery in Japan during the third quarter. Load factors were in the upper 80s and approaching historical norms on a smaller capacity base for Hawaiian and the industry. Third quarter industry capacity was about 56% of 2019 and we expect total Japan to Hawaii industry capacity to increase to almost 70% of 2019 levels by the end of the quarter. With capacity increasing, we've seen sequential slowing in unit revenue but anticipate that improves as we head into 2024 and Japan point-of-sale traffic continues to recover. In our international network outside of Japan, U.S. point-of-sale traffic remained very strong. Our New Zealand, Australia and Korea markets have not been significantly impacted by the Maui fires. Passenger revenue for our international routes, including Japan, is up over 90% for the third quarter this year compared to 2022. Korea in particular continues to be a strong market. Average fares in Australia and New Zealand are positive compared to 2019 but we are facing some difficult comps due to the surge of pent-up travel demand in 2022. Last week, we announced that we will turn our year-round thrice-weekly Honolulu to Auckland service into a seasonal route during the New Zealand summer. Auckland demand remains strong in the summer season, reinforced by strong U.S. point-of-sale traffic and this move to seasonal service reflects our focus on being more nimble and adaptable with schedules to address demand seasonality across our network. Our co-brand credit card had another good quarter, with third quarter revenue up almost 2% over the same period in 2022. This year's strong credit card performance, particularly on new card acquisition, reinforces our confidence in the growth potential of this business and the deep demand for Hawaii vacations as a favorite reward for cardholders. Looking ahead to the next quarter, non-Maui bookings continue to improve, albeit with lower fare levels in the main cabin. Maui bookings have been improving, especially closer to departure, although it significantly reduced yields. For international, we're satisfied with the return of Japan point-of-sale demand which is creating a larger overall demand pool for our service, albeit at fares in the short-term that are sequentially lower than we anticipate going forward. While we are seeing continued year over year improvements in international RASM, the growth is sequentially slower compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the network as a whole, we expect RASM to be down approximately 11.5% on capacity growth of about 3% for the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2022. Headwinds to RASM are similar to those shared in previous quarters with the addition of short-term effects of the Maui fires. These headwinds include 6 points from the deterioration in revenue due to the Maui fires which we anticipate will improve over time. About 4 points in spoilage and this should be the last quarter of a challenging comparison, as we lap last year's high watermark for spoilage. And about 1 point from cargo, as activity normalizes to 2019 levels from the highs of 2022. Now that we have better clarity for the remainder of the year on the engine shortfall from Pratt & Whitney and the impact from the Maui fires, our capacity guidance for the full year has been revised to up 7.5% to up 8.5%. We continue to remain confident in the core revenue-generating capability of our business. We are the carrier of choice and outperform competitors in each of the core Hawaii markets that we serve. The headwinds on fares and demand we are facing from the Maui wildfires should be short term in nature and we will overcome those in time. The A321 engine issues are a near term challenge but with the arrival of our 787s, we're looking forward to opportunities for longer haul growth in 2024. Once we obtain certainty on our A321 engines, we're also encouraged about the plans we can develop with our expanded fleet. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent. Aloha, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We ended the third quarter with an adjusted EBITDA loss of about $12 million, or an adjusted loss of $1.06 per share which is about $40 million lower than we had forecast at the beginning of the quarter, primarily driven by the impact of the Maui wildfires and increase in fuel prices. Unit costs, excluding fuel, came in at the higher end of the updated guidance range from September 5, primarily due to lower than expected capacity as a result of the A321neo engine and operational challenges. Given the close-in nature of the cancellations, it was difficult to significantly reduce our costs to match the decreased capacity, although certain variable costs, such as fuel consumption and landing fees, were avoided. With respect to our balance sheet and liquidity, our cash position decreased in the third quarter, resulting from normal ATL seasonality, exacerbated by refunds and reduced bookings as a result of the Maui fires. With that said, we have $1.4 billion of liquidity which includes a $235 million undrawn revolver which is about 50% of our trailing 12-month revenue and twice our pre-pandemic liquidity target. While our liquidity remains strong, we will likely finance the first several of our 787 deliveries. We received proposals from several lenders and lessors and we'll finalize our financing plan for 2024 soon. In addition to our existing unencumbered assets, the 787 is a very financeable airplane and Hawaiian is an attractive name to the financing community. Our fourth quarter costs remain elevated as we approach the conclusion of preparations to bring the 787 and A330 freighters into service throughout 2024. We're currently carrying about 25% more pilots on our payroll than we did in 2019 for about the same amount of capacity. As the capacity that we're planning for comes online, our training bubble will deflate and pilot productivity will improve. We expect this improvement to grow throughout 2024 and decrease from a CASM impact of $0.26 in the fourth quarter of '23 to $0.14 in the fourth quarter of '24 at the then current pilot rates which is a 50% improvement. We expect our fourth quarter unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, to be about 8% higher than the same period in 2022, with similar drivers to the prior quarter, including approximately 5 percentage points from increases in labor costs and benefits which result primarily from the new pilot contracts and the higher number of pilots in training and other rate increases. About 1 point from a higher number of heavy maintenance events, 1 point from higher airport rates and 2 points for close-in cancellations which resulted in lower capacity, partially offset by Pratt & Whitney compensation credits for grounded aircraft. Commensurately, we expect our full year CASM ex guidance to be up 4% to 5.5%. We expect the benefits from initiatives such as our A330 maintenance insourcing, our new passenger service system and CBA-related work rule changes to ramp up in 2024 as these investments mature. And we will pursue further operating cost improvement through continued investment in technology and analytics to drive increased productivity. Turning to our fleet plans, we have executed 2-year extensions for 4 A330 leases that would have otherwise expired in 2024. In addition to ownership cost improvements, the extensions will collectively enable us to maintain our network plans and mitigate the impact of the ongoing A321 engine challenges. Including the new lease terms on these aircraft, we have a total of 12 aircraft leases that will expire between 2025 and 2029, if not extended. It's exciting to be at a point where we'll soon start to see an acceleration of the benefits from investments that have been drivers of increased expense this year. While we're facing a number of near-term challenges, the durable financial foundation that we have built enables us to endure them and emerge stronger. If the last few years have taught us anything, it's how to be nimble and adjust to circumstances which we'll continue to do as long as necessary. And with that, we can open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: When looking at passenger trends to Hawaii, it seems like inbound travelers from Japan, I know that recovery has kind of stalled out the last 2 months or so through October. Just curious if you're actually seeing that in the data right now. And then maybe any thoughts on what the thought on it is. I know, Brent, you mentioned, the lower fares and whatnot and I'm just curious on the recovery. It just seems like it should be doing better. I didn't know if there's any, like, Maui impact from that as well.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, Connor. Japan had a really strong August holidays and so the front and middle part of the month there performed exceptionally well. And there was -- we had some of our own and there was some additional industry capacity in that window. And so, certainly that helped with arrivals. They have -- we were still running kind of load factors in the mid to upper 80s and so demand overall remained strong. As we alluded to, certainly, we've got some more capacity online. The industry has more capacity coming online in the fourth quarter. That is generally getting filled up but like I said in my prepared remarks, it is -- we're starting -- we're seeing a little bit of what we believe is kind of short-term pressure on Japan point-of-sale yields as that capacity comes back online. But we're also encouraged with the strength of the U.S. point-of-sale market and the amount of traffic that we're generating there.\nPeter Ingram: And maybe just to follow-up that a little bit and underscore something that Brent said in his answer, it's been a while since we saw strong traffic coming out of Japan, so it's probably useful to remind people that there is a seasonality to it. And seasonality really has a pretty strong peak in late July throughout the month of August and into the early part of September. And so some of what you may be seeing in the numbers, Connor, is just reflecting of the run-up towards very full flights on that peak and then a little quieter period now before things pick up seasonally again towards the end of the year.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. I'm much better with straight lines. I know it's a little bit easier for me then. On the GTF stuff, your schedule capacity, I think, is down 2 points from just last week and I think, your guidance today kind of implies another 1 point deceleration. Just -- is that the type of lead time that they're giving you? Just -- it seems really tough from your standpoint to manage the business, where they're only getting like a 2-week heads-up on a one-shot business need to happen? And then maybe within that, is the Amazon flying included in your capacity guidance, or is that something that's separately block hours or whatever?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Let me start with the GTF and Brent can correct me if I'm wrong but essentially what we've talked about on the call today in terms of our outlook for the schedule and having for, the ability to withstand over the next few months for AOG is reflected in the schedules that are published now. All that information was published, so there's not another shoe to drop that we are aware of at this point from that. I would say, we had a pretty clear picture about what the inspection issue would drive for the back part of this year. Those were a number of removals that we were required to make by September 15th which is the news we got just before our call 3 months ago. What changed in late September and into October that has required us to cut a little further here is we had some unscheduled removals which can and does happen on any fleet from time-to-time. But in the circumstance we're in right now where there are limited to no spare engines available on the market to support that, every one of those removals drives another aircraft on ground, because we aren't sitting with a bunch of spare engines in our hangar right now to be able to accommodate that, although, candidly, from a contractual standpoint, we should be having that but we don't have those spare engines available. So, we've tried to adjust the schedule now to provide a little bit of buffer, so we don't end up in a situation like we did over the last couple of months. I will admit my crystal ball is not perfect on this but we do feel better about the engine availability situation as we get into the first quarter and really, the back part of the first quarter and further in the year, we have a number of engines that are in the MRO pipeline right now that are coming back. So, from a Hawaiian Airlines perspective, our engine availability should be improving as those come back but they're -- obviously, the situation has been frustrating and we have been living a little bit too close to a razor's edge in terms of the ability of the market to withstand it and, we really do need Pratt to provide us with more certainty going forward. I think the other part of your question was about the Amazon flying, the freighter flying and whether that affects our statistics and, certainly it wouldn't affect ASMs. I think it is incorporated into our expectations about fuel burn and our consumption and so it's built into the economics and the guidance as well, the cost impact is reflected in the guidance.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes, Connor, obviously, there are no seats on those aircraft, so they're not in ASMs. We do have the impact included in our RASM, CASM ex fuel guidance but really for the fourth quarter, they're really small. As it starts to get -- have a bigger impact, we'll break it out for you just to at least show what the direct cost impact is to CASM and revenue for RASM.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nHillary Cacanando: This is Hillary Cacanando calling in for Michael Linenberg. So you mentioned that you have reached a short-term compensation agreement with Pratt & Whitney. And last quarter, you said that you'll get compensated in the form of maintenance credits. Is that still the case? Or has that changed at all to perhaps increased cash compensation? And could you talk about what the timing of that payment will be?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, so the compensation is in the form of maintenance credits. We -- it gets recorded as an offset on our maintenance materials and repairs line. And effectively, it helps to offset payments we would make for power-by-the-hour charges.\nHillary Cacanando: And then will that be reflected for the fourth quarter in terms of timing?\nShannon Okinaka: It will be reflected as we use the credits. So as we start incurring power-by-the-hour charges, we'll offset the credit.\nPeter Ingram: We've been accruing that over the past couple of quarters. So it is reflected in the third quarter and I think some may have been reflected in the second quarter as well and it does carry into the fourth.\nHillary Cacanando: Okay, got it. And then you announced a new flight, to Tokyo Haneda. I was just wondering if you could talk about how the bookings have been looking?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, I would say bookings are certainly looking solid. Haneda in particular, it looks quite good as we continue to ramp our capacity up in the fourth quarter and I think overall, we're encouraged with demand, particularly the strength of U.S. point-of-sale demand and we'll continue to build on Japan point-of-sale. So I think overall, we feel positive with where we're at in Haneda.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: I guess first, I want to say my thoughts have been with you all since the devastating Maui wildfires. And I had a question on Maui. So I know you've spoken to the impact on demand and lost revenue in the quarter with things still trending below normal historical but starting to pick up. Can you just speak to how bookings look for Maui for the holidays and any early look on spring break into next year?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. So right now, the holidays, both kind of Thanksgiving and Christmas generally look pretty good. Pricing, those are really strong demand periods and so average fares in those remain pretty strong. So I think we're encouraged with that, I would say, in the context of spring break. It's still a little early on that, where load factors at the end of the first quarter there are still relatively low and there was a bit of a pause around the event where folks were a little bit uncertain about planning further out travel. We have seen -- as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, Katie, that in close demand has been pretty strong and so I think things have been pretty -- have been fine for the spring. But as we get out of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, we anticipate those will continue to strengthen.\nCatherine O'Brien: And then a 2-part question on 787, if you'll allow it. I guess first quickly, why is that starting service on the West Coast? Is there some like operational consideration? Or I just figured that would ultimately be deployed international? And then maybe one for Shannon, just like, as you send out the RFPs for the financing of those first couple 787s, what markets are initially looking attractive? I've heard sale leasebacks have gotten a bit more expensive over the last 6 months but not sure if on a relative basis, that's still more attractive than, traditional debt financing, given where interest rates are today.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Why don't I take the first part of that and then turn it over to Shannon to talk about the financing. It's actually quite an insightful question, Katie, because as I think about the 787, it is our most fuel-efficient -- will be our most fuel-efficient long-haul airplane. It's got greater capacity and it's got a big premium cabin, so you want to put it in a market like New York, where you really check every box of high premium demand ability to fill up the airplane even on days in the middle of the week and really take advantage of the fuel efficiency. There are operational considerations that compel us to put the first one on the West Coast, though. One is we need a place where we can do overnight maintenance on the aircraft and that is initially going to be in Los Angeles, as we start ramping up. And we need a place where the aircraft is going to be on the ground for 8 to 10 hours a night so that every third day or so we can get some maintenance attention on it. And we don't have that on our longer-haul flights, where the aircraft tend to turn after being on the ground for just a couple of hours. The other thing it helps us with is building up initial experience for our pilots on that aircraft. They -- having a shorter route to the West Coast gives us more takeoffs and landings and the ability to build up that experience. And so those 2 factors push us to starting on the West Coast but we're definitely going to want to stretch the legs of that aircraft as we get deeper into '24 and into 2025.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes and I'll take up the RFP on financing. To your point, we are looking at a variety of different vehicles. Unfortunately, we're not going to get to the sub-1% Japanese yen debt that we did back with the A321neos but we're finding that there is a lot of opportunity, albeit a little bit more expensive than what we've had on our books prior but we see the regular debt financing markets, the public markets, as well as some opportunities in Japan that we're pursuing. So we're still in some of the initial phases of the process but we'll provide updates as we progress.\nCatherine O'Brien: I'm sure we'd all love some sub-1% financing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: First question for Brent. Just wanted to ask about kind of Japan and the cadence of the recovery expectations there. I think you said in your prepared remarks that Japan capacity would be 70% recovered by the end of the fourth quarter relative to 2019. How are you thinking about the build back there in 2024? And when do you think your Japan entity could be back to 2019 levels of capacity?\nBrent Overbeek: So, we think that kind of industry, 2019 ends up with a little bit of a strange comp as you flip from 4Q to 1Q. We -- from what we see in kind of industry schedules, industry capacity excluding us is pretty flat quarter-to-quarter as we go from December into the first quarter. We ramp up a little bit more capacity in terms of our night slot and service to Kona and our midnight frequency to Honolulu. And so that will ramp itself up over the first quarter and have a little bit more growth in Japan capacity. Obviously, the longer -- the further we get away from Japan opening up is allows greater time for booking curve and allows more traffic to come on the books. And so we're trying to match our capacity coming back in line with Japan point of origin travel in particular continuing to strengthen.\nAndrew Didora: And then maybe a 2-parter for Shannon. Thank you for the color around liquidity in your prepared remarks. Do you have -- what percentage of your assets are currently unencumbered? And then the second part of my question, are you seeing any credit card holdbacks given the cancellations you're experiencing?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes, I don't know the exact percentage but we've got a number of aircraft that remain unencumbered to the value of about $560 million. On the credit card holdbacks, no, we're not seeing anything like that. I think we've still got a very strong business. Bookings are beginning to build back. So we haven't had even any discussions about things like holdbacks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with TD Cowen.\nHelane Becker: I just have a couple of clarification questions, actually. I saw an article this morning that talked about you guys signing up Lufthansa Technik to do A330 and A321 maintenance. And I'm just kind of wondering if that article is accurate and what the timing of that will be?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, the article is accurate. I believe the agreement there is for Lufthansa Technik to provide component support for A321s and A330s. And I think we're also going to use them for our 787. So this was business that we had elsewhere previously. And when we did our A330 end sourcing, it gave us an opportunity to run a comprehensive RFP and get the best market terms that were available. And so we've done that. So it's really around providing component support for various pieces of equipment on the aircraft.\nHelane Becker: And then for my follow-up question, so you have 1 aircraft that started service for Amazon. And I'm just kind of wondering if you could talk about, it's been what 2 weeks? Let's talk about the performance and whether you're going to in '20 -- I guess it would be 2025, right, break out how, break out that revenue line or include it in cargo and other revenue. I don't know. How should we think about, like, parsing that out, if at all?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Well, let me start and then Shannon can follow-up or correct me if I get anything wrong here. In terms of the operating performance, we're pleased how things have been going so far. It's great to get into a place where, instead of just incurring startup costs and no revenue, we're operating revenue flights and getting the business growing. Our on-time performance has been very good so far which is crucial in this arrangement. Part of the reason why we were sought out to bid for this work. So it's great to be up and running. In terms of how it appears on the income statement, I'll let Shannon go through it in more detail. But essentially, right now it's not particularly material. And so we're not breaking anything out. As it becomes more material over time, we're going to look at the best way to break it out. And Shannon can talk about what things that we're thinking about.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. So for sure, Helane, it would be part of, other revenue but as it gets more material and right now we're anticipating 2025, to your point, we actually move ourselves into segment reporting. And we haven't quite finalized exactly how we define the segments but I would think that however we do the segment reporting, you should see more clearly what part of our direct revenues and costs are Amazon related. And we'll have to do some allocations in that accounting as well but it will come through the segment reporting piece of our SEC reports.\nHelane Becker: Okay. When you -- just one other clarification question. When you report on Form 41 cargo volumes, will the Amazon volumes be included in that or are they separated?\nShannon Okinaka: I am going to have to follow-up with you on that question. Yes, we'll follow-up with you.\nPeter Ingram: And Helane, just circling back on your first question, I want to clarify one thing. The Lufthansa technique agreement is covering A321 and 330 components. It's not 787. That's a different contract for that one.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna International Group.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So Peter, as we think about 2024, I know you're still in your planning phase here but there's a lot of moving pieces here with the 787, A330s, where Japan will be at that point with its recovery. So as we think about all that and stage, gauge and departures, any color of how we should think about capacity for next year as we put those pieces together?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Let me start and then hand it over to Brent. I think we will. We've got an opportunity for some growth next year. We've got, 787s coming throughout the year. I think we have at least 3 in service by the end of the year and a fourth one coming late in the year, so there will be some contribution from that. It's -- I would like to think that as we get fully into the year, we're going to have all the 321s flying again. That's obviously subject to discussions for the reasons we've talked about earlier but we do feel better, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about the aircraft or the engine availability as we start getting some of those MR overturns. So we're not going to be providing guidance at this time but we do see things growing as we have the annualization of bringing Japan back this year and then the incremental fleet availability coming into next year. So it does position it as a year for capacity growth for us.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And as a follow-up, Shannon, I think you said on the 50% impact for 4Q, you actually gave a percent per ASM number there. And is that just on a larger capacity base? Does that include any productivity within the network? Just want to understand how we're getting to that. I think it was 50% number by the end of 4Q of next year?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes, that was when I was talking about the pilot productivity and the number of excess pilots we have on property due to all of the training to get ready for the 787 deliveries and A230 freighters. So what it refers to is just that CASM impact from having that excess number of pilots versus 2019. And so we decreased that CASM impact by 50% from the end of '23 to the end of '24. So that's what that referred to.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global.\nDan McKenzie: A couple questions here. I guess my first question is really a schedules versus a revenue question with respect to California. So I guess, just setting aside the Maui wildfires, it looks like San Francisco and Los Angeles are cities where flying has not yet recovered to 2019 levels. And so I guess, my question is, it seems like an important part of the network. And I'm wondering what's holding the recovery back to these cities, from a network perspective. Is it a delay or is it structural in nature? And, if these cities could get back to a normal schedule, what would that possibly, what could that mean for revenue?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, Dan, frankly the scheduled cuts that we've had to make in terms of putting capacity back in are things that we've been really frustrated to do, frustrating for us financially, frustrating for our guests and are really almost exclusively related to A321 availability. And so where we've had to make some reductions, particularly in the Bay Area, these haven't been things that we wanted to do and we were going to have to temporarily suspend Long Beach, Maui for a period this winter. Not something we want to do but really kind of given where we're at with the Pratt situation are things that are really necessitated more than anything by that. If we look kind of in terms of kind of industry recovery of -- kind of California versus other metros, I'd say the Bay Area is maybe a little behind the basin and Seattle and kind of other big metros but not material as we look out at kind of industry volumes and particularly like looking at second quarter DOT data, maybe it's a percentage point or 2 behind some of the other metros in the Bay but overall, I would say just a little bit slower.\nPeter Ingram: And just to follow-up on that, Dan, I mean, California is a super important market for us, Los Angeles is the biggest concentration of our flying outside of the Hawaiian Islands. If you look at what we've done since pre-pandemic, some of the flying we added in 2020 coming out of the pandemic were things like Long Beach to Maui and adding our flight to Ontario which weren't there before that time period. So, we're really again, once we have a full availability of our A321 fleet, I think if you looked at our flying 2019 versus what we'd like to be flying now, we'd be flying more, not less to California.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. And then, I guess, Peter, can you remind us of what percent of the bookings were sold through blocks with the travel, Japanese travel agencies say in 2019? And just, what is the expectation, going forward? And what could that possibly mean for revenue?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, let me, let me start and then hand it over to Brent. I know, I don't have the specific percentage at my fingertips right now. Brent may be a little more willing than me to go take a stab at a number. What I would say generally is that -- the travel distribution market -- I mean, travel distribution market has been evolving globally. I think it has evolved more gradually in Japan than a lot of places. And there's been a lot of, third-party intermediaries that continue to be a big part of the distribution picture in Japan. That was starting to change. And one of the trends we have seen over the course of the last couple of years is as travel resumed internationally from Japan, the big travel retailers have not grown back their business as fast as they had. And we've made a lot of strides in advancing our own direct distribution, particularly over our websites and also but also working with some of the online travel agencies who distribute things on more of a digital platform than a brick and mortar platform. So while we expect the brick and mortar agencies to still be, play an important role and they're going to be important partners for us going forward. It is going to be less significant than it was. And we really think that the market was moving away from blocks and probably won't go back to blocks going forward. And net-net, I think that's probably a good thing for us.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, Dan, I think back to 2019, we were probably in the high 20s in terms of blocks. And, those were at -- they were at a discount to our average Japan revenue or Japan average fare as well, in terms of that commitment for giving for folks selling spaces, they were getting a little bit of a discount but as Peter mentioned, the market's evolved. We've seen a lot of changes in distribution there. It was an evolution that was happening. And the pandemic has clearly accelerated that. And so, I don't know that that's an endeavor we'll get back into but it is -- we are really focused on how we sell and how we distribute our products in Japan to make sure to ensure we're successful going forward.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. And, if I could just tack on one fast third question, going back to Peter's comment that the -- the direct distribution is a good thing. Can you elaborate just a little bit on what that means from a, your ability to commercialize fares differently than what you were able to do before?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, I think probably the biggest benefit, 2 benefits. One, we have a direct relationship with the customer and be able to sell them ancillary, sign them up for Hawaiian miles and get even more kind of future loyalty there. In terms of ancillaries themselves, the biggest benefit for us is, is selling extra comfort seats. And that was a product that we could sell-through, through a third-party and brick and mortar agencies but it was it was not very efficient or effective for us, the agency or the customer. And so being able to handle that directly with us when at time of booking or follow-up post booking is a much easier process. So the biggest benefit, I think we'll see is -- is greater extra comfort sales in Japan as we continue to grow there.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, as there are no further questions, I will now hand the conference over to Peter Ingram, President and CEO for closing comments.\nPeter Ingram: Hello, again to everyone for joining us today. I obviously wish that, the third quarter's financial outcomes more appropriately reflected the outstanding work of our team. While we are financially secure to continue investing for the long-term, we know that we need to deliver better near-term performance in spite of the external challenges we face. The initiatives that are coming on now and early next year will help us achieve this. We appreciate your interest and look forward to updating you on our progress in the months ahead. Aloha.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference of Hawaiian Holdings has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."}, {"symbol": "HA", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-07-25 20:38:08", "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings, Incorporated. Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time I\u2019d now like to hand the call over to Marcy Morita, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.\nMarcy Morita: Thank you, Daryl. Hello everyone and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings second quarter 2023 results conference call. Here with me on Honolulu are, Peter Ingram, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Overbeek, Chief Revenue Officer; and Shannon Okinaka, Chief Financial Officer. We also have several other members of our management team in attendance for the Q&A. Peter will provide an overview of our performance, Brent will discuss revenue, and Shannon will discuss cost and the balance sheet. At the end of the prepared remarks, we will open the call up to questions. By now, everyone should have access to the press release that went out at about 4 o'clock Eastern Time today. If you have not received the release, it is available on the Investor Relations' page web page of our website, hawaiianairlines.com. During our call today, we will refer at times to adjusted or non-GAAP numbers and metrics. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers and metrics can be found at the end of today's press release posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. As a reminder, the following prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our future plans and potential future financial and operating performance. Management may also make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future performance and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer you to Hawaiian Holdings\u2019 recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. These include the most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K, as well as subsequent reports filed on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Hello, Marcy. Hello. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I want to start with the sincere mahalo for our line team, who have been working in a challenging operating environment for the past several months. The good news is that things are getting better and our team has once again demonstrated that when things get tough, they rise to the occasion. For that, I am incredibly grateful. Leisure demand remains robust throughout our network reflected in strong second quarter revenue performance and encouraging advanced bookings for the back half of the year. We continue to make important progress on the strategic initiatives that will make us an even better airline. And we are encouraged by improvement in some of the outside influences that have affected our operating environment. With some of the factors we don\u2019t control falling into place, we are getting back to a work in which our team members can do what they do best, deliver exceptional hospitality to our guests. As you have seen in our press release today, RASM came in above the range that we guided to during our last earnings call, a testament to the robust demand environment. I'll touch on a few highlights of our commercial performance then Brent will address in more detail. Revenue performance from the U.S. Mainland to Hawaii, the largest part of our network remains strong, continuing the trend we have seen for several quarters. There is no evidence of a slowdown or other signs of a looming recession in our demand indicators. Similarly, we have seen the continuation of recent trends on our international routes outside of Japan. With Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, all seeing solid demand in the second quarter. And on our Neighbor Island network, we continue to be decisively outperform Southwest on load factor, unit revenue and customer preference in an environment that remains challenging in terms of fares and supply. Where we have seen a divergence from recent trends in a favorable direction is on our routes between Japan and Hawaii. Since early May, Japan outbound demand has accelerated meaningfully for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. Combined with the historically high demand from U.S. point of sale, the result has been load factors and RASM that are comparable to historical levels. Now I will offer one caveat to this recovery. The performance we are seeing is currently on a capacity base that has been about 70% of what we operated in 2019. And JAL and ANA, the other two major operators between Japan and Hawaii have been operating a similar proportion of their pre-pandemic capacity levels. So we will have to see a continued growth in demand as capacity comes back, both as a result of demand and the likely conclusion of slot relief measures. But having talked about this since 2021 on these calls, it's great to see Japanese visitors starting to return to Hawaii in numbers. And it's important not just for us, but for many businesses here in Hawaii that have historically relied on what has long been the state's largest source of international visitors. We've also seen a positive shift in our operations. For eight months, from last October through almost the end of May, we've dealt with the consequences of a major runway construction project in Honolulu. As I previously shared, the construction project resulted in a reduced arrival rate at the airport during peak periods and frequent ground holds for some of our Neighbor Island flights, which severely affected our operations and on-time performance. The good news is that on May 27, the most impactful phase of the construction project was completed, and the runway is open for daily operation. As expected, we delivered a significantly improved on-time performance in June and are trending even more favorably in July. We're not resting here though. There are still some work to be done to get all the way back to the historical level of industry-leading reliability. So this is no time to take our eyes off the ball. What is most important though is that our team is now positioned to be successful again, which they really couldn't be for 8 long months. I thank them again for their perseverance as we work through these challenges. We've also seen some improvement in the availability of our A321 aircraft, which have been constrained in recent months by our engine supplier's inability to meet spare engine commitments as we detailed on previous calls. The worst period saw us with five of our 18 aircraft on the ground awaiting engines. More recently, we've experienced two and sometimes three grounded aircraft. Our plan prior to this morning had been for no more than two aircraft out of service for the next few months, improving to one in the fourth quarter. Today's news from Pratt's parent company's earnings call announcing additional removals for this engine type, renders is plan subject to change. Since this development is late-breaking, we haven't yet fully calibrated the impact. Our team has already started to work with Pratt & Whitney to understand the specific impacts on our installed fleet. And in the days ahead, we will assess whether we must take any schedule action to mitigate aircraft shortages. Even as the situation improved recently, we always knew that it remained dynamic. And while we receive financial compensation for unavailable aircraft, what we are really looking forward to is full availability of our fleet, an appropriate level of spare engines at our facilities and a much more predictable operation. We're also making progress on many major initiatives we're tackling this year. We've achieved major milestones on two such initiatives in the second quarter, transitioning our reservation system to Amadeus' Altea platform and in-sourcing important aspects of our A330 maintenance from a third party. Altea will provide a stronger technology foundation on which to build new revenue-generating products and digital experiences for our guests. By in-sourcing management of our A330 maintenance, we're taking full ownership of our A330 fleet reliability, which will provide a lower steady-state cost structure and better control and flexibility to accommodate changes in our business, especially as we bring the freighter fleet into service. Earlier this month, the first A330-300 freighter that we will operate for Amazon arrived in Honolulu. Over the next few months, we'll use the aircraft for employee familiarization work. This is the first of 10 freighter aircraft we will be inducting over the course of the next 1.5 years providing us a new and diversified stream of revenue that will begin to ramp more materially in 2024. In May, we unveiled our Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner Interior and a new business class product, the Leihoku Suites. These 34 seats feature fully flat beds, privacy doors and shared double suites. This aircraft truly will set the standard for premium travel to Hawaii. Our team has done a great job of building in unique Hawaiian touches that provide a special experience from the front to the back of the airplane. We have recently learned of an incremental two-month delay on the delivery of our first aircraft, but this does not at all diminish our enthusiasm about what the aircraft will mean for us in the long-term. On a previous call, we shared with you our exciting news about plans to provide WiFi connectivity on our long-haul fleet using SpaceX's StarLink. The Starlink team continues to work through the certification and modification kits for the A321 and A330, the first reach type. At this point, we don't expect the first installation to occur until at least 4Q, and it will be 2024 before we have a steady stream of aircraft mods underway. Getting this product installed on our fleet, which will be free for every guest from day one, will set a new standard for bandwidth and speed, something we have even more confidence about now given documented performance of the technology on other fleets that are in service. As you can tell, we're very busy right now. Our message to the team over the last year has been to buckle down and focus on what we can control. Encouragingly, we're now seeing some of the externalities we don't control, like runway construction and Japan demand move in our favor. All of these things position us for stronger performance ahead. And what positions us most of all is our team throughout the organization. They continue to do a great job extending a standard of hospitality and care that sets us apart. Lastly, I want to mention some changes that we've made recently to our commercial leadership team. We have consolidated responsibility over commercial to 2 long-standing leaders, Brent Overbeek, our Chief Revenue Officer; and Avi Mannis, our Chief Marketing Officer. Both have been promoted to Executive Vice President as part of this change. I have great confidence that their complementary skill sets and vision are going to drive our commercial performance over the coming years. Let me now turn it over to Brent to go over our commercial performance and outlook in more detail.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter. Hello, hi, everyone. As Peter mentioned, leisure demand remained strong for most of our markets in the second quarter with our international routes standing out in particular. I'll later expand in further detail upon each part of our network. Total revenue was up just over 2%, and we operated 11% more capacity versus the same period in 2022, which was in line with our guidance. In the second quarter, system RASM was down 8% year-over-year, which is slightly better than our guidance range as a result of the pace of recovery in Japan that Peter alluded to. North America finished strong as we experienced robust demand throughout the quarter. Load factor ended at over 90% for the second quarter operating on 5% less capacity compared to the same period in 2022. We would have liked to flown more to serve the strong demand, but we're limited by the availability of A321 aircraft due to the engine availability issues previously discussed. Given today's news from Pratt & Whitney, it will likely be a few more quarters until we have the entire A321 fleet available. And none of the forward capacity plans that I discussed today nor the guidance in our press release reflects the potential incremental impact of the newly announced issue disclosed this morning. In the Neighbor Islands, we continue to demonstrate that we are the market carrier of choice with strong demand and load factors throughout the quarter. Although revenue continues to be affected by competitive supply and unsustainably low fares. The most recent DOT statistics show us generating unit revenue that was 2.5 times Southwest with a load factor that was 32 points higher, proving that customers continue to value our superior schedule, high-quality service and loyalty value proposition. While fares remain below historical norms, they did increase 6% from the first quarter. We saw a tangible recovery in Japan during the second quarter. Our load factor improved to 77% for the quarter and peaked at 94% for the month of June. U.S. point-of-sale traffic remained historically strong, but it was even more encouraging to see Japan point-of-sale progress as we move through the quarter since this segment of the demand has traditionally represented the lion's share of revenue on these routes. We have maintained good momentum in our international network outside of Japan. Local demand in Korea, Australia and New Zealand markets was healthy with additional strength from U.S. point-of-sale traffic from both the Hawaii market and the Mainland. Passenger revenue for our international market, including Japan, was up over 160% for the second quarter of this year, compared to 2022 when the initial wave of easing restrictions was commencing. Our co-brand credit card had another record second quarter sales with revenue up almost 11% over the same period in 2022. On the cargo front, as mentioned in prior calls, activity is normalized back to 2019 levels. Second quarter revenues were down just under 30% year-over-year, but to put in context, cargo operations performed better than 2019 for the same period. Now looking ahead to the third quarter. We are anticipating strong summer demand. To give a little more color in North America, our capacity is forecasted to be down a few percentage points year-over-year. Note again, this forecast does not reflect any changes to our schedules that we might need to make to absorb the newly announced Pratt & Whitney engine challenge. Advanced bookings remained slightly above 2022 while fare levels are slightly lower than 2022 for the same period, driven by some modest year-over-year fare declines in the shorter season. Our system capacity growth will continue to be driven by our international network, our longest stage-length entity with international ASMs up almost 44% over the third quarter of 2022. Since the relaxation of the last COVID-related restrictions in Japan, Japan point-of-sale bookings have begun to accelerate for the remainder of the year. As a comparison, at this point for travel within the third quarter, Japan point-of-sale bookings are double where they were compared to the same metrics over the second quarter. Bookings and fare levels for the Japan outbound August holiday period are strong with fare levels above 2019 despite the headwinds of a weaker yen. As Peter mentioned, we're still operating with less capacity than our pre-pandemic schedule as are our competitors. Even as capacity does come back, we're confident that our product and brand remain well regarded by Japanese consumers and that we will compete well in a resurgent Japanese market. Finally, moving to our Neighbor Island market. We will soon overlap last year's introduction of $39 fares on every seat by Southwest, anticipate a year-over-year improvement in PRASM as we move into the back half of the year. In viewing our entire network, we expect RASM to be down roughly 4% on capacity growth of just over 6% compared to the same period in 2022. We also have other continuing headwinds impacting our RASM comparisons year-over-year. Spoilage continues to be a headwind of over 4 points this quarter and will likely continue to be a headwind for the remainder of 2023. When you combine that with a difficult year-over-year comparisons for cargo and the growth in stage length, it highlights the progress that we were making on the passenger side of our business. Looking beyond this year and into 2024, as Peter mentioned, we are excited for the 787 to join the fleet. The larger 300-seat cabin allows us to grow capacity without changing frequencies. The premium cabin on our 787s not only has an enhanced live flat seat product as mentioned, but also has nearly twice as many seats in the premium cabin as our A330s, allowing us to capture more of the demand for premium products in our markets that we've seen over a sustained period of time. Our first route will likely be from the West Coast of Hawaii, Water colleagues and training and maintenance and we look forward to being able to more optimally use the fleet on longer haul emissions as we grow the fleet. With the exciting prospects of our 787 fleet, rolling out StarLink delivering the benefits from our Amadeus investment and the momentum we're seeing in our markets, in particular, Japan, we're encouraged about what we can accomplish for the rest of the year and into next year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We ended the second quarter with an adjusted EBITDA of about $26 million, which equates to an adjusted loss of $0.47 per share. Looking back at the first-half of the year, while we acknowledge that there is still work to be done, our year-over-year progress is significant and very encouraging. Unit costs, excluding fuel, were generally in line with our expectations for the second quarter. Our pilot wages came in a little higher-than-expected due to operational disruptions that resulted in upgauges and other scheduled changes that caused closing changes to pilot scheduling, offset by maintenance credits we received for grounded A321s, due to engine unavailability. Fuel consumption was lower-than-expected due to slightly less flying during the quarter. Our third quarter costs remain elevated as we near the apex of our preparations before the 787 and A330 freighters enter into service. For example, we currently have about 25% more pilots on property than we did at the end of 2019 for about the same amount of capacity, many of whom are in training. We expect pilot productivity to improve as we begin generating revenue from the freighters and 787s. And the number of pilots in training and transitioning fleets will move towards more normalized levels. That being said, we expect our third quarter unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, to be about 8.5% higher than the same period in 2022. This is primarily driven by about 4.5 percentage points from increases in labor costs, which are primarily a combination of the new pilot contract and the higher number of pilots in training. About 2 points from a higher number of heavy maintenance events and 1 point from higher airport rates. Airport rate increases will be an ongoing headwind to unit costs as they are increasing, on average, at a rate higher than that of industry average, most notably our rates for Hawaii airports, where we have the most activity. As labor and other rates increase, we're focused on finding efficiencies throughout the company. As we invest heavily in technology to modernize legacy systems, we have a distinct focus on accessing data to enhance our analytical capability. We have also negotiated work roles that will improve our productivity, not all of which have been fully implemented. And we're investing in tools for our frontline to help them become more efficient and effective. Now that we're midway through the year, we have clear visibility to what the remainder of the year looks like as our costs are tracking largely in line with expectations. With that said, we'll be tightening our full-year CASM ex guidance range to a 3% to 5% year-over-year. As Peter mentioned, we received notification from Boeing that our first 787 delivery will be slightly delayed from November of this year to January next year, and will also impact our remaining 2024 deliveries. This delay will move some CapEx from 2023 to 2024 so we now believe our CapEx for this year will be about $280 million. The decrease due to the deferred delivery is combined with some puts and takes from changes in the PDP schedule and other adjustments. 2023 is a year in which we're making substantial investment in our fleet, technology and guest experience, which are reflected in both our operating costs and capital expenditures. We're investing in our future, and we're executing on multiple initiatives to build a stronger business that will generate significant shareholder value. And with that, we can open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. On the Japan bookings, just curious what you've noticed anything different versus the 2019 travelers. Like do you have any data around just length of stay, potentially what your expectations are for their spending pattern. And then maybe if you could just touch on the advanced bookings of these. I assume a lot of them are really close and just given what you're saying, but any color there would be helpful.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, Conor. We haven't seen any, kind of, material change in length of stay yet. Your comment on advanced purchase is we have seen a real material change as the markets come back, and it is coming back at a lot different pace relative to like 2019, we don't have some of the advanced booking base that we would have. And so as we look out in the further quarters, that's a little bit more challenging, but we're really encouraged the pace we're seeing. We're going to have I think, a really strong third quarter and the pace that we're building into the fourth quarter is really encouraging. So I think we're on a good track. We're seeing a little more individual bookings and so a little less through agencies, a little more direct with us, which is great because it allows us to market and merchandise directly to customers. And so we're encouraged with all those trends.\nPeter Ingram: And Conor, I might just add specifically with respect to Japan. One of the differences, if you go back to 2019 and prior, is we would typically tell -- sell a significant proportion of our inventory through blocks with the major Japanese travel agencies. And that would give us a sort of very early committed share of traffic. So the curve now is very different since we haven't, at this point, reintroduced blocks through the travel agency, and we're getting a much higher proportion of our shares directly through our website and through online travel agencies that didn't use the blocks. So it's more of a steady build up to departure data as opposed to having a big chunk of inventory that's already accounted for with the blocks. And we've obviously got to calibrate ourselves for that demand curve, but we're pretty pleased with what we've seen. And Brent mentioned the 94% load factor in June. I think that's an indication that we're capable of filling up the airplanes and certainly at least on the capacity that's in the market right now.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Helpful. And I know it's obviously really early on the whole Pratt issue, but just curious if you could provide any context around potential capacity headwinds that you're thinking about there? And then on the flip side, Shannon, I think you mentioned that you're getting maintenance credits. Is that how we should expect this to kind of play out for you going forward? Just again, any goalpost that you may have, and you realize that it's only hours old. So any help would be helpful. Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I appreciate that. Not only is it only hours old, but the announcement was when at least I was sleeping this morning. So I had to catch up a little bit when I got up. What I can tell you is that they've identified a number of engines and it's specific by engine serial number that we'll need to go through inspection. Some of them will be by the end of this year and some will be going out over the next nine to 12 months. I think it was the announcement that they made. As it pertains to us for the engines that will be looked at this year, it's a fairly small number. So I don't think there is major surgery that might be needed. And -- but it's too early for us to speculate specifically, because the impact on our schedule is a combination not only of what gets removed, but what we have fair support for, either from our engines coming back from the shop or from spares that are supplied by Pratt & Whitney to support the operating carriers that are out there. And I think one of the things, frankly, that Pratt & Whitney can do to support their installed operating base is work with Airbus on the allocation of engines to -- between the proportion that goes to new production for aircraft that are not yet delivered and the proportion that goes to supporting that spares pool. So all of that, I think, is going to have to be sorted out over the next little while. We will -- we're eager to firm up a plan, because to the extent that we did have to make any changes to our schedule for the back half of the year, the time to do that is now. So we really do want to understand this quickly. But it's sort of happening in real time right now. In fact, our team is on a conference call with the Pratt team as we're sitting here on a conference call with you. So there will be more developments to come in the next little while on this. As far as the credits, I can just tackle that one, too, since I'm already talking. They do come in the form of credits back on our -- what would otherwise be our power by the hour expense. And so they get reflected in the income statement as reductions to our maintenance expense lines.\nConor Cunningham: Appreciate the detail. Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Sure. Thanks, Conor.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nShannon Doherty: Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Shannon Doherty on for Mike. So just my first one. Now that we're in the second half of the year, can you provide us some update for the start of the Amazon service. It sounds like from the opening script that the store may have been pushed back out just sometime in 2024. But have you thought about how you're going to break out the cargo guidance? And any broader update here would be really helpful.\nPeter Ingram: No. The start hasn't been pushed back. We expect to be operating in revenue service in October. The first aircraft has been delivered to us here, and we're doing employee familiarization. So I think you may have confused that with the comment about the 787, which the delivery is being pushed back to '24 but we didn't actually expect to have the 787 in operation before early '24 anyway. So no changes to our 2023 plans on either of those except for the timing of the 787 CapEx. This year, because our operations from Amazon -- for Amazon will be fairly limited, it's not particularly material to our financial results. To the extent it is, it's been incorporated as investments as we go through the preliminary preparations we need to do. And so it's a bit of an expense drag on us in 2023, and we'll see revenue rent more materially as we go into 2024.\nShannon Doherty: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And can you also share what the potential cost savings will be from transitioning the A330 maintenance in-house? Should we expect to see CASM ex be lower next year as we lap the labor training costs and maintenance events? That'd be helpful.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I think there's a couple of things. So just from the A330 maintenance transition, we do expect to have savings. So what would be third-party expenses will now be reflected in the combination of maintenance expenses on our lines and labor costs as we do some of that work ourselves, but the net of that is a savings. Overall, in terms of the impact from CASM ex, I think we'll hold off on guiding 2024 right now. But I would say that there are other factors that influence it like the timing of maintenance events and heavy checks and all of those things are going to play and when we get around to guiding for a 2024 CASM outlook, we'll be incorporating all of those factors.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. The one thing, Shannon, that I would add there is where we'll see a lot of the savings, it will be hard to tease out in the financial statements because it's really as we grow the 330 fleet with the Amazon traders, we can now grow that fleet with a lower per unit maintenance cost because we're able to get better productivity through shared resources -- internal resources. So that's really, I think, more of a benefit on the cost side.\nShannon Doherty: No, thank you both.\nPeter Ingram: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Helane Becker with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.\nHelane Becker: Yes. Thank you very much, operator. Hi, everybody and thank you very much for the time this afternoon. My first question is, are you concerned about the revenue outlook or maybe the unit revenue outlook being down relative to capacity being up so much? Maybe capacity is not up so much, but up.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Let me start with that, and we expect that there may be some questions here given some of the other earnings calls that have been going on this season so far and earlier today. What I would say is we're pretty pleased with the revenue environment right now. We've got some changes this quarter in terms of the mix of our flying, with longer stage length flying as we bring more of the international business back year-over-year. And we had a couple of factors that Brent called out in this call in terms of spoilage and cargo revenue that we're running at unusually high rates last year in the third quarter that aren't in the third quarter. If you separate out the spoilage and cargo, our RASM is sort of flattish to a little bit up. And that's compared to a strong demand environment last year. And I think we feel pretty good about that, and we feel pretty good about how bookings are coming in going forward. So I am not raising caution flags today. I think we're in a good environment, and I hope, particularly as it relates to Japan, but things are just going to accelerate from here.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I think the only thing I would add is that we've got that positive -- excluding those couple of items, we would be positive on the RASM side. And when you look at what our stage link growth, given almost all of our capacity growth is on the international side, pretty encouraging results and pretty good progress from where we had been and relative to the rest of the industry as we look out in the third quarter.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's very helpful. And then my other question is this. I was looking at some numbers today from the Hawaii Tourism Authority and they showed the second quarter travel to the islands was down 6.5% in the domestic market. And every month sequentially was worse than the month before. And I'm sure, Peter, you see that data as well and the whole team since you're so close to it. But do you expect that Hawaii vacation to continue to be -- or maybe the question is really, do you know what percentage of your travelers that come off the West Coast and from North America are people with second homes in Hawaii and kind of repeat travelers versus that aspirational vacation that you get from people that generally come from the East Coast?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I think it's a mix, and I don't have precise numbers on those, although we could probably -- by looking at -- certainly for what's booked on our website by looking at ZIP code data, we can probably discern a little bit how that mix has changed. I just don't have that at my fingertips. What I would say in terms of the traffic numbers you mentioned at the beginning is a couple of things. One, industry capacity right now is a little bit lower than it was. It's down a small bit on our capacity. I think some other carriers, as they have responded to very strong demand in other geographies have moved some of the capacity that they had when Hawaii was one of the few places that was working back in 2021, and the early part of 2022, they started to reallocate some of that capacity away. So it's not being reflected in empty airplanes. Our airplanes are very full, revenue is holding up well. And I don't have anything that I look at that sort of causes me to question whether Hawaii is going to continue to be a desirable aspirational vacation location for people. It's the best visitor place to go in the world, and we expect it to continue to be that way going forward.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s hugely helpful. Thank you very much for all of that. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. So your trimming capacity but seen Japan improved, was the capacity cut based on any change in your demand outlook? I know the GTF headlines aren't incorporated into your changed outlook yet. So just kind of trying to figure out what drove that cut. And then maybe just a quick related one on the GTF IC 16 A321neos, the GTF engines, it's close to 30% of your fleet. Is your understanding that most of those don't fall in the inspection objective?\nPeter Ingram: Sorry, Catherine, you mentioned capacity cut, I'm not sure what you're referring to on that.\nCatherine O'Brien: Maybe I'm backwards, on the full-year.\nPeter Ingram: For the full-year? Yes, for the full-year, it's really a function of having much lower Japan flying in the front part of the year, I think.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. And just to really -- Catherine, just tightening up as we work through kind of the back half of the year where we were versus our expectations, calibrating a little bit on when we thought we would be back to a more robust 321 schedule, so it's just kind of working through the timing of that in the back half of the year and then just tightening up for the full-year, so\u2026\nPeter Ingram: I mean if anything right now, we're -- the constraint on how much we fly is not demand, it's how many aircraft we have. We're looking forward to getting the 787s next year and helping to give us more capacity to expand.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's more like an operational adjustment versus demand.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. That's correct. And then sorry, can you repeat the second part of your question? I think you had one about the engines.\nCatherine O'Brien: Yes, yes. So I mean, this is just from ASCEND data, so take with the grain of salt. But when I looked at it this morning, it looks like you had 16 A321neos with the GTF engines that's about 30% of your fleet. Is your understanding that most of those don't fall within the inspection directive? And listen, to repeat Conor, I know this is like hours old. So I appreciate any color.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. So the fact is all of -- we have 18 aircraft. All of the 18 aircraft were delivered to us during the period that the, sort of, production issue was in place. I think it goes from 2015 to 2021. Not all of our engines on wing now, though, are currently affected because a number of those engines have been in the shop since then. Some of the parts replaced, some of the engines that are operating on our fleet today are engines that are lease spares that may have been produced outside that window. So we do think it's a limited number of serial numbers of specific engines that need to be worked on. And again, our team is going to work through that in the days ahead with the folks from Pratt & Whitney. And I should just say that we hate it when these things come up, but we also recognize that the whole foundation of our industry is that we operate safely. And Pratt & Whitney has got a safety management system, and that's the process they're going through to decide which engines need to be evaluated. We have safety management systems and processes that are in place to make sure we operate. And that's the first thing we're going to do before we think about any adjustments that needed to be made to what we're flying and how we're flying the aircraft.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's super helpful. Maybe if I could just sneak one revenue one in for Brent. Just thinking through your three main markets, how should we think about that, the sequential performance of underlying the system sequential improvement you're expecting in 3Q versus 2Q. It sounds like based on your fare commentary, maybe North America decelerating sounds like Inter-island might be accelerating and then International. I wasn't sure it sounded positive, but I wasn't sure it's given some of the comments on capacity, that would be super helpful.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. There's several moving parts in there, Catherine. I think it's a fair characterization. I think we'll be kind of flattish to down a little bit in North America from a sequential basis, but I would say mostly flattish. International continues to improve, and that's really on the strength of Japan and the strength we're seeing on the traffic basis there. And Neighbor Island, I think we'll see a little bit of sequential improvement again, a lot of moving pieces in last year from a comp perspective from both 2Q and 3Q. And given kind of the lateness of booking in that market, we still have a little more runway to go in terms of how 3Q pans up. But I think overall, your assessment was pretty fair.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Didora: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. First question just for Peter. Just given this whole kind of international theme this summer of U.S. travelers out bound, I would have to think it's taking away some Hawaii vacations. Do you have any sense or any metrics that you provide that give us a sense for maybe how much volume or revenue has been kind of lost this summer as people travel abroad? Just trying to get a sense of how things could look as kind of travel patterns normalize a bit. A - Peter Ingram Yes. I don't have something that specifically answers that question. But I'd come back to the point that our revenue has been strong in the North America routes. It's very comparable to where we were a year ago when we were in a very strong demand environment. Some of a slight amount of our capacity is lower year-over-year as we've shifted back to some of our own international flying. And some of the other capacity from our domestic competitors has moved elsewhere as well. So that's why you may see a little bit less in terms of total traffic to the islands this year. But I don't think it's demand weakness here so much as it's capacity being allocated to other geographies as people shift to changing demand globally. So we feel pretty good about where we are. Hawaii is an incredibly desirable destination and we're blessed to be here every day.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Understood. And then two follow-ups for Shannon here. Just one, just in terms of CapEx. I think I caught the 2023 new number, but obviously some moving parts, kind of any guideposts that you have for 2024 right now?\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Andrew. Not this point. Obviously, it will be higher. We're taking in more 787s next year, but we're still working through some of the details on things like the PDP is moving with the recent notification by Boeing. And so not quite ready to put guidance out yet.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. Got it. And then lastly, just in terms of Amazon. Sorry, I forget, are those -- are the start-up costs this year included in your CASM ex? And then how should we think about kind of 2023 start-up and training costs for Amazon moving into 2024?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. I'll take that one as well. Yes, we have all of the Amazon costs included in our CASM guide, that includes the start-up as well for the full year, the direct operating costs in the fourth quarter. As Peter mentioned, they're pretty small this year, which is why we're not splitting them out. I think for next year, we'll definitely be able to talk in more detail and put some of that stuff out of the passenger business, because it does -- here, we have cost and revenue that aren't necessarily linked to ASM. So it's not a great ratio to report on, it's not that helpful to you. So we will definitely talk about that more a little later this year, early next year as to how we're splitting that out and what the direct guide is. But next year for '24, we definitely will have that put out better.\nAndrew Didora: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Thank you. Peter, I just have one question, three parts here. Your mention of strategic initiatives in your prepared remarks, could you comment on that? And then also, I realized that this Pratt & Whitney news here is very new, but could you help us frame assuming you get to where you need to be with the fleet, how much potential upside there is there within utilization block hours per day or however you want to frame that? And then part C, I realize it's early, but if you could help us think about core inflation for cost for next year.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Let me tackle the first part and I may have to have you go back again and remind me of the second and third part. But in terms of strategic initiatives, this has been one of our themes as we went into the year, that this was a year we had started a number of projects coming into 2023 that were slated to be delivered this year. And things like our transition to Amadeus Altea, our A330 maintenance, bringing 787 on board, bringing Starlink on board. And so we really sort of identified as much internally as externally that we wanted our team focused on making sure we got those major initiatives over the finish line and delivered on our commitments. And I do feel good that we're making good progress. The Amadeus transition was a sort of monumental technology achievement for us. And we have our safety management system work was something else we are working on. That's been progressing over the last couple of years, and we're in a much better place right now, bringing the A330 maintenance fully in-house and getting that over the line. We now unfortunately have the timing of 787 slipping a bit, but only by a couple of months, and there's been a lot of great work by our team done. So that is moving a pace, and we'll have that plan early next year. We'll have the freighter business online this year, another significant project. So these are all important initiatives and really big investments of time and resource and in some cases, capital for us, but things that we know are going to pay off and make us a better airline going forward.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then for the second quarter, curious where you were in terms of block hours per segment or however you measure your core utilization and where you'd like to get to, assuming that these Pratt & Whitney issues are worked out. And then the last part was, again, I realize it's early, but how should we be thinking about core inflation for next year? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. In terms of our sort of block hour efficiency, I don't have the number on my fingertips, but I would tell you that with particularly early in the quarter with the lower Japan demand, we weren't flying our A330s as intensely. We expected -- or was always our plan this year for that to pick up through the back half of the year. In some ways, that was fortunate because that absorbed some of the challenges we had with A321 availability as we substituted those aircraft. So there is an opportunity for us to improve aircraft utilization next year. Offsetting that, one of the things we'll be thinking about is making sure we have the right level of spare aircraft capacity to provide resilience. So it's not just trying to squeeze everything out of that efficiency as possible, but it's also making sure you've got the right level to have a resilient operation as well as good efficiency. In terms of employee efficiency, just to touch on that as well. I'd say there's still opportunities for us to make some gains going into 2024. And particularly, as we have had less than full utilization of our flight attendant workforce without the Japan flying that has -- that is heavier staffed in terms of flight attendance. And in our pilot ranks, we still have a lot of people, I think Shannon mentioned this in her remarks, who are either in training or instructing and that means they're not flying revenue block hours. So one of the things we're looking forward to over the next year or so is getting that back into a normal steady-state level as opposed to the accelerated level of training that we've had over the last couple of years.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: And then on core inflation?\nShannon Okinaka: I'll take that a little bit on the cost side. So from about 2019 to where we stand today, we're looking at a, call it, a 4% to 4.5% increase from a CAGR perspective on our costs. And that's really -- as we look across the industry, it's generally in line with the industry and what we're seeing around us. When you take our significant costs, primarily, labor, fuel and airports. On the labor side, the vast majority of our employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements, and we have fully executed agreements with all of our unions through 2023 and 2024, the next one to become amendable is in 2025. And so from that perspective, we're kind of insulated from significant inflation that we may not be factoring in. From an airports perspective, we do workload and I mentioned earlier, that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing pretty significant cost increases and especially in Hawaii. There\u2019s a lot of capital projects in the Hawaii airports that are coming through our rent rates. And so we work pretty closely with the State of Hawaii on that. But I mean we\u2019re also just investing a lot to try and kind of offset a lot of these cost increases. So while we don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t have what our core inflation assumptions for our forecast at my fingertips, there\u2019s a lot that goes on to really offset or mitigate that risk.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your questions.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Hey, thanks. It kind of sounds like we're all after the same information here. So at the risk of kicking a dead horse, Shannon, I know you don't want to talk about capacity next year, but what it sounds like is directionally, next year could be a pretty big catch-up year. So I guess maybe we could just start with the fleet if we -- it looks like that will be about 13% larger than 2019. And please correct me on that. But then just -- and also just given the runway construction there, it seems logical the departures. And as you were sharing earlier, efficiency metrics could finally normalize next year. So is there any fly at least to this line of thinking?\nPeter Ingram: Maybe I'll just give you some general comments to think about the capacity piece of that. A lot of what you're going to see next year, some of the growth is just going to be the annualization of flying that we've been adding back over the course of this year, particularly as we have in our plans that we ramp up our operations to Japan over the back part of the year and into 1Q. That will be in place throughout the year next year. So really what we're looking at in terms of growth beyond that sort of annualization is going to be a couple of 787s coming into the fleet over the course of the year. That will be spread throughout the year. So the last delivery may be later. They'll have the A330 freighters coming on. And then the other thing we have the capacity to is we do have A330s of next year and over the next few years that are coming or to the end of their leases. And what we've always said about the 787 is it's going to be a combination of replacement and growth. And we'll calibrate that appropriately to make sure that we can absorb it and make sure the market can absorb it and it will be efficient growth for us as we get into those periods.\nDaniel McKenzie: Yes. Okay. That's helpful. And then a second question here, just the -- I'm wondering if you can clarify the story around premium seats. Where are we at today with respect to growth? And in 2024, big picture, what is the expectation in this part of the story. And I'm thinking most of the premium growth is going to be on the international side of the business.\nBrent Overbeek: So yes, I think, Dan, as you look into '24, we'll have still a relatively limited number of 787. So that premium growth will start to come in. That will be really more of a story kind of in '25 and beyond. And I think as we've looked at the resource, the 787 is going to be a fantastic airplane, but we're going to get most value out of it as where it can fly out of longer ranges and where we have high levels of premium demand, and those are places like Sydney, like Tokyo, like New York, Boston, those kinds of places. We'll work our way into that over the course of next year. But I really think that the growing number of premium seats for us is really -- we'll see some of that as we trickle into next year, but it's really probably a little bit more of a \u201825-story. While we're excited to have a new product and the growth in the space that's really where we're going kind of in \u201825 and beyond.\nDan McKenzie: Yes, understood. Okay, thanks for the time guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Peter Ingram for closing comments.\nPeter Ingram: All right. Thank you, Darryl.

First Quarter 2023 Financial Results Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Marcy Morita, Managing Director, Investor Relations. Thank you, Marcy. You may begin.\nMarcy Morita: Thank you, Camila. Hello everyone and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings first quarter 2023 results conference call. Here with me on Honolulu are, Peter Ingram, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Overbeek, Chief Revenue Officer; and Shannon Okinaka, Chief Financial Officer. We also have several other members of our management team in attendance for the Q&A. Peter will provide an overview of our performance, Brent will discuss revenue, and Shannon will discuss cost and the balance sheet. At the end of the prepared remarks, we will open the call up to questions. By now, everyone should have access to the press release that went out at about 4 o'clock Eastern Time today. If you have not received the release, it is available on the Investor Relations' page web page of our website, hawaiianairlines.com. During our call today, we will refer at times to adjusted or non-GAAP numbers and metrics. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers and metrics can be found at the end of today's press release posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. As a reminder, the following prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our future plans and potential future financial and operating performance. Management may also make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future performance and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer you to Hawaiian Holdings' recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. These include our most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K as well as subsequent reports filed on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Hello Marcy. Aloha everyone and thank you for joining us today. 2023 is off to an encouraging start. Many of the challenges we have discussed on previous calls remain, but leisure demand and the substantial majority of our markets remain and we outperformed our revenue guidance in the first quarter. At the same time, we continue to execute against a wide variety of important initiatives this year that are going to position us extremely well for the years to come. Last week, we made the transition of our Passenger Service System to Amadeus' Altea platform. This is the largest technology project in the history of our company and hundreds of people worked for more than a year to make it happen. The core PSS transition went smoothly, but we did experience issues in some of the Hawaiian Airline systems that connect it particularly our website and kiosk check-in. Those systems have been stabilized since the end of last week. But in the three days immediately following the cutover, we face crowded airport lobbies and we're unable to take the normal volume of bookings on our website. We expect a small one-time impact on revenue in 2Q as a result about which Brent will offer some thoughts. As you would expect, I wish the transition had gone flawlessly. But in spite of the challenges, I was inspired to see how our team and partners pulled together to take care of our guests and solve problems. What's most important to me is that first that we are taking care of our guests with empathy and care and second, where we go from here. Right now, we are focused on ensuring that the systems we've implemented are stable and working as planned and that we are addressing any lingering transition issues. Beyond that is where the real benefits of this investment will be realized as we begin to build new digital experiences and revenue generating products, on top of this fundamentally sounder technology foundation. In less than a week, we will complete another important project to in source substantial elements of our A330 maintenance from a third-party, reducing our steady state expenses, giving our team greater control of our day-to-day operation, and allowing us to scale our costs more effectively as we grow the fleet with the Amazon A330 freighters. Beyond these two significant initiatives, there is much more ahead of this year. One of our key themes this year is delivering on our commitments, a nod to the fact that as we move forward from disruptive couple of years, we continue to invest in our future and several of these initiatives are coming to fruition this year. It's good to be off to a positive start. Brent will talk about our commercial performance in more detail, but I'll hit a couple of highlights. Demand in the largest part of our network from the US Mainland to Hawaii remained strong. First quarter performance met our expectations and we are well set up for 2Q and the summer. Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea continue to see solid demand in the first quarter of the year. On the Neighbor Island network, we continue to face a pricing environment that delays a return to capability on these routes. We are closely monitoring DOT reported yield and load factor information as it becomes available. And month-after-month, it shows that we are resoundingly outperforming Southwest on both fronts. Inter-island pricing pressure abated somewhat sequentially in 1Q. But remember, this is on the heels of five plus months of our competitor offering last seat availability of $39 fares inclusive of taxes on every flight. Demand recovery of outbound Japan travel remained slow. We've seen some green shoots in recent weeks, but our Japan routes remain far from a complete recovery. With the extension of slot flexibility for a few more months, we are going to fly less Japan capacity in the summer than we anticipated when building our 2023 plants. Some capacity will be shifted to the more rewarding US Mainland market this summer, but not as much as we would prefer as we are still plagued with limitations on our A321neo fleet capacity as a result of our engine suppliers' inability to meet fair engine commitments amidst an overtaxed engine overhaul supply chain. At the moment, we have five aircraft grounded awaiting engines relative to an overall fleet of 18. We expect to return one of these aircraft to service later this week with another one returning about a week after that if the current plan holds. We're working with Pratt & Whitney to find a way beyond this situation, but in the meantime, some of the A330s that aren't flying to Japan are backfilling service on routes that we would prefer to operate with A321s. And we've been less aggressive in scheduling summer capacity overall than we otherwise would have been. While I'm on the subject of operational challenges, let me provide an update on the impact of runway construction in Honolulu on our reliability. Since October, Honolulu Airport has operated without access to its primary arrivals runway. The project, which has experienced delays, is currently scheduled to be completed before the end of May. By which time we will have effectively seen seven months of impairment to the airport's peak hour capacity. Air Traffic Control protocols to manage the disruption have had a severe negative impact on our Neighbor Island operation. For the past several months, we have commonly seen our 717s held on the ground with extended weights for approval from Air Traffic Control to depart. In the most recent period, this has been a daily phenomenon. These delays then cascade through the day for subsequent flights scheduled for the delayed aircraft. We have made adjustments to add buffer to our operation, putting slack time in the schedule to provide opportunities to recover a line of flying after ATC delays. This initially yielded some promising improvement to reliability. But in recent weeks with the return of daylight savings time schedules, we have seen performance deteriorate again. Unfortunately, there is no quick fix here and we expect the challenges to persist until the construction project concludes. I know this has an impact on our guests who depend on reliable inter-island service and for their jobs and personal lives. And we are absolutely committed to getting back to our historically industry leading on time performance. On a more positive note, we were pleased to see the ratification of our new pilot contract in February. The new terms went into effect on March 2nd. This contract recognizes the contributions of our pilots to our company and reflects the evolution of the industry's labor economics. The pilot contract follows the ratification of deals with our other collective bargaining units over the course of 2020 and 2021. As we sit here today, it will be 2025 before we have a contract becoming amendable for any work group. Given the more unsettled state of bargaining at some of our competitors, we feel very well-positioned in this important area. We also remain focused on our environmental commitments. We've published a roadmap which details our plan to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, including commitment to considerable progress in the 2030s. And to help put that plan into action, we've announced an agreement with biofuel company Gevo to purchase 50 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel over five years. The availability of SAF is essential to reducing our carbon footprint and we will continue to invest in meaningful partnerships to help develop this nascent industry. Earlier, I mentioned that 2023 is a year for Hawaiian to deliver on our commitments. The PSS transition and our A330 maintenance and sourcing are significant milestones. Let me take a moment to talk about some of the other initiatives that have seen progress. We have a more clear picture now than at any time in the past few years on the timetable for introducing 787 to our fleet with the first delivery scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year and a planned entry into service date in 1Q 2024. The fleet will grow to four by the end of 2024. Planning and training have already kicked into gear and we don't expect any impact from the recent brief interruption of Boeing 787 deliveries. We also continue to make progress toward commencing freighter flying for Amazon. Revenue flights will begin in the fourth quarter and planning is on track. As a reminder, we will ramp up to 10 freighter aircraft in the operation over the course of 2024. As you can tell, 2023 is shaping up as a very busy year. We aren't yet where we want to be from the standpoint of financial recovery, but there is much to be excited about as we progress into the middle months of 2023. Our team is doing a great job as they always do taking care of our guests and making sure that we compete to win in the markets we serve. Let me turn it over to Brent to go over our commercial performance and outlook in more detail.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter. Aloha everyone. As Peter mentioned, leisure demand remained strong for most of our markets in the first quarter. Total revenue was up just over 28% as we operated a little over 15% more capacity versus the same period in 2022. With that said, the impact of the Omicron virus in the first quarter of 2022 makes it an atypical comparison. For reference, total revenue is shy of 2019 by a little less than 7% on just over 1% more capacity. System RASM was up just over 11% year-over-year for the first quarter, which is better than the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance underpins the strength we're seeing in North America and the rebuild in our international markets, tempered by the low fare environment in the Neighbor Island market. North America continues to do well and we're encouraged by booking volumes that we saw from late March through mid-April. For the first quarter, a 10-point improvement in load factor drove revenue for North America up approximately 20% year-over-year, despite operating a touch less capacity compared to the same period in 2022. Neighbor Island revenue performance continued to be challenged low fares. Our competitor is no longer offering $39 last seat availability as they were for most of the second half of last year. However, low fares remain broadly available in the market. Hawaiian was founded to serve the inter-island market and our 93-year commitment to the market in Hawaii remains unchanged. We offer the best service and schedule in the market and consumers continue to choose our product as demonstrated by the most recent DOT statistics, which show we have a unit revenue that was almost three times our competitor and a load factor that was almost 30 points higher. The steady return of demand in our international markets resulted in better than expected performance in the first quarter, due largely to the strength in our Auckland and Sydney routes. Strong traffic gains for US point of sale demand led the way for international routes. Passenger revenue for our international market including Japan is up almost 300% for the first quarter of this year compared to 2022, keeping in mind that the New Zealand, Korea, and Japan travel restrictions were being relaxed in the first quarter of 2022. For reference compared to 2019, for the same period, our passenger revenue is down 32%, driven by the slow recovery of Japan. Japan continues to lag the recovery of the other markets that we are seeing strong performance from US point of sale and steady improvement from Japan point of sale. Slot relief in Hennetta [ph] through July enables us to shift A330 aircraft to other markets so we can capture the demand there. However, as Peter mentioned, we face operational challenges with our A321 engines that prevent us from optimizing our schedule. There are many markets where we would ideally like to fly an A321, but are now compelled to fly an A330 due to our current shortage of available for service A321s. To add to the operational inefficiencies we're experiencing due to fewer A321s in service, the runway construction in Honolulu, and Air Traffic Control protocols have further challenged our operation. With the numerous delays imposed on us in Honolulu, we've added block time and additional turn time to our flights, which ultimately results in lower efficiency. We're hopeful that the timeline for the project stays on track and we can return to our historical levels of dependability and efficiency in the latter portion of the second quarter. Our premium product demands remain strong across the system and RASM for these products is still near record highs. Ancillary products remain an important and growing source of revenue and we're continually looking for further opportunities to optimize revenue from our seating products. Our co-branded credit card had another record for the first quarter with revenue up almost 11% compared to the same period in 2022. Our cargo team had a strong quarter from a historical perspective, but off from the record highs of 2022. First quarter revenues were down just over 25% year-over-year as international yields softened from their 2022 peak and we didn't fly any charters for the US Postal Service. However, compared to 2019, first quarter revenue was up 16%. As Peter mentioned, while much of our PSS transition was a success, we didn't counter issues with booking through our website at the end of last week. Hawaiianairlines.com is our primary distribution channel and in 2022, it represented approximately 60% of our revenue. The website performance issues are stabilized, however, with the extended outage last week, we believe that we will have roughly a $4 million to $6 million drag on revenue in the second quarter. Now, let me give you a bit more background about each of our geographies as we enter the second quarter. In North America, our capacity is down a few percentage points year-over-year, primarily driven from our exit from New Orlando market. Advanced bookings remain both above 2022 and 2019 levels and we anticipate fair levels will end up similar to last year. The vast majority of our capacity growth is coming from international, our longest stage length entity where our capacity is up almost 145% compared to the second quarter of 2022. This is a function of methodically ramping capacity across Japan and New Zealand as travel restrictions were starting to abate last year. Not surprisingly, advanced bookings looked strong on a year-over-year basis, but we still have a ways to go to get back to our historical levels. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we're clearly outperforming our competitor in the Neighbor Island market, but it remains a challenging revenue environment. Our capacity is up about 8% year-over-year and industry capacity is up 18% year-over-year. The second quarter of last year was the recent high point for average fares in this entity. So, at this point, it looks like it will be our most difficult year-over-year comp. Current published capacity levels look to moderate on a year-over-year basis as we head into the back half of the year. Adding all that up, we think system ticket revenue will be a few points short of our capacity growth -- our year-over-year capacity growth of roughly 12%. However, as we mentioned in previous quarters, we do have some year-over-year headwinds impacting our overall RASM comparisons. Most notably spoilage has turned to a more normal historical level, but creates a three and a half point headwind year-over-year. We also have a few other aspects of our business where we've had a significant change. This year, we didn't find any dedicated mail flights for the Postal Service, largely exited our third-party ground handling business and we'll be a much -- and we'll have a much smaller amount of charter flying for the Department of Defense. Together, these changes create just over an additional 2.5 points of RASM headwind. In total, we think RASM will be down about 10% year-over-year. We know we have more work to do, but we're staying the course on strengthening our international markets, tapping into demand from our US Mainland to Hawaii markets, addressing the market needs of Japan, and staying on top of our Neighbor Island travel. As we get past the external factors affecting our operational efficiency, we'll continue delivering on our commitments. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks Brent. Aloha everyone and thank you for joining us today. We ended the first quarter of this year with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $85 million, which equates to an adjusted loss of $2.17 per share. These results are consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. Costs, excluding fuel, were also generally in line with our expectations for the first quarter. But we have not quantify the full financial impact of the operational issues that Peter discussed. One significant area of impact was in our fuel consumption, which ended higher than expected. Although the fleet changes did not have an impact on overall capacity, the change in our fleet mix degraded our fuel efficiency, causing about half of the overage versus our original expectations. The other half of the variance was primarily due to increased taxi times and block hours, resulting from airport and Air Traffic Control congestion. We have considered these impacts in our guidance going forward. As Peter mentioned, we're very pleased that our pilots have ratified a four-year contract. While the contract provides for immediate wage increases effective at the beginning of March, the company gained important scheduling and work role flexibility that would help us manage the business more efficiently. The salary increases contributed to just over half a point to CASMex for the first quarter, and the impact to full year 2023 is estimated to add a little under two points to CASMex. For adjusted reporting purposes, we excluded the impact of the signing bonus and one-time increase in vacation liability as they were not related to first quarter performance and would be anomalous in a period-over-period comparison. While we're on the topic of non-recurring items, in the first quarter, we received a one-time interest payment of about $5 million related to a federal tax refund and recognized a $10 million gain from the sale of commercial real estate that we owned, both of which were excluded from our adjusted results. We also adjusted out a credit resulting from the reversal of an accrued liability due to the accounting for the termination of our A330 maintenance contract. For the second quarter, we expect our unit costs ex-fuel and special items to be about 1.5% higher than the same period in 2022, primarily driven by about two percentage points from the increased from the new pilot contract and about one point from heavier flying of our A330s to the West Coast due to A321 unavailability, offset by about point and a half benefit from spreading our fixed costs over larger capacity and half a point from fewer heavy maintenance events in the quarter. We're committed to staying within our full year CASMex guidance range of up 1% to 5% versus 2022. The full year range reflects larger year-over-year changes in the second half of the year, partially due to timing of maintenance events and the timing of airport-related rate increases. We've talked a bit about the operational challenges we experienced and will continue to experience, all of which puts pressure on our unit costs. Despite these pressures, we're finding ways to mitigate cost increases, including efficiencies related to staffing and training and optimized workarounds for A321 engine delays as well as Honolulu runway construction. Just a quick note on the balance sheet. As we plan for the delivery of our first 787, although we're comfortable using cash to pay for the delivery this year, we are evaluating the market to assess the viability of various financing options. With that said, I'm pleased that we have the flexibility to pay cash if desired to keep leverage and interest cost down. We remain focused on what we can control to return to profitability. While we navigate short-term challenges, we're also investing in our future to reduce costs through increased efficiency and to enhance our revenue generating capability. We're confident that the investments that we're making this year will provide value to our guests, employees, and shareholders when operating in a steady state. With that, we can open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi everybody and thank you very much for the time this afternoon. On the issue with the runway, Peter, I think you said that it took longer than expected -- or is taking longer than expected, which kind of is not surprising given the management of the airport in the past. But do you know if your competitor and inter-island flying has the same issues that you have?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, Helane thanks. The project was originally scheduled I believe to be done more on a February timeframe. So, it's run a couple of months late at this point. It is the case that flights are being held in the Neighbor Islands for both carriers. It is also the case that we have a greater density of flights in the hours of day when the Air Traffic Control disruptions typically go into place. And the fact that our competitor also will often have those airplanes depart the island later on whereas ours are flying back and forth between the islands all day means I think the impact is being more profound on us. But we don't have any indication that Air Traffic Control is particularly disfavoring Hawaiian departures. They are particularly disfavoring the short haul departures in favor of getting the long haul aircraft that are coming in from the Mainland in the late morning on the ground as opposed to having them circle. And so that's why the Neighbor Island impact takes a disproportionate -- or Neighbor Island network takes a disproportionate impact.\nHelane Becker: Got it. That makes perfect sense. And then just for my follow-up, I didn't really catch comments on Japan other than it's reopened. Can you talk at all about how forward bookings are shaping up for the summer months maybe? Thank you.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. Sure Helane. So, we are seeing we've seen some continued improvement in Japan point of sale, not back to the historical levels that we had and certainly our capacity levels reflect that, but we are seeing some signs of improvement. And I think if we look over the last four to six weeks, we've seen some steady progress, not exceptional, but some steady progress in Japan point of sale. We continue see really strong US point of sale traffic, so both Hawaii-originating traffic and traffic from the mainland, that continues to book really strong. Unfortunately, it's a relatively small portion of our overall traffic mix. And so as we look at load factors, we're not going to be up to our historical levels, but we continue to see kind of sequential progress month-over-month as we move from the first quarter into the second and then progress through the second quarter.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Thank you very much.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nConor Cunningham: Hey everyone. Thank you. Peter, I don't know if you gave this or if it's just not relevant anymore. But on 2023 capacity guidance, I mean there's a lot of moving parts from all the issues that you kind of talked about. Is the 9.5% to 12.5% growth that you had previously put out there still relevant today? And if not, maybe you can talk about where the pull downs are happening and all the moving pieces that may make up your outlook for 2023? Thank you.\nShannon Okinaka: Conor, I'll start. This is Shannon. Yes, we did not update our full year ASM guidance, so we still believe that the range is in that 9.5% to 12.5% for full year capacity. We do have -- it is a different mix of what we had planned at the beginning of the year, but we are intending to move some of that Japan capacity over to North America as Brent discussed. Brent, do you want to add anything?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. No, I think we're -- at this point, we're confident that we're still in range. We'll continue to keep an eye and as the A321 situation progresses, we have expectation that that's going to improve as we get through the latter part of this quarter and into the third quarter. And then we'll also keep a keen eye in Japan. And I think both of those could influence it, but at this point we're comfortable with where we're at and certainly within range of the guidance that we've got there.\nConor Cunningham: Yes. Thank you. And then, yes, Shannon, I know you said you don't know the exact impact to all these operational issues and some of the engine problems and whatnot. But when we think about that, I know that you're saying that you expect to be in the full year range, but it just seems like a lot that's going on. Why wouldn't we expect to be at the high end of the range? Are you finding one-for-one offsets as you move forward? Is it just through the productivity and so on? I'm just trying to get a sense for where things shake out there. Thank you.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks Conor. When we put out the guidance at the beginning of the year, we had a number of management issues initiatives in mind. And we had, frankly, also, put in some factor for more management initiatives, we're being really aggressive this year about finding efficiencies. I mean actually, I think, we're doing a really good job so far, which is why we feel pretty comfortable with that that full year range. I don't -- I wouldn't say that at this point, I expect to be on one side or other of that range. But we're -- it's mostly what we're finding looking for is mostly labor efficiencies at this point. And we had so many estimates at the beginning of the year for different initiatives. So, say, like, we didn't know exactly how the A330 maintenance insourcing was going to roll out from a cost per perspective, and we're just finding ways to be more efficient than some of our expectations or estimates at the beginning of the year. So, those are the areas that we're really focused on some of the investments that we're making as well as labor efficiency.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. Maybe this is like a really silly question. It's going to have to go one word answer, but you guys have talked about US point of sale in Japan improving, one of your competitors mentioned that last month at a conference. Is there anything you guys could do from like a marketing perspective to maybe try to capture some more of that US point of sale than your normal mix? Or like, do the slot timings in Japan not work for that or maybe the connecting fare mess doesn't work versus direct? Like just was curious if there's anything you could do to kind of, like, shift and maybe carry more of that US point of sale than typical or that's a silly analyst idea?\nBrent Overbeek: No. Appreciate the perspective and you can send your resume over Catie and you can come join us anytime you want. No, we have made a concerted effort to make sure that we've got connectivity from North America to Hawaii. Obviously, we do well out of Hawaii point of sale, but that North America point of sale business is really what we've been able to tap into a bit more. The challenge we've really got is just security, given how far south we are, it is more inefficient for our guests to do want to come connect through here. So, our total lapsed time is a little bit longer than others, but we have been able to find some opportunities to go out and take some traffic that isn't a normal source of our traffic base. So, we'll continue to look at that both on the pricing or revenue management perspective, but also on marketing side in terms of being able to promote that. And so we've done a fair amount of that already, which has helped us get to this point and we'll continue to look for additional opportunities to do that. It gets a little bit tighter in the summer obviously as Japan load factors pick up a bit more and as our North America load factors creep up as well closer to the 90% level. It gets a little bit more difficult squeeze some of that stuff on board, but we'll continue to look for troughs and opportunities to take advantage of that.\nPeter Ingram: And just to add to that for a bit, I think Brent nailed it that the security of connecting over Honolulu puts a natural constraint on the demand we get from the US Mainland. The other point of US point of sale that is valuable to us, but is also limited is Hawaii point of sale. And I think as most of us in this room go out around our community, we probably all know a number of people who have told us recently that they took their family to Hawaii or to Japan on spring break. It is incredibly common around here, but unfortunately there's only 1.4 million people in Hawaii and that constrains the size of that market as well. So, it's really performing well particularly in those seasonal periods and we'll probably see a little bit more of that over the summertime period as well when kids are out of school again. But there are fundamental natural limits to how big US point of sale is going to be for us on the Japan business.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And then maybe one for Shannon or Peter might want to jump into. But so as CapEx starts to ramp up again this year with the first of your 12 787s closer to year end and then again, in the coming years, how are you thinking about financing these deliveries? I know you said during the prepared remarks that you'd be comfortable using cash to finance this year's delivery possibly. But what about next year? I think in the 10-K of about $500 million in aircraft CapEx and the [Indiscernible] table over the next over 2024 and 2025. Just want to make sure that that's the right ballpark for next year? So, I appreciate the time. Thanks so much.\nPeter Ingram: Sure. Let me start. I think Shannon did touch on that a little bit that we're in a position where certainly for initial aircraft, we can finance it off our balance sheet. I think as we think about it, there's always a buffet of financing options that are available to us. We're in a position right now having done the loyalty and brand financing a couple of years ago where we really don't have that much aircraft debt on our balance sheet right now relative to the size and value of our fleet. So, we think we've got the flexibility to pick our spot a little bit in terms of the timing of the market and when we want to go out and certainly we have we have very valuable assets with probably this will be the most popular modern generation wide-body aircraft coming in our fleet and already having the most popular narrow-body aircraft in our fleet.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. I don't really have much to add. I mean we -- as we're going out -- we just started going out into the market. So, we haven't gotten a lot back yet, but we'll evaluate them. And I mean I feel comfortable with where we are today. I think our main focus is getting back to profitability generating cash and then we'll consider what our options are for next year. But right now, I think we've got the cash. We've got highly financeable assets in the 787s and 321s. So, I think we're in a good position for now.\nCatherine O'Brien: And is that $500 million the right number for 2024 and 2025 for the 10-K?\nShannon Okinaka: It should be if it's in the 10-K, but I will double check and get back to you, Catie.\nCatherine O'Brien: I know there's some mismatching of, like, deliveries contractual versus, like, management estimates, so just was wondering. Thanks so much for all the time. I appreciate it.\nShannon Okinaka: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon everyone or good morning. I'm trying to figure out the time zones here.\nPeter Ingram: Good morning.\nMike Linenberg: Peter, have you at all attempted to put a cost to Hawaiian around the grounded A321neos, the GTF issue? And I know this goes just beyond the airplanes. I mean you're obviously paying rentals or financing costs. You have A330s flying in markets that should be A321neos. You probably have excess pilots who are sitting around. It's hard for them to bounce between airplane types. There's got to be a meaningful revenue and cost impact that is growing. What -- any sense on just even rough numbers on what this headwind is to Hawaiian?\nPeter Ingram: I don't have a precise enough number that I want throw one out at that point. I think you've touched on a number of the categories where it has affected us financially. Certainly, when we're not flying those aircraft, they're not burning fuel and we're not paying for powered by the hour fees, but we do have a quorum of 321 trained pilots that is sized for a larger fleet than the one that we've been operating the last couple of months. Putting the A330 in markets has impacted us greater because they're in markets where demand is a little bit more limited and usually we're putting them when they go into 321 markets, they're going into markets where the cargo carrying capacity of that aircraft doesn't yield us any revenue benefit, which is different than if you're flying to a Los Angeles or a Korea. So, it is -- I should point out, we do have some contractual penalties that are part of contract when we do not have the appropriate level of spare aircraft available. What I will say quite definitively is that those penalties fall far short of covering the financial impact of not having the aircraft and we would much prefer to receive zero penalties because we've got the contractual level of spare engine availability.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Okay. Thanks for that comprehensive answer. And then I guess my second question to Brent, on your RASM guide for the quarter and I realized there's a lot of moving parts here. But if I look at your fuel price assumption versus what it was a year ago, it's roughly looks like about $1.3 per gallon. How much of that maybe reflects fuel surcharges? I know some of them are explicit in some markets like Japan, some are maybe more implicit just part of the fare structure. If that down 8.5% to down 11.5% are a couple of points maybe driven to -- because of these fuel surcharges, any color on that would be great? Thank you.\nBrent Overbeek: So, as you pointed out in Japan, it's certainly much more explicit and in Korea, it's probably closer to Japan than any of our other entities in terms of it being explicitly in there. And kind of beyond that it is really kind of overall market pricing supply and demand. And so at this point, I wouldn't attribute anything kind of specifically to fuel surcharges other than what market demands at and what but the industry is able to bear based on that level of supply right now.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global Holdings. Please proceed with your question.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. I guess following up on Mike's first question, I know it's really hard to quantify all the inefficiencies. It sounds really rough, but could we at a minimum at least say that in the second quarter, you would be profitable, but for these inefficiencies without actually quantifying it?\nPeter Ingram: I don't think I want to speculate on that, Dan.\nDan McKenzie: I see. Okay. Well, I just thought I would try. It just seems like a lot. That's all. Okay. So, next question here with Amazon pulling up in the fourth quarter, I'm guessing you're probably beginning to get some line of sight on what the metrics might look like, so departures, cost, and potentially what the financial target -- potentially what the financial target is with respect to margins. And just if you can just shed some insight on what those metrics look like at this point?\nBrent Overbeek: I think in terms of this year, Dan, it's going to have a very limited impact. It's really -- it's the -- it's a cost drag this year as we incur some expenses in spooling up for coming into service. And then we have a couple of airplanes entering service before the end of the year, but really for a partial fourth quarter impact. So, it will really be more of a 2024 story before we have something meaningful to talk about and we're not -- we have not yet put out some revenue or cost guidance related to that. That will be something we think about as we go through in the latter part of the year.\nShannon Okinaka: Dan, what I'll add is we have included the operating cost of the fourth quarter of the Amazon work in our full year guidance. So, the -- that cost piece is baked in. Obviously, we didn't give revenue guidance for the full year, but the cost piece is baked in to our guidance.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. And then maybe just squeeze one more in here. I'm just wondering if you could unpack the revenue outlook for second quarter a little bit more? So, you guys always guide conservatively, but just setting that aside, we have the inter-island impact, the Japan impact. But I'm wondering to what extent if any there's the tech slowdown might be having on leisure demand to Hawaii? I know it's okay today, but I'm just wondering if it's a -- is this another shoe that could potentially drop that we have to worry about or am I just trying to split demand by too much here?\nPeter Ingram: I would say maybe you're trying to split it by too much, Dan. I think if we look across North America right now, we we're above where we were in 2019 in term of advance bookings, we're above where we were last year. We've had a pretty encouraging several weeks kind of leading in and I feel pretty good. Both in terms of where we're at from an advanced booking perspective, for 2Q and 3Q as well. So, I'm not seeing any kind of macro signs of it. There are some geographies and the Bay Area is maybe a little more strain than others, but certainly I think we'll see overall demand levels be quite strong, but nothing material jumps out in terms of what we're looking at.\nDan McKenzie: Yes, very good. Okay, perfect. Thanks so much you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Shannon, I think on the last call, you said that 2Q through year end PRASM would be closer to FY 2022. And if we look at the guide here for 2Q, three points of headwind from spoilage, no pulse and service, doesn't sound like you're doing ground handling and there's something else. So, a lot of moving pieces, the $39 fare wars tapering off. I just -- could you give us some color on how we should think about the cadence of CASMex second half? But also just color on kind of core yields here because in the past you've always talked about this RASM premium off of the US West Coast and there's a lot of moving pieces here. So, just would like to hear your view on what you see with respect to core yields or I guess perhaps the competitive landscape for fares? Thank you.\nShannon Okinaka: Hi Chris. I'll start a little bit with the CASM side, and I'll pass it over to Brent to talk about PRASM. But so for CASM, yes, we're going to stay with our full year 1% to 5% range up. And the first half was a little on the lower side and the second half is a little on the higher side to get that average. And a lot of it just timing on the cost side of when our maintenance events are happening and a bunch -- a number of our airports rate increases happen on July 1st or take effect on July 1st, which pushes up that second half CASM versus the first half. But we are going to keep that full year guide of 1% to 5% for CASM. So, I'll have Brent maybe address some of the yield question.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. So, Chris, we're not going to give a revenue guide. We haven't historically kind of got it out for full year revenue this early in the year and we're not going to do that. Some of the headwinds you mentioned structurally are there or abate as we get later in the year depending on those individual attributes, but some of them will be there in 3Q. and I think they'll taper off a little bit as we get towards the end of the year. If we look at kind of overall what's kind of going on in the marketplace. Like I mentioned, I think we feel pretty good about where we are on North America advanced book. Average fares look to be consistent with kind of 2019-ish levels in some cases up, some cases down, but overall in the same neighborhood. And then international excluding Japan continues to book strong. We're encouraged with that again really strong US point of sale demand there. And then with Japan, we're continuing to see things rebound from a traffic as that comes back at slightly lower fares. But overall, we're encouraged with the trajectory we're seeing in Japan.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you for the color. My follow-up, Peter. So, with the $39 fare war seemingly over, curious to hear your postmortem view on this. What did you learn? And do you believe that Southwest products here is resonating with travelers? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Well, I think what we've learned from the Southwest experience in the Neighbor Island market so far is that travelers in Hawaii prefer Hawaiian Airlines and that's been reflected in consistently higher load factor, superior revenue generation. We're focused on continuing to compete, whether it is $39 fares or other levels of fares going forward and we think we're well-positioned to succeed for the various reasons we've noted over time.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks Chris.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like turn the floor back over to Peter Ingram, President and CEO for closing comments.\nPeter Ingram: Hello, again to everyone for joining us today. Amidst the challenges facing our business, our team continues to deliver meaningful accomplishments, which positions us for a bright future. We appreciate your interest and look forward to updating you on our progress in the months ahead. Aloha.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Financial Results Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Marcy Morita, Managing Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nMarcy Morita: Thank you, Doug. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Results Conference Call. Here with me on Honolulu are, Peter Ingram, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Overbeek, Chief Revenue Officer; and Shannon Okinaka, Chief Financial Officer. We also have several other members of our management team in attendance for the Q&A. Peter will provide an overview of our performance, Brent will discuss revenue, and Shannon will discuss cost and the balance sheet. At the end of the prepared remarks, we will open the call up to questions. By now, everyone should have access to the press release that went out at about 4 o'clock Eastern Time today. If you have not received the release, it is available on the Investor Relations page web page of our website, hawaiianairlines.com. During our call today, we will refer at times to adjusted or non-GAAP numbers and metrics. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers and metrics can be found at the end of today's press release posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. As a reminder, the following prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our future plans and potential future financial and operating performance. Management may also make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and do not guarantee future performance and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer you to Hawaiian Holdings' recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. These include our most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K as well as subsequent reports filed on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Peter. Hello, Marcy. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It's encouraging to be entering a year where COVID restrictions are no longer hovering over our network. But we know that we have a lot of work ahead of us as our financial performance remains quite a ways from being fully recovered. As we continue to build upon the progress we've made, we've also embarked on a number of significant initiatives that will strengthen our company and make Hawaiian a better airline our guests, our community and our shareholders. I want to start by thanking our team. We've been tested over the past few years by a global pandemic, intense competition and during the waning weeks of 2022 by Mother Nature. Through it all, our team has shown their metal and continued to deliver unrivaled hospitality. Our team cares deeply about our company, our guests and each other. And more than anything else, this is what sets us up for success as we move forward. Leisure travel demand remains strong. We've experienced a full recovery in much of our network, most notably in the largest part of our network between the Mainland U.S. and Hawaii. Low fares in the Neighbor Island market have stimulated traffic and we continue to materially outperform our competitor on all these routes. Australia, New Zealand and South Korea have all seen strong demand recoveries over the course of 2022. Having said that, despite the removal of COVID travel restrictions in October, Japanese travelers have not yet resumed international travel at a pace comparable to pre-pandemic levels as Brent will discuss in more detail. With the timing of Japanese demand recovery is still uncertain, we will need to be nimble. In recent weeks, we've made adjustments to slow the deployment of capacity to Japan. While we remain confident that with time the long standing affinity of Japanese travelers for a Hawaii vacations will manifest. We also need to be pragmatic in putting capacity elsewhere if recovery remains slow. The natural question for investors is to wonder why it is taking Hawaiian longer to return to profitability than other U.S. airlines. On the cost side, our outlook relative to 2019 is comparable to others. We are facing cost inflation in a number of categories, including labor. I should emphasize that our cost outlook now includes the impact of new contracts for each of our unionized group since 2020, including the economics of the TA we recently reached with ALPA. Where our 2022 results and our near term outlook diverge from our peers is on revenue. Not because we are underperforming our competitors on specific routes, but because of the characteristics of the markets in which we compete. We don't control the timing of demand recovery from Japan. We only make decisions on one side of the Neighbor Island competitive battle. And even in North America, the North America to Hawaii market, which is operating profitably, with supply demand environment relative to 2019 is less favorable than in the domestic 48 and transatlantic markets. As a result, I can project the timing of our return to profitability as precisely as I would like. What we can do and what we are doing is to focus on what we do control. We can focus on operational execution to unlock efficiencies, which help offset an inflationary environment. We can invest in a continuum of initiatives to position our company for sustained success. And we can work to win competitive battles and maximize revenue generation in each of our markets. That is our focus. Everyone in Hawaii is keenly focused on winning in Hawaii. Last quarter, I talked at length about the competitive situation on our Neighbor Island routes. Based on the most recent information available through DOT reporting, we continue to succeed in earning a disproportionate passenger share with higher average fares than our competitors and the gap is substantial. We continue to believe that our place in the community, our product and schedule, our knowledge of the guests and our fabulous employees give us structural advantages here that will enable us to win. We are Hawaii's airline. The current battle continues nonetheless, which suppresses near term financial performance. We are standing our ground and remain resolute that we will win in the end and emerge stronger on the other side. Also among our key imperatives this year is to firmly reestablish an efficient operating rhythm. 2022 was marked by an unprecedented level of hiring and training throughout our organization as we rebuilt our network after the pandemic. Almost 20% of my over 7,000 teammates have joined our company since the beginning of 2022. Being in rebuilding mode meant that we sometimes accepted ways of working that were not optimally efficient at scale. For 2023, the focus is on operating more reliably, consistently and efficiently, something that is good for both our guests and our cost structure, countering inflationary pressure in a number of areas. Over the past few months, we have not performed to our standards operationally. The root causes are not a function of our decisions, but it is our responsibility to overcome external forces and deliver the level of service and reliability our guests expect. Since October, on-time performance at our Honolulu hub has been undermined by construction on a primary arrivals runway and the air traffic control programs that constrain arrivals into the airport. These changes have disproportionately affected short haul Neighbor Island flights. As a consequence, our reliability has fallen below our high standards and we've been forced to make adjustments to our scheduled to stabilize operations. This construction will continue into the second quarter and will continue to challenge our operations for the next few months. We've adjusted our schedule to add block time and have created schedule recovery buffers on our lines of flying. As a result of these changes and an intense focus on daily reliability by our operations team, we've seen considerable improvement in performance over the past two months. But even with these changes, it will be a day to day battle during the construction period to manage through the capacity constraints at our primary hub and we will be more susceptible than usual to weather our mechanical disruptions. A huge mahalo goes out to our teams and the trenches who are working every day to deliver on our customer promise. We are also not immune to global supply chain challenges. Since late last year, we have encountered constraints on the availability of A321 engines, for which Pratt Whitney's MRO supply chain has been unable to keep pace. Most recently, this has resulted in two of our 18 A321s being grounded for an extended period awaiting available serviceable engines. Here again, we have made adjustments to protect the integrity of our schedules, but not without operational challenges and associated revenue and cost headwinds. As we deal with these near-term challenges, we remain keenly focused on completing an extensive list of initiatives that will position Hawaiian for long-term success. Our team has deep in preparation for the launch of freighter operations for Amazon later this year. Over the next few months, we will also be -- we will also complete the insourcing of certain elements of the maintenance programs for our A330 fleet, for which we have relied on a third-party for over a decade. This will improve our cost structure overtime and immediately give us more control over fleet reliability and performance. While separate from the Amazon initiatives, taking on this in-sourcing at the same time as we are adding at least 10 freighters to our A330 fleet makes it even more timely. We're putting mobile technology in the hands of more of our employees to make us more operationally nimble and to allow us to serve our guests better with real time information. And in April we will go live with our new passenger service system. Not only does this un-shackled us from a core system that has limited our pace of innovation, it also has served as a catalyst to accelerate transformation of our technology, streamlining the connections between the PSS and other systems, enabling better use of data and providing an opportunity to modernize code for our e-commerce platform. This year, we will begin cycling our long-haul fleet through the installation of StarLink inflight connectivity, which will position us as a global leader in offering free, fast and frictionless Internet to all our guests. We're also pleased to have reached terms on a four year pilot working agreement with ALPA this month. Since this agreement is currently out for a ratification vote, we won't be commenting on the specific terms of the contract. But we have reflected the expected economic impact of the agreement and the guidance we're sharing today. Should our pilots ratify the agreement, we will have reached new contract terms with all of our organized labor groups since 2020. And none of our contracts will become amendable prior to 2025. So we have a lot to do in a year with significant challenges in some of our core markets. While we might wish for these initiatives to be a bit more spread out, you don't always get to choose when the opportunity presents. And I believe the priorities I just mentioned will be transformational for our company. 2023 promises to be an exciting year and I am fortunate to have an unbelievably talented team to tackle the challenges and opportunities. Let me turn it over now to Brent to go over our commercial performance in more detail.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter. Hello, everyone. During 2022, we saw robust demand for travel to Hawaii from North America and our international markets, excluding Japan, a strong performance by our premium and ancillary products. We saw overall PRASM surpassed 2019 due to the strength in these areas. Our ability to be flexible and adapt our network and schedule to address a dynamic environment served us well. Overall, fourth quarter revenue performance was in-line with what we have anticipated, despite the operational challenges we faced in the last two weeks of the year. Although ASMs were down 6% from 2019 due to a slower than expected rebuild in Japan, our system RASM was up versus 2019, demonstrating the continued strength we\u2019ve see in our U.S. Mainland to Hawaii routes and International routes, excluding Japan. Consistent with our expectations, approximately $25 million of passenger revenue was attributable to spoilage from pandemic era credits that expired at the end of December, a level that we do not expect to see going-forward. The resilience of the leisure market was evident in our domestic travel demand. U.S. Mainland to Hawaii total passenger revenue was up 29% on 9% more capacity compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 with load factors remaining in the high 80s. We achieved this revenue growth despite 11% more industry capacity between the U.S. Mainland and Hawaii than in 2019. 2022 was also a strong year for our international markets outside of Japan. In July we resumed service to Auckland and pent-up demand to and from New Zealand drove strong RASM gains. On the back-half of the year, Korean PRASM returned to pre pandemic performance levels and we continue to experience very strong demand in the Sydney market. Unlike our other international markets, Japan's ramp-up has been slower than we anticipated when it began reopening. This difference can be attributed to three primary factors. First, Japanese consumers have exhibited a degree of conservatism in returning to the long-haul international market -- international travel. Second, the Japanese government is encouraging major domestic travel agencies there to promote domestic travel in lieu of international travel. And lastly, the weakness of the yen has made it more expensive to travel to Hawaii now than it was prior to the pandemic. The relationship of Japanese travelers to Hawaii is a strong one. And Hawaii is still a cherished an aspirational destination, more so than other international destinations. This drives our belief that the weakness in demand is transitory and we will be well positioned to fully serve Japan to Hawaii market when demand returns. Moving on to the Neighbor Islands, it continues to be a challenging market from a fair perspective. Our competitor is no longer offering $39 last seat availability as they were for much of the second half of 2022. But low fares are widely available in the market. We continue to manage yields above $39 when possible and the low fares have had the near term effect of stimulating demand. We continue to offer the best service and schedule in the market and we are seeing positive signs that our strategy is paying-off. The most recent DOT statistics show that for the third quarter, our load factor was 22 points higher than our competitor. And our average share of roughly $50 million was nearly double there's. While our ticket PRASM of -- while our PRASM of $29.3 was well below our historical standards, it vastly exceeded our competitors $10.6 result. With our premium products demand remained strong, both domestically and internationally. For the fourth quarter, North-America premium cabin unit revenue improved over 30% compared to 2019. In the longer-term, we're excited about both expanding our premium -- expanding our premium offerings with the arrival of our first Boeing 787-900 at the end of 2023. The 787 fleet will offer 34 lie flat suites versus the 18 seats our A330s -- on our A330s, as well as additional extra comfort seats. Ancillary revenue remains strong. We saw continued momentum in Extra Comfort sales. Our newer preferred seat option performed in-line with our expectations and we launched this product for international flights during the second half of 2022 with promising initial results. Among other successful products our co-branded credit card had another record quarter and year with spend up over 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This program is uniquely designed to reward people who love Hawaii and those who live here. We've also implemented a new benefit for cardholders, a second free checked bag. Our cargo team had its best fourth quarter on record, which contributed over $34 million in revenue, driven by strong yields from the international market. We do anticipate our cargo activity to slow moderately as we head into 2023, as international yields continued to decline. Additionally, we don't have any charter flying in 2023 for the U.S. Postal Service, as we did for the first three quarters of 2022. As Peter mentioned, we will face some operational challenges associated with the maintenance of our A321 engines. With the reduced scheduled to and from Japan we have the ability to shift our A330 aircraft to cover A321 routes. That results in a heavier A330 schedule into North-America for the first quarter than we would normally plan and [shoulder] (ph) season. While that allows us to maintain service in well-performing Mainland markets, we\u2019re not optimized on gauge and that will have an unfavorable impact on first quarter 2023 RASM. We continue to work with Pratt Whitney and anticipate improvement in the quarters ahead. Our first quarter 2023 capacity is forecast to be approximately 15% higher than the same period in 2022. Compared to the first quarter 2022, we plan on operating a slightly lower capacity for North America routes, higher in the Neighbor Islands and substantially more international markets where our network rebuild was only starting to take shape in early 2022. The first quarter of 2022 had some unique pandemic related challenges. So we expect a difference versus 2022 to narrow as we progress throughout the rest of the year. At the end of last year, we saw some softness in North America bookings for travel in the first quarter of 2023, but these have improved over recent weeks, and we're encouraged with booking index. Even with some fares discounting initiated by other carriers. We are now forecasting first quarter 2023 PRASM to be up approximately 15% compared to the first quarter of 2022. As with capacity, we expect 2023 PRASM to be closer to 2022 levels in future quarters. We look forward to strengthening our international and U.S. Mainland to Hawaii markets. Rebuilding our presence in Japan and continuing to be the airline of choice for Neighbor Island travel. 2023 does not come without challenges in some of these markets. But we are equipped to be nimble as we review demand and opportunities. We have a well thought out product lineup for our market, a strong brand and team that is second to none. I'd like to thank our amazing team for their outstanding efforts, not just during the quarter, but during the entire year. We've had some challenging weeks to wrap-up the year. And it's great to see everyone pulled together. With that, I'll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent. [Foreign Language] Happy New Year, and thank you for joining us today as we walk through our fourth quarter and full rear Results, share our 2023 first quarter and full year outlook and talk about initiatives that we have on the horizon. We finished 2022 with an adjusted EBITDA of $25.6 million for the fourth quarter and adjusted EBITDA loss of $31.0 million for the full-year. This equates to an adjusted loss of $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.08 per share for all of 2022. These fourth quarter results are slightly better than expected due to the strong demand in North America and certain international markets, partially offset by the competitive Neighbor Island market and slower buildup in Japan. Our fourth quarter unit cost, excluding fuel and non-recurring items were up 14.2% compared to 2019, which was in-line with our expectations. As mentioned on the last call, we saw increases in wage rates and airport rents, and as expected we also incurred costs related to future growth opportunities such as startup and pilot training costs for our new cargo flying for Amazon and the induction of our 787 later this year. Regarding the 787s, we recently announced the amendment of our deal with Boeing which solidified our delivery schedule and increased our order with Boeing from 10 to 12 aircraft. We're very excited about the delivery of our first 787 aircraft, which is scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year. Several factors influenced our decision to add two more 787s to the order, including the exceptional revenue generating capability of the larger premium cabin and increase in overall seat count. In addition, the 787 delivery schedule will provide flexibility in our growth rate as we decide whether to extend or return A330s when leases expire. Our next four A330 lease expirations occur in 2024. The finalization of the 787 deliveries schedule resulted in just over $70 million of capital expenditures moving from 2022 into 2023. We now expect 2023 aircraft related CapEx to be in the range of $290 million to $300 million. In addition, we expect our 2023 non-aircraft related CapEx to be in the range of $40 million to 80 million, which is higher than normal due to preparation for the 787 induction and the in-sourcing of our A330 maintenance. Our investment in technology and facility initiatives will also be slightly higher than 2022. Notable facility investments include reconstruction of the security checkpoints at Honolulu airport for better throughput and guest experience. And new below the wing workspaces to increase the efficiency of our operations in the new [indiscernible] terminal at Honolulu. Looking at costs going forward, it's clear that our costs will remain structurally higher than pre pandemic levels, much of which is driven by industry wide cost inflation. To address this, we're focused on productivity above people and assets, as well as on revenue generating capability. While we did not expect to be at pre pandemic levels of productivity this year, we believe that our investments and the recovery of our network position will yield sizable improvement in the future. And as we start-up our new Amazon service and enter the 787 into service we'll reap the revenue benefits and grow shareholder value. For the first quarter, we expect our unit cost ex-fuel and special items to be about flat to the same period in 2022. And that's low-single digits on a percentage basis for the full-year compared to 2022. This includes our estimate for the cost of implementing the new ALPA TA effective March first. The primary drivers behind the increase in unit cost are training of our pilots for the Amazon flying and for the new 787 fleets, contractual rate increases in our power by the hour agreements and a more intensive heavy maintenance schedule for our A321s. 2023 is a year in which we are making substantial investments in our fleet, technology and guest experience, which reflected in both our operating costs and capital expenditures. These initiatives are building blocks to make Hawaiian Airlines a stronger business. And as we get back to operational excellence and fight to win in our markets, our investments in technology and product are going to better enable our frontline team to deliver that aloha and hospitality that is one of our primary competitive advantages. Having faced the challenges of the last few years, we have renewed energy around innovation to improve our revenue generating capability and manage our costs. We're excited about our future as we lay the foundation that will set us up for success. With that, we can open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nConor Cunningham: Hey, everyone. Thank you for the time. I'm just going to the 1Q RASM guidance. I\u2019m a little confused on what's kind of happening there. So you talked a little bit about higher utilization kind of impacting the results there or the outlook there, but just when I think quarter-over quarter, it implies a pretty massive step-down versus historical trends. I would just wonder if you could maybe provide a little color on what's kind of happening there? And then why you expect it to snap-back in the remaining quarters after? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Well, I mean, we guided, Conor, to year-over-year and not over the sequential quarter. I do think we've got some different moving pieces as you look through, we talk through some of the -- some of the changes in spoilage in particularly as you move through the quarter. And like I mentioned, we saw a little bit of softness in the front part of the quarter, particularly in North America in addition to some of those [indiscernible].\nConor Cunningham: So it's basically a function of just like a larger spoilage in 1Q and then it kind of normalizing like high level...\nPeter Ingram: On a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis, we see that from 4Q to 1Q, but from a year-over-year perspective, it will be a little bit different, yes.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, all right. That make sense. And then just -- your cost cadence is going to be probably a little bit different than some of your other peers. I realize you have the final contract in your numbers. But I was wondering if you could just provide a little sort of color around the Amazon cost build there? I would imagine it's much more second half weighted, but I'm just trying to figure out the lumpiness it\u2019s going to happen through 2023. Thank you.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Conor. This is Shannon, I'll start. Yeah, we do have -- we haven't broken this piece out, we do have a good amount of pilot training going right now and it's kind of combined with the preparation for 787s as well, because we, of course, have one pilot training planed, which includes getting ready for both. So that is definitely in our first quarter cost in our guidance. As we move throughout the year, that training kind of stays at that rate, but we will be, to your point, adding in forward costs as we get ready and get closer to flying for Amazon. Once we are actually flying the airplanes and we can specifically identify costs related to the Amazon flying. I'll try to point that out. But for right now, it is somewhat intermingled with all of the other things that we're planning for.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Peter, you said a number that I wanted to double check. How many people did you say you've hired in the last year?\nPeter Ingram: I said about 20%, just a hair under 20% of our employees on payroll today have joined the company since the beginning of 2022.\nHelane Becker: Right. So that's -- you only have about 775,000, so that's a significant amount of new talent that's been trained in the last one year. So when do you think they hit their productivity levels that contribute to the bottom-line?\nPeter Ingram: I think for a lot of the group's, Helane, you get the productivity fairly quickly. You're always wanting to do more training, probably over the course of part of the year last year if you think about our airports organization, we would have people who were trained on certain functions, but they weren't necessarily training to be cross utilized across the operation and as we get more of that training done, it makes you a little bit more efficient and adaptable, in the day-to-day operation. So that. I would say is the story in that part of the business. With flight attendants for us, we are fully staffed to be able to operate a -- not only the schedule we're operating today, we're not planning on having any material hiring of flight attendants this year, although we had a lot last year. There it's just really a question of having the ASMs back, which is, to a certain extent a function of getting our wide bodies flying to Japan, getting the A321s back in the operation at full force would be helpful and sort of flying the full capacity that we have. So in terms of -- that's what really is the one limiting factor on efficiency there. And then as Shannon was alluding to with regards to pilots, we still have a lot of training this year, and we did a lot of training last year. So -- And as we work to position through so that we have the right staffing for the initial tranche of the freighter aircraft and work to move people through the training cycles to get equipped for the 787s coming on later this year, we'll still have some unproductive time in terms of pilots spending time in training rather than flying revenue block hours for us and that is going to continue, really throughout this year and probably start to level out some next year. But as we are in growth mode with the freighters we'll still have some jobs that carry-on activity beyond, I would say, a normal steady-state level, even as we go into 2024.\nHelane Becker: Okay that's hugely helpful. Thanks, Peter. And then just for my follow-up question on the Japan routes. I know that DOT rejected the initial alliance that you had put forth, would you consider circling back around and applying for an alliance again or JV or however you want to term it with Japan Air to sort of in the short term anyway improve those results.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. So, we've continued our commercial relationship with Japan Airlines and we still work closely with them on codeshare and interline and some frequent flyer reciprocity. We're doing that without the antitrust immunity protection that you get from an approved antitrust immunized joint venture with DOT. So that constraints a little bit how much we can optimize that relationship and how closely we can work with JAL. For the time being that is our plan going forward is to continue working on that way. We still have the opportunity to go back to DOT at some point and we spent some time in 2020 when the [ATI] (ph) application was turned down, trying to understand the concerns that DOT had and obviously the time came when we wanted to reapply we would hopefully be in a good position to be able to address those and structure the partnership in a way that it made sense in terms of how DOT looks at it. So, no immediate plans to go and make a filing there, but it is still something that we have the ability to go back and take another look at again.\nHelane Becker: That's great, thanks. All hugely helpful as usual. Thanks, Peter.\nPeter Ingram: All right. Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Good to be back this quarter. So I just wanted to circle back on the first quarter revenue outlook if you allow me. A quick clarification, first Brent. Was your comment that 1Q passenger revenue will be up 15% but trend toward flat, was that on your total system or is that just North America to Hawaii routes?\nPeter Ingram: That was system PRASM.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, got it. And then looking back historically, load factor is usually pretty flattish between fourth quarter and first quarter. So if we assume the same for this year, maybe that's wrong, maybe that\u2019s right. But that means yields are down year-over-year versus last year with that pretty material Omicron impact, is that just like more competitive at [indiscernible] or is there a stage linked impact we should be thinking about given the international add-back.\nPeter Ingram: Yeah. I mean, there is a really big 1Q year-over-year change on the international side. Our international capacity is up, I believe, almost 70% in terms of 1Q. So, it's a really difficult kind of transitioned from a comp perspective, Cathy, and I think that -- a lot of that will smooth out as we get into 2Q and beyond.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: It makes lot of sense. And then, Peter, I know it wasn't very firm guidance but last quarter you spoke to low-single and mid-single digit growth on a full-year basis versus 2019, just like in the Q&A. So understandably not super firm. But your guidance today points to very slightly down, maybe up 2% if I'm doing that math right. Can you just walk us through the underlying change versus your prior expectations? Is that just all Japan offset by the new [indiscernible] flight or is there a pull out anywhere else in the network, maybe given some of the competitive situation. Thanks so much for the time.\nPeter Ingram: Yes, so a lot of that is certainly driven by Japan, slowing the pace of our return to service their. I think in an ideal situation -- ideal circumstance if we were flying Japan less intensely we might have been a little bit more aggressive than we are planning right now in terms of redeploying capacity to other more productive markets and to a certain extent, that's a function of the aircraft availability that I alluded to with our 321s not being as available as we would like and having a little bit of uncertainty there. If that uncertainty can be alleviated, that would give us an opportunity to make a couple of adds at least seasonally elsewhere in the network. And then, of course, if we saw a rapid change in Japan we'd love to come back there a little more quickly. But that's most of what has changed since we talked about the numbers three months ago.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Very helpful. Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Sure. Welcome back.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hillary Cacanando with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nHillary Cacanando: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So you noted three reasons why Japanese markets have been weak. Japanese consumers are exhibiting foodservices on Japanese government promoting domestic travel over international, Japanese yen [indiscernible]. So could you kind of just give us a high-level view -- your view of the Japanese leisure market, for example, why are Japanese consumers conservative than before? What will change that? Would you expect the government to start promoting international travel that king thing [indiscernible] high-level view of that market.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Sure, Hillary. Maybe I can just sort of reiterate and emphasize some of the things that Brent talked about. I do think some of this is a national temperament issue and Japan was one of the more conservative places in the world in terms of dealing with the pandemic and maintaining a fairly high-level of caution. That was frankly contrary to how some restrictive policies were considered by the population in the United States, there was a lot more acceptance and even to certain amount of popularity the level of restrictions. And so, I think it is perhaps not entirely surprising but it is taking a little bit more time to embrace traveling internationally. The folks in Japan have been traveling for leisure domestically and some of that has been stimulated by some incentive programs to try and encourage domestic tourism as an economic stimulus opportunity. And frankly, the existence -- ongoing existence of those programs is perhaps shifting some of the behavior towards domestic opportunity -- travel opportunities versus international. And I do think as those programs go away, that should be less of a factor. And then of course, Brent talked about the exchange rate, where the yen has depreciated relative to the dollar which hurts the spending power of Japanese coming to the United States. So I think the middle one of those, the travel incentives for domestic travel probably normalizes fairly quickly over time. The general sentiment towards travel and comfort is going to be a gradual thing and your guest is as good as mine on how the currency exchange goal is going forward. But the good news is, there we\u2019re at least in a better place than we were, we were as high as JPY150 to the dollar a few months ago. Now it's been back more in the plus or minus from one JPY130 range. So that's still higher than when it was before. One thing I'll just point out, and I'm -- our crystal ball has not been very reliable when it comes to predicting the return of, travel and so we're hesitant to stick our necks out and point to a specific date, but they are -- there is one bit of policy news that was announced this week that I think is on the margin encouraging. And that is that, Japan is reclassifying COVID and their sort of treatment of diseases to be treated more like the seasonal flu as opposed to being treated like much more severe diseases and that goes into place in May and will help contribute. I don't think it's going to be a silver bullet, but I think it contributes to that evolution of the sentiments and more comfort around getting back into the rhythm of international travel.\nHillary Cacanando: Got it. Thank you. That's that was really insightful. Thank you very much. And then just one more question, you deferred delivery of 10 Boeing aircrafts with deliveries expected to start in the fourth quarter. So if you continue to experience delays from the OEMs, will that impact your planned schedule this year, if you have any contingency plans in-place to continue to see delivery delays from Boeing, Airbus and engine manufacturers maybe like perhaps the leisure or like any other contingency plans or you think you are in good shape when it comes the fleet plan even if there\u2026\nPeter Ingram: Yes, so. We reset the delivery schedule with Boeing, with the new agreement. We don't have any 787 ASM contribution in 2023 in our plan, we expect to take the first airplane before the end of the year and have it in service in early 2024. Given the freshness of the delivery forecast on which that deal, which is basically right now about a month old. I think we've got a pretty good level of confidence about Boeing's ability to deliver on that. And we do expect to get a couple of 787s in service in the early part of next year. We don't have any other deliveries we're expecting this year aside from the A330 freighters which is contingent on getting them out of the transition program from a passenger airplane to a freighter airplane, which is the responsibility of our partner on that. And then the other area where I've talked a couple of times about some risk to aircraft availability is not so much around aircraft deliveries, but it's the supply chain for spare engines, particularly on the 321 where we know we're already running short and have their airplanes that are unavailable to us in the near-term as a result.\nHillary Cacanando: Thank you very much.\nPeter Ingram: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.\nDan McKenzie: Hi, thanks for the time here. So going back to the script, investing in continuum of initiatives, starting with, I guess, premium revenue. I just wondered if you can help us understand what capabilities you're gaining in 2023 versus what you were doing in 2022? So the IT limitations that go away and the percent of the revenue picture that the IT improvements are touching here.\nPeter Ingram: So I don't think the [indiscernible] which gives us materially different capabilities in terms of managing front cabin as we look into 2023. I do think the things that will continue to benefit from, obviously, we've executed very well on the revenue management side, that's a capability we will continue to have going-forward. We'll have an annualization of our preferred seats products that we launched last year that will hit, it's kind of long-term run-rate and a lot of initiatives that we had around Extra Comfort and seeing optimization. We think some of those have some more growth as we look into 2023.\nDan McKenzie: I see. Okay. Next question here. I think if I heard you correctly, it sounds like the three biggest drags on the business are a slower recovery in Japan, the inter-island dynamic and then the airport challenges at Honolulu. And I\u2019m just wondering if you can just help us understand just how big a drag these three components are. And so, I guess, if one of these were to flip what could that really mean? And then finally the suboptimal schedule at Honolulu, how many points of revenue is that overhang that's embedded into the first-quarter guide here? A - Peter Ingram I'd just say, Dan, the first two of those, the Neighbor Island competitive dynamic and the slower recovery in Japan. They are much more impactful in terms of the near-term financial performance than the operating challenges at Honolulu. We've been able to make adjustments to the scheduled to stabilize the operation without having to stay-in a material amount of capacity and particularly as we as we get beyond the construction period. We think that will become even more stable, but it's not costing us economically so much as it is sort of challenging our teams on a day-to day basis and causing a few hairs to go gray as we battle through some of the challenges, especially as we did in October and November, where our performance was particularly pressured before we could get the scheduled changes in-place. I would say, in addition to the two big revenue dynamics that are in-place, Neighbor Island and Japan. The other thing that does constrain us a little bit is the aircraft availability. And do we have as many airplanes as we want to fly our flight and server demand, particularly in the peak time of the year and the summer and if we can -- we're going to continue to work with our partners at Pratt, who have been a good partner with us over the year to see if we can get a little bit more certainty and hopefully a little bit more aircraft availability in the summer which would allow us to get some of the revenue back that we're leaving on the table if we don't have aircrafts flying.\nDan McKenzie: I see. Okay, thanks for the time guys.\nPeter Ingram: Yeah. Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Didora: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Brent, first question for you. In your prepared remarks you spoke a bit about some modest softness in Mainland to Hawaii, I believe. Why do you think that is? And how are you seeing -- what are you seeing out of your competitors? How are they behaving on that route as everyone tries to vie for the strong leisure consumer?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I think we clearly saw some real strength in the fall last year. We started to see as we came in the holidays. Things were slowing down a little bit for 4Q, but we hit that in our forecast. The front part of 1Q, I will say, we saw bookings slow a little bit. Early on in the year, we saw some promotional fares that got a little more aggressive than what we had seen in some of the shoulder periods for the fall. However, since we've really come back from the New Year, I am pretty encouraged with some of the progress we've seen on the traffic front and we've seen some real positive builds. We've seen some of the levels of discounting abate versus where they were early on the year. So I think we're trending in the right direction.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Thank you. And then Shannon, I think you said that you include the pilot contract as of March 1. Did I hear that correctly? And given that it's partial quarter, could you just give us a sense of what the quarterly labor impact is through 2023?\nShannon Okinaka: Sure. Thanks, Andrew. Yes, you did hear that correct. If the pilots do ratify the agreement, it'll be effective -- the rates will be effective March 1, which is why we've included it from there. So the effect of the contract, which is more than just rates. But for the first quarter, I think we've added a little over half a point for the impact to the first quarter, I think for the full year, it's a little over 1.5 points from the ALPA contract. And again, that's 10 months of the year, not 12.\nAndrew Didora: Right. Okay. Look, I know it's hard to forecast an exact inflection in earnings power here, but until you get there, how should we think about potential cash burn here over the next several quarters?\nShannon Okinaka: Yeah. I think it is a little difficult just to forecast, given we're hopeful that Japan comes back quicker. I think in the short term, we are just going to be more conservative about how we use our cash. So we've got -- we're not -- we're still missing absolutely. I think that's very important for our future. But we're looking at ways to reduce costs, which then conserve cash. But we're not -- I don't have any major program planned to conserve cash. We still have quite a bit of cash in our bank that we're going to use to invest in long term initiatives.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. And just to add on to that. I think we need to act with urgency to improve our financial condition, but it's important that we don't panic. And if you go through how we're performing competitively in each of the geographies, we are performing well head to head against our competitors. In some cases very, very well. So we don't want to panic, we don't want to stop investing, but we have to be -- and we're comfortable with our liquidity position, but we have to be mindful of the fact they need to act prudently and make good decisions going forward and that's what you can expect from us in the period ahead.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good afternoon, everyone. So Peter, I appreciate all the direct comments here and on the revenue initiatives here, so you have some here with your IT, I think your passenger service system, your premium cabinets. We have Amazon I believe slated for the back half of this year. Could you talk a little bit about what's going on outside of Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea? And then also on the competitive landscape, there was a promo that went out today. It looks like the $39 fares for inter-island are still out there and there was a one way [indiscernible] 255 or so. So when you mentioned on the inter-island piece and you talk about average fares being higher in few reports and that you feel confident about your position. How long are you willing to hold the fares here? And if you could kind of just put some -- as we think about some of the revenue initiatives out here and if you could perhaps frame that piece, but also some of these other sale promotions that we see here? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Maybe just sort of start on some of the revenue initiatives and I think Brent touched on a number of these earlier, but over the last year or so, we've implemented a new revenue management system and there's still upside in terms of being able to generate performance from that. We've enhanced our capabilities around the pricing of our preferred seats and our extra comfort seats to allow us to be much more dynamic in terms of how we price by the day of week by specific seats on the airplane that are more desirable. And we've saw a lot of progress over the course of the last year in terms of generating returns from that. But I don't think anyone on our team would argue that we've squeezed that real last drop of opportunity out of that yet. Some of those things have not been -- they were initially rolled out primarily on our North America network and so there's opportunity to further rollout things like preferred seats internationally, which Brent said, we've just begun. So there's a variety of things that we're continuing to work on and a long list beyond that. In terms of the PSS itself, it really doesn't on day one turn on new revenue generating capabilities. I think where the payoff is longer term as we modernize the systems that underlie our technology. It just makes it easier for us to adapt and evolve and develop new products and get them into market on a more timely basis. So I think it is -- there's not sort of a flick the switch sort of benefit on the revenue side that comes from that. But I do think there is a broader improvement of capabilities that comes with that. And then turning to second part of your question of how we're going to compete. You're right, the $39 fares are still out there. It's not every seat seven days a week anymore, but it is generally four days a week of $39 and a little bit higher on the weekends and pretty broadly available, although not last seat availability. And the fact of the matter is, we have to continue to compete. We do have better schedule and service and great reliability and great employees. But we all know that you got to be cost competitive and you got to be price competitive in this business. So we're going to like going to continue to compete and we ultimately know that we're going to be successful.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay, apologies. There was a lot in that first question. Just on the other international point of sale markets, if you could give a little bit color on what you're seeing there? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. So I think certainly Australia and New Zealand have had a really, really strong winter strength out of those points of sale, but also really good strength both from volumes and fares for U.S. point of sale. We've also seen really strong U.S. point of sale for Japan and Korea, albeit that represents a much smaller portion of our overall traffic mix, but clearly there's been some demand there. And then Korea point of sale, I would say, has held up pretty well also. So I think overall, we're pretty encouraged with how those are going. Is there additional runway there? Certainly, we'd like -- we think so. And again, I would say front cabin has been exceptionally strong, particularly in the South Pacific where we've had a real ability to capture demand at materially higher fares.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call over to Peter Ingram for closing remarks.\nPeter Ingram: All right. Thank you, Doug and mahalo again to everyone for joining us today. We have a lot of important work in the period ahead, and I am very fortunate to be a part of a terrific team. Together, we're going to face our challenges hear on and cease the many, many opportunities that are ahead of us. We appreciate your interest and look forward to updating you on our progress again in a few months. Aloha.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

I will now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Hello Marcy, and welcome to the team. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Demand for travel to, from and within Hawaii remains strong. Leisure travel has led the global recovery and I expect this to continue. I know the markets are focused on an uncertain economic outlook but demand across our network is showing no signs of weakness as consumers continue to place a high priority on leisure travel. Operationally, we had a solid summer relative to some of the challenges elsewhere in the industry. But relative to our own high standards, we are not yet where we want to be. On the positive side, our completion rate from Memorial Day to Labor Day was 99.9%. On time performance was under a bit more pressure however, exacerbated by some changes to air traffic arrival protocols here in Honolulu and more recently runway construction work that is pressuring the on time performance of our Neighbor Island flights. These factors have dampened our operational performance in October but our ops team is working hard to overcome these challenges. Demand for travel between Hawaii and the US Mainland has been fully recovered for some time, and the peak summer period did not disappoint at all. Brent will take you through the details later in the call. Outside of Japan, we have also seen a strong recovery on our international routes, overcoming the strength of the US dollar and demonstrating that the robust desire for leisure travel is not a uniquely American phenomenon. Sydney, in particular, has seen notable demand strength. While Japan demand is not all the way back, we have seen some positive and important developments in recent weeks. Specifically on October 11th, Japan removed most of the pandemic travel restrictions, which have artificially suppressed demand, including most importantly, testing requirements for international arrivals and the hard cap on the number of international arriving passengers. We anticipate a solid recovery in Japan Hawaii travel in the coming months. But mindful of the cautious nature of the Japanese public and the continuing weakness of the Japanese yen relative to the US dollar, we are choosing to add capacity back gradually. Brent will take you through the details of our scheduled recovery plans and what we are seeing in terms of demand recovery since the removal of travel restrictions has been announced. Let me now turn to developments across our Neighbor Island network. As a reminder, prior to the pandemic, our Neighbor Island routes accounted for a little over 20% of our passenger revenue. A substantial contribution albeit is smaller than our North American international flying. But the percentage revenue contribution from these routes understates their importance to our business. The origin of our company, almost 93 years ago, was flying between the islands of Hawaii, and we have been the primary provider of inter-island transportation ever since. In addition to serving as the inter-island highway system for the state, these operations provide essential connection capacity for our long haul flights, enabling our North America and international operations to function at the scale we provide despite limited connecting capacity outside of Hawaii. Over the past nine decades, we have absorbed competitive challenges on various fronts and throughout we have prevailed in large part due to our singular focus on serving the needs of Hawaii travelers better than any competitor. During the third quarter, our most recent competitor added capacity and initiated unusually aggressive pricing, promising to have last seat availability of $39 fares through the end of the year. These $39 fares include federal taxes, which means that the company receives $26.05 from each ticket sold. These fares, even if 100% of seats are occupied, did not cover the cost of operations. I'll defer from speculating on the strategic logic of this initiative, because ultimately, this is irrelevant. What is relevant to us is how we respond and compete. Let me lay out some fundamental facts. Our cost structure on Neighbor Island routes is similar to Southwest. We operate smaller 128 seat Boeing 717 aircrafts that are uniquely well suited to short haul operations. Southwest operates larger 175 seat 737 MAX 8 aircraft designed to serve longer stage lengths. Based on our analysis, Southwest has a small cost advantage on a per seat basis due to the larger aircraft size. On a per operation basis, our costs are measurably lower. When comparing revenue production, the results are not even close. During the second quarter, based on the latest available DOT statistics, we generated a revenue premium of 129% over our competitor on a per available seat mile basis. Our passenger revenue per operation, even with aircraft that have 27% fewer seats, was 73% higher. Part of this revenue premium is derived from sources of revenue that are available to Hawaiian, but that our competitor cannot access. Connecting revenue from our long haul network provides RASM accretive traffic to our Neighbor Island flights. Codeshare and interline revenue from other North America and international airlines are available to us, but not our competitor. We have a premium cabin. We have extra comfort seats. $39 main cabin fares cannot close this gap. Confronted with these facts, and in light of the importance of our Neighbor Island operations to other parts of the network, the answer to how we're going to respond is simple. We're going to stand our ground and compete, and we are going to compete aggressively. We have made $39 fares available on our Neighbor Island flights through the remainder of the year. Not every seat on every flight, but these fares are broadly available. HawaiianMiles members will receive double miles on Neighbor Island flights through the end of the year to reward our loyal customers. Our HawaiianMiles credit card holders now receive two bags free on every flight. We are adding flights to meet the demand for travel. I'm going to be asked to speculate on how the current situation evolves in the months ahead. The simple answer is that I do not know. What I do know is that the appropriate response to this challenge is to compete. So we will lean in. For so long as these deeply discounted fares persist, we will see lower returns from our Neighbor Island routes. Exactly how long this will last is difficult to predict at this time. But for now, it will be a headwind to the recovery of our bottom line. Shifting gears, let me touch on last week's announcement of our agreement with Amazon. If you didn't hear our investor call last Friday, the recording is available on the investor relations page of our Web site. Our team is excited by the opportunity that this new initiative will provide to further diversify our revenue and add a new avenue for growth in the coming years. Work is well underway to prepare for our first A330-300 freighter in the second half of 2023. More than ever we are operating in a dynamic environment. As we put the pandemic in the rearview mirror, we must now deal with inflationary pressure and an uncertain economic outlook. But there is a great deal to feel positive about. Leisure travel demand is incredibly resilient. We've seen this proven in the wake of the pandemic just as we did amidst the global financial crisis a decade and a half ago. Most of our markets are fully recovered and the geographies that are lagging are positioned to move forward. Our competitive position is strong in every corner of our network. In the core of our network, we outcompete the largest airlines in the world. And above all else, we continue to have the best team in the business that has overcome the adversities of the last few years and continues to deliver the outstanding service and hospitality that is our hallmark. I am encouraged by our progress, but not satisfied with where we are. What I am sure about is that we are on the right path. With that, let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our results and commercial outlook in more detail.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter, and Aloha everyone. Overall, our third quarter revenue performance came in as expected. Concerns about inflation or recession do not appear to have impacted consumer demand in the quarter. Passenger revenue was down just 4.5% from 2019. We operated 113% of our domestic capacity and just 52% of our international capacity compared to 2019. Yields in the third quarter on our US Mainland to Hawaii routes were 9% higher than the third quarter of 2019. Our revenue management team using our new revenue management system did a fantastic job of improving yield for these markets. Well, it's only been six months since we cut over to our new RM system, the team is adapting well, the technology is clearly superior and we have more that we can do in this space going forward. In the Neighbor Island selling fares introduced in the market are clearly below historical levels and below any of the markets served by the big four US carriers. But it is stimulating demand and confirming our conviction that consumers favor our product. As Peter mentioned, we're contending with a $39 fare throughout the end of the year, but we are managing yields above that base level where it makes sense to do so. Further evidence that Hawaiian being the preferred product in the market. Low fares at some of our Neighbor Island route\u2019s up 10 plus load factor points versus 2019, especially in markets that have a high percentage of local traffic. Underscoring this strictly in state travel, guests with local ZIP codes exceeded 2019 levels in September despite a smaller schedule. The recovery continued to be strong for our international markets, excluding Japan. Obviously the policies of Japanese government continue to dampen that market throughout the third quarter. In our markets outside of Japan, however, average fares for the quarter were up 31% compared to 2019, which drove a ticket PRASM improvement of 25% of the strong fare performance, all despite the strength of the US dollar. Sydney, in particular, had a resounding recovery with PRASM improvement of over 50% versus 2019. An ongoing theme, our premium products continue to perform very well. We saw continued strong demand for our front cabin with North America premium cabin PRASM up 34% compared to 2019 for the quarter. Extra comfort revenue remain strong and the sale of preferred seats, which we introduced this past spring, continues to meet or exceed our expectations. Total ancillary revenue, including seats, bags, cargo and other products continues to perform very well. Our co-branded credit card program achieved another record quarter with revenue up 15% versus 2019. Net retail sales were up 13% and new accounts were up 18% versus 2019, both records for the program. Acquisition and spend remain strong, showing no signs of weakening. The cargo team delivered its highest third quarter revenue ever, up over 62% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Yields remain strong, up 73% compared to the third quarter of 2019 with the strongest demand from the Asia Pacific region. Looking forward, we are pleased by both domestic and international bookings and are expecting a continuation of strong demand for travel to Hawaii. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate overall revenue to be up about 3.5% from 2019. Breaking this down further by geography, in North America, we continue to see strong demand and anticipate our load factor will exceed fourth quarter 2019 levels. We anticipate our fourth quarter PRASM for North America to be about 18% higher than the same quarter 2019, which includes a mid single digit tailwind from the spoilage revisions Shannon referenced last quarter. The calendar works against us this year with an early Thanksgiving and Christmas on the Sunday. Nevertheless, we are positioned for a strong finish to the year in this region. We expect to fly at similar schedule to the third quarter at about 9% more flying than our fourth quarter 2019 schedule. And while industry capacity to Hawaii is still elevated relative to 2019, we are continuing to see moderation through the fall and into the winter. We remain well positioned and based on the latest the data from the DOT, we continue to materially outperform our competitors on PRASM in North America. This demonstrates the strength of our North America network, our focus on the Hawaii premium leisure traveler, our award winning service and our optimally configured aircraft. In the Neighbor Island, we expect to fly about 80% of our 2019 capacity in the fourth quarter, and we are competing well and continue to maintain a share of local traffic well in excess of our seats here, earning a sizable load factor premium, as well as meaningful yield premium compared to our competitor. However, the deeply discounted fares will pressure industry PRASM. Internationally, Sydney is continuing to build nicely through the end of the year. Auckland and Incheon are building a bit more slowly but their clear signs of recovery has taken hold in those markets, and fares are holding up very well. As Peter mentioned, the cap on daily arrivals to Japan was lifted on October 11. And we've seen a positive inflection in demand following the announcement, but intend to take a measured approach to restoring capacity to pre-pandemic levels. Japan-Hawaii traffic typically has an extended booking curve, and certain prominent travel retailers continue to focus on domestic leisure travel, taking advantage of government incentives. Our current plan is to restore capacity throughout the next couple of quarters with a full Japan schedule in place by the second quarter of 2023. Thus, our capacity Japan will likely align with the broader industry capacity plans.  Moving to our capacity outlook. We anticipate our overall capacity for the fourth quarter to be down approximately 5.5% from 2019 levels, bringing our full year capacity down approximately 9.2% from 2019, which is slightly lower than we forecasted last quarter, reflecting the adjustments to our Japan schedule. To summarize, we continue to see strong demand and we expect our fourth quarter load factor to be close to 2019 levels, premium cabin PRASM improvements to continue to accelerate to historical highs and extra comfort revenue to exceed 2019 levels. Internationally, with travel restrictions removed in all of our destinations, we expect demand will continue to build. We have the right products for our markets, a strong brand, an exceptional team and a winning formula for success. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent and thanks everyone for joining us today. First, we filed an 8-K yesterday, disclosing that we'll be restating the first and second quarters GAAP results. This is due to an adjustment to reclassify approximately $19.4 million in unrealized losses from other comprehensive income to the income statement. As these losses are unrealized, this change will have no impact on adjusted results. Now, let me provide an update on the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we have ample liquidity. We closed the quarter with $1.7 billion in total liquidity inclusive of cash, short term investments and our undrawn revolver. Adjusted net debt was $1 billion, which continues to be near 2019 levels. As I mentioned last quarter, high fuel prices and uncertain economy and lower internal and fare all point to maintaining strong liquidity for the coming quarters. Turning to the P&L. We finished the quarter with an adjusted EBITDA of $47.9 million. These results were as expected with higher fuel costs and a challenging internal and fare environment, offset by the strong North America and international demand environment that Brent discussed. On the cost side, our third quarter non-fuel costs, excluding nonrecurring items totaled $512 million with unit costs, excluding fuel and special items up 10% compared to 2019, which was consistent with our expectations. Fuel costs rose in the third quarter to $3.54 per gallon, up approximately 1.2% from our July guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect our unit costs excluding fuel and special items to be up about 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 on a capacity decrease of 5.5%. As with previous quarters, this quarter\u2019s biggest drivers are market driven increases, primarily in wage rates and airport rents. We're also incurring costs to prepare for future growth, including pilot training and other startup costs related to our new cargo flying for Amazon, as well as the future induction of the 787s. While these costs present near term headwinds, they are investments which lay the foundation for substantial future benefits. Additionally, we continue to invest heavily in technology, the benefits of which will be realized in increased revenue and labor productivity. For the full year, we continue to expect unit costs, excluding fuel and special items to be up approximately 13% compared to 2019 on a capacity decrease of about 9%. We also expect our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $15 million. Our capital expenditure forecast for 2022 is approximately $130 million, which is a little higher than our previous guidance due to an increase in technology spend. About $17 million of the remaining CapEx is related to pre delivery payments for our 787s, some or all of which has the possibility of moving into 2023. We continue to partner with Boeing to determine a final delivery schedule. We've also updated guidance on our full year fuel price and consumption and our tax rate in the 8-K that was released today. As we look out into the remainder of 2022, we're confident that we are well along the road to recovery, and our focus is on the long term success of our business. To ensure our delivery of outstanding service and hospitality, we remain committed to invest not only in our daily operations in areas such as training, light operations and safety and security, but also for our future as we grow and become a [modern] airline with a more diversified business. In addition to running a solid passenger business, we're excited to begin our new venture with Amazon as we take advantage of our core strengths, operating a solid airline and delivering authentic Hawaiian hospitality. And with that, we can open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Shannon, I just want to go back to, you talked about the cost guide and you talked about pressures, startup costs tied to Amazon, pilot training tied to the 787? Are some of those, are they either going to be capitalized or expenses incurred, or are you going to call them out as special items when they hit the P&L? How are they going to be treated? I'm just curious as we think about the CASM trajectory over the next year or two?\nShannon Okinaka: As far as some of our Amazon accounting, we haven't quite got to the final determination for some of the startup costs. So I think I can provide you more information on that in January, as far as how we'll treat the Amazon startup costs. So I think for now, especially with things like pilot training, it's kind of hard to piece out what level of pilot training is specifically for Amazon or 787, or our own passenger growth. So that's going to be a little bit hard for me to quantify next year, I think, we'll just have to build that into our cost guidance as we as we move forward.\nMike Linenberg: And then, Peter, listening to your commentary about inter-island competition and some of the comments, the follow-up comments by Brent, you sort of list through each of the key elements there, where the competitor maybe, either -- I mean, you know, that market better than anybody, like you said, you've been serving it for 90 years, pricing below cost, pricing at a loss, potentially. You start checking off the boxes there and it looks like that we may have a case here of predatory pricing here. Is that where we're going here? And I know the Justice Department is -- seems like they're a lot more focused on where they think there's potential harm they seem to be looking at everything. Is that what maybe going on here, because as best as you can tell when you look at the numbers and the fares, and you have access, we all have access, you can get that data better than anybody. It doesn't look like the competitor there is actually pricing to generate any sort of profit, is that -- is my sort of thinking right or where are you on this?\nPeter Ingram: I'll leave the legal questions to someone else, Mike. But what I will say is fares of $26.05 do not cover the total cost of operations, as I said in my prepared remarks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: So Peter, are we to assume, with your decision to stand and compete on the inter-island competition, that perhaps summer all these flights are operating at a cash loss? And I know, you said that you don't want to speculate, I want this competitors end game might be. But is there perhaps some lower yielding traffic here that you would perhaps be willing to walk away from should this persist longer than expected?\nPeter Ingram: So let me start and see if Brent or Shannon has anything to add. There are certainly some of the operating costs that are noncash, most notable one, obviously, is depreciation and some of the aircraft ownership. And in our case, our aircraft are already substantially depreciated. And the cost of ownership is very low on our fleet. Most of the costs are cash. I would say it is the case, though, that there's a lot of things that are sometimes challenging to attribute to a specific flight in the way we look at the cost structure. But what I would say about the price structure that's in there right now, if you look at how the pricing is elsewhere in the country and markets under 250 miles, you won't see pricing in the local market anywhere close to what we're seeing here. So it's highly unusual and I don't think sustainable for the long term. In terms of whether we would walk away from some low yielding traffic, I think that's -- and Brent may have something to add to this. But I think some of that is difficult to do, because people see the fares all the time, some of our best regular corporate accounts have access to $39 fares and in a different environment, those yields on that traffic might be different. But I don't think we have any intention of walking away from those sorts of customers that are important just in the current environment when you've got such pervasive low fares, they are going to permeate the entire revenue structure.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, I think as Peter mentioned, we are aggressively competing for traffic. We think that is the right long term answer to do in terms of protecting our customer base. But we are managing up on those windows where there are opportunities to sell up. And so whether they be holidays, whether it\u2019d be key business times, there are some pockets where we can manage that. But we feel overall we need to compete aggressively and defend our market and give customers choice that they've shown they clearly prefer us.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: And then Shannon or Peter, given what you're seeing with respect to this inter-island competition, the removal of travel restrictions and any startup costs from Amazon. How are you thinking about capacity and CASM ex for next year?\nShannon Okinaka: So we're not prepared yet to give CASM ex guidance for the full year. But if we think about our costs and in generally two or three buckets, some of our just business as usual costs have gone up and that's where we're talking about those market increases like labor, fuel is going to do what fuel is going to do, we're going to see that across the industry. But to the point we've been making, we do have a bunch of investment costs. And it includes things outside of Amazon and 787s, we are investing in a new PSS, that's going to continue in 2023. We're still as we ramp up our ASMs in the first half of the year, we're still below 2019 levels of ASM, which also pressures unit costs. But at this point, we think it's really important for us to continue investing in the business for the future growth, because we know those ASMs will come back.\nPeter Ingram: And just to add to that, on the capacity outlook for next year. When Shannon\u2019s referring to ASMs being below 19, it is really in the early part of the year as we're ramping [and] up. Our expectation and you can see it reflected in the schedule update that's out there now for Japan recovery is a schedule that we expect to fly at this point, which is different than some of the schedule add over the last two years as things have been very dynamic. And we would expect as we get beyond that ramp that we do have capacity up above where it was in 2019, probably for the full year, it's somewhere in the low to mid single digits level.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: Peter, you went through all the inter-island dynamics very thoroughly. You\u2019ve spoke about the slow ramp in Japan, but you're also seeing pretty decent sequential revenue improvement 3Q to 4Q. Just wondering where are you seeing much of this offsetting strength coming from, is it good holiday? Just curious where you're seeing that strength.\nPeter Ingram: Really North America has a nice sequential improvement. While the calendar is working against us a little bit in the latter part of the quarter, the front part of the quarter looks really, really strong in North America. And so we're encouraged with what we're seeing in terms of average fare improvement really in both cabins. And so that is, we've seen that coming out of the summer and that continues to accelerate into really into October, November and December. While the calendar is working against, it still looks like it'll be a pretty good month. So some improvement clearly in Japan as it comes off from the depths of where it was at but really I would say North America is powering a disproportionate amount of that and again, more on the average fare side and a little bit on the load factor side.\nAndrew Didora: And Peter, I apologize, I wasn't able to be on the call on Friday. But when we think about kind of this Amazon deal, should we really think about this as a cost plus contract, so that the margins on this look relatively low versus the actual revenues brought in. And just curious, just in terms of the revenue that you will book, does this include a lot of the pass through items, such as fuel and certain maintenance items or am I wrong on that thought process?\nPeter Ingram: We will -- on the how we're going to account for those pass through items, which you know the most significant of which is fuel. I think that's one of the things we're going to be sorting out now that we have a broader population of people that we're allowed to talk to about this. But those items are clearly pass through. The bulk of the revenue that we think of as at risk revenue is going to be in the form of a per block our operated revenue that we book and a per departure revenue that we book. And it's up to us to make sure that that revenue exceeds the costs that we incur, primarily from the crew and maintenance of those aircraft, the biggest sort of elements of the cost structure. So it is -- in that sense, it is -- there's an element of costs plus but those, the per block hour and the per departure rate is established in the contract that we've negotiated with Amazon. There is a mechanism for adjustment over time based on particular drivers. But our ability to generate the margin is really going to be a function of how we manage our costs below that. And frankly, our success is not only hinging on that but it's our ability to satisfy our customer by operating absolutely reliably on a very consistent basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global.\nDan McKenzie: Peter, over the years, you seem to have always found a way to backfill lost revenue. So if anyone can pull a rabbit out of a hat, it's you given the network wins over the past decade. And so I guess as we think about backfilling the loss revenue, given the new competitive dynamic, Amazon seems to be a start once up and running later next year. But on the partner side, going back to the JAL JV that failed to win antitrust immunity. Does it make sense to revisit other international opportunities that are out there or how should we think about other tricks that could be up your sleeve to backfill some of this lost revenue?\nPeter Ingram: On the international side, I think the biggest opportunity is to get to a full recovery of Japan. And while we are planning to approach that methodically over the coming months, we do think that the historical importance of Japan travel to Hawaii should not be understated, and really is the largest international opportunity. We're going to continue to look for other places that our service would be in demand. I think Brent and the network planning team have a variety of things in mind for future growth as we have aircraft available, particularly as we get to the point where the 787s start arriving, and we free up some flexibility in that regard. So we absolutely think there's still runway for growth. We remain primarily a passenger business. We're going to execute the Amazon contract very well but it doesn't detract from our focus on running the passenger operation and looking for opportunities to grow it as we move forward.\nDan McKenzie: And then second question here, going back to the Amazon opportunity. One follow-up question that I had was just simply on the warrants. And I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on the thought process for warrants close to 18 -- I think was 18% of the company, not more than 20%. But why is that sort of the right level of ownership or the right amount for you to grant them, and is it possible that that could potentially be upsized at some point?\nPeter Ingram: Like everything else, this was a subject of negotiation and a back and forth over several months with Amazon. And ultimately, we came to a total package on the contract that we think is a worthwhile endeavor for our company, and we're excited about it moving forward. Just to correct one number. You said there, it's not 18%, it's 15% of fully diluted shares, 9.4 million shares.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Quinn Wasko with Cowen.\nQuinn Wasko: This Quinn for Helane. So, just thinking about the loosening of travel restrictions in Japan. My thought at the time was when those restrictions came off, we would start to see more capacity and schedule getting allocated to Japan. But it seems since then the capacity has pulled back a bit, even most recently this week, getting pulled back all the way into February. And so maybe just thinking about the full recovery of that market into one each \u201823 seeing that recovery. What's giving you confidence in that being the point where we're going to start seeing this capacity come back online?\nPeter Ingram: We had worked our way through and we were waiting on some governmental approvals around our ability to operate a smaller schedule and protect some of our slots. And so some of that had taken a while, which caused us to publish the schedule a little bit later than frankly we would have liked. But yes, as you can see, we've got kind of a published ramp up now through, really through the end of this quarter, a little extra holiday flying back down and then we'll kind of gradually right now bring back more service in the first quarter. As we talked about, we think there is a longer booking curve here. Japanese residents, comfort and travel is going to take a little bit longer than it has in other geographies. A focus on traveling abroad, I think, it's going to take a little while but we're -- we think that's about the sweet spot where folks will start coming back, and we'll see stronger golden week in travel really at the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter and we plan on matching our capacity concurrent with that.\nBrent Overbeek: And just as a point of clarification, Quinn, we aren't reducing our capacity from the level we're flying. We actually increased our schedule in August to get to more of a full -- close to a full daily service between Honolulu and each of Narita, Osaka and Kamata. There is no reduction from that. What is reflected in the schedule reductions is a slower pace of growth in our forward schedules as opposed to a reduction from where we are today. And we do anticipate over the course of the fourth quarter having some more of that capacity through Japan come back as we move through the period and then again more in the first quarter.\nQuinn Wasko: And so moving on to your Amazon business that you guys are doing with them, when you're thinking about how you're going to be sourcing as pilots and how you're going to fill that capacity. If for whatever reason there was some constraints on the pilot hiring, would you think about constraints from your international capacity, especially to Japan, if that market isn't fully recovered yet and moving some to the Amazon business?\nPeter Ingram: I think we've got an extremely high level of confidence that we're going to be able to procure, source all the pilots that we need. We've got a very compelling proposition to aspiring pilots at Hawaiian Airlines. If you look at our fleet composition today, on the passenger side with 24 of our 61 aircraft being widebody aircraft, we've already got a higher proportion of widebody aircraft in the fleet, which are the higher paying positions than any of the US carriers, including big three network carriers. On top of that, we've got commitment for 10 more widebodies from Amazon and we've gotten order for 10 more widebodies entering the form of our firm 787 order. The career earnings potential is really pretty attractive for pilots. And so we're confident in our ability to find pilots available. There are -- we're continuing to hire every month and we're confident in our ability to work through the training that we need to make sure that we're ready to serve our customer when we start flying in the back half of next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Peter, just going back to the Amazon business. So just want to clarify, there are no volume commitments on the CMI lease and then B, so do these rates set on a per flight segment basis or at the start of the year? And if Amazon starts to move the schedule around with respect to seasonality in peak and therefore block hours. How do you manage your per flight margins?\nPeter Ingram: So I'll start on that and then I'll maybe hand it over to Jim Landers, who you guys met on the call on Friday, and who's in here again with us today. There are no specific volume levels of flying that need to be maintained in the contract. But there are significant incentives to manage utilization higher on the aircraft and therefore provide a predictable level of flying. And that is, just when you think about it, these will be the biggest and the newest aircraft in the Amazon air fleet across a variety of carriers. They are incentivized to cover the fixed costs of those efficiently by scheduling them regularly and keeping them going and probably keeping them going generally on the longer haul and highest demand parts of their network. So we're going to work closely with them on managing that schedule over time. They really do value the flexibility to make the adjustments they need to serve their customers, but they want to do that in a way that puts the carriers that are operating for them in a position to be successful as well. And so we'll work with them over time to make sure we can execute on that. Jim, anything you would add?\nJim Landers: Yes. I would just say that we're in our early days of working through the details of the relationship. But clearly in the cyclicality of the year -- of the shopping year, where there maybe peaks and valleys, we can look to optimize the aircraft utilization through maintenance events and optimizing the whitespace and other ways to make sure that we're getting the best out of the aircraft. But to Peter's point on being their new flagship and largest aircraft, we expect a high degree of utilization.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Ingram for closing comments.\nPeter Ingram: All right. Mahalo again, and thank you all for joining us today. Let me also again thank our team for meeting the challenges of the competitive marketplace and continuing to deliver the warm hospitality that sets Hawaiian apart from others. I look forward to updating you on our progress again in a few months. Aloha.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jay Schaefer, Vice President and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\nJay Schaefer: Thank you, Maria. Hello, everyone and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings second quarter 2022 results conference call. Here with me in Honolulu are Peter Ingram, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Overbeek, Chief Revenue Officer; and Shannon Okinaka, Chief Financial Officer. Peter will provide an overview of our performance; Brent will discuss revenue and Shannon will discuss cost and the balance sheet. At the end of the prepared remarks, we will open the call up for questions. By now, everyone should have access to the press release that went out at about 4 o\u2019clock Eastern Time today. If you have not received the release, it\u2019s available on the Investor Relations page of our website, hawaiianairlines.com. During our call today, we will refer at times to adjusted or non-GAAP numbers and metrics. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers and metrics can be found at the end of today\u2019s press release posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. As a reminder, the following prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our future plans and potential future financial and operating performance. Management may also make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer you to Hawaiian Holdings\u2019 recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. These include our most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K as well as subsequent reports filed on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Hello, Jay. Aloha, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Demand for travel to from and within Hawaii remains very strong. As you know, we updated our second quarter outlook at the end of May due to improved demand throughout our network. And today\u2019s results are better than our May expectations. We anticipate strong demand continuing into the third quarter as we increase our international schedule. And importantly, with stability returning to the demand environment, we continue to reduce our debt levels while maintaining a healthy liquidity position. In North America, yields improved throughout the quarter compared to the corresponding months in 2019, with premium demand leading the way. Every indication suggests a continuation of these trends as we enter the third quarter. Internationally, the recovery in demand has taken root in Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, Tahiti and American Samoa. Travel restrictions in Japan have prevented us from resuming a full pre-pandemic schedule. But these restrictions are incrementally easing. And next month, we are resuming service to Haneda, at the same time as we increase frequency from Narita and Osaka. As we saw when restrictions loosened in North America, consumers in international markets are showing strong interest in visiting Hawaii. In the second quarter, the commercial team fully implemented variable seat pricing on all North America routes. And early results are exceeding the business case expectations. Building on our success in the Premium Cabin and with our Extra Comfort product, variable seat pricing helps us better capitalize on our award winning service. And as we discussed on last quarter\u2019s call, we are caught in the implementation of our passenger service system transition is underway and on track to launch in the spring of 2023. Turning to our sustainability efforts in May, we released our Corporate Kuleana Report. Kuleana is the Hawaiian word for responsibility. And this report reflects our commitment to our environmental, social and governance priorities. This year, we announced commitments to replace single-use plastics in our cabins by 2029, to increase local sourcing of food and beverages served on board to 40%, and an ongoing focus on sustainable tourism. As we work toward our commitment to become carbon neutral by 2050, we also announced a strategic partnership with REGENT to support the development of the Monarch, a 100-seat electric seaglider for potential application in Hawaiian inter-island travel. We also announced an agreement with Par Hawaii, Hawaii\u2019s largest supplier of energy products to explore the commercial viability of locally produced sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. SAF is by far the most important near and medium-term component of our efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. And this study will be an important step toward developing SAF supply in our home state, which will be critical to our long-term sustainability goals. I know that staffing has been in the news recently as delays and cancellations create frustrations for travelers and airlines. Our team has worked diligently to stay out of these headlines, with a completion percentage of 99.5% for the quarter and 99.9% from the beginning of the Memorial Day travel period through the end of the quarter. We continue to see strong demand for open pilot and flight attendant positions. Executing on our pilot training efforts will remain a focus of our management team through the end of the year, as this represents the primary constraint on our scheduling flexibility. And while aircraft technician and airport operations staffing remain tighter than we would prefer. We are working to ensure that we can successfully attract the right talent. Tight coordination between our recruiting, training and schedule planning teams is ongoing to ensure that we can operate schedules that we publish. The labor agreement covering our pilots became amendable this month. We have had positive and productive conversations with ALPA well ahead of this month\u2019s amendable date. And we look forward to completing a new contract that recognizes the critical contribution our pilots make to our business and the competitive environment for these highly skilled professionals. At this point, we can\u2019t put a specific timeline to completing these negotiations. High and volatile fuel prices will continue to be a challenge going forward, especially on our more fuel-intensive long-haul operations. While the gyrations of the fuel, the global jet fuel market are beyond our control, we will focus on managing what we can, including cost management elsewhere in the business and revenue generation. Compared to the challenges of 2020 and most of 2021, these are high class problems. And I am pleased with our performance in the second quarter and the outlook for the third quarter. Our team throughout the operation and here at our headquarters has done a fantastic job navigating the twists and turns of the past several quarters. And their hard work has been recognized by the traveling public who selected Hawaiian Airlines as the best domestic airline in Travel + Leisure magazine\u2019s World\u2019s Best Awards recent survey. The progress we continue to make on our goals for 2022 sets us up well for the remainder of the year and for years beyond. With that, let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our commercial results and outlook in more detail.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter. Aloha everyone. As Peter mentioned, our second quarter revenue performance was better than expected throughout our network. Passenger revenue was down just 5.5% from 2019. Although 2 points of the quarter\u2019s revenue performance compared to 2019 was due to an accounting revisions that Shannon will elaborate on later. We operated 112% of our domestic capacity and 31% of our international capacity compared to 2019. Demand for our North American markets was robust throughout the quarter, peaking with a 92.9% load factor in June. Yields also strengthened as we progress through the quarter, with June up about 9% versus 2019. For our inter-island market, the second quarter saw good recovery in both fair and volume and recovery has been rapid for those international markets that have fully relaxed travel restrictions. As we increase our Japan flying, our performance there in the near-term will be constrained by the passenger arrival caps currently at 20,000 per day. However, we are optimistic that the cap will be increased or lifted altogether in the coming months. Similar to last quarter, our premium products continue to perform very well. We saw continued strong demand for our front cabin, with North America Premium Cabin PRASM, up 37% for the quarter versus 2019. Total ancillary revenue, including seats, bags, cargo and other products, continues to perform exceptionally well. System-wide Extra Comfort revenue was up 2% compared to the second quarter of 2019 despite reduced capacity. In North America, Extra Comfort revenue was up 25% on 15% more capacity. And as Peter mentioned, preferred seats are off to an encouraging start and the benefits will approach steady state as we get later in the year. Our co-brand credit card program continues to show strong performance, with another record quarter as revenue was up 11% versus 2019. Net retail sales were up 14% and new accounts increased by 11% compared to 2019, both records for the program. Acquisition and spend remain strong, with no signs of weakening. The cargo team recorded its highest second quarter revenue ever, up 50% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Second quarter yields remain strong up 84% compared to the second quarter of 2019, with the strongest demand from our Asia-Pacific sales. Looking forward, we are encouraged by both domestic and international bookings and are expecting continued strong demand for travel to Hawaii. For the third quarter, we anticipate overall revenue to be down about 1.5% from 2019. Breaking this further down by geography, in North America, we continue to see strong demand, anticipate our load factor to approach third quarter 2019 levels. The revenue environment continues to improve and we anticipate our third quarter PRASM for North America to exceed 2019 levels or roughly 2 points sequential improvement from the second quarter. We expect to fly a similar amount of capacity to the second quarter at about 116% of our 2019 schedule. While industry capacity to Hawaii is still elevated, we continue to see moderation both versus last year and 2019 as we move through the summer and into the fall. We remain well-positioned and based on the latest data from the DOT we continue to materially outperform our competitors on PRASM in North America. This demonstrates the strength of our North America network focused on the Hawaii premium leisure traveler, award winning service and optimally configured aircraft. In the Neighbor Islands, we expect to fly about 82% of our 2019 capacity in the third quarter. As with last quarter, we have implemented modest schedule adjustments based on some of the pilot bottlenecks impacting our 717 fleet. We remain well-positioned and continue to maintain a share of local traffic, well in excess of our seat share and earn a very sizable load factor premium as well as yield premium versus our competitor. However, the recent reintroduction of deeply discounted fares will pressure industry PRASM in this entity. Internationally, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing a fairly rapid recovery for markets that are not subject to ongoing travel restrictions. South Korea performance is very strong since the quarantine requirement was removed in April. Sydney is built a bit more slowly, but July load factors are in the 80s, which is positive and yields remain strong. Auckland, where we just resumed service in July, is beginning to accelerate and we are optimistic of our performance there. Of course, a full recovery in Japan is dependent on the easing of government restrictions on arrivals and the current yen-dollar exchange rate, which is down about 22% compared to 2019, will increase the cost of Hawaii vacation for these travelers. However, consistent with our other international geographies as restrictions ease, we do anticipate demand to pick up materially. Moving to our capacity outlook, we anticipate our overall capacity for the third quarter to be down approximately 6.5% from 2019 levels. This is about 6 points higher than the same comparison for the second quarter as we continue to build back in the international network. For the full year, we expect capacity to be down approximately 9.5%. However, this may move a bit depending on the changes to the Japanese government\u2019s cap on arrivals. To summarize, we anticipate strong domestic demand and we expect our load factors to be close to 2019 levels, Premium Cabin PRASM improvements to continue to accelerate to historical highs and Extra Comfort revenue to exceed 2019 levels. Internationally, travel restrictions continue to ease and we are seeing robust demand for Hawaii vacation. We have the right products for our markets, the strong brand, exceptional team, and a winning formula for success. With that, I will turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent and thanks everyone for joining us today. Let me start with an update on the balance sheet. We closed the quarter with $1.8 billion in total liquidity, inclusive of cash, short-term investments and our undrawn revolver. Adjusted net debt was $944 million, which continues to be below 2019 levels. During the quarter, we fully redeemed the remaining principal on our 2020 WTC bonds. The combination of the tender offer in November 2021 and the redemption in June reduced our outstanding debt by $223 million or 11%. Not only does this improve our leverage, but will trim our interest expense by $18 million per year. In total, since we issued our loyalty program bonds in 2021, we\u2019ve reduced our debt load by $607 million or 27%. The remaining debt and lease principal payments for this year totaled $36 million. Our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample liquidity. With high fuel prices and an uncertain economy, we plan to maintain liquidity above pre-pandemic levels for the coming quarters. Turning to the P&L. We finished the quarter with an adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 million. These results were better than we originally expected despite increases in fuel costs, given the strong domestic revenue results that Brent discussed. As Brent noted, in the second quarter, we recorded additional passenger revenue to accelerate the recognition of spoilage of unused tickets. This change in estimate was based on an evaluation of the trends for passenger use or non-use of unsold tickets. The impact to the second quarter was $10 million more than what we had anticipated entering the quarter. On the cost side, our second quarter non-fuel costs, excluding non-recurring items, totaled $491 million, with unit costs up 16% compared to 2019, which was at the better end of our expectations. This year over 3-year increase is primarily due to wage and airport rate increases accompanied by lower ASMs. For the third quarter, we expect our unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, to be up about 10% compared to the third quarter of 2019 on a capacity decrease of 6.5%. As with last quarter, this quarter\u2019s biggest drivers are wages and benefits and airport rents. For the full year, we expect unit costs to be up approximately 14% compared to 2019 on a capacity decrease of about 9.5%. Fuel costs rose in the second quarter to $3.95 per gallon, up approximately 5% from our May guidance update. And we\u2019re forecasting our price per gallon for the third quarter to be $3.50 based on the forward curve as of July 14. We expect our fuel consumption for the third quarter to be down about 12.5% as compared to 2019. Our capital expenditure forecast for 2022 is approximately $115 million, with about two-thirds for aircraft and the remaining third for non-aircraft spend. The majority of the aircraft CapEx is pre-delivery payments for our 787s. Some or potentially all of these payments may shift into 2023 depending on the timing of our delivery schedule, which is still in flux. The non-aircraft expenditures reflect investments in technology and in our facilities. We expect our adjusted EBITDA to increase in the third quarter to approximately $45 million. While fuel has moderated somewhat in the past month, as Peter mentioned, yields will need to improve further to fully offset the high fuel cost environment. And as we have seen through the first half of the year, fuel prices are susceptible to volatility. In conclusion, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re on the road to recovery, and our focus is on the long-term success of our business by strengthening our brand and award-winning hospitality and service to differentiate us from the competition and win in the marketplace, restoring our international service and returning operations to full scale, hiring and training our people as we plan and prepare for our future, and investing in foundational technology to enhance our commercial agility and increase our cost competitiveness. We believe that these priorities are the winning formula to growing value for our shareholders. And with that, we can open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. So I have, I think just two questions. One is on Orlando. So you guys went to Orlando and now you\u2019re leaving Orlando. Can you just talk a little bit about that decision?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, Helane, I think listen, as with the delay of our 787s, we\u2019ve known for some time, we wouldn\u2019t have sufficient aircraft to continue operating on all the routes that we had added in North America as demand for those aircraft increased. And Orlando has been a strong market during the peak periods, but during some of its off-peak periods was a little bit softer than we anticipated. And given where we were with aircraft, it was the best decision right now in terms of the network.\nHelane Becker: Got it. Okay. And then so maybe you can just say that like as we think about the guidance, you\u2019ve taken those ASMs out. So what percentage of the growth in ASMs was \u2013 would represent Orlando?\nPeter Ingram: We\u2019ve taken them out in terms of the guidance, and it would have been relatively small. We\u2019re talking about something that was operating 3 days a week in the back part of \u2013 for 3 weeks in September. So I don\u2019t have that number handy, Helane, but it\u2019s pretty de minimis.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s fine. And then on the 717s, with fuel prices going up, does that fill that, does that change the way you\u2019re going to be thinking about replacing the 717s? I know you talked about the new, the Monarch, which kind of could be an exciting opportunity. But just what about the \u2013 what about shorter-term, right, because that\u2019s probably a 2030 kind of a thing?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Thanks, Helane. The 717s, we still expect to be operating that airplane at least through the middle of the decade as we\u2019ve communicated before. Frankly, fuel costs on short-haul flying like we have in our Neighbor Island operation is a smaller proportion of the total cost equation than is ground handling costs, airport costs, other things associated with the fact that it\u2019s a very high frequency, high cycle environment. And frankly, that goes for the operating costs of the airplane and the cycle costs on power-by-the-hour deals and things like that. So it\u2019s really not as fuel-sensitive. The 717 is a terrific airplane for what we do. They are really \u2013 if we could replace 717s with new 717s, that would probably be the ideal aircraft choice for us at some point. So we\u2019re happy with that airplane, and it doesn\u2019t really change the equation.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Alright, well, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Sure. Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. \nMike Linenberg: Hi, good morning, everyone. I guess a couple here. On the A330s, obviously, you\u2019re bringing the plane back from Orlando since I think you indicated to backfill into some of the international that you\u2019re ramping back up. But what is the utilization on that airplane? When I sort of think what your schedule looks like in September and beyond, it still seems like you\u2019re down pretty meaningfully. Can you talk about what the utilization is? And what sort of embedded productivity gains that you should see as you ramp that fleet back up to full utilization? What\u2019s the headwind?\nPeter Ingram: So we aren\u2019t at kind of peak productivity in terms of the 330s. We will get there as we get later in the year and build Japan back a little bit more. So I don\u2019t have the exact number in terms of productivity. It\u2019s probably a little bit less than where we were back in 2019. But as we continue to build back Japan in the latter part of the year, I think we will get back to the same levels, if not maybe a little bit higher of productivity. And I want to say at that point, it was around 12 hours a day, but I don\u2019t have that number handy.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. And then when I look at the EBITDA guide for the third quarter, it does look like that you still \u2013 you may be close to \u2013 at the high end, maybe you\u2019re slightly profitable, at the midpoint, maybe you\u2019re not. I think the third quarter seasonally is also one of your better quarters. Where are we \u2013 are we at the limit on how much you can take fares up, given where the fuel prices are and the elasticity of demand? Are we pushing on a string here? Assuming that Asia doesn\u2019t or Japan doesn\u2019t come back, where do you get that additional revenue when you\u2019re dealing with a largely discretionary, relatively more price-sensitive customer base? How should we think about that?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. So let me touch on a couple of things and then see if Brent or Shannon want to add on to it a little bit. I think there is still some opportunity for upside. One of the things we\u2019re encouraged about is we look at DOT data, which has a little bit of a lag, but we really haven\u2019t seen changes in the trends. We continue to outperform our competitors in all the geographies we serve in terms of revenue generation, and we know our cost structure is competitive as well. So I think we are the most profitable airline in the markets we serve, but the market mix we have is a little bit different competitively than some of our competitors have across their networks. I think as we get back to flying more to Japan, you\u2019ll see that manifest itself in terms of improved productivity on the labor side. Today, we have more pilots on payroll than we did in 2019, but we aren\u2019t doing as much flying as we did in 2019. So clearly, as we get that utilization up, we have improvement on the cost side. We haven\u2019t seen any weakening in the demand in North America, which is the biggest part of our market. You do see some seasonal changes as we go into the fall, but really nothing that indicates demand. And we are optimistic about Japan. Brent mentioned the potential headwind of the exchange rate. But if you look at how robust demand has been in places like Australia and South Korea, which haven\u2019t necessarily benefited from favorable exchange rates themselves, we have seen a real strong desire for travel and a willingness to spend. And I think Japan is going to help us a lot as we move through the end of the year and into 2023.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Peter, just a quick follow-on and maybe Brent can add on this. Just you\u2019ve done a nice job on the premium product, and I think that your product stands out. But I \u2013 when I look at your widebodies, I feel like you don\u2019t have enough seats, you may \u2013 maybe you\u2019ll disagree with me, but I think the premium has been where people are paying up and some of those fares are pretty high. If you had your druthers, is it \u2013 what is it, is it 18 seats on the A330, and maybe is the right number, 24 or 28, like if you could have more seats or maybe it doesn\u2019t matter, maybe that\u2019s not the issue there, because I feel like you\u2019re \u2013 relative to some of your competitors, you do have a smaller Premium Cabin, and it may be where \u2013 that may be where you\u2019re leaving revenue on the table? I don\u2019t know. Correct?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, look, Mike, this is a subject we discuss a fair bit around here. And I think we felt when we modified the A330s back several years ago now that we had the right sweet spot for that moment in history. But I think your observation is right. Brent\u2019s been getting on these calls quarter-after-quarter and telling you that our Premium demand has been improving faster than our Main Cabin demand. And I think if we \u2013 if there was zero cost to doing a fleet transition and we could complete it overnight and not have aircraft out of service for a long time, we probably would stretch that Front Cabin back a little bit, particularly on the A330s and possibly even on the A321s as well.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, I think, Peter, you took the words out of my mouth. I think if we had a no cost option there, we would clearly go do that. It\u2019s something that we will continue to evaluate kind of the economics over the life of that airplane, not just in the short-term in terms of today\u2019s environment. I will say we have seen probably a little more strength on the 330 than we have in the 321, some of that\u2019s a market mix issue, but overall, it\u2019s done exceptionally well.\nPeter Ingram: And Mike, the one last thing I would add on this subject, as we look forward to the 787, which isn\u2019t going to be a huge contributor to our fleet over the next couple of years, but obviously will be going forward. The L.O.P.A. that we have designed for that aircraft actually has a larger premium mix. We dedicate a little bit more of the geography of the airplane to the premium cabin and the 787. So, it\u2019s going to be well suited to where the market has been evolving over the last couple of years.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thanks for the time everyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Hi. Thanks guys. Just following up on Mike\u2019s question, just given the movement in the dollar, I am just wondering if you can talk about how that\u2019s impacting foreign point-of-sale versus U.S. point-of-sale internationally to international destinations? And it sounds like things are pretty strong, and that\u2019s not really having an impact at this point. But maybe just clarifying, can you just remind us what percent of the bookings that represents the international inbound? And then just related to this, how that distribution strategy augments that foreign point-of-sale?\nPeter Ingram: So, it \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen a material shift in point-of-sale. Maybe we are up slightly in U.S. point-of-sale particularly to kind of Australia, New Zealand, but not a material shift there. I think in all of those markets, as they have opened up, we have seen a desire for guests in those countries to travel and have been willing to kind of offset a higher dollar-denominated trip for them. In terms of point-of-sale mix, it differs a fair amount from kind of, I will call it, Australia, New Zealand is a bit different than Japan and Korea. Australia, New Zealand were probably \u2013 we are generally about two-thirds point-of-sale, non-U.S. about a third U.S., and Japan, Korea are probably closer to 90% heavy \u2013 heavily weighted towards foreign point-of-sale.\nDan McKenzie: And how that distribution strategy is augmenting that foreign point-of-sale?\nPeter Ingram: Our distribution strategy internationally really hasn\u2019t changed at all. The recent changes we have made in terms of our distribution policies is with a domestic focus.\nDan McKenzie: Understood.\nBrent Overbeek: I think we have seen a little \u2013 throughout the pandemic, we have seen a little bit of behavioral shift from guests and more activity getting conducted online, both direct through our website and a little bit more through OTA. So, we are seeing a little bit of a shift away from some of the traditional agencies across geographies, and some of that is coming direct to us, where we can transact and offer more products and services, and really our distribution strategy is intended to continue that and offer that in more channels.\nDan McKenzie: Very good. Second question here, just looking out 1 year to 3 years, 3 years to 5 years, I am just wondering if you can help us reconcile the inflation pressures we are seeing today from where you sit? And just internally, if the plan calls for margins that can get back to pre-pandemic levels or should longer term investors anticipate potentially some \u2013 just some erosion here from the cost pressures?\nPeter Ingram: Well, Dan, it\u2019s hard to specifically forecast inflation going forward. I think obviously, in the near-term, we are in an inflation environment that many of us haven\u2019t seen in our professional careers. But I do think that this industry has proven resilient over time, particularly in the United States of being able to adjust and adapt, maybe not always as quickly as people would like quarter-to-quarter, but over a period of time, you see supply and demand fall into balance and strategies emerge to be able to develop different revenue sources and different cost savings opportunities. And I think that will play out again and we will be able to return to profitability levels that are comparable with what we have been able to produce historically.\nDan McKenzie: Terrific.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. I would add that in the medium-term, I think we have a lot of opportunity, especially on the cost side. But I think once we have more of our fleet plans firmed up, I think the commercial team can then do medium-term planning, and that will provide more opportunities for revenue increase. But looking at the cost side, I think we have a lot of opportunity for labor productivity from a variety of things. We \u2013 when we get new contracts with our labor groups, obviously, the rates go up day one. But a lot of times, we are able to get some work role benefits that take time to implement. And so I think you will see \u2013 we will see better productivity from those contracts over the next few years. I think some of the contracts also get productivity improvements with more flying. So, we will see better productivity from that. Also we are making a lot of investment in technology and facilities, and we should be able to get a lot of good cost savings from those in the next few years.\nDan McKenzie: Terrific. Thanks for the time.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks Dan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. Thank you. So Peter or Shannon, there is a lot going on here with the international regions with respect to FX, different reopening timetables. So, could you rank in terms of utilization, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, where you are today? And then how are you ranking these markets or weighting, excuse me, these markets into your planning for 2023? I realize some of this here that you can\u2019t control. But in your prepared remarks, there is just a lot of moving pieces here with respect to your flights into these markets. So, kind of want to better understand if you could, where you are in terms of utilization, but also going forward, how you are thinking about these individual markets and your planning for next year? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Let me start, and hopefully, I hit the mark correctly on where you are going with the question. I think in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, we are pretty much at a steady state level in terms of the amount of capacity that we would have in those markets and may vary by a frequency or two here or we may make some adjustments seasonally. But we are not dramatically below where we intend to be for the near-term on how we allocate aircraft to those regions. Japan, we are still pretty considerably below. During this period, we were just operating a single daily flight to Osaka, pre-pandemic that was a daily. We are less than daily on Narita, that was daily before. We had two flights in Haneda, daily flights before the pandemic. We were about to add a third, and we don\u2019t start flying to Haneda until August. And then there is Fukuoka and Sapporo. So Japan, we are still operating really a fraction. I don\u2019t have the precise number, but we can get that for you, but it\u2019s a fraction of what we were doing before. So, that\u2019s where \u2013 that\u2019s where the growth is coming on the international as we look forward to the end of this year, but even more importantly into 2023.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And my second question here. So, from your competitors\u2019 recovery and their core market shares moving forward. So, I was wondering if you could give some color here with respect to capacity off the U.S. mainland, how that\u2019s \u2013 what you are seeing? And also any color with respect to fares, and anything that you are able to speak to confidence with 30 days or 60 days out there? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I will start with that one and then maybe hand it over to Brent. On North America to Hawaii flying, capacity has come down a little bit from where it was in 2021, but it still remains above where it was in 2019 pre-pandemic. So, it\u2019s still been a net add over the course of the pandemic, although some of our competitors have made some adjustments over the last few months. So, that\u2019s probably the biggest one. International, we have seen more of the capacity come back, again, with the exception of Japan, where the competitive capacity is still substantially on the sidelines as we are.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. Relative to \u201821, clearly, we have peaked and are coming off of that, and we are still, from an industry capacity a bit above where we were at in 2019, albeit that\u2019s abating a little bit as well as we get into the fall. Obviously, that\u2019s a fair amount more than the capacity that remains for travel within the Lower 48, where industry capacity is down a fair amount. So, we are a little bit in terms of our geography, had a bit of a capacity disadvantage. There not to get into specifics on pricing, but I will say yields have held up throughout the summer. We had a really strong June that I referenced. The rest of the summer looks good. And even into the fall, we are continuing to see pricing improvements and average fare improvements versus 2019 at this point.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Didora: Hey. Good afternoon everyone. Brent or Peter, I mean you both mentioned the variable pricing initiative. Can you maybe provide a little bit more color around that when it was introduced in each of the regions? And I guess what kind of impact do you think it has had on pricing in these early days?\nPeter Ingram: Well, the early days, the impact is quite small. So, we implemented it fairly early in the quarter. And what we are doing is charging for some of our more desirable Main Cabin seats. We did not \u2013 all the guests who had pre-reserved seats in those seats, we let them remain in those seats. And so our ability to sell some of those in the second quarter was rather small, as we get into the third quarter, it gets greater, gets in the fourth quarter, obviously, even more. We have been really encouraged by the take rate. Again, we have got a little bit of a restricted supply as we are moving through the quarter. And our business case on this has it at kind of in the $10 million to $15 million on an annual basis. And I think at this point, we are \u2013 while our results are still early and we have got a long ways to go, I think we are pretty encouraged with the domestic results we have seen so far. We have not rolled it out in any of our international markets yet, and that\u2019s a process that we are working through. But our intention in there is that we will roll the products out in those geographies as well in the months ahead.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And then I guess just on the implied 4Q capacity here, I guess one, there is a pretty big disconnect versus your schedules. I think your schedules are up mid-single digits. I guess, where do you have to adjust the most? And I guess sequentially 3Q to 4Q, just curious on like what\u2019s the limiting factor here? Like why isn\u2019t there a bit more of a step-up in capacity, especially with international reopening?\nPeter Ingram: So, we have got \u2013 I think going back to one of the previous questions, for the most part, we are reopened internationally and everywhere about Japan. We have got a little bit of schedule cleanup that we need to do and particularly in the front part of the fourth quarter, and you will see that probably in the not-so-distant future. So, that I think is probably the majority of the disjoint that you are looking at.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back over to Peter Ingram for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nPeter Ingram: Thank you, operator. Mahalo again to all of you for joining us today and the strong demand improvement as we move through the first half of 2022 gives us confidence for the periods ahead. I am extremely proud of our team and their commitment to deliver an outstanding guest experience. And we appreciate your interest, and look forward to updating you on our progress in a few months.

Mahalo, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. We updated our first quarter outlook at the end of March, reflecting better than previously expected results due to strong demand throughout our network. With the effects of the pandemic, more muted now than at any point since the beginning of 2020, we are enjoying a period of strong demand for travel to, from and within Hawaii. COVID restrictions for travel to the State of Hawaii were lifted at the end of March and restrictions on travel in our key international geographies are appreciably reducing. Looking ahead, we expect record domestic revenue in the second quarter and a steady recovery of international demand as the year progresses. Let me briefly touch on a few of the following themes for 2022 that we\u2019ve discussed in our previous calls. Specifically, restoring international service and returning to operations at full scale, enhancing commercial flexibility and operational efficiency through foundational technology, succeeding in a disrupted competitive environment and preparing for the 787s. Internationally, we are underway with the long-awaited recovery in demand for travel to Hawaii as COVID travel restrictions eased in Australia and South Korea. New Zealand is implementing plans to ease restrictions, setting the table for us to restore service in July with flights three times weekly. In Japan, travel restrictions, incrementally eased with the removal of government mandated quarantine and an increase in visitor arrival allowances. But the current restrictions remain a significant barrier to travel, and we will need to see policies evolve further to realize the full demand potential in this geography. Based on what we\u2019ve seen in Australia and South Korea, we know that there is pent up demand for travel to Hawaii and our international geographies just as we have seen domestically. And we are preparing for our service to return to full scale. We continue to see strong demand for our domestic business. And our premium leisure model remains successful with strong, present outperformance relative to our U.S. mainland competitors, especially strong performance of our front cabin and extra comfort products shows the continued willingness of leisure travelers to pay a premium for superior products and service. And we can market and distribute these products more effectively than ever before because of our technology investments over the past few years. On the technology side, our new revenue management system launched successfully at the end of March. Work on the implementation of our PSS is underway and on track to launch in the spring of 2023. The revised delivery date of our first 787 has not yet been determined. The delay in 787 deliveries is affecting all of Boeing\u2019s customers and we are working closely with Boeing to bring more certainty to the timetable. There is so much to be encouraged about right now that it\u2019s almost difficult to remember that the first quarter began with the Omicron variant suppressing demand and affecting our staffing and operations. I\u2019m very encouraged by how we\u2019ve started an important year of continued recovery after a bumpy first couple of weeks. I could not be prouder of our wonderful team on the front lines and throughout the company, who are committed to connecting people with aloha. The progress we have made on our goals for 2022 sets us up well for the remainder of the year and for years beyond. As passenger volume returns, we are actively hiring and training throughout the business. Recently agreed labor contracts ensure our competitiveness as an employer. The ratification of our IAM contracts with our mechanics, airport operations and cargo employees was an important milestone. And our dispatchers represented by the TW just last week ratified a five-year contract. Combined with the agreement, we reached with our flight attendants union in 2020, these contracts demonstrate a commitment to look forward and do right by our employees. Our pilot agreement with ALPA becomes amendable on July 1. But for the moment, we are rather uniquely positioned in the industry with no amendable collective bargaining agreements. We\u2019re managing through the challenges of recruiting in a competitive labor market. The hiring challenges are most pronounced for our airports and maintenance teams. I know there is a lot of interest in pilot hiring and for this group, we continue to see good supply, but training is a constraining factor in getting the right pilots into the right classification to support our operations. Lastly, we will continue to make investments that strengthen our brand as a premium leisure airline. Yesterday, we announced that we will be providing our guests the best in-flight connectivity product in the world. After reaching an agreement with SpaceX to deploy their Starlink WiFi product on our long haul aircraft. The speeds will support fast web browsing and streaming that we\u2019ve gotten used to on our devices on the ground. Also importantly, we will be deploying it with a simple interface and free of charge to all our guests for however many devices they are accessing on board. We have deliberately trailed the industry in deploying in-flight connectivity because current and previous generations of products perform below our standards over the Pacific, where most of our time in-flight is spent. Until now there was no offering that provided a superior product to match the rest of our in-flight experience. Starlink changes this, and we think our guests will be delighted when they have the chance to experience it. We expect to begin aircraft deployment in 2023, and we\u2019ll provide an update later in the year with greater detail as we build out our timeline more discretely. Next month, we will reinforce our commitment to sustainability with the publication of our third annual Corporate Kuleana Report. As part of an island community, we have a profound responsibility to contribute to the environmental, economic and social wellbeing of this place. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the contributions our team has made through corporate action, employee volunteerism and charitable giving to support our community through these difficult times. We\u2019re actively engaged in dialogue around some of the most difficult challenges facing our community, including managing the impact of tourism and addressing issues of social justice and inequality. We\u2019re also looking inward to ensure our own very diverse workforce feels valued and heard, and that Hawaiian remains a great place to work and build a career. We have much to be encouraged about as we move towards the peak summer travel season. Our unparalleled brand is getting stronger every day. Our purpose and values serve as our compass and are imbued in everything we do. I get to come to work every day with the best team in the airline industry with external conditions in a better place than we have seen in the past two years, I am confident that we are poised for success ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our results and commercial outlook in more detail.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter. Aloha, everyone. Our first quarter revenue performance was better than expected throughout our network and in line with the updated guidance we provided at the end of March. Passenger revenue was down 33% from 2019 as we operated 118% of our domestic capacity and just 25% of our international. Our premium products are performing particularly well. We saw continued strength and demand for our front cabin with North America premium cabin PRASM up 8% for the quarter. Extra comfort revenue in North America also exceeded 2019 levels for this quarter. Other revenue continues to be a bright spot up 32% this quarter from 2019. Cargo recorded the highest quarter of revenue as we benefited from strong yields from Asia, and we generated the highest first quarter of revenue ever for our HawaiianMiles co-branded Mastercard on strength of card member acquisition and strong portfolio net retail sales. Looking ahead, we\u2019re encouraged by bookings and are expecting strong demand for travel to Hawaii. The Governor of the State of Hawaii announced the removal of all COVID-related travel restrictions and we saw robust sales in the days following the announcement in early March. Three days in early March were among our all time top 10 single days for direct sales. Our business is recovering. And for the second quarter, we anticipate that our revenue performance will accelerate with overall revenue down 8% to 12% from 2019. Let me take you through each segment of our business. In North America, we are seeing strong demand and anticipate our load factor to be near second quarter 2019 levels, which were close to 90%. While we are seeing more signs of industry capacity from the Mainland to Hawaii, continue to abate throughout the summer. Industry capacity remains historically high at roughly 117% of 2019 levels. The revenue environment is improving and we anticipate our second quarter RASM for North America to be above 2019 levels and a greater than 20 point sequential improvement from the first quarter. We expect to fly a similar schedule for the first quarter at about 115% of our 2019 schedule. We remain well positioned and based on the latest data from the DOT, we continue to materially outperform our competitors on PRASM in North America. This demonstrates the strength of our North America network focus on the Hawaii premium leisure traveler award-winning service and optimally configured aircraft. In the Neighbor Islands, we\u2019re encouraged as load factors are approaching 2019 levels as we expect to fly about 80% of our 2019 capacity in the second quarter. The pace of recovery has been tempered by the increase in direct flights to the Neighbor Islands, the lack of international connecting traffic and some sectors of the local market that have remained persistently down during the pandemic. However, we are seeing some recent improvement in these sectors, such as travel associated with in-person events, including sporting tournaments and annual festivals. We continue to refine our second quarter flight schedule based on some pilot training bottlenecks impacting our 717 fleet. Despite these challenges, we remain well positioned and continuing to earn a share of local traffic well in excess of our seat share, maintain a material load factor premium and continue to generate a sizable yield premium versus our competitor. Let me take some time to go through our international network and the various policy changes in that geography. Australia lifted its remaining travel restrictions for visitors in February, and we continue to see solid demand of that market. South Korea made it easier for travelers by eliminating quarantine with proof of vaccination beginning April 1. We have seen an increase in demand with load factors expected to increase from the mid-30% in April to mid-70% in June. In response to demand, we\u2019re adding additional frequency during the summer and we\u2019ll be flying five times weekly to Seoul. Moving to Japan, we\u2019ve seen incremental progress towards reopening with an increase in daily arrival caps and the removal of government quarantine requirements for vaccinated Japanese nationals. We remain uncertain on when Japan will fully reopen. But no, there is substantial pent-up demand for travel to Hawaii. We are now expecting to fly about 30% of our 2019 international schedule in the second quarter. We remain well positioned with our brand and quality of experience to capitalize in demand for Hawaii vacation, when it materializes in each international market. Rolling all that up, we anticipate our overall system capacity for the second quarter to be down 11.5% to 14.5% from 2019 levels. Turning to an update on our 2022 commercial initiatives. We implemented our new PROS revenue management system this month and are encouraged with the early results that we\u2019re seeing. The team is developing an experience with the system and things are going great so far. It\u2019ll take some time for us to reach a level of expertise with the system and fully utilize all its capabilities, but we have confidence at this one lock incremental revenue, as it continues to ramp up to steady state. On ancillary seats product sales, we are seeing steady growth from our extra comfort seat product due to strong demand for this premium product along with seating price changes we implemented at the end of 2021. These resulted in higher first quarter revenue than in 2019 for North America. And looking ahead, we expect continued improvement in our second quarter North America extra comfort revenues per seat to exceed 2019 by about 15%. Lastly, in January, we launched our new NDC supported technology platform to a positive response. And we are in the process of signing agreements and onboarding major travel agency partners. In addition, this change in distribution strategy will help us provide better information about our product offerings to our guests, which will enhance our revenue generation while at the same time controlling our distribution costs over the long-term. We expect these commercial initiatives to drive incremental benefits of approximately $10 million this year, as they ramp up to steady state. We are well along on the road to recovery. Domestically, we anticipate strong demand with load factors close to 2019 levels. Premium cabin PRASM improvements to continue to accelerate to historical highs and extra comfort record revenue to record levels. Internationally, travel restrictions are easing and we are seeing robust demand for Hawaii vacation. We have the right products for our markets, strong brand, an exceptional team and a winning formula for success. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Let me start with an update on the balance sheet. We closed the quarter with $1.9 billion in total liquidity, inclusive of cash, short-term investments, and our undrawn revolver of $235 million. Adjusted net debt was $931 million, which is near our 2019 levels. Our scheduled debt and lease principal payments for this year totaled $122 million, $67 million of which was paid in the first quarter. Our balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity and we continue to look for ways to fortify our financial position. We\u2019re comfortable holding a higher liquidity position as we continue to recover and move to profitability and consistent generation of positive cash flow. Turning to the P&L. We finished the quarter with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $106 million, while reflecting the impact of the Omicron variant and pandemic related restrictions in much of our international network, these results were better than we originally expected given the strong domestic revenue results that Brent discussed. On the cost side, our first quarter non-fuel costs and non-recurring items totaled $472 million with the unit costs up 12.2% compared to 2019. These results are at the higher end of our expectations. As the higher wages resulting from the ratification of our IAM contracts in mid-February were not included in our original guidance. As a reminder, our IAM contracts primarily cover our mechanics, airport operations personnel, and cargo employees as well as certain administrative positions. Upon ratification, we paid a signing bonus totaling $2 million that was adjusted as a one-time expense and we also recorded a one-time increase to our vacation liability for higher pay rates. As Peter mentioned, coming to negotiated agreements with our unions is critical to our success and we are well placed in the industry in this respect. Fuel costs rose in the first quarter to $2.83 per gallon, up approximately 12% from our original outlook in mid-January. Our consumption was outside of our range with higher than expected fuel burn as we flew our A330 is a little harder and heavier, about 55% of our fuel was purchased based on Singapore Jet Fuel prices, 35% on U.S. West Coast Jet Fuel prices, and 10% on other jet fuel prices. We have limited exposure to New York Harbor crack spreads that exploded in recent weeks. Our leadership team continues to focus on initiatives that keep our costs competitive and offset inflationary and other pressures Specifically for 2022 tailwinds include productivity benefits from recent technology investments and amended labor contracts. Lower aircraft rent \u2013 lower aircraft rent expenses through the renegotiation of several of our A330 leases, as well as lower depreciation and amortization expenses. Significant headwinds pressuring our unit costs include airport related costs as airports return to charging airlines for both operational and capital expenses and increasing labor rates from recently amended contracts with our flight attendants, grounds crew, mechanics and dispatchers. Lastly, we are incurring costs, adequately train and position our crew as we grow back our network. For the second and quarter, we expect our unit costs excluding fuel and special items to be up 16.5% to 19.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019 on a capacity decrease of 11.5% to 14.5%. Sequentially our unit costs are expected to be consistent with the first quarter on a capacity increase of about 5.5%. In addition to higher selling and other variable costs associated with the expected increase in revenue and continuing ramp up of our network, cost increases from the first to second quarter include a full quarter of new IAM wages versus half a quarter in Q1, other contractual wage rate increases and one-time maintenance costs. We are suspending our full-year guidance for capacity and CASM ex-fuel as the uncertain timing of Japan\u2019s reopening impacts our ability to predict ASMs and therefore unit costs. Although we don\u2019t know the exact timing, people leave the impact of steady state flying in Japan will reduce CASM ex by a double-digit percentage. We expect our fuel consumption for the second quarter to be down 14.5% to 17.5% as compared to 2009. And we\u2019re forecasting our fuel price per gallon for the second quarter to be $3.59 based on the forward curve as of April 21. It is worth noting that the forward curve includes a substantial increase in the refined margin and a widening differential between the geographic indices. Our capital expenditure forecast for 2022 is $105 million to $125 million with about two-thirds for aircraft, and the remaining third for non-aircraft spend. The non-aircraft expenditures reflect investments and technology and in our facilities. Despite the increase in fuel costs, our adjusted EBITDA is expected to improve in the second quarter to a range of negative $50 million to positive $10 million. We are encouraged that we have line of sight to positive EBITDA and we\u2019re focused on profitability as our full network recovers. We\u2019re confident that we are on the road to recovery and our focus is on the long-term success of our business. Our priorities are our investments and technology to unlock new sources of revenue and enhance cost competitiveness. Our commitment to strengthening our brand and award-winning hospitality and service to differentiate us from the competition, and hiring and training our people as we plan and prepare for our future. We believe that these priorities are the winning formula to growing value for our shareholders. And with that we can open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners. Please proceed.\nConor Cunningham: Hey everyone. Thank you for the time. Just in terms of, I mean, I know you\u2019re in the early stages of your international recovery and I get that. You don\u2019t have a ton of data, but I was just curious if you could provide any context around how bookings look like maybe the day that restrictions are \u2013 are eased and just how that \u2013 how that flushes out over the next couple of weeks until you actually get the flying again? And then I\u2019m trying to figure out like the Neighbor Island flying, it seems correlated with the international coverage. So I\u2019m just curious on when you talked about how you\u2019re doing a lot better than your competitor there, but is there a maximum that you\u2019ll be flying in terms of Neighbor Island flying until you have a full recovery on International side? No there\u2019s a lot there, so I\u2019m sorry about that.\nPeter Ingram: All right. On the International side, Conor, thanks for the question. We have seen particularly in South Pacific, in Australia, New Zealand when announcement and in Korea as well, when announcements have been made and changes in policy, we\u2019ve seen a pretty quick and pretty dramatic move towards bookings. And I think what we\u2019ve seen, I would say is more direct bookings, shorter booking curve, folks keen to travel as those policies have changed and so we\u2019ve had a really good experience there and we\u2019re certainly encouraged what we\u2019ve seen there. As it relates and we fully anticipate we\u2019ll see similar behavior out of Japan. We know that there\u2019s a keen interest in getting to Hawaii, the safety that we have in terms and comfort \u2013 the level of comfort around us as a destination. We know we\u2019re going to be really appealing to Japan as it opens up. And so we\u2019re very much looking forward to that. In terms of Neighbor Island, I think we\u2019ve said before we anticipate coming back a bit smaller post-pandemic than we did going in. Some of that really is just a function of how we\u2019re scheduling the network. And so before we had some capacity at the beginning of the day out of Honolulu and returning later in the day that was really about positioning aircraft and we switched our scheduling paradigm to now overnight aircraft in the Neighbor Islands. And so we\u2019ve eliminated some of that flying, which was frankly, was not that productive from a revenue perspective. So we anticipate that we\u2019ll likely end up in the mid-to-high-80s probably over time will be the window that we end up in there. As you mentioned we are missing kind of the International connecting and stop-over-traffic there. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, we have particularly with some of the governor\u2019s announcements and changes in policy here in Hawaii. We have seen certain segments of the market start to come back and I\u2019ll call it late March and April. We still have ways to go admittedly in some of those, but we\u2019ve seen some, some encouraging initial signs of that.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, great. And then as a follow-up just on Japan, just to talk a little bit more about that, that the Japanese yen has obviously come under a lot of pressure, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s changed your expectation for the recovery ramp over when it does reopen. I know there\u2019s a lot of unknowns, but it has that \u2013 has that move in the currency, made you contemplate the, a rebound there a little bit \u2013 a little differently, and I appreciate the time? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I think we have seen a material move in the yen over the last I\u2019ll call it the last month really or last 45 days. I think it\u2019ll have a bit of an impact that being said, we\u2019ve seen the desire to travel and people\u2019s willingness to pay out of International markets be quite strong. And so on the margin obviously the cost of a Hawaii vacation for Japanese resident will have gone up with the appreciation of the yen or with the appreciation of the dollar versus the yen. So I think it has a, maybe a minor impact but overall I think we\u2019re still pretty bullish on how folks are going to come back and their desire to travel here and spend.\nConor Cunningham: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. Hey Brent. Yes, this is another sort of multi-question here. I\u2019m curious if you sort of index the price of a sort of typical Hawaiian vacation, and I\u2019m just in the context of the inflationary pressures that we\u2019re seeing everywhere. I think the Hawaiian vacation was always somewhat aspirational and I suspect that it\u2019s probably a bit higher and again not from a yen perspective, just from a U.S. dollar perspective. So coming from the other way, and the reason I ask is, there has been a sizable amount of competitor capacity withdraws. Whether it\u2019s West Coast to Neighbor Island or even to Honolulu, and I don\u2019t know if it was just that so many carriers had loaded up so much. And now that the rest of the world is opening up we\u2019re just seeing a recalibration or maybe its higher fuel prices. So I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a demand element there, it\u2019s obviously to your benefit for your competitors to scale back. But I was somewhat concerned that there may be some impact on the demand side and/or it\u2019s just very expensive to fly some of these long-haul flights given where fuel prices are. So I know that\u2019s kind of a multipronged question sort of following up on Conor, but however best you can answer it. Thank you.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I think I will say certainly over the last \u2013 over the last 15 months, we\u2019ve seen a lot of capacity go directly off the West Coast in the Neighbor Islands. And so really Maui, Kona, and Lehua have all seen a material increase in industry capacity, kind of well in excess of what, what previous levels were. I think what we\u2019ve collectively seen from an industry perspective is that some carriers were suffering from a load factor perspective. And if you look at some of the competitive data there, people were struggling to fill some of that capacity so combined with higher fuel; it only is a bit rational that some of that is probably finding its way out of the market. In terms of kind of cost index, it has been, certainly we\u2019ve seen lodging prices that have been quite high more so in the Neighbor Islands than in Oahu, and that could be a contributing factor. Now all that being said most of our capacity is in Honolulu and Maui. We do have a bit of direct service into Kona and Lehua. Forward looking demand looks strong and we\u2019re really encouraged with how kind of bookings look for us and so while some of that capacity has come out, we still see a pretty strong demand environment really across \u2013 across all of our markets into Hawaii from North America.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just another question to you on the Japanese market. You said earlier that presumably as Japan starts to relax some of these COVID restrictions, and I know they\u2019ve been already starting to relax. That you expect to maybe see a similar response as what you\u2019ve seen with Australia, New Zealand and Korea. Historically though, I always thought, and I know this is past and things probably have evolved, but that a large portion of Japanese trips to Hawaii, the consumer discretionary element was, a large portion of it was done through the travel agencies and the Japanese being planners would book those six to nine months out in advance. And so with summer upon us, assume say the rules are relaxed in the next month or two. Do we get that type of snap back or has that Japanese consumer already booked for his or her family a trip to, I don\u2019t know, Okinawa or somewhere else in Asia-Pacific? I\u2019m curious about how that has evolved and whether or not it will snap back as quickly given that historical trend.\nBrent Overbeek: So, I would say historically we did have more Japanese point of origin traffic that would work through a travel agency partner in plan and advance maybe not quite as much as you had indicated in your comments. But we had seen over time that continue to kind of narrow in terms of planning time relative to departure. I think what we\u2019ve seen broadly across the pandemic is people are more interested. And I think this will apply in Japan as well. People are more interested in planning on their own and getting things done. So, they\u2019ll continue to work with our key agency partners, but I do think we will see more direct sales, more OTA sales and people planning and shortening their planning horizon. So, is it perfectly analogous to what we saw in Australia? Maybe not one for one, but I do think a lot of those same characteristics will continue to change as Japan comes online.\nPeter Ingram: And Mike, this is Peter. I would just underscore the point that over time the distribution, the third-party distribution paradigm internationally is evolving. We are seeing more direct sales. We have over the course of the pandemic when sales were limited, the direct channel held up much better than third party channels. And in fact, the pandemic itself has likely, has caused in some of these international markets where third-party is important a retrenchment in those businesses that are focused on that, a closing of some of their retail outlets. So, we expect that that evolution to continue, but we also expect they\u2019re going to remain important partners in those geographies in the coming years.\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. And actually, one important thing that\u2019s happened over the last little while in terms of more symbolic right now than generating bookings, but during the pandemic, actually a lot of the wholesalers couldn\u2019t actually promote packages to Hawaii. And that has changed recently now with some of the governmental policy changes to where they can get to the point where they can actually start to market packages to Hawaii. And so that at least will be in place and will be ready for as additional restrictions come off, particularly the arrival cap as Peter alluded to is kind of probably the most important one for us to move forward.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, good to know. Yes, thanks gentlemen. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.\nHelane Becker: Hi everybody. Thanks for the time. So, two questions here. As you think, maybe for Shannon, as you think about going forward, where do you think your liquidity or your cash balances need to be for you to feel comfortable?\nShannon Okinaka: Hi, thanks, Helane. We\u2019re still looking at it. We\u2019re not really in a rush to do a big balance sheet analysis and figure out our target. I think we\u2019re really comfortable right now with our cash balance. Obviously, it\u2019s higher than where it probably needs to be. But I think for now, it\u2019s okay. As we still don\u2019t know exactly when Japan comes back and what that rebound looks like from Japan. We\u2019re also working out still trying to determine the delivery schedule for our 787s. And with that, then we\u2019ll look at the financing, how we choose to finance them as well as just a quite a large debt maturity wall in 2026. So, we\u2019re just \u2013 I think until some of those things become a little bit more certain we\u2019re not going to establish a cash target or liquidity target, but we\u2019re just really comfortable with our position for now.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s hugely helpful. And then on the 717s, I guess, I have been reading and you guys just talked about the training issues that you have. Does it just make sense to take a look at that aircraft type and think about \u2013 and I think it was mentioned that you are basing aircraft in Neighbor Island overnight, which you\u2019ve never done before. Does it make sense to maybe think about replacing those with larger aircraft that might be more fuel efficient and enable you to still do achieve the goals of being an important part of Neighbor Island travel?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. So, look, the 717 is a terrific aircraft for what we do as we\u2019ve said for really, as long as I\u2019ve been with Hawaiian. It\u2019s a pretty good size for the demand levels in the market. It is a low operating cost airplane from a cycle perspective which in many cases the cycle impacts on maintenance costs, is a bigger driver on very short haul flying than fuel cost is. We\u2019re able to keep that airplane flying well through the middle of this decade. We\u2019ve got a majority of our fleet that is owned with no outstanding debt on it. And so that makes it an extremely low ownership cost fleet for us. Eventually we will be looking at replacements. I think a couple of things that we consider is whether an airplane slightly larger would be better. I don\u2019t think it would be dramatically larger because at the fringes of the day that would give us an airplane that was putting more seats in the market than we needed. We\u2019re going to continue to evaluate that over time, maybe a little bit bigger than what we have now would be better. But I don\u2019t think it would be dramatically bigger. It wouldn\u2019t be the size of our 321s with 189 seats. That\u2019s just more than you need a lot of times of the day in the Neighbor Island routes, right?\nHelane Becker: Yes, got you. That makes a lot of sense. Okay. All right. Well, thanks very much for your time and help.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nAndrew Didora: Hey everyone, thanks for the questions. Brent, I know obviously a ton of moving parts here in terms of the recovery \u2013 the international recovery. Since we don\u2019t break out the unit revenues by entity, can you just give us a sense of sort of the RASM differential between the Mainland and Dryland and international? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how RASM will trend based on mix as your international network comes back.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I mean, I get \u2013 either at this point, it\u2019d be kind of hard to think about kind of guiding for third quarter for the reasons you mentioned. A lot of that really depends on the pace that Japan comes back both the amount of resources that we\u2019ve got to it beyond what we\u2019ve got in kind of our 2Q guidance. And the pace of demand in terms of booking curve. But again, I think we feel pretty confident about those. I would say Japan is somewhat is fairly close to West Coast from a PRASM perspective higher than \u2013 typically higher than the rest of our international network. So probably in line I think with long haul. And so that will be consistent. As we think about things going forward, I \u2013 we\u2019re encouraged with the progress we\u2019ve seen in North America. But I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re kind of at the high point of where we can get North America. So I\u2019m optimistic that there\u2019s more runway in third quarter that we can continue to perform it and grow some unit revenue there as well.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. That gives me a general sense on the international RASM. And then I guess, Shannon, this pre-pandemic, you did hedge fuel, you had some nice hedge gains back in 2018 if I remember correctly. I guess any plan to go back to a more meaningful hedge policies out of what needs to change for you to reconsider that. Thanks.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. So although, it doesn\u2019t show up in our results, we actually still have a hedge \u2013 hedging program in place. We did some analysis through the through the pandemic when we were determining whether to \u2013 whether or not to start hedging again as the domestic business came back. And that analysis showed that, that over time, we weren\u2019t truly we didn\u2019t have really big gains or losses over a longer period of time. So we moved the program to be a little bit more opportunistic where we\u2019d buy more at lower prices and less. And at this point right now, it\u2019s at zero at higher prices. And we really look at it to as like an insurance program. So if you think of it like insurance right now the premium is really high and you\u2019re getting a lot less coverage. We tend to buy out of the money options. And so if you\u2019re getting 10%, 15% out of the money right now, you\u2019re looking at really high prices. So what it would take to get us to buy some hedges is for some of that pricing to come down to make it a more reasonably priced insurance program for us.\nAndrew Didora: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Please proceed.\nDan McKenzie: Hi, thanks guys. Continuing on the international theme and you leave it to me to kick a dead horse here. I believe international revenue in 2019 was just over $700 million and I\u2019m just sort of extracting that from the 10-K so please correct me on that. But what percent recovered were you in the first quarter and where \u2013 what recovery are you expecting in the second quarter in the guide here? So I guess I\u2019m just trying to get a more precise idea of what\u2019s missing exactly. And then just related to that is the expectation that just given pent up demand and I know you\u2019ve talked about this in prior questions but is the expectation that the international side of the business could ultimately be better than 2019 once things open up here?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. So Dan, on the international, I think you\u2019re in the ballpark with the $700 million, I think of about it \u2013 as about 25% of our revenue pre-pandemic. The \u2013 in terms of the recovery, I don\u2019t have that my fingertips what percent we were recovered in the first quarter, but it was still pretty dramatically off through most of the last several quarters up till this one, we were probably between 90% and 95% still missing from the market. We did start to see the ramp up in the first quarter from Australia, but even that was held back a little bit and probably of the 25% of our revenue pre-pandemic that was international about 70% of that was Japan, maybe even a little more than 70% Japan. So the biggest by far of the international markets is still sort of trying to grind out of the starting gates for us. So we\u2019ve still got a lot of runway left in terms of getting international back, but it is encouraging to see Australia up and running and gaining some momentum, South Korea gaining momentum, New Zealand getting ready to go. And we just \u2013 we\u2019re looking forward to having Japan join the party in a meaningful way.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. And then I guess is the expectation that given pent-up demand, you can business, ultimately that\u2019s going to be higher than 2019.\nPeter Ingram: Look at \u2013 I think there\u2019s some opportunities there. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll snap there right away, but if you look at how when cases are down in Japan, the demand for domestic travel appears very strong. I think there\u2019s a real willingness to travel as we\u2019ve seen domestically as the carriers flying between Europe and the U.S. Mainland have experienced. And I think we\u2019re going to see a really robust recovery as people have the ability to get out and stretch their legs and travel and do the things they\u2019ve been missing for a while.\nDan McKenzie: Understood. Second question here, the 8.5 points of incremental CASM-ex pressure in the March pressure pardon me in that per the March update? I know you guys aren\u2019t guiding to full year CASM-ex at this point, but how much of that 8.5 points is in the second quarter and the third quarter? And what I\u2019m really after is just what the CASM-ex drop could look like once international is ultimately restored here?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks, Dan. I don\u2019t have those numbers broken out by quarter in front of me. So I can\u2019t answer that piece, but the adding that to Japan will have a large impact on our CASM. I think as I spoken the prepared remarks, we\u2019re looking at expecting double-digit decreases in CASM-ex once Japan is in a steady state. So I think you should expect CASM-ex to have good improvements once the capacity comes back.\nDan McKenzie: Very good. Thanks for the time you guys.\nOperator: And our final question is from Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey everyone, thanks for the time and apologies in advance, one more Japan one. But I just want to make sure I\u2019ve got this right. I just want to confirm there\u2019s currently no quarantine required for Japanese citizens returning to Japan from vacation Hawaii as April 10. I guess, is that right? And if so, what are the remaining government restrictions that are behind your decision to suspend for your guidance due to uncertainty around that full international relaunch. Or is it just that even with the quarantine drop, there\u2019s still some hesitancy to travel or is it the U.S. entry requirements? I know that\u2019s kind of a bundled question there, but I\u2019m just trying to get a sense. Yes, thanks.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Let me try to explain what the most significant restriction is, and I\u2019ll let Brent or others chime in if they have more. So the removal of the quarantine is very helpful. What is most constraining for us right now is over the past couple of years, the Japanese government has had a policy of doing post arrival testing for people coming back from international trips. And there have been limits at various point in time that are placed on the carriers in terms of the amount of traffic they can carry on their airplanes, basically, because of the constraints in doing those arrival testing. So the ability to do that testing at scale is limited. And so what they have done is imposed either weekly or per flight caps on the number of people that each carrier can bring into the country. Currently, those caps are at about 10,000 arrivals per day, that are allocated across all of the carriers operating in the market. If you look back pre-pandemic, typical demand would be more like 140,000 or 150,000 passengers a day. So there is this artificial hard constraint on the number of people that can come into Japan, even if there is sufficient demand to fill an awful lot more seats.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I think as Peter mentioned, until we\u2019ve seen some sequential progress in that cap coming up, but it\u2019s still \u2013 our allocation is still quite small. And so that\u2019s going to need to grow material or get removed to get things kind of back at scale, I think is the critical impediment at this point.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Got it. And I guess, from your government just quick follow-up on that one before my second one. From your government affairs folks, is there any read through on that\u2019s a pretty, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s what like 7% of 2019 demand is allow right now. Any timeline on when that gets raised or just really kind of depend day to day here?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. We\u2019ve been hesitant to try and speculate on that, because every time we\u2019ve done that up till now we\u2019ve been wrong. And I feel confident that it will come back. We\u2019re seeing most of the world, even in some of the places that had the biggest restriction, not just in our network with place like New Zealand, but if you look at Singapore and some other places in Southeast Asia, these restrictions are being removed. Last year, there was a lot of speculation that after the Olympics, there would be a loosening of restrictions in Japan. Then there was a question of, well, maybe it\u2019ll be after the elections that were last fall. I think the hope of those being the catalyst for removal of restrictions was dashed a little bit by the first the Delta wave and then the Omicron wave of cases at the end of the year. It\u2019s our understanding that, problematically for us, some of these restrictions remain politically popular in Japan, which is in contrast to the attitude we see in this country around restrictions associated with COVID at this point. And there are some elections that are coming up, I believe it\u2019s in July of this year. So we don\u2019t expect a material move in policy before July, we may see some more of these increments where the cap went from 5,000 to 7,000 to 10,000, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll see a full liberalization before those elections in July. But I don\u2019t want to speculate, because I don\u2019t have enough insight into what the catalyst is going to be that that really opens it up more comprehensively.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Totally understand a complex issue. And then maybe just \u2013 I realize it\u2019s hard to compare across the airline, just given the varying states of network recovery. But at the midpoint of your guidance, I\u2019m getting a RASM, that\u2019s going to be up like 3% to 4%, which is a bit lower than some of your peers. I would think having your historically significant exposure long haul flying in your international network currently be smaller than normal. I would think that\u2019d just be a RASM boost mathematically. But maybe there\u2019s something else you want to highlight as an offsetting drag. Like, maybe they\u2019re just the less inter island or higher percentage of capacity in new markets or maybe I\u2019m just wrong in that international impact, which is so many colors. Thank you so much for the time.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I think Catie probably the biggest impact is that we talked about in our prepared remarks is really the amount of capacity that\u2019s in the market right now. And while that continues to abate, if you look at our market, we\u2019ve got 117% of North America capacity compared to 2019 in the second quarter. And I think if you took that for a big portion of some other folks, and I think that\u2019s going to look a little bit worse than what it exists largely in the mainland. And it\u2019s headed in the right direction in the short-term. I think we\u2019re doing all the right things and performing really well in a difficult competitive environment. But I think we still are at a unique position in terms of our domestic business, in terms of the amount of competitive capacity relative to the comp period people are looking at.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Totally fair. Thank you so much for that.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo, again, for joining us today. The strong demand improvement as we move through the first quarter gives us confidence in the periods ahead.

Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Since we last spoke in December, we ended the quarter largely as expected with strong demand and positive signs of recovery, particularly on the domestic side of our business. We, like other businesses, faced operational disruption related to the rapid spread of Omicron at the tail end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. The outstanding efforts of our team mitigated the worst impact of these challenges, but not without some level of disruption to our guests. We\u2019ve made some modest near-term adjustments to restore operational integrity and I believe we are now on better footing for the months ahead. Despite solid results from our domestic business in the second half of the year, the recovery of our international business continues to lag. We remain confident that we\u2019ll see a substantial recovery in international demand as we pass this latest wave of COVID cases. As we\u2019ve said before, conditions are aligning to enable a full restoration of our business at scale supported by the availability of vaccinations and therapeutics that were not part of the toolbox early in the pandemic. For international, what continues to limit us are governmental policies regarding travel across borders. The response to the rapidly transmissible Omicron variant has likely delayed relief in this regard by a couple of months. We aren\u2019t in control of that, but what we can control is our preparation and readiness. We are preparing for an increase in international during the second quarter of the year and a more comprehensive operation in the summer and beyond. As conditions allow us to realize the underlying demand, we know that our exceptional service, solid operational performance, unique brand, and a focus on leisure travel, positions us extremely well for sustained success. Excuse me. Our team continues to work relentlessly to help our business recover in an ever-changing environment and to help strengthen our company for the long-term. The outstanding contributions of our employees have remained the one constant throughout the pandemic. Mahalo to each of my teammates for their tremendous efforts in 2021 as we made substantial strides towards recovery. Before I talk more about 2022, I\u2019d like to talk a bit more about the disruptions in our operations over the past month and what we have done to address them. Like other airlines we experienced scheduled disruptions beginning in the waning days of 2021 as the spread of Omicron led to increased absences. Also, unique to us these absences were compounded by some unscheduled downtime with our training equipment, which affected the availability of crew members for our 717 fleet at the end of last year and the begin beginning of this one. These factors led to the cancellation of several neighbor island flights and a handful of North America flights in the last several days of 2021 and the early part of January, 2022. To provide more flexibility to our operating teams we have subsequently made some short-term adjustments to our schedule to manage through this period and help us restore operational performance to the levels our guests are accustomed to. Since these changes have been in place, we have seen the operations stabilize. I feel confident that we put the worst of this disruption behind us. Our sick calls are declining and our training equipment is back online. Since we last spoke in December, our initiatives for 2022 have not changed, and I\u2019d like to provide you with some updates. Back in December, we didn\u2019t have a clear line of sight into the impact of Omicron would have and how governmental policies would react. In line with much of the country, Hawaii saw record high COVID case counts in January from the highly contagious variant. Despite the increases in new cases, hospitalization rates have been manageable. Aided by our state\u2019s high vaccination rate, Hawaii remained and continues to remain open for tourism with limited changes in the state safety protocols. This contrasts with our experience with the Delta variant, when hospitalization spiked and the policy response was more restrictive. Consistent with our expectation that cross-border travel liberalization will be delayed a couple of months because of Omicron, we have pushed the ramp up of our Japan operations from the end of March to the second quarter. The international travel policy changes we have seen since the identification of the Omicron variant continue to remind us that the road ahead may not be smooth. But the underlying desire for travel for leisure remains profound, and we will be ready to take advantage of pent-up demand as it materializes. I\u2019m pleased that we have reached tentative agreements with the IAM, which represents our airport, cargo and maintenance employees. These agreements, which are subject to ratification in mid-February, provide us with pay rate \u2013 provide for pay rate increases and enhance benefits. Our employees deserve to be rewarded competitively. And I\u2019m proud that this contract, when ratified, will provide that. I\u2019m also pleased that in an increasingly competitive labor market, the updated pay rates will help us to compete for new hires and to retain our existing employees. The provisions in these agreements, coupled with our commitment to continue investing in technology and process enhancements, will yield long-term benefits in terms of higher productivity and shared benefit costs beyond 2022. Along with the agreement we reached in 2020 with the AFA, representing our flight attendants, we will soon have completed labor contracts representing 70% of our workforce since the beginning of the pandemic. This is unique in our industry and reflects our commitment to manage the business for the long-term, and to collaborate with the unions representing our employees. We\u2019re also advancing our commitment to invest in technology to meet our productivity goals and deliver the best experience for our guests. We remain on track for the cost and revenue benefits expected in 2022, as the use of these technology tools continues to mature. Our new passenger service system is expected to launch in the spring of 2023, which will be a catalyst for the simplification and streamlining of our commercial and guest service processes. These investments will enable a stream of benefits that will continue to develop over the coming years. With Omicron shifting the outlook for other travel markets, we have not seen a significant change in the competitive capacity environment since we last spoke in December. Much of the domestic capacity that shifted to Hawaii remains, as the recovery of business and international travel remains slow. As recovery continues, we expect that the competitive environment will evolve, and marginal capacity added domestically will be reevaluated. Internationally, some of the capacity that was marginal pre-pandemic may not return. We are committed to ensuring that we are positioned to capitalize on opportunities as the competitive environment involves. As we mentioned back in December, our two 787s that were scheduled to be delivered in 2022 are delayed, and we now expect to receive them no earlier than the first half of 2023. The capacity from these aircraft has been removed from our full year capacity expectation and some of the expected costs related to readiness activities have now shifted into 2023 with the delay. I remain optimistic about the trajectory of our recovery despite the uncertainty that continues to surround our industry. Yes, the path isn\u2019t linear and some of the progress on the international side is a little bit to the right, but we continue to make progress on our plan for 2022. The trajectory of leisure travel has been interrupted by the pandemic, but the underlying desire for it has not. Domestically, Omicron has had less of an impact on our business than previous COVID waves and the signs of recovery are already evident. International travel will recover with policy changes even if we cannot precisely forecast the timing and pace. We will be ready to take advantage of the continuing recovery and are well positioned for success. With that, let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our 2021 results and the commercial outlook in more detail.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter, and aloha, everyone. I\u2019d like to take a brief moment to thank all of our teammates for their efforts and dedication and taking care of each other, and our guests as we closed out 2021. Our fourth quarter revenue performance was in line with what we expected in December when we reguided the stronger demand throughout our network, with total revenue down 30.1% from 2019, as we operated 81% of our capacity compared to the same period. Passenger revenue was down 34.8% from 2019, as we operated 109% of our domestic capacity and just 17% of our international capacity compared to 2019. We had a busy holiday period and didn\u2019t see much of an impact from closing cancellations related to Omicron, but as expected, our yields were lower from elevated competitive capacity in our North American markets. Nonpassenger revenue continues to be a bright spot, up 20.7% this quarter from 2019, driven by strong performance in cargo and revenue from our Hawaiian Miles co-branded Mastercard, with a record quarter of retail sales and strong new account acquisitions. Despite a challenging operating environment in 2021, leisure travel to Hawaii was resilient as evidenced by strong domestic travel volumes to Hawaii. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we continue to recover our business, and we anticipate that our overall revenue will be down 31% to 35% from 2019, a slight deceleration from our results in the fourth quarter, with the Omicron variant headwind impacting our traffic and schedule. We anticipate this headwind will be short term, as we are starting to see our bookings and cancellations stabilize. Our international network continues to lag domestic as governmental policies continue to limit us, and most of our network here remains suspended. Let me take you through each segment of our business. In North America, we\u2019re seeing the impact of Omicron variant with lower net bookings for the first quarter. We continue to closely monitor bookings. And from what we see today, the worst of the impact will be in the first quarter, as we are seeing upward momentum for bookings in the months ahead. We expect to fly about 120% of our 2019 schedule this quarter, which is higher than we anticipate for the rest of the year, due to how the network developed in 2019. We remain very well positioned and based on the latest data from the DOT, we have further expanded our revenue premium since we last spoke in December, and they\u2019re materially outperforming in our North American markets. This demonstrates the strength of our North America network, our focus on the Hawaii leisure traveler and our optimally configured aircraft. In the Neighbor Islands, we were planning to operate 80% to 85% of our 2019 Neighbor Islands capacity. As we work through the temporary schedule changes that Peter mentioned, we\u2019re now expecting to fly about 75% of our 2019 schedule in the first quarter. The booking curve for the Neighbor Islands is close in. And with Omicron surge, we\u2019re seeing some customers choose to stay at home, resulting in lower bookings. But we are starting to see signs of improvement and remain well positioned and continue to maintain the share of local traffic well in excess of our seat share and a significant load factor premium versus our competitors. With the evolving news of Omicron, we can\u2019t speak with certainty on the pace of recovery in key international markets, particularly Japan. Let me spend a few moments discussing the published schedules versus our expectations for the planned resumption of service to Japan. Based on what we know today, we expect to ramp up our service to Japan in the second quarter, a bit later than we had originally planned, but that\u2019s not yet reflected in our currently published schedule. We are working through respective governmental processes for the upcoming summer season around slots and route authorities. And we\u2019ll update our published schedules accordingly as that gets resolved. There could be a further delay to our restoration of our international network as we remain uncertain about when Japan will fully reopen. While we can\u2019t control the precise date when Japan will fully open; however, we will be ready to relaunch our international network as soon as policy conditions allow. We are now expecting to fly about 25% of our 2019 international schedule in the first quarter, which is slightly higher than the fourth quarter, reflecting a full quarter of flights to Sydney that resumed in mid-December. We remain well positioned with the brand and quality of guest experience to capitalize on demand for a Hawaii vacation when it materializes. Moving to our capacity outlook. With Omicron shifting our recovery back a bit, we anticipate that our overall capacity for the first quarter will be down 10% to 13% from 2019. On a sequential basis, capacity from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022 is essentially flat. For the full year, we now expect capacity to be down 3% to up 1% from 2019, driven primarily by the pushback of the resumption of service to Japan in the second quarter, the schedule changes in the first quarter, and the delay of the 787s to 2023. For 2022, we remain on track to launch a new revenue management system, a new distribution strategy, new travel products and enhancements to existing travel products. We continue to expect these commercial initiatives to drive incremental benefits of approximately $10 million this year, as they ramp towards their steady-state values. We\u2019re encouraged that we\u2019re on the road to recovery despite some temporary setbacks. Domestically, we see upward trajectory of our bookings as Omicron has had less of an impact on our business than prior variants. Internationally we are well positioned and we\u2019ll be ready for recovery once international travel policy allows. We have a great product, strong brand, exceptional team and a winning formula for success. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent, and thanks everyone for joining us today. For the fourth quarter, we recorded an adjusted net loss of $70.3 million or $1.37 per share. While our full year adjusted net loss of $383 million or $77.55 per share reflects the challenges of rebuilding our business, while navigating the volatility of the ongoing pandemic. There have been bright spots in the recovery, specifically the continued robust domestic demand for travel to Hawaii. In fact, we ended the quarter with a profit for the seasonally busy month of December, where we saw strong domestic demand for the holidays, even without the full resumption of international service. We closed 2021 with $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments and $2 billion in liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. Our adjusted net debt as of December 31 was $961 million, about $18 million lower than pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2019. In the fourth quarter, we opportunistically repaid $161 million of debt for the partial pay-down of our highest interest bearing EETC notes providing important interest expense savings going forward. And for the full year we prepaid $441 million of future debt obligations, and we made $171 million of scheduled debt and lease payment. And last week we completed the final scheduled principle payment of $51 million for our 2013 EETC tranche B debt. As we work our way back to sustained cash generation, we will ensure we have enough cash to navigate the remainder of the crisis and will continue to invest in strengthening our business. While our current debt profile doesn\u2019t provide significant near-term economic opportunities to delever we\u2019ll be prudent about how we fund our 787s and other capital investments. And we\u2019ll look for more opportunities to use our excess cash to produce positive future returns. Our fourth quarter non-fuel expenses excluding special items came in a little better than we expected due to favorability across a variety of cost categories with some of those costs pushing into the first quarter. In December, we spoke about our expectations for our 2022 unit costs. The reduction of ASMs from the delay and the ramp-up of our international business and the change in our assumption about the timing of our 787 deliveries results in an expectation that our full-year unit costs, excluding fuel will now increase 3.5% to 7.5% as compared to 2019. This excludes the impact of our tentative agreements with the IAM and other collective bargaining agreements that will be amendable this year. We expect IAM agreements to add another point to point-and-a-half to the year-over three-year range when ratified. We work through the new contracts and increase our operational agility through recent technology investments over the next few years; we expect these wage increases to be partially offset by increased productivity and other benefits. Let me walk you through some of the specific changes to our 2022 unit cost expectations as compared to 2019. With the assumption that the delivery dates of the first two 787s shift from the end of 2022 to the first half of 2023, we now expect a half-point headwind of incremental expense related to preparing the 787 entry into service. Delivery dates for the first two 787s are not firm and if pushed beyond the first half of 2023 we may see some of these costs shift further out of 2022. We also expect an additional half-point headwind as we reduce ASMs due to the delay in the resumption of our international service, which will result in some excess staffing from January through April. This labor will remain relatively fixed in the near-term as we stay on target for the recovery of our international network in the second half of the year. If resumption of our international service is pushed beyond May, we expect an additional cost headwind of about $2.5 million per month. The reduction in ASMs also impacts the magnitude of the headwinds and tailwinds we discussed back in December, and we now expect a net unit cost headwind of four-points from wages and benefits, depreciation and amortization, aircraft rent and rentals and landing fees, which is up half-a-point from our prior expectation. For the first quarter we expect our unit costs excluding fuel and special items to be up 10% to 13% compared to the first quarter of 2019 on a capacity to decrease of the same magnitude. The expected increases from 2019 are in line with the full year headwinds previously mentioned, but I\u2019ll explain the sequential increase in costs from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022, as capacity is about flat quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase in cost is primarily driven by an increase in the number of heavy maintenance events, some equipment purchases that were pushed from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, and incurrence of more project related OpEx. We expect our fuel consumption for the first quarter and full year as compared to 2019 to be down 18% to 21% and 4.5% to 8.5% respectively. And we are forecasting our fuel price per gallon for the first quarter to be $2.53; and for the full year to be $2.42. We have also revised our capital expenditure forecast for 2022 to reflect the delivery delay of our two 787s. We now expect our capital expenditures in 2020 to total $105 million to $125 million with about two-thirds for aircraft and the remaining third for non-aircraft spend. On the non-aircraft side we continue to make investments in technology that provide us with commercial flexibility or operational efficiencies. We\u2019ll also continue to invest in our facilities to improve the experience for both our guests and our employees. Our first quarter outlook results in an expected EBITDA of negative $150 million to $90 million. While we\u2019re disappointed that the negative headwinds of Omicron have pushed our recovery timeline back a couple of months, we believe the strengths of our team and our business model coupled with the resilience of demand for travel to Hawaii will result in success over the long-term. And with that, we can now open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Linenberg: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Hey Shannon, I want to go back on the costs you said because of the aircraft delays and the pushback in international, you now have a four-point headwind, and I guess what previously was it 3, 3.5 point. I just want to get some context around that?\nShannon Okinaka: Sorry, Mike. That might have been confusing. We gave a lot of numbers. So the previous guidance for the full year was to be up 2% to 6%; and now the guidance is to be up 3.5% to 7.5%. And so what you have to do basically is add the half-a-point from the reduced ASMs, from the schedule changes and the pushback of international. And then we have another half-a-point from the 787 delay, and then the four-points for all of those other things. And we had talked about the specifics of those other things in December, but now it\u2019s primarily wages and benefits. But there are some give and takes from those other categories that result in the four-point headwind.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. So, just like hear me out here though, when I look at your previous guidance relative to capacity, and I now see you\u2019re pulling down your capacity by about three-points, right. And I realized that it\u2019s not totally linear from a unit cost perspective, but your unit cost pickup is a bit less. And so I actually sort of looked at that and thought, with that type of capacity pullback that wasn\u2019t as bad of an increase that I would\u2019ve anticipated realizing that it\u2019s not a linear relationship. And so I \u2013 that\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t follow and maybe \u2013 maybe the way that I\u2019m looking at it just isn\u2019t the right way to think about it?\nShannon Okinaka: No. I think that\u2019s exactly the right way to think about it. We are aggressive on our cost and we make adjustments to our business as things [indiscernible] changes. Yes. So I think you\u2019re thinking about it, right, Mike.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. That\u2019s what it looked like. It looked like you picked up maybe you saw some other areas where you could get some cost benefit you were able to sort of capture that in this number. Jumping on to my second question; this is just to Brent on the schedule. A month ago, you guys were talking about ramping up Australia and you seemed somewhat encouraged. And I did see you pull Brisbane from the schedule for the entire year, like it\u2019s out. And I just didn\u2019t know if either Australia wasn\u2019t ramping up as well or it\u2019s because of the delayed airplanes and the international route that had to get cut if you weren\u2019t going to get the 787s would be Brisbane, maybe it was the most marginal of your international. Am I reading too much into it? Thank you.\nBrent Overbeek: We had \u2013 Mike, as we have been kind of working our way through the pandemic, we were kind of looking at the pace at which international was coming back. We looked at the conditions that we thought were going to exist in the marketplace, particularly the international marketplaces that we serve. And while we certainly like flying to Brisbane, enjoy that, we were at the point where we were ready to move on. We don\u2019t think the conditions in the short-term are going to make sense for us. And so I wouldn\u2019t read anything in that in terms of short-term changes. Those were things that we were pondering and as we moved our way into 2022, it made sense to move forward with that.\nPeter Ingram: And Mike, just to put perhaps a finer point on that, there\u2019s \u2013 the Brisbane decision is not a reflection of any level of disappointment with how we\u2019ve started up in Sydney. It was really something that we had been evaluating going back before we resume service to Australia.\nMike Linenberg: That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. Thanks, guys. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nHelane Becker: Thank you very much operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for the time. I just have a clarifying question for Shannon. When you said negative EBITDA for first quarter, you said minus $150 million, is that minus $150 million to minus $90 million or minus $150 million to positive $90 million?\nShannon Okinaka: Minus $150 million to minus $90 million, Helane. Thank you.\nHelane Becker: Thank you. And then my other question is probably for Peter. There\u2019s a \u2013 tomorrow morning, the Honolulu City Council is holding a meeting to consider Bill 41 CD1, which I guess is the bill that limits people using their houses for Airbnb. And so, are you thinking about that as impactful to your business as you think about resumption of traffic from anywhere to Hawaii or is there a shortage of hotel rooms or is there a shortage of places for people to stay or how should we think about that as impacting your business if at all?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, it is something that we do think about certainly. In recent years with Airbnb and VRBO, I think, there has been increasing use of what\u2019s referred to as vacation rentals or transient accommodations, non-hotel accommodations. A lot of visitors really enjoy the experience of having something different in hotel. And particularly I think it demand for it has increased relative to hotel stays over the course of the pandemic as many people like to have a space that is a little bit more private with just their own traveling party. It\u2019s a subject that has created much debate in our community here in Oahu and candidly throughout the Hawaiian Islands as residents in many cases would like to see some restrictions on where these vacation rental units can be certified to operate legally and to prohibit them from other residential neighborhoods. And Bill 41 is the latest of a series of piece of legislation that we have seen throughout the counties of the state. I think it\u2019s important that we maintain a place in the suit of options that are available for visitors, for them to take advantage of vacation rentals. We do think it is appropriate to have some restrictions on that as we go forward. And we\u2019ll actively monitor that discussion and hope that the various state and county governments that are looking at this strike the right balance as we end up seeing this move through the legislative process.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Thanks, Peter. That\u2019s very helpful. And thanks everybody for your time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nConor Cunningham: Hey everyone. Thank you. Hey Brent, you mentioned flying 120% of your North America schedule and that\u2019s going to be your high-water mark in the first quarter. I\u2019m just trying to parse out what that is. So, what percentage of that is just domestic flights that should have been flying potentially international? And then where is that being added? Is that just a frequency thing in stronger markets? Just any help there would be great. Thank you.\nBrent Overbeek : Yes. Conor, it\u2019s really a function of 2019 and how we grew in 2019. So, a lot of our growth was in kind of 2Q, 3Q, 4Q of 2019. So, as we keep comparing back to that base year, 1Q in particular, looks a little bit odd. For example, like Boston didn\u2019t start until the second quarter of 2019. So, it looks like growth on this relative basis. So, there is not a lot of material change in the network there. We\u2019ve added a few select trips during the spring break, but a lot of it is really just the base of 2019 that we compare back to and 1Q being a bit different than the rest of the year.\nConor Cunningham: Okay.\nBrent Overbeek : And I think another thing is \u2013 another thing if you think about sequentially kind of quarter-over-quarter, we\u2019re pretty flat. So, from 4Q of 2021 to 1Q of 2022. So, if you really think about it, it\u2019s really more of the base movement in 2019 than anything material that we\u2019re doing to change things in the first quarter of 2022.\nConor Cunningham: Right. So, it\u2019s not like you were adding flights from assets that should have been somewhere else, this is just a base.\nBrent Overbeek : Yes.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, cool. And then some of the other airlines have talked about the rise of premium leisure and the potential permanence of that new customer. I think it\u2019s kind of an interesting thing for you guys, because I am just curious if you could speak to like your premium products and how they performed through the pandemic and just your general view of this customer? I just would think that if that is a sticky person, that it would fall right into your market. So just curious if you have any thoughts on that? Thank you.\nBrent Overbeek : Yes, I think, it\u2019s a great observation, Conor. And we have certainly seen it here kind of throughout the pandemic and even into the fourth quarter our premium products are doing fantastic. I think domestically, we were PRASM-positive in the front cabin despite some of the headwinds we had in the fourth quarter. So, demand and some pricing power there continue to remain really, really strong. We\u2019ve seen strong performance in Extra Comfort as well. And so that has done well. We\u2019ve been able to have a little more pricing power there in terms of seeing some improvements in the average sell-up price into that product. So yes, I think, premium leisure is doing quite well, and we are really well positioned to be a winner from that in Hawaii.\nPeter Ingram: I\u2019d just add to that, Conor. I do not think that this is a phenomenon that occurred because of or coincident with the pandemic. It\u2019s actually if you go back and look at our premium cabin trends in 2018 and 2019, typically, those were outperforming the performance in the main cabin. And some of that was because of the great efforts of Brent\u2019s team and our commercial team more generally in terms of marketing those products better, but some of it is, I think, an evolution of the demand. And so, we\u2019re just seeing that continue as we\u2019ve gone through the pandemic.\nConor Cunningham: Great, appreciate. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. One, we\u2019re seeing other airlines this earnings season point to worsening RASM trends versus 2019 in the first quarter versus 2019, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 versus 2019 if you follow me. And your guidance is also pointing to a decel in RASM performance versus 2019 as we head into the first quarter. Can you just walk us through what\u2019s driving that? Is it the pricing environment changing? Is it just assumptions that you have to make on January and February on lingering Omicron impact? Or obviously, you\u2019ve had to make some changes to international. The switching capacity around closer in put pressure on RASM. Just would love to hear some of the puts and takes on the pricing and how you\u2019re thinking about demand. Thanks.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. So I think the timing of Omicron hits a decent chunk of 1Q. It\u2019s particularly pronounced in January and February. We\u2019re encouraged that we\u2019ve kind of seen the bottom in terms of booking trends, but we\u2019ve got a bit of a hole we\u2019ve got to dig out of in terms of continuing to move in the spring break. So the timing of it, I think, has a real impact in terms of being in 1Q. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we think 1Q is the most material impact. Internationally, there\u2019s a pretty material slowdown. We\u2019ve seen some steady progress, while still a small portion of our network. We had seen demand in our international network continue to strengthen. And that waned obviously at the end of the fourth quarter, but going into 1Q, our expectations around passenger revenue have softened quite a bit. Still quite positive on what we\u2019re able to generate in terms of cargo revenue. And so that will continue to support the schedule that we\u2019ve got in place. But on the passenger revenue side, that has slowed down and certainly in some of the geographies, particularly Japan and Korea, that has been maybe a little bit more pronounced. And then finally, I think we enjoyed a couple of good holiday periods in the fourth quarter, and while not as strong as normally, we still had good results in November around Thanksgiving and the holidays and as Shannon mentioned in her prepared remarks, in terms of generating a profit in December. So without a lot of that in January and February that we\u2019ve seen things kind of move on from there.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. That all make sense. Maybe Omicron, not surprising, and then a little bit just fewer peak days or less ultra-peak days, how you want to think about it, that makes sense. Maybe just a medium-term question. If Japan and other parts of Asia continue with relatively much stricter COVID policies in other geographies through this year, who knows maybe even 2023. I know you don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but are there any other long-haul international markets you would look to, to reallocate wide body capacity? Or could some of those perhaps find their way into other domestic opportunities like the one that you took in Austin over the pandemic? Thanks.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I think it\u2019s a little hard to say on the international side, where we\u2019re going to be at in terms of regulations, both in Japan and other locales. I think we feel like we\u2019ve got some other opportunities to grow in North America and other long-haul destinations, but we\u2019re going to balance those with the available resources that we\u2019ve got and how we manage that planning cycle will be really important as we move forward into the middle \u2013 really into the summer of 2022.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Got it. I could sneak one super quick one modeling question for Shannon. The 1 to 1.5 points on new labor agreements, I just want to make sure that\u2019s only for the IAM tentative agreement, right? And then is that the 2022 impact? Okay, yes, to the TA. And then is that the 2022 impact or an annualized impact? I know it\u2019s a small difference given it will be ratified mid-Feb, I just want to be sure. Thanks so much for all the time.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks, Cathy. Yes, you\u2019re right. That is just for the IAM TA. And the 1 to 1.5 refers to the 2022 versus 2019 impacts, but it is the full year impact of the TA.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nNoah Chase: Thank you for the time. This is actually Noah Chase on for Hunter. Peter, how do you see your network structure evolving in the case to airlines don\u2019t actually pull the marginal capacity added in Hawaii or competing international markets as we come out of recovery? And how do you think that actually shapes your passenger revenue breakdown, the pre-COVID set roughly at a 25%, 75% split between international and domestic?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I think at this point, and I\u2019ll let Brent chime in as well, if he wants. We are confident that we\u2019re going to see Japan recover. And so we would expect, as we move forward into the latter part of this year, that we\u2019re going to see a similar balance between domestic and international than we\u2019ve had before. We did add a couple of flights domestically. So it may move a couple of percentage points, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re envisioning a radical shift. And I think, frankly, over the longer-term, what is most likely to happen for our long-haul capacity serving Hawaii is that as we have evolved the network over the last decade, it\u2019s largely going to mirror where visitors are coming from Hawaii. And so I think over time, if you saw that broader visitor mix shift one direction or the other, we would likely shift our network similarly.\nNoah Chase: Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s super helpful. And then if I could just sneak one more in. Are you seeing inflationary pressures that are more apparent in Hawaii than other parts of the U.S.? And is that impacting current hiring efforts and how you might expect it will affect pilot negotiations?\nPeter Ingram: So in terms of inflationary pressures, I sort of split it into labor versus non-labor. And I would say on the non-labor side, there\u2019s really nothing that\u2019s particularly unique about what we\u2019re experiencing in Hawaii. I think from an airline perspective, the part where we are seeing costs go up more is on our airport cost structure. But that, I think, is less a function of stimulus-driven inflation in the broader economy and more a function of investments that have been made in airports over the last several years. So that\u2019s a headwind that we\u2019ve all seen coming for some time. On the labor side, again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly unique to Hawaii. I think we are experiencing some tighter labor markets, particularly for job functions like the one in our airports, and cargo and maintenance organizations. And so the increases that are provided in our new IAM deal are actually welcome to improve our competitiveness in terms of attracting and retaining that part. As for your specific question about pilot negotiations, that\u2019s an interesting one to consider, and it is colored by the fact that the negotiating picture is not just our contract becoming amendable this year, but the fact that a significantly \u2013 a significant percentage, almost all of the pilot contracts throughout the industry have either recently opened up or been opened up for some period of time. So there is a fair bit of uncertainty. And I think that is likely to shape our negotiations as we move forward over the coming months.\nNoah Chase: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.\nDan McKenzie: Hi, thanks. First one is just house cleaning, and I just have a couple of other questions, but on the first one. Can you remind us of the timing of when the new revenue management system is turned on, like what day? And what the benefit is that you\u2019ve included in the first quarter revenue outlook?\nBrent Overbeek: So Dan, it will turn on in the kind of the middle of the latter part of the quarter. And we have prescribed zero dollars for the first quarter, just given where we are with the booking curve and working our way through that and the implementation. We\u2019ll be well into the booking curve. And so as we work to get value out of that, it\u2019s going to be more in the medium term than the latter \u2013 for the summer and the latter part of the year, not in 1Q.\nDan McKenzie: I see. Okay. And then a question on pent-up demand. I guess, Brent, while I have you, I\u2019m just wondering how spring and summer searches for travel are comparing to 2019? So not bookings, just looking at searches, are they trending above 2019? And what inflections have you seen as you kind of grind through the Omicron and what you\u2019ve seen recently?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I think I would characterize it as pretty flat. We\u2019ve \u2013 certainly in the context of summer, there\u2019s been a lot of interest out there around that. And so I\u2019d say we\u2019re kind of at parity with 2019. And spring break, I think we\u2019re probably pretty close in terms of searches, where we\u2019re probably \u2013 we are a little bit down in bookings, but that\u2019s really just a function of the timing of when Omicron came up on us.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. And then, I guess, kind of another question, if I could just squeeze one more in. Can you remind us on the percent of scheduled seats that are from business and Extra Comfort? And where I\u2019m going with this in the script, you mentioned optimally configured aircraft. And I think as you compete more and more with Southwest, have you looked at increasing the number of premium seats just given the success that you guys have had on the premium revenue mix? Just kind of going back to an earlier question as well.\nBrent Overbeek: I don\u2019t have the exact percentages in front of me in terms of cabin split. We can have Ashlee follow up with you on that. It is something that we periodically look at, and we look at how we\u2019re best using our real estate on board the aircraft. As Peter had mentioned earlier, we were making strides back in 2018 and 2019 in our more premium related products. We\u2019ll continue to look at that. Real estate investments in terms of reconfigurations for first-class cabin are pretty expensive. So the hurdle might be there. It might be a fair amount of hire to go make some changes there to existing aircraft. But certainly, as we look forward, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to keep a sharp eye on for existing products.\nPeter Ingram: And I\u2019d just follow on to that, but I\u2019d underscore that the trends there are long term. And so if you actually think about how we\u2019re laying out our 787 with the next airplane that\u2019s entering our fleet, we have designed our cabin on that airplane with a larger premium section. And that\u2019s certainly reflects the evolution of our thinking over time in terms of where opportunity is from a revenue-generating perspective.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Very good. Okay. Thanks for the time you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to go back to Dan\u2019s question here before. So he\u2019s looking at it or he asked about searching, but if you could give a little bit more color with respect to actual bookings. I think you just said that they\u2019re slightly down. And so for March and beyond, what are you seeing in terms of absolute bookings? And then the pace of bookings relative to 2019 or typical seasonality?\nBrent Overbeek: So Chris, as we worked our way through the latter part of December and early January, we had seen things slow down to a much \u2013 to a slower pace. We\u2019ve seen that kind of get off those bottoms, and we\u2019re continuing to see improvements. And we anticipate going forward that as cases abate, we will continue to see a material acceleration around that.\nPeter Ingram: And just to put that in context a little bit, Chris, we were \u2013 as we came through the Delta variant that had us behind in bookings. As cases started declining from that, there was an acceleration. And then subsequently, Omicron came in, we saw a slowdown again. So there is a real relationship to cases. And so it\u2019s hard to extrapolate the trends from the last month even, because the trends from the last month may reflect two-week period to look very different from one another. And I do think we\u2019re on the good side of the Omicron curve now, in the early days of starting to see trailing seven-day average case counts go down and that\u2019s setting us up for a better environment going forward.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then for my follow-up. So Japan or any other markets in the region take longer to recover for whatever reason. How should we think about the commercial initiatives that you outlined or the impact of the initiatives that you outlined out in December, whether in terms of staging or the revenue contribution? Thanks.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I mean I think all of those are obviously highly correlated to how we\u2019re doing in the marketplace. So the benefit of our revenue management system goes up when demand is more in line with supply. And so there might be a slight erosion to that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that material.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Peter Ingram for closing remarks.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo again to everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and look forward to updating you on our progress again in a few months. Aloha.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

Aloha, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This will be Alanna's last call, leading our Investor Relations function as she is moving on to a leadership position in our ESG efforts as our Managing Director for Sustainability Initiatives. Mahalo, Alanna, for stewarding the Investor Relations team through the last 2 unusual years. Ashlee Kishimoto, who many of you on the call will remember, is returning to Investor Relations and will be hosting our calls going forward. As you have already seen in the financial release we issued earlier this hour, the surge in COVID cases associated with the spread of the Delta variant has dampened our near-term financial performance. As much as we would all prefer to see a straight-line recovery, the environment continues to deliver twists and turns for us to navigate. While it's disappointing to see the full recovery of our business delayed by a few months, we are absolutely confident that the effects of these conditions are short term, and we are already seeing signs of a solid rebound in our domestic business at the same time as the necessary conditions for recovery of our international operations are falling into place. With that in mind, we are managing the business for the long term, preparing for an international rebound in the months ahead, focusing on the delivery of outstanding guest experience and moving forward with efforts to better position our balance sheet for the future. One constant over the course of the pandemic has been the outstanding contributions of our team throughout the business. Constantly evolving conditions have forced us to adapt and overcome, and they have responded with an awe inspiring display of strength and resilience day in and day out by continuing to lead the industry in operational performance by an impressive margin and always keeping the evolving needs of our guests, top of mind. I am honored to be a part of this remarkable team. The third quarter began with great promise. Unprecedented demand for Hawaii vacations from the Mainland allowed us to operate our largest July schedule ever from this geography. By July, we were operating 115% of pre-pandemic level capacity; and load factors, which had steadily improved in the first half of the year, reached historical levels. By the tail end of July and into early August, we saw the beginning of the impact of the Delta variant wave of COVID cases as bookings slowed. These conditions continued until mid-August when Hawaii's Governor made public comments asking visitors not to come to Hawaii in light of a pandemic high level of new cases and hospitalizations in our home state. These statements not only further blunted the pace of bookings, but they led to the cancellation of a significant number of reservations, particularly for near-term travel in late August, September and, to a lesser extent, October. The impact of all of this was a significantly lower final load factor in August and September and a deterioration of the strong booking position for the fourth quarter that we had established prior to the Delta surge. By the end of September, conditions were solidifying although not yet quite back to where we were in July. The 7-day averages of COVID cases and hospitalizations in Hawaii were clearly in decline, bookings had stabilized and begun to recover and cancellation rates had reverted to more normal levels. Hawaii now has among the lowest rates of COVID per capita in the U.S. returning to the position we have had through most of the pandemic. Our hospitals have returned to a more normal mode of operations, and we are seeing resurgent interest in Hawaii travel. On October 19, Governor Ige acknowledged this progress and encouraged visitors to resume travel to Hawaii effective November 1. We have some work to do to recover the bookings we didn't take over the course of this period, and that will affect traffic levels for the fourth quarter, but it's encouraging to see demand back on the mend. Given that trends have quickly started to move back in a positive direction, we think that this Delta variant interlude will be remembered as a short-term setback on the road to fulsome recovery. As we've discussed on prior calls, the part of our business for which recovery has been most elusive is international, where restrictions on cross-border travel continue to stifle demand. What is encouraging now is that the necessary preconditions for recovery are falling into place. Most importantly, vaccination rates in Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, which lagged the U.S. in the early part of 2021, have dramatically accelerated. In Japan, which is the most important international country in our network, 70% of the population is now fully vaccinated and 77% has received at least their first dose. These numbers compare to 57% and 66% for the U.S. and 71% and 79% in Hawaii. Similarly, we expect in the weeks ahead that vaccination rates in our other important international markets will meet and most likely exceed U.S. levels. This environment sets the stage for a relaxation of restrictive cross-border travel policies that have been in place throughout the pandemic. Notably, New South Wales in Australia has announced the elimination of quarantine requirements for vaccinated travelers beginning in November, allowing us to recommence service to Sydney in mid-December for the first time since March of 2020. This is a harbinger of expected policy relaxations in the Asia Pacific region in the months ahead and particularly notable given that Australia previously had some of the strictest COVID travel restrictions of major nations. We expect quarantine requirements to be shortened or eliminated, replaced by vaccination and/or testing requirements. When this happens, pent-up demand for leisure travel should be unleashed in our international markets, paralleling the experience we have already seen for domestic travel. People want to travel, especially for leisure. The confinement associated with this pandemic is unprecedented in our lifetime. And when domestic travel restrictions have been relaxed in the U.S. and elsewhere, leisure demand has responded quickly. I am confident the international experience will be similar. We continue to ready ourselves for this eventuality, making sure that we are prepared with staffing, training and fleet to take advantage of demand while delivering the operational performance that our guests expect of Hawaiian Airlines. We are planning for the addition of more international flying to our schedule beginning in late December and ramping up through the first quarter of next year. Given that the policy environment is still evolving, we expect that the recovery of international demand will have a limited impact on our fourth quarter financial results, but we expect a more material recovery in 2022. Elsewhere in our business, we experienced a number of notable events in the past quarter. Hawaiian was proud to respond to the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet for just the third time in the history of the craft program. Our team helped relocate refugees from the Afghanistan evacuation to a new life in the United States, an experience that was extremely moving for all those involved. We also continue to use aircraft and crews that are temporarily surplus from our scheduled operations to support charter flights for the U.S. military and other customers. In addition, we marked a notable milestone with the opening of the new Mauka Concourse at our Honolulu hub. The Mauka gates represent the first major expansion at our home airport in 28 years with the ability to simultaneously serve 11 narrowbody or 6 wide-body aircraft. In conjunction with ongoing projects to improve our lobby experience in Honolulu, we are taking meaningful steps to enhance our award-winning guest service. We're also taking concrete steps to reduce our debt levels. Most notably, by conducting a tender offer for the A and B tranches of our 2020 EETC issuances. As our investors are aware, our focus through 2020 and into the early part of 2021 was bolstering our liquidity to manage through the COVID crisis. While COVID is still with us, we have a clearer line of sight today to long-term recovery and the tender offer is an important first step towards restoring our balance sheet to a superior long-term position. All of this fits in the theme of focusing on the long term even as we look to manage near-term performance in a turbulent environment. As we navigate the day-to-day twists and turns of our current environment, it is easy to forget that just a little over a year ago, it was impossible to travel to Hawaii without enduring a 14-day quarantine. Now we have seen our mainland business recover and are confident that it will recover again from the recent dip. Conditions are falling into place for a recovery of our international franchise. By the middle of next year, we expect to restore system capacity to pre-pandemic levels and beyond, justified by the full restoration of demand for travel to Hawaii. And through it all, I'm immensely proud to share this journey with a fantastic team of aviation professionals who are laser-focused on serving the needs of our guests. As we close out this year of recovery over the next couple of months, we are looking ahead to even better days in 2022. With that, let me turn the call over to Brent to discuss our commercial performance in more detail.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter, and aloha, everyone. Our third quarter revenue performance was better than our updated guidance range as the impact of the Delta variant, while significant, was not quite as bad as we anticipated when we provided our updated guidance. We also had a noncash accounting adjustment that increased revenue by about $10 million. Total revenue was down 33% compared to the third quarter of 2019 on a 21% decline in capacity. Passenger revenue was down 35% year over 2 years, while other revenue was down just 10%, driven by strong performance in loyalty, charters and cargo. As Peter mentioned, the quarter started off strong in North America. Despite elevated competitive capacity, our North America traffic volumes and passenger revenue exceeded 2019 levels in July. At the same -- at the time of our last call at the end of July, our book load factors for August and September were roughly in line with 2019 levels. But as we moved through the quarter, we saw traffic volumes decline with the increase in the prevalence of the Delta variant and public officials\u2019 comments discouraging travel to Hawaii. Commensurate with the slowdown in bookings, we also experienced an increase in sale activity and lower sale fares initiated by a few of our competitors. Over the past several weeks, we've seen an improvement in booking activity and the sale levels have begun to show nominal signs of improvement. As we move forward, we're hopeful that as load factor continues -- as load tractor deficits continue to ease, we'll see pricing firm up a bit more. While we've seen pressure -- pricing pressure in the main cabin, front cabin demand and pricing has held up relatively well. In both July and August, front cabin PRASM was up double-digits compared to the same months in 2019. We don't think we'll get back to those levels of improvement over the next couple of months. But as we work our way through the fourth quarter, we continue to expect stronger relative performance in the front cabin. Not surprisingly, our ancillary revenue streams that are tied to passenger volumes, such as Extra Comfort and Bags have seen a commensurate decline in revenue over the back half of the third quarter. Credit card revenue held up well. Credit card spend was strong during the quarter. And while we did see a temporary slowdown in digital credit card acquisitions as bookings softened, in-flight acquisitions remained strong throughout the quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the impact of the Delta variant and the Governor's comments were significant. In the short term, we went from being ahead by 4 points on our fourth quarter advanced book load factor compared to 2019 to where we are now down double digits. Advanced bookings have firmed up, and we are seeing positive build relative to 2019 for the past few weeks. As Peter highlighted in his opening remarks, we've weathered a short-term setback, which doesn't change our long-term view of success moving forward. The recovery of our business was also impacted by the Delta variant. We operated about 76% of our 2019 capacity in the third quarter, but at much lower load factors than previously anticipated. We have trimmed capacity in the fourth quarter from our previous expectations and expect to operate about 72% of our 2019 capacity. Booking trends have improved over the past several weeks in Neighbor Island. And while October has been a difficult month, we are optimistic that booking trends will continue to improve as case counts have come down on the Mainland and particularly here in Hawaii. In our international geography, we've seen an easing of travel restrictions in Australia, and we're excited to reinstate 5x weekly service to Sydney, Australia starting in mid-December. By then, vaccinated Australian citizens will no longer be subject to quarantine upon returning to Australia. While we don't have perfect clarity on the timing of our other international markets opening up, we're undoubtedly much closer than when we spoke in July. Vaccination rates have been increasing in each of our key international geographies and now exceed that of the U.S. Mainland. Furthermore, there's been a dramatic drop in case counts, particularly in Japan. We're encouraged that The Biden Administration has announced that vaccinated foreign travelers will be able to enter the U.S. starting November 8 and have encouraged the State of Hawaii to align its safe travels program with federal requirements. While timing for reopening may still be uncertain for some of our markets, what we do know is that similar to our domestic markets, there is pent-up demand for leisure travel. Hawaii and Hawaiian are well positioned with the brand, safety and quality of experience to capitalize on this expected increase in demand. Overall, for the fourth quarter, we expect that system capacity will be down 18% to 21% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and revenue to be down between 32% to 37%. Unsurprisingly, the nominal decline from our third quarter 2021 performance is driven by advanced booking loss during the time when the Delta variant was surging as well as the Governor's comments discouraging guests from travel to Hawaii until November 1. We're encouraged that we're on the road to recovery despite some temporary setbacks. We're confident that demand will continue to rebound in North America and Neighbor Island and accelerate in international once conditions permit. We've got a great product, strong brand, exceptional team and a winning formula for long-term success. With that, I'll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka : Thanks, Brent, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. For the third quarter, we reported an adjusted net loss of $48.7 million or $0.95 per share. We closed the quarter with $2 billion in cash and short-term investments or $2.2 billion in liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. Our adjusted net debt as of September 30 was $885 million or about $90 million lower than the pre-pandemic balance at the end of 2019. I'll start with our tender offer. The EETC tender is our first step towards strengthening our balance sheet. While our adjusted net debt continues to be lower than pre-pandemic levels, the negative carry of the excess cash weighs on our income statement. Now that the path to cash generation and profitability is clearer, we're comfortable that our current cash balance exceeds our needs and the tender for our EETC notes provides an opportunity to reduce our debt. Although it is a relatively small portion of our total debt balance, lowering the balance of our highest interest-bearing EETC notes will provide valuable interest expense savings. If we repurchased 50% of each of the 2020 EETC tranches, we will save $8 million in interest expense next year. We expect to have the results of the tender by November 1. In addition to paying contractual debt maturities and investing in our business, we'll continue to look for opportunities to use our excess cash to produce positive future returns. For the third quarter, our total operating expenses, excluding special items, were down about 15% compared to the same period in 2019 on a 21% decline in capacity. This result is at the better end of our updated expectations and was due to favorability across a variety of cost categories. Given the in fuel prices, we're providing our fourth quarter operating expense guidance metric, excluding fuel. We expect our fourth quarter total operating costs, excluding fuel and special items, to be down about 7% to 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 on 18% to 21% lower capacity. These figures do not include any assumptions related to our amendable labor contracts. With capacity essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, the corresponding increase in ex-fuel operating expenses is primarily driven by costs related to capacity readiness as we position ourselves for the resumption of more substantial international service. We're also expecting some smaller increases in technology equipment purchases, volume of heavy maintenance events and contractual wage increases. The slight pause in our recovery will result in some excess labor in the fourth quarter, which we're opting to maintain to stay on target for our international recovery expected in the next few months. We're forecasting our fuel price per gallon for the fourth quarter to increase to $2.41, which we expect to increase our total operating expenses by about $18 million compared to the prior quarter. Looking further ahead, we're focused on improving margins and investing in the long-term success of our business, including technology initiatives that will position us to be agile in responding to market demands. We also recently made the decision to continue investing in our growth, extending 2 of our A330 leases that were due to expire in 2021 for 2 more years, which positions the 787 deliveries that we're expecting in 2022 as growth aircraft rather than replacement. We intend to share more details on our 2022 planning assumptions and outlook, including ASMs, CASM ex and CapEx at an investor call to be held in mid-December. We'll provide more information regarding the investor call in the coming weeks. While we're disappointed that the negative headwinds of the Delta variant have temporarily interrupted our recovery, we're confident in the strength of our business model, the resilience of demand for travel to Hawaii and our success over the long term. And with that, we can open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nHillary Cacanando: This is Hillary actually calling in for Mike. I just had a question on the liquidity. So with the cash tender offer for your [7.375% and 11.25%], it looks like you're on the path to a great deleveraging strategy. And just wanted to find out if you kind of go over your deleveraging strategy going forward because you had mentioned last quarter that you have 2 buckets of debt where you have interest rates that were too cheap to pay down and the other one with where you would incur penalty for prepayment. So I guess, going forward, it is cash tender and buying back that one of your strategies or how should we think about that going forward? And what your normalized liquidity will be going forward as well?\nShannon Okinaka : Yes. Thanks, Hillary, this is Shannon. Yes, you're right. We do have some limitations on what we can do at this point on delevering, as you mentioned. We have a lot of debt with really low interest rate that really doesn't make sense to prepay. And outside of the EETCs, some of the -- a little higher rate debt has make-whole provisions and some penalties that make it noneconomic to repay. So yes, the tender is our first step. We're also being very creative about how we use our cash. We are investing in technology initiatives as well as growth.  The next question, I think, really that we'll have to answer from a liquidity and leverage perspective is how we're going to pay for the 787s, and we do have a lot of excess cash on our books right now. So of course, one of the options is to pay for the -- at least for the first 2 787s with cash. But we do have, over the next few years, a fairly regular amount of just natural maturity payments on our debt that will help us with our leverage and to also decrease the interest expense. We haven't quite yet established a new leverage target. I can't imagine. I don't think it would be significantly different than our pre-pandemic leverage target, which was 1.5x to 2.5x our debt-to-EBITDA, but we haven't reestablished in the target. So I think that's pretty safe to use for now.\nHillary Cacanando: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just one more question on your international routes. It's great to hear that Japan is about 70% vaccinated and your expectations for international recovery for next year is definitely -- has improved. And so I wanted to find out, last quarter, you said you expect South Korea and Japan to lead the recovery and Australia and New Zealand to lag, is that still the case? Or since you're opening up the market -- the Sydney market again, has that changed?\nPeter Ingram: Obviously, with the restart of Sydney, we've seen an update on that. And it was really a positive surprise to see Australia move as quickly towards reopening. So we think that really does set the stage for further reopening. The conditions are falling into place everywhere. I think, is the main message that we want to make sure we've delivered. And there are some elections coming up in Japan that are probably going to set up a decision-making environment for the policymakers coupled with the high vaccination rates and the very low case counts that we think there is a good prospect for positive news from Japan in the coming weeks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Peter, 2 quick ones, unrelated. And I'll accept 1 sentence answers if you are up for it. And then I got a little bit more of an involved one after that. First one, pre-COVID, what percentage of your passengers were under age 12?\nPeter Ingram: I'm going to hand that to Brent to see if...\nHunter Keay: Why don't you look that up and I'll ask you another one, if that's cool. And then the question I have for you, Peter, is a second quick one is, yes or no. Are you contractually permitted to walk away from the 787s because of Boeing's production problems?\nPeter Ingram: We are not unless they were to delay delivery to the point when it kicks in delay provisions. But since we have rephased those deliveries to only begin in 2022, I do not expect that condition to be in place.\nHunter Keay: Got it. Okay. And then, Brent, I'll give you another couple of minutes on this other question. The last question I had, the state tax on hotel rooms that Hawaii is going to impose, why do you think that's happening?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I think there's a variety of things. I think a lot of it had to do with some of the financial challenges of the state faced and with the economic impacts of the pandemic and created an environment where they were looking for places to raise money. Unfortunately, taxing of visitors traveling into states is one of the easiest pockets to reach into for policymakers, and we've seen that a few times in recent years. So I think that's probably the biggest impact. I think it was really about -- more about getting money for the general fund.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And then, Brent, if you have that answer on Page 12?\nBrent Overbeek: I don't have at my fingertips, but we did look at it slightly different on the international side, Hunter, and I assume that's where your question is emanating from. When we looked -- we looked at what percentage of customers had a -- someone in their traveling party under 12. So i.e., if the parents with a kid under 12, they probably wouldn't travel without the child. And I want to say in most of our international geographies, that was in kind of the high teens, low 20s when you look across kind of all of the geographies. I would also temper that with the thought that the vaccinations are now here in the U.S. where we seem to be very close to approval for people 6 to 11 to be able to get the vaccines and that would alter those percentages as well.\nHunter Keay: Yes, that was kind of the thing that hold music you had was absolutely wild before the call started, like a rave.\nPeter Ingram: I'm sorry we didn't get to enjoy it on our end.\nOperator: Our next question is from Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners.\nConor Cunningham: I want to echo the music as well. I think it was a Star Wars theme song. It was quite interesting. Just on the -- on international, in general, is there a scenario in which you see a full-blown recovery to 2019 levels? And then if you do see a recovery of that nature, what's the potential CASM-ex tailwind that you get just from having an international network back?\nPeter Ingram: My base case expectation is a full recovery to 2019 levels. So absolutely, there's a scenario.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And that's by -- sorry.\nShannon Okinaka: No, go ahead, Conor.\nConor Cunningham: Is that by mid-20? Like I'm just trying to get the sense of the timeline, like I mean, obviously, there's a waiting game that still needs to happen here. But like is it like basically you're fully back the second that everything opens up. I'm just trying to get expectations around that. Sorry.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I think we can be there in the back half of '22. Yes.\nBrent Overbeek: I think as we've looked at things, we would certainly kind of -- depending on the timing, we would build into it and by -- ideally by kind of summer of '22, we'll be back to a full network.\nShannon Okinaka: And on the CASM-ex side of your question, Conor, obviously, yes, the addition of international piece of our network will reduce our CASM ex. And I still hold firm to -- given the same network as 2019, we would have very similar CASM ex levels. Next year is a little -- we've got some different kinds of headwinds with the 787 prep and the cost for ramp-up of the 787. But generally speaking, yes, our CASM ex will respond favorably with the international resumption.\nPeter Ingram: And I would say we're not giving specific '22 guidance today. Part of the reason we're going to schedule a call in December to talk to everyone is to give the policymakers a little bit more time to evolve the policy environment, and that will hopefully give us a clearer picture of what our outlook will be for the ramp-up of capacity in '22. We may not know everything by December, but we're hoping to know more than we do today.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Great. And then I don't think you touched on it, but just like how the newer markets that you launched to the Mainland like so Orlando, Austin, Long Beach? Like how have those been pulling up? Are they a drag on your revenue performance? Are they at system averages? I'm just curious if there's an additional tailwind from that as we look into 2022 as well?\nPeter Ingram: So I think some of the -- the West Coast stuff came on and was pretty much in line with our performance. Again, kind of our known brand in California, not a lot of market awareness that we needed to drive there. Those 2 came out, and they're largely in line with our more typical West Coast performance. We've been really encouraged with Austin and Orlando. They have a little more seasonality in them than some of our West Coast markets. But overall, those are performing well. And we think as we continue to build brand awareness in those markets, we'll continue to benefit from that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global.\nDaniel McKenzie: I guess my first question really is for Brent. And I guess, Brent, I'm just wondering if you can help us reconcile what's in the schedules data versus the revenue guide because at least what I've seen in the schedules is a steep recovery to Japan in December. So it's almost like the schedules are anticipating the announcement that you guys referenced in your script, and I'm seeing something similar to in other places. And so I guess what I'm just trying to wonder, does the capacity guide include this return of capacity and the revenue guide does not? Or if you can just help us tie what's there publicly versus what your outlook is?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I guess we'd have to kind of reconcile with what you've got on capacity numbers. We've got kind of a gradual ramp-up in Japan as we move into December. We were hoping to do a little bit more, but we postponed a little bit of that. And so maybe we can take that offline and reconcile that. But yes.\nDaniel McKenzie: Yes. And that really was my next question is how -- let's say you get the green light from Japan, how quickly could you add back the flying? Does it -- do you have the people in place now? I mean is the operation set the go button once you get the green light?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. We certainly have crude capability and airplane capability. And as we've been working through our planning scenarios into the first quarter of '22 and into the summer of '22, we continue to kind of build that out. And so I don't think we would be ready to snap back to our historical levels of Japan flying within a month. But as demand built up over the course of the front half of the year, I think we would certainly build into that.\nDaniel McKenzie: I see. And then if you can just, kind of a housecleaning question, just remind us, maybe this will be for Shannon, where our full time equivalents today versus the third quarter of 2019? And where do those need to be? And is that, at this point, a constraint to how you're thinking about the schedule you want to fly, say, in the first quarter or in the summer of next year?\nShannon Okinaka: Dan, I don't have those exact numbers. I know that our FTEs are still lower. We'll pull up the exact numbers for you and give you that information offline.\nBrent Overbeek: Let me answer that a little bit more generally. I mean we are down several hundred, I would say, employees relative to where we were in 2019. But in anticipation of the recovery of our capacity that we're building to, we have a hiring in place as well. Just over the last couple of weeks, we graduated our first flight attendant class since the beginning of the pandemic. And I would add as a personal note, it was quite gratifying to see this class because a number of them were training to be flight attendants in March of 2020, and we suspended that class and those folks have come back to us now, and I'm proud to have them as part of our team. We had our first pilot class that we've graduated since the beginning of the pandemic. We've been hiring in our airport operations. So we are actively working on recruiting front, understanding that we did have some people leave the company permanently in the early part of the pandemic, and we're positioned to recruit and train and meet the requirements we need to deliver the operation that our guests expect.\nOperator: Our next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: So it sounds like your decision to extend those 2 A330s was due to your view on demand, but was the uncertain timing of when 787 deliveries will begin again a factor at all? And then should we think about wide-body net growth next year, all being focused on international growth? Or was any part of this decision to keep some of those mainland routes you started during the pandemic?\nPeter Ingram: So let me sort of put it in context. Our 787 order for which we've got 10 firm orders has always been considered to be a combination of replacement and growth. So one of the things we've always looked at was to make a decision whether an incremental delivery is going to be a growth aircraft or replace a retiring A330 is something that we've got the flexibility to do over time. As we push back the 787 orders, we did have the potential to shrink a little bit in 2022 by letting A330s be returned at the end of their lease. But as we saw the recovery coming this year and particularly the strong domestic recovery we've seen, we made the judgment that we didn't want to shrink in 2022. The cost of those lease renewals is considerably lower than what we were paying before, just given how the market has been on the A330s. And so it was a fairly easy decision to us to keep those airplanes in the fold, allow us to have the flexibility to fully grow back our international schedule as the demand recovers, which is our expectation. And then we will continue, as we take 787s at the end of 2022 and into '23 and beyond, to face those incremental decisions of replacement or growth based on the conditions that we see at the time.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. And then maybe just one on the revenue side. Of course, the biggest driver of revenue momentum for here will be demand recovery, and it sounds like there's a lot of green shoots on international hopefully coming. But can you remind us of what Hawaiian specific initiatives we should be thinking about as demand starts to normalize over the coming quarters in terms of -- I know you guys are working on some merchandising things and a couple of other things. Would just be great to get reminded of what we should be keeping an eye out for in 2022?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Thanks, Catie. Yes, certainly, we've got a new RMS coming in the front part of the year. As you mentioned, we've got some merchandising initiatives underway, and those are things that we'll cover off as well as some distribution initiatives underway. And those are some of the things we'll cover off a little bit more in greater detail in the December update.\nOperator: Our next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: I have 2 questions. One is on the labor side. So great that you're able to hire folks and that you've got flight attendant in, pilot classes going on. I know I think, Shannon, you mentioned that your cost guidance excludes any labor contracts that are open. Can you just maybe talk about like your thoughts regarding timing of getting these contracts done? Are people still not necessarily willing to negotiate or are they willing and you're just not reaching an agreement? How should we think about that?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. Let me take that one, Helane. So we -- as you know, we don't have an amendable contract with our flight attendants. We settled that agreement in the early part of 2020, actually, I think it was in May 2020, we came to terms. So we're under contract with the AFA for our flight attending group through 2025. Our pilot contract becomes amendable next summer, summer of 2022. And we are already in preliminary discussions around that. Our goal would be to have an agreement in place by the amendable date. We've preferred not to have amendable contracts hanging out for a long period of time. Obviously, that is something that is not unilaterally in our control. We have to make sure we do that in a context where it's a sensible agreement for both us and for the labor unions. But that's what we would like to do, and we're already in some discussions on that, and we expect that to accelerate in the early part of next year. The 2 contracts that we do have amendable right now, one is with the IM and that -- they represent our airport employees and our maintenance group. That contract became amendable at the end of last year. We had in 2020 -- or in 2019, actually, we had entered into some expedited negotiations with the goal of getting a deal before the amendable date. That was sort of tossed up in the air by the onset of the pandemic, but we have resumed those talks this year. We have not yet reached an agreement. We are close on a very, very large number of issues, and we still have some distance between us on a handful of important issues. And our hope would be that we can find a resolution to that and not have to go into full Section 6 negotiations, which will take a more extended period of time, but we haven't brought that to close just yet. And then we've got a contract with our dispatchers union, they're represented by the TW. That became amendable the middle of this year. And we're in negotiations now hoping to come to terms on that. There's still a variety of -- a pretty wide variety of issues that need to be resolved. Philosophically, if I just step back at it, I reiterate again, our preference is to negotiate the terms of deals by the amendable date. That preference has not historically been realized, and we would like to change that over time. Obviously, it requires us coming to terms that make sense economically for the long term for the company and it makes sense for -- or it can only work if we can come to terms that work for both parties. But we would prefer to get that done. I think the unions have a similar motives, but it's always difficult when you get into the intricacies of a specific discussion to see if you can accomplish the goal of getting it done by the amendable date.\nHelane Becker: That's actually very helpful. And then I just have a kind of unrelated question. As you think about the market reopening, I mean, it's kind of been open, all this is the issue of the governor and people not booking in blah, blah, blah. As you think about kind of reopening in major ways on Monday, is there -- are there enough -- I don't know if it's Airbnbs or hotel rooms or service personnel, rental cars, just things that people -- that were shortages earlier in the pandemic as things started to reopen that people will expect as they return to the island?\nBrent Overbeek: I think the conditions are getting better on that. The -- right now, from where we were in July when the domestic business was more than 100% recovered compared to pre-pandemic, there was still some shortage of hotel room availability is not everything that come back online. I think some of the hotels and restaurants and other businesses have had some challenges attracting workers, the staff back up, but that situation has improved over time. And of course, right now, we've actually -- we backed off some of the occupancy levels that we saw in July. And so there's some room to grow back before you start bumping into the limits. I think earlier in the pandemic, one of the challenges was restrictions on how many people could go into places like restaurants, those have been evolving local restrictions. And I think with COVID cases going down and hospitalization is down right now, we're moving in a favorable direction in terms of the local policy on that, and that frees things up. But probably the biggest impediment is still staffing on those, but we're not bumping at limits right now. In terms of rental cars, that was one that was particularly acute early on in the pandemic with the unfortunate breathing space that we got from lower arrivals over the last couple of months. That's provided the time for the fleet to be repositioned. And our earlier expectation was that it would be October, November before the rental car companies -- at least, what they had told us before they could get their fleet back up to the level of more standard service, and here we are at the end of October and into November. So that should be remedying itself as a constraint.\nOperator: Our next question is from Christopher Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna International Group.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: So I realized you're still setting your plans on CASM ex and are going to give more detail on your December call. But if you could just help us think about the sort of at least some of the pieces here with respect to structural cost savings realized to date and then anything on the productivity side and how we should think about that? Is it fair to say that you think that you can run the airline on fewer FTEs when your ASMs are fully recovered? Or is that perhaps passengers per FTE? Any detail on the productivity piece side would be helpful.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks, Chris. Yes, we've done actually quite a bit of work on productivity. What Peter didn't mention as part of our philosophy on the labor agreements is that we believe we should pay competitive wages. And so when we get into negotiations, we don't disagree with unions about paying competitive wages. But what we do look for in labor agreements, in processes and is increasing our efficiency and productivity. So we've had some -- experienced some productivity improvements from investments in technology and processes. And you can see that really clearly, if you were to look at our airports, labor and our processes, especially in Hawaii, where we have the bulk of our people. We achieved some productivity improvements through our agreement with the Flight Attendants Union. That was really important. You're talking about a number of heads on airplanes. So really important productivity savings there. So I don't have a number for you as far as how much that will impact 2022 CASM, but it works really well to offset some of those contractual wage increases that we talk about every year pretty much. As far as tailwinds in addition to labor, obviously, with the wide-body market softening, we'll see some good decreases in some of our aircraft ownership costs with the lease extensions that we did this year. We had some structural reductions in costs in our management and administrative costs. Things that we reduced in 2020 that we feel do not have to come back even when we're at full capacity. We've done a lot of work on our maintenance programs looking at -- especially our -- I think they focused on A321 more recently and looked at how they do their heavy checks and when they do them to reduce cost and gain efficiency there. The reason why we did the tender really at this point is to save on interest expense. So we've got a number of tailwinds which will offset some of the headwinds that we see and we've talked about airport costs increasing and the 787 transition costs. I can quantify some of this better for you in December, but that's just some of the gives and takes that we're looking out in 2022.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Is there a general number you can share with respect to the savings on the structural side to date?\nShannon Okinaka: I don't have anything off the top of my head. So we'll look at it and we'll provide more information in December.\nChristopher Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And just as a follow-up here. So in your prepared comments, you spoke about the PRASM and the front cabin outpacing the main cabin. How much of that at this point are you weighing that as you plan for 2022? Meaning, is this something that you're discounting and look at it as short term? Or is it something perhaps that's more structural in nature?\nBrent Overbeek: I think it's structural. It's something that we saw even pre-pandemic in terms of improving demand for that product and our ability to monetize that. And so we were bullish going into '19 and '20, and we have seen some real improvements in our ability to monetize some of the investments we've made in that cabin. And certainly, as we've come back out of the pandemic, that has remained strong. But looking forward, I anticipate that's going to be a trend that we continue to see.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Peter Ingram for closing remarks.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo, again, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and look forward to talking to you in December as well as updating you on our progress again at the end of the next quarter. Thanks, everyone.

This includes the most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K as well as subsequent reports filed on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo, Alanna. Aloha, everyone, and thank you, as always, for joining us today. During the second quarter, we continued to make strides towards recovery. Our financial results were better than we expected at the beginning of the period and well ahead of what we would have predicted at the beginning of 2021 propelled particularly by strong demand on our U.S. mainland routes. International recovery in the Pacific is clearly lagging, but we have every belief that when the rebound occurs, it will be robust. My appreciation goes out as always to our team who continue to do an outstanding job of rebuilding our network and caring for our guests in an ever-changing environment. They embrace our purpose to connect people with Aloha and reflect our values every day in spite of the challenges facing them. As passenger volume has returned, we have moved from downsizing to hiring in many parts of our business. In fact, by the end of the year, it is likely that we will have swung to hiring mode for virtually all major work groups in the company. It is encouraging to us all to see a path towards growth even as the recovery still has some ways to go in parts of the business. The pace of recovery remains different in each of our 3 geographies. When we last spoke, our North America routes were leading the recovery, and that remains the case today. Notably, in June, our North America traffic exceeded 2019 levels. This, in turn, provided conditions for material recovery in nonfare revenue categories like Extra Comfort, baggage and Hawaiian miles. Neighbor Island demand continues to grind back closer to prepandemic levels, albeit at a slower pace than we have seen from the U.S. Mainland, aided by the relaxation of travel restrictions. We remain the carrier of choice for residents and visitors to the islands. International passenger volumes, meanwhile, remain in the low to mid-single digits relative to prepandemic levels, as lower vaccination rates in Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand have thus far stunted any meaningful prospects for border reopening. While we don't expect any significant improvement in these trends to be reflected in our third quarter results, there are encouraging signs to note as the pace of vaccinations has accelerated more recently in both Japan and South Korea in particular. And while we can't precisely forecast when these trends will be reflected in an inflection in demand, the robustness of the U.S. leisure demand response to reopening continues to inspire our confidence in a vibrant international lead to a recovery. And we are focused on being prepared from an asset and staffing perspective to seize this opportunity when demand rebounds. Since we last spoke, we have seen a meaningful easing of travel restrictions in Hawaii through several positive changes to the state's Safe Travels program. Travel restrictions have been completely eliminated for Neighbor Island travel as of June 15. As of July 8, anyone fully vaccinated in the U.S. traveling on a domestic flight can bypass testing and quarantine with proof of vaccination. And one 70% of Hawaii residents have been vaccinated. The governor has indicated that the Safe Travels program will end. Like all of you, we are keeping an eye on the spread of the Delta variant and its impact on the geographies we serve. To date, we have seen no discernible impact on demand that we can attribute to this. But as we have been throughout the crisis, we are prepared to be nimble. On July 1, we reinforced our commitment to sustainability with the publication of our second annual corporate Kuleana report. Along with many other carriers, we are committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Unlike the rest of our peers, we are based on an island [indiscernible] in the middle of the Pacific, which reminds us every day of the importance of really delivering against carbon reduction goals. Our carbon emissions have benefited substantially from our fleet renewal, particularly the introduction of the A321neo, and we expect to see continued benefit with the introduction of the 787 next year. But there is much more for us to do and the Kuleana report will help to keep us accountable to achieving intermediate milestones along the way. As part of an island community, we also have a profound responsibility to ensure the environmental, economic and social well-being of this place. I'm incredibly proud of the contributions we have made through employee volunteerism and corporate giving to supporting our community through this difficult year. We are engaging in dialogue around some of the challenges facing our community, including managing the impact of tourism and addressing issues of social justice and inequality. We're also looking inward to ensure our own very diverse workforce feels valued and heard and that Hawaiian remains a great place to work and build a career. As we look out to the second half of 2021, we are prioritizing initiatives that will accelerate our recovery from the pandemic and position us to be even more competitive in our market niche. We will continue to rebuild our network with a focus on our international network as conditions improve. We are investing in technology and facilities to seize market opportunities. And we are doubling down on our commitment to award-winning hospitality and service to differentiate ourselves from the competition. Underscoring all of this is our dedication to our purpose to connect people with Aloha and our commitment to our values of Malama, ho\u2018okipa, lokahi and Po'okela. This is a winning formula that positions us for success in 2022 and beyond. Let me now turn the call over to Brent to provide more details on our commercial performance and outlook.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter. Aloha, everyone. Our second quarter revenue performance was better than expected across all of our geographies. Total revenue was down 42% compared to the second quarter of 2019 and at the favorable end of our updated guidance on a 30% decline in capacity. Passenger revenue was down about 45% year-over 2 years, while other revenue was down only about 7% driven by continued strong performance in cargo and loyalty. Our revenue performance reflects significant sequential improvement compared to the first quarter of 2021, with quarter-over-quarter revenue increasing 12%. Not surprisingly, this was driven primarily by the substantial rebound in demand that we experienced in North America. By the end of the second quarter, our North America capacity and traffic volumes were back to 2019 levels, albeit at lower average fares given elevated industry capacity. During the quarter, we launched our Austin-Honolulu and seasonal Phoenix-Maui routes, returned the Las Vegas-Maui to our network and now have restored all of our prepandemic North America routes. Our premium products are performing particularly well. We continue to see strength in our front cabin with front cabin PRASM favorable versus 2019 in each of May, June and for the quarter overall. We expect this trend to continue in the months ahead as front cabin book load factors and average fares are very strong for the remainder of the year. Extra Comfort revenue is also on a positive trajectory, improving relative to 2019 each month during the quarter. Our other nonfare products are performing well. We saw meaningful sequential improvement in bag fee revenue for the quarter. And by the end of the quarter, our co-brand credit card revenue had reached prepandemic levels. Our credit card revenue performance was driven by a continued recovery in spend engagement as well as the strong resurgence in travel demand matched with our best-ever consumer offer during the quarter. We continue to see strong spend and card acquisitions so far in July. Looking ahead, we're encouraged by the booking activity we've seen for the second half of the year. Our book load factor for the third quarter is roughly in line with 2019, and our fourth quarter booking levels are ahead of 2019. The changes to the Safe Travel program to allow vaccinated arrivals to bypass testing and quarantine went into effect on July 8. And while it's still early, we're not expecting that to drive material acceleration in our third quarter bookings, given that demand was already quite strong. In any event, we view this as a positive development as it reduces both the cost and complexity of a Hawaii vacation for our guests. In our Neighbor Island geography, we continue to build back our network in the second quarter. We operated about 57% of our schedule compared to 2019, ramping up to about 70% in the month of June. We saw travel restrictions initially eased for vaccinated Hawaii residents in mid-May, and then ultimately end for all Neighbor Island travel in mid-June. We saw steady progress in demand recovery from both local residents and visitors throughout the quarter in response to the loosening of restrictions leading to the better-than-expected revenue performance for the quarter. Going forward, our near-term pace of recovery will be tempered by the increase in direct Neighbor Island and direct to the Neighbor Island markets and the lack of international connecting traffic. In spite of these factors, we are encouraged by the recovery of our North America -- sorry, Neighbor Island market, both on an absolute and relative performance and expect to fly approximately 77% of our 2019 schedule in the third quarter, and we expect load factors to continue moving in the right direction. On the international front, we operated just 11% of our network in the second quarter. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate only marginal improvement in our capacity recovery driven by one incremental frequency in South Korea, the reinstatement of our once-weekly Tahiti service starting on August 7, and likely some scheduled service to American Samoa later in the quarter. In Japan, we've not seen any easing of travel restrictions and do not expect any changes, at least until after the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games conclude in early September. As of now, we're not planning any incremental frequency in Japan for the third quarter, but we are preparing for when restrictions are lifted. As for Australia and New Zealand, we do not expect to resume our operations for the remainder of the year due to their ongoing restrictions. Overall, despite the ongoing travel restrictions in much of our international markets, we are confident about the level of pent-up demand for  Hawaii travel and expect a positive response when restrictions are eased. Rolling it all up at a system level for the third quarter, we expect capacity will be down between 20% to 23% and the system revenue will be down between 28% and 33% compared to 2019. Looking further down the road, we've announced our intent to replace our legacy revenue management system with PROS RM Advantage, which will be a meaningful driver of revenue improvement over the long term. We have a ways to go to implement the new system and expect to begin using it sometime in the first half of 2022. We're excited to implement this world-class solution, which will enhance our revenue management and forecasting capabilities and provide long-term value to our business. With that, I'll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. For the second quarter, we reported an adjusted net loss of $73.8 million or $1.44 per share. We closed the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, which includes the receipt of an additional $205 million in PSP funding during the quarter. Our adjusted net debt as of June 30 was $758 million, an improvement of $255 million compared to the beginning of the quarter, driven by cash generation from operations as well as the incremental PSP funding. It also represents an improvement of $220 million when compared to prepandemic levels at the end of 2019. For the second quarter, our total operating expenses, excluding special items, were down about 23% compared to the same period in 2019 on a 30% decline in capacity, which is at the favorable end of our expectations. Our solid cost performance for the quarter was driven by favorability across various cost categories as well as a few onetime credits. These offset slightly higher-than-expected fuel cost which was $1.89 per gallon. We expect our third quarter total operating costs, excluding special items to be down about 10% to 14% compared to the third quarter of 2019 on 20% to 23% lower capacity. These figures do not include any assumptions related to our amendable contract with IAM with whom we have recently resumed contract negotiations. The IAM represents our mechanics and airport employees, among others. The sequential increase in costs quarter-over-quarter is driven by the variable costs associated with operating a bigger schedule, higher fuel prices, higher airport rates and costs related to preparing for the resumption of more international flying. So let me focus for a moment on that last item. As we rebuild our business, we're focused on ensuring we have staff readily available, resulting in a higher-than-normal level of training activity. Even with the ramp-up costs, we expect our third quarter unit cost ex fuel and special items to be lower than the second. And if our international business, particularly to Japan and Korea resumes in the fourth quarter, we expect further unit cost improvement. Based on current conditions, we are preparing for the international schedule recovery to begin in the back half of the fourth quarter and continue into early 2022, and we planned our resourcing for that outcome. If our international recovery materializes in the fourth quarter, we expect our CASM ex to continue to improve both in absolute terms and relative to 2019. If our international business does not return as planned, it is possible that we may have some surplus labor in the near term, but we believe accepting this risk is appropriate to ensure we are positioned to capitalize on the international leisure demand recovery when it happens. Looking further ahead, we expect our CASM ex levels to be similar to 2019 once we're operating in comparable levels of capacity, excluding any impact from our 787 transition costs. We're forecasting a fuel price per gallon of [$2] for the third quarter, which does not include any impact from fuel hedging. At this time, we do not have any fuel hedging in place but are prepared to resume hedging should market conditions warrant. Despite the increase in fuel costs, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to improve from negative $29 million in the second quarter to a range of negative $20 million to positive $20 million in the third quarter. We're encouraged that we have line of sight to positive EBITDA generation and we're focused on improving our margins further as demand conditions improve throughout our network. As returning to profitability remains a short-term focus, we're also investing in the long-term strength of our business. As Brent mentioned, we're investing in a new revenue management system, which will drive revenue improvement in the years to come, supplementing the continuous enhancement of our distribution, product and service. We also have numerous cost initiatives in progress, including the transition of 717 training to a dedicated simulator at our Honolulu training facility and modernizing technology to gain efficiency and flexibility. We're also excited about the opening of a new gate complex in Honolulu that will benefit our operations and guest experience. It's encouraging to have the continued improvement in domestic demand this quarter. And while the timing of our international recovery is still uncertain, we're excited about what the future holds. We're confident that we are on the road to recovery, and our focus is on the long-term success of our business. And with that, we can open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: Peter, I know you talked about the 717 replacement for a while. But is there a scenario where it's replaced by an electric aircraft? I mean, these eVTOLs that we keep hearing about, all these different airlines are investing with eVTOLs. But if you think about it, it really fits with Hawaiian better than any other airline I can really think of, given the stage length and the weather and how much you've been talking about ESG on this call. Is there a scenario with the 717s, just leap ride over any other potential CO2-emitting aircraft and go straight to electric?\nPeter Ingram: It's an interesting question, Hunter. As we think about it, the Neighbor Island routes really do provide an interesting application for electrification of aircraft because one of the challenges that the machines that are currently in design are limited on their range. And we've got a lot of traffic that flies between 100 miles and 250 miles. And that is certainly the prospect of replacing that with an electric aircraft at some point in the future is a lot more foreseeable than the prospect of replacing an airplane that has to fly 2,500 miles across specific ocean to get to the West Coast from here. That said, I think the technology is still a ways off. The eVTOL equipment that is being envisioned and designed today by a number of manufacturers is typically more for urban mobility, and it is 4 to 6 passenger applications. And when you think about the 6 million people that travel between the Neighbor Islands each year, we really require bigger aircraft than that. But I think the answer to your question is, yes, I can see it, but it may be a generation or 2 of replacement removed before we get there. It's probably the middle of the 2030s before we have an electric aircraft of the appropriate size to be a suitable -- suitably considered as a replacement for the 717. But certainly, those are things we're starting to look at a little more and trying to understand the  landscape and understand the direction that some of the producers of that technology are going.\nHunter Keay: Okay, cool. And then that's interesting. And then on the 787s, I know we've also talked about that, too. But just -- I mean, do you really need these planes? I mean you can probably, I would imagine, walk away without much penalty given Boeing's issues. But have you done an analysis on how much OpEx you might save granted in exchange for more CapEx. Just to switch to an all 330 -- A330 widebody fleet. I mean is there a scenario where you decide that the complexity is just simply not worth it in this new world that we're in?\nPeter Ingram: Hunter, anytime you go through a fleet transition, it requires a period of transition, and that adds complexity and it does add a little bit of cost. But it also positions you to benefit from the benefits of the modern technology and the 787 remains the most advanced generation of new aircraft incredibly fuel-efficient and environmentally efficient. And it is destined to be the flagship of our network. We're still very excited to get it. There will be, as you suggest, some transition as we go through that, but that is part of the evolution of working through fleet transitions, and we're prepared to manage through that as effectively and efficiently as we can.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: Maybe the first one for Shannon. So like the rest of the industry, you're holding on to a higher liquidity balance than typical due to COVID, very understandable. As we look forward to next year, any thoughts on what would trigger you to deploy that cash? And should we assume the first priority would be to use it to pay down debt, including perhaps prepayments? Or how are you thinking about that?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks, Catie. Yes, we do -- I mean, obviously, our first focus last year and earlier this year was obtaining enough liquidity to feel comfortable for the rest of the pandemic, however, long it lasts. And that's where we stand from a cash perspective. We are working through what we can do with the balance sheet and delevering. And I think I mentioned this before, but we've kind of got 2 buckets of debt. We've got some really, really cheap debt that doesn't make sense pay off early because it's so cheap. And then we've got the more expensive debt that frankly have some prepayment penalties that make it expense a little expensive to retire early. So we're working through that. But our bigger challenge is the negative carry associated with the amount of the gross debt because like I said in the prepared remarks, our net debt is actually better than where we were prepandemic. So we're working through different analyses and ideas of what we can do to reduce that negative carry, one from just how can we manage the balance sheet, but also looking at areas to invest. And we've got -- we've had a lot of ideas in the past, and we continue to have a lot of ideas of initiatives with positive ROI. So we're trying to be creative about how we can use the cash both on the balance sheet but also to position us well for greater profitability when all of our network returns.\nCatherine O'Brien: I guess as a quick follow-up, maybe to the idea of allocating that cash between the balance sheet, investing back in the business. And we were talking about these ROI projects, are those outside of aircraft investments? Or you're also looking at potential incremental aircraft investments with the cash on the balance sheet? And there's a couple of more quick follow-up after that.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. No, I'm -- I mean, I think for now, at least in the short term, we've got our aircraft plans with the 787 deliveries. We're looking a little bit more outside of that. We've got a bunch of technology projects. We have some facilities projects we're working on, and we're just looking at different ways to deploy the cash.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Got it. Makes a lot of sense. And then I guess in your current bookings, are you seeing anything unusual in leisure demand for the fall perhaps less of a seasonal drop off in some of the shoulder periods or anything interesting further out to Thanksgiving or Christmas break period. I think you said in the prepared remarks, 4Q book load factors currently running ahead of where you were at this point in 2019. It would be great to hear what fares look like, too.\nPeter Ingram: Sure. Thanks, Catie. So we have -- I think when we talked earlier in the year, we had a really compressed booking curve and as we were working through 1Q and 2Q, in particular, it was actually quite compressed. It has really elongated now and kind of looks in many respects like our historical booking curve and in some cases, even out further in advance, we're seeing kind of stronger advanced book outside of 60 days. So a real kind of 180 from where we were unsurprisingly early in the year in terms of North America. No, I think overall, we continue to kind of evolve in terms of both booking curve and customer demographics kind of similar to back -- closer to what we were before. So demographics of our customers are getting a little bit older than where they were in the second quarter, where we had tended to look a little bit younger. We still continue to see a lot of larger groups in terms of family size, traveling as opposed to individuals and as business traffic and convincing traffic comes back a little bit later than some of the leisure travel. We see more people traveling in larger parties and that is certainly kind of pushed out the booking curve a bit. And in terms of the holidays themselves in the fourth quarter, they're off to a really good start, and we're encouraged both in terms of the main cabin performance, but particularly in the front cabin, we continue to see really, really strong performance over those holiday periods. In terms of pricing environment, there continues to be unsurprisingly, a fair amount of discounting that's available and pervasive in the market as we get into the fall. Industry capacity for the quarter is up, I think it's 125%, 128% of third quarter of 2019. So we have seen some pressure there in North America as we get a little further outside of the summer. But overall, things are holding up pretty well for the period. And over the long term there, we think we've got the right formula to compete in terms of good value for our guests and having the right products.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners.\nConor Cunningham: So curious to get your thoughts on just what your international network is going to look like in 2022. It seems like you expect Japan and South Korea to be back in the fourth quarter, which is good. But I know a lot of the stuff is out of your hands, but just wanted to get your expectations for sizing of that market when we think about next year, assuming that things continue to reopen and so.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Conor, it's Peter. Let me start and then I'll turn it over to Brent to add a little bit more color. Our thinking right now is that the end state at some point in 2022 of the international portfolio is actually quite similar to the prepandemic international portfolio. All along, I think we have viewed or at least for a while, we've considered that Japan and Korea are likely to recover first among the 4 major geographies we serve. I think we still believe that. And as Brent said, we expect to see some of that coming in, in the fourth quarter is the working assumption we have, although we won't act on publishing schedules and that reflect until we actually get closer to the realization of the policy changes that are necessary before we can embark on a recovery. And then we expect Australia and New Zealand to lag and unlikely to have any revenue impact in the back half of this year, but to recover next year. But we really do think that the pent-up demand that is a very real feature of what we have seen for leisure travel in North America is a great harbinger of what's likely to happen internationally. And the fact that we're having to wait a little longer for it really just means that it's that much more pent-up by the time people are able to start traveling again. And we know there's a voracious appetite for travel to Hawaii from Japan. We know that Australians are some of the most eager global travelers in the entire planet. And I think the same sort of rebound in travel desire that we've experienced over the past several months in North America is going to repeat itself when Hawaii is once again available to international visitors from around the Pacific rim.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I think the only thing I would add to Peter's comments is we really do believe in everything that we've kind of seen and heard in the market. So leisure traffic is going to be back. It may look a little bit different in terms of how it books, but we're really looking forward to that. In terms of our network overall, I think Peter mentioned it will likely be pretty similar to what it was before. We're a little bit larger now in North America than where we were, and so we will get a little more constrained on aircraft. When that happens in 2022, and we'll take a critical eye to that as to how we place some of those trade-offs as well as keeping a keen eye on some broader market changes that will likely occur in some of the markets that we compete in as there's apt to be some changes there in terms of market participation by some of our competitors.\nPeter Ingram: And just one final thought I'll add. One of the other benefits we have when the conditions for recovery are present is the fact that from the standpoint of managing the spread of the virus, Hawaii has done a good job, and that has positioned us in good stead as a safe place to visit for North America visitors as the reopening occurred. And I think that will also be important to international travelers as they begin to think about leaving the confines of their own country later this year or early next.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. I appreciate all the color. That was great. And then I think, Shannon, you may have talked about this a little bit, but I may have missed it. But just on cost, as you -- there's been a lot of discussion about network restart costs and so on throughout this whole quarter from everyone. So your maintenance expense continues to track like pretty far below -- not far below, but below 2019 levels. So I would imagine that there's some sort of deferral on the widebodies a lot or maybe not, but like there's I'm just curious on a potential maintenance bubble that may happen as you do start to restart international again? Like what is left that's been deferred that may need to be made up at a later point?\nPeter Ingram: Conor, let me start on that one. I think likely the biggest driver of the maintenance costs being lower is the fact that a lot of our maintenance expense, particularly on the engine side for all our fleets is based on power by the hour contracts. And so as we fly less, we have lower maintenance costs in that period. And as we begin to accelerate our flying those maintenance costs come back. So that's probably the biggest driver. You've seen we have not deferred a lot of heavy maintenance costs. We have -- most of our airplanes are operating now on their normal maintenance cycles. We had a couple of 717s that we deferred some checks and we actually have that work back underway to get those aircraft back in the fold now, but that's not enormously material. We are taking advantage of some of the downtime of aircraft here over the next several months to get some paint events done. But it's really not a huge snapback in costs that we're expecting on the maintenance side at this point.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Conor, if you remember, we really didn't do any kind of long-term parking of our aircraft. So there's not a lot of work that needs to be done to bring aircraft back. Really, we maybe put down a few 717s, but really not a lot of cost to bring it back on the maintenance side. As a matter of fact, to Peter's point, we took advantage of the downtime to do more work on airplanes that we had been deferring.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Peter, I want to go back to this July 8, I guess, where the state dropped testing and quarantine rules. And I guess that was what, for all fully vaccinated domestic passengers, not international?\nPeter Ingram: That's correct. It's for domestic at this point. And I think the distinction there, you may recall, Mike, if you were following it, the -- initially, the vaccination exemption was only in place for people who were vaccinated in Hawaii and then that was extended to anyone in the United States. It's really more of an administrative thing than some belief that our vaccinations are better than other people's vaccinations. It's really a sense of being able to recognize and understand the documentation. And I would certainly hope that the goal of the state government would be to extend that to people vaccinated elsewhere, and it's just a matter of them sorting through how they're going to handle that administratively.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. Okay. That makes sense. I just -- I'm hopeful that we're close because when you look at the number or the percent of Japanese that are now fully vaccinated it in fact, rivals some U.S. states. And I guess -- and in some cases, they're vaccinated with U.S. vaccines. It just seems odd, so it does sound like it's an administrative issue. So is this something that we're very close on? Or does it feel like it's just because of the administration issues that this could just go on for some time?\nPeter Ingram: Well, I think one of the challenges that we face with the international geographies is it's not just a question of what the restrictions are here in Hawaii, which is currently requiring a COVID-19 test within 72 hours of travel for an international visitor, but it's also the fact that someone returning to Japan would have to have a COVID test before they go back, another one after on arrival and enjoy a period of quarantine at home despite paying for those 3 tests in the course of their travel. So it's not just about the Hawaii restrictions, which we will try and influence to the extent that we can as appropriate, but it's also about the international restrictions. And I think particularly in the case of Japan, as Brent pointed out, we're somewhat focused on what happens after the Olympics because we do know that, that has been something that has really been a focus of Japan and getting the preparations in place for that and making sure they can execute that as safely as possible for their people, and that's probably made them that much more conservative in terms of how they view their policies towards COVID-19.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. That's helpful. That makes sense. And then just a quick one for Shannon. Shannon, the fact that you are carrying all these widebodies, they're clearly underutilized. Many are idle. What is the CASM headwind on that? I know you sort of talked through some numbers earlier. But is there any way -- can you give us a feel that like a 5-, 6-, 7-point CASM headwind. I'm just -- I'm throwing that out there because a couple of other carriers talked about these grounded or underutilized international widebodies. And I know that you are prepared to carry them to carry the people and the aircraft into next year. There's got to be some additional cost there that's pretty sizable. Any estimates that you can help?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Sorry, no, I don't have that number at the top of my head. We do -- I mean, we -- what we did during the past year, those to -- because we couldn't optimize aircraft utilization. Brent and his team created a schedule to optimize labor costs. And as our flying is ramping up, we're kind of switching that over. Now I think Brent had mentioned come mid to end of 2022, depending on how international ramps up, we'll have to figure out how to best utilize the aircraft from a profitability standpoint. But I'm sorry, I don't have that number right now as far as 2021 CASM impact of the lower utilization -- aircraft utilization.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: As you think about growing in North America, could you just talk about how you're thinking about markets that might be available to you that makes sense for you to fly to maybe before international comes fully back?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I'll talk a little bit about how we're thinking about it and again, see if Brent wants to add any color on top of this. Obviously, the beginning of this year in March and April, we added some new flying -- a couple of new cities with Austin and Orlando and Ontario that had been on our list for consideration for some time that we were considering. We also added extra service into Long Beach by adding a Maui connection, and that was really a follow-through of a lot of our 321 initiatives over the last several years of adding extra lines on our route map between points that we already served. One of the challenges we think about how to take advantage of the aircraft availability we have and crew availability we have while we are waiting for the eventual international recovery that we're very enthusiastic about is we want to be careful about not adding a lot of new cities for which we're not going to be able to serve them when we want our aircraft to swing back into markets like Tokyo that are obviously core to our fleet in Osaka and Seoul. And so we're trying to balance the desire to take advantage of near-term opportunities and chase a little bit incremental revenue in the short term, but not incurring those long-term start-up costs associated with new cities. And so we've done a couple. But more so, I think if we were doing something short term, we would probably be thinking more about points that are already on the network.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I think it would be kind of potential upgrades to some markets that were 321s. We've done some of that this summer. We had a few markets where we were planning on operating 321s. We looked at the economics, thought it would be sensible to fly some 330s in their stead. So we've done that. We'll continue to kind of revisit those into the fall as well as what Peter mentioned in terms of connecting existing dots more efficiently.\nHelane Becker: That's really helpful. The other question I had was on fuel on the West Coast. Or I don't think you fly into any airports that aren't served by pipeline. But are you having any issues getting fuel on the West Coast?\nPeter Ingram: We're not having any issues at this point with fuel supply.\nHelane Becker: Yes. Okay. Yes. And then my last question is related to Ohana by Hawaiian. I saw the $9 million -- maybe, Shannon, this is for you. I saw the $9 million charge and a $2.6 million impact from the termination of the CPA agreement. Is there any meaningful revenue impact we should think about as we think about modeling first quarter of next year, which is far away, I know. But just sort of thinking about the impact on revenue from the shutdown of that if it's not...\nShannon Okinaka: So Helane, I'm going to pass it over to Brent to talk about the revenue impact. But really, we haven't been flying Ohana by Hawaiian for a while.\nBrent Overbeek: And while Ohana was an important part from a network perspective to be able to connect all the major islands within the chain, it was not a significant portion of our overall Neighbor Island revenue portfolio. I mean, we had what amounted to call it about 7 ATR round trips a day total between the markets of Lana'i and Moloka'i to Honolulu. So from a revenue modeling perspective, I wouldn't expect a material impact to that going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Shannon, can you just talk to kind of when you think you get capacity, whenever that is capacity back to 2019 levels where you see CASM ex falling?\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Joe. We've had costs moving in different directions. But as we've modeled it, -- once we get back to 2019 capacity in a normal operating mode, we expect our CASM ex to be very close, similar or same to 2019. What we haven't quite finished doing is modeling and figuring out our exact 787 transition funds. So that part hasn't been factored in. But we expect our CASM to be at 2019 levels when our capacity is the same.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Great. And then maybe a question for Peter or Brent. I would imagine that the vast majority of your credit cardholders are either Hawaiian residents or living on the West Coast and not much on the international side. When you all do route profitability and allocate earnings from that to the routes, I mean how impactful of a variable is that in terms of helping domestic or North America profitability and kind of hurting how profitable the international side is for you all?\nPeter Ingram: Sure. Let me start on that, and then we've also got Avi Mannis in the room, and he may want to add some comments or Brent. But you're right, our portfolio, our primary credit card portfolio is a U.S. issued credit card. So the main geographies are the Western U.S. and Hawaii for the residents of folks in those programs. We have -- when we -- we do actually have a credit card that we issue in -- that is issued in Japan on which we have a co-brand relationship. It is a much, much smaller endeavor than our domestic credit card. The sort of -- speaking more broadly than just credit card, we have more frequent flyer members travel on our either interisland flights or our flights to the U.S. mainland than we do on our international flights. And as we assess the revenue performance and the profitability performance of those routes to the extent that people are using mileage awards on those flights, there is revenue allocation that we make to account for that. So it's just -- in essence, you can think of it as revenue is still getting attributed to those routes, but with a different form of payment than cash.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And maybe just another one on co-brand. Peter, I think you said by the end of the quarter, spend was back to where it was or better than it was in '19. I would guess that the T&E spend on the card is still meaningfully lower and maybe that has to do with changes in customer spending patterns. But can you just speak to that? How big is T&E typically on the portfolio? And what does that suggest for I don't know, the spend on the card once T&E actually comes back?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. We definitely -- when we looked at the spend on the current, it was fairly dramatically different at times last year. And I think things have largely normalized. But Avi, you're probably closer to that on a day-to-day basis than I am.\nAvi Mannis: Yes, I think we are seeing the category mix start to normalize spend overall is looking very good and acquisition is looking very good. So certainly, we saw a shift in the mix over the last year, but we see it kind of moving as we're seeing a lot of our other customer behavior moving back where it was.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna International Group.\nChrisStathoulopoulos: So Peter, could you give us some more color on the -- these various revenue and product initiatives that you alluded to in your opening remarks?\nPeter Ingram: You're talking about some of the things we're doing on the customer side. I think some of it is on the facilities front where we are continuing to make sure we improve our guest experience, particularly in Hawaii. We've got the new gates that we expect to come on in the next couple of months that are going to change our experience. We're going to be -- in the next several months we're going to be relocating to new gates in Los Angeles that will free up some opportunities and provide some benefits for our travelers. We've made changes to eliminate the expiration of miles in our loyalty program. We're continuing to work on a number of innovation, some of which we haven't announced with in terms of our product and portfolio around tickets. And so there's a variety of things, not all of which we have publicly disclosed yet, and this wouldn't be the right forum to do that. But I think it is broadly under the focus of wanting to make sure we are a great airline from the perspective of hospitality and service and putting the guests at the center of everything that we do because we do think that, that is a key differentiator, and we've got the right products and service to win the Hawaii traveler.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay. And then, Shannon, you mentioned that you might be temporarily overstaffed in the second half if demand doesn't pick up as expected. Could you help us frame which labor or headcount categories that would come from? And then also, how should we think about labor productivity and full recovery specifically ASMs per FTE relative to 2019 on a full ASM base relative to 2019, could you run the network at 2 or 3 or perhaps 5% FTEs per ASM?\nShannon Okinaka: Great. Thanks, Chris. Yes, from the potential near-term surplus of labor if international doesn't come back, it's primarily pilots. They've got a long training horizon. So we need to kind of plan that out months in advance of when we think we need them. So if we don't really hit the mark in that late fourth quarter time period, we could have some surplus pilots. We've been managing some of that with all of our labor groups throughout the pandemic through short-term voluntary leaves and things like that. And we've been pretty successful. So we're not that concerned. We think as we get closer to knowing when international comes back, we can try and mitigate some of that surplus. From a long-term perspective, obviously, we're very focused on labor productivity. I don't have an exact comparison in my head on what labor productivity will be when we're fully back in operation with full capacity versus where we are now. But we've implemented a lot of initiatives technology-wise, just process improvement wise and also with our unions and our contract negotiations. Obviously, rates -- labor rates continue to go up. And frankly, we want to pay people what -- a fair wage. But we also are working very heavily with the unions on efficiency and productivity and things like crew complement. So -- and that's the way we fight or mitigate against the inflationary pressures of the wage rates. So I'm really sorry, I don't have a number comparison for you. But I think from a productivity standpoint, we're definitely going to be more productive going forward than where we are now.\nPeter Ingram: And Chris, just to clarify a little bit where we are right now. I would say -- I'm going to talk about everyone besides pilots and then pilots. For everyone besides pilots, I would not characterize where we are as overstaffed right now. We're able to fine-tune it fairly well. And in fact, on our ground operations, we're definitely in hiring mode. With pilots -- we are -- where we are is really spending a disproportionate amount right now on training to get people positioned in the right seat and fleet for the recovery. So it's -- overstaffed is probably the wrong way to characterize it. It's a little bit more of a disproportionate emphasis on training, which doesn't generate as much revenue as flying, but it's still very important as part of making sure we're prepared to be in the right place when the revenue opportunities are there in 2022.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global Securities.\nDanMcKenzie: A couple of questions here. If you can just remind us prepandemic, how far along or how far down the road you got with basic economy? And how far down the road you got with premium revenue? And I guess where I'm going with that is we spool up in 2022, is there more upside in those initiatives?\nPeter Ingram: So yes, Dan, so we had rolled out basic economy in North America or in our domestic markets or really North America in the latter part of 2019. So that was kind of spooling in as we were working our way through the start of the pandemic there in 1Q, and that's fully implemented and we continue to work on that product. And we continue to kind of understand, we're now in a place too where we can continue to understand how that's -- how customer behavior is changing around that product, how do we tweak and optimize and change that? And what does that mean going forward? So I'm encouraged with what we're seeing there. It's an important tool that we've got to compete in the market, particularly given some of the price points that we've seen out there, and we'll continue to work and optimize it. As you mentioned on the premium side, that's a great differentiator for us, and that's just a part of the business where we've seen a lot of strength. And frankly, the team had invested a fair amount of effort and time even before the pandemic on how do we continue to see improved performance there. We've talked about at previous Investor Days. We won a really high paid first-class load factors, certainly well, well above the industry and well above our competitors. And how do we continue to kind of push the envelope, really more on improving yields in the cabin because frankly, we just don't have that much extra space given our existing layouts. And so I'm really encouraged with the foundation the team's laid over the last 18 months and we're starting to reap some of the benefits of that in the second half of this year.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. So I guess I don't quite understand how far along you got on the premium story for just using baseball innings here, did you -- is it sort of second inning in that premium story, the fifth inning? I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of what upside there is? And where I'm going with both of these questions is whether the thought is these are initiatives that can potentially partially backfill or fully backfilled some of the competitive challenges you may be seeing elsewhere across the network.\nPeter Ingram: So I would say on a relative basis, basic is probably closer to the earlier part of the game. And on the premium side, I think we're probably in the middle innings. We've done some things to really improve performance there, but I think there's certainly more that we can do as we think about that. And as we think about products like Extra Comfort and optimization of that product, I think we're -- we've got a long ways to go to be able to improve that as well. So I would say, overall, in terms of premium, we're probably closer to the middle innings there.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand it back to Peter Ingram for closing remarks.\nPeter Ingram: Hello again, to everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and look forward to updating you on our progress again in a few months. Aloha.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Aloha, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. Our first quarter performance exceeded what we were expecting when we last talked to you at the end of January. More so than any time in the past year, we experienced the quarter with more rays of sunshine and dark clouds. At the time of our fourth quarter 2020 financial release, our outlook was depressed by sluggish bookings at the end - in early January, which in a typical year, is the peak period for first half sales. What we didn't know then is that we were on the cusp of a positive turn. As virus case counts in the US crested in mid-January even before the pace of vaccinations accelerated, we saw material improvement in bookings for our North America routes. Week by week for the rest of the quarter, the bookings pace continued to accelerate. Neighbor Island bookings also improved, although not as much relative to pre-pandemic levels as North America. If there was any doubt that there is pent up demand for leisure travel after a year of lockdowns that doubt has now been dispelled. Despite the positive evolution of the quarter, our financial performance remains dramatically affected by the pandemic. January results remained significantly depressed especially after the end of the holiday travel period. February was better, but only benefited a bit from the demand improvement that became apparent at the end of January. March was notably better, so much so then nearly half our passenger revenue for the quarter was recorded in the final month. Well, we aren't back to where we were pre-pandemic it feels like we are out of the ditch and back on the highway. Through this period, we made progress on our objectives for 2021, rebuilding our network to drive revenue, reducing our cash burn and strengthening our balance sheet. There is more work to be done. But we are proud of our progress. We continue to rebuild our network with the launch of four new North America routes over the past several weeks. We made important progress on reducing our cash burn and reached a milestone in March achieving positive operating cash flows for the month. We address any lingering skepticism about our near-term liquidity by bolstering our balance sheet through our at the market equity offering and a $1.2 billion debt financing backed by our loyalty program cash flows and brand assets. With $2.1 billion in liquidity, we are no longer actively looking to raise capital. Our Treasury team has done a remarkable job over the past year, and we are confident we have the liquidity to withstand whatever remains of this crisis. As I look out to the second quarter, I'm optimistic about our continued recovery in North America. Bookings have recovered and remain strong. Our booking curve is lengthening as travelers become more confident and demand looks much more like pre-pandemic normal. After a year of staying cooped up at home, our guests are ready to travel. Our Neighbor Island business is lagging North America in its recovery trajectory. The requirement to obtain an expensive COVID-19 test to avoid 10-day quarantine on short Neighbor Island flights continues to inhibit demand. With lowercase counts and positivity rates than when travel restrictions were imposed, it is time for the state of Hawaii to remove pre-travel testing requirements on trips within the state. For now, we will take some comfort in the continued evolution of the Safe Travels program, which will soon allow Hawaii residents to travel between the islands without testing or quarantine if they have been fully vaccinated in Hawaii. Our International Business remained substantially dormant, with strong cargo demand allowing us to maintain minimal service to Japan and Korea. Recovery of our international business remains the biggest wildcard in our return to something that better resembles the old normal. North America is well on the way to recovery. Neighbor Island has improved and will recover substantially when testing requirements are lifted although the timing of this is not in our hands. The path to recovery on our international business remains less certain. Restrictions are persisting longer than we had anticipated, especially as the pace of vaccination lags what we have seen at home. We are optimistic however, that the rapid recovery in demand in North America is a harbinger of strong demand recovery in our international markets as cross border travel becomes a realistic proposition again. We think this will especially be the case in Japan, where the affinity for travel to Hawaii is extraordinarily high. In the meantime, we remain focused on managing what we can control, being disciplined about bringing costs back into the business, setting the foundation for future growth and rebuilding and serving our guests with signature Hawaiian hospitality. The first quarter has been an enormous turning point in our recovery. And we were excited to once again be charting a path to excellence for our guests, our employees, and our investors. I would be remiss if I didn't once again thank our team for their exemplary contributions through this extraordinary period. Amidst the uncertainty of the past year, they have remained steadfast in the pursuit of our purpose to connect people with Aloha, even as the pandemic keeps us more separated than any of us wants. I'm gratified that we are now at a point where we are calling back increasing numbers of our colleagues from voluntary leaves as our business comes closer to full recovery. Let me now turn the call over to Brent to give you more details on our commercial performance and outlook.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter, and Aloha everyone. I'd like to echo Peter's gratitude to the entire team once again this quarter. They've done a fantastic job taking care of our guests and each other as we build back our airline. Our first quarter revenue performance was better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. As we saw a sharp rebound in posting demand in North America and the back half of the quarter. Total Revenue was down 72% compared to the first quarter of 2019 at the favorable end of our updated guidance on a 49% decline in capacity. Passenger revenue was down 77% year-over-two, while other revenue was down only about 19%, driven by continued strong performance in cargo and loyalty. While our sequential improvement in first quarter revenue performance was encouraging in and of itself, the events of the quarter marked an important inflection point for North American business, and pointed to continued progress and improvement for the remainder of the year. During the quarter, we continue to rebuild our North American network, adding frequency back into markets we previously served and launching service and three new routes including nonstop service from Ontario, California and Orlando to Honolulu and from Long Beach to Maui. From a traffic perspective, load factors that were languishing in the low 30s in January, doubled to the low 60s by March. And finally after a disappointingly slow start of the year with booking activity. We saw material acceleration in February, with bookings at roughly 80% of 2019 levels for travel in the second quarter. We saw another step change during the month of March, and they've been running at over 110% of 2019 booking levels since then. Unlike previous quarters during the pandemic, we've seen guest confidence and travel extending further resulting in appreciably strengthening booking activity for the latter half of the year as well. As such, our current book load factor for both the third and the fourth quarter of this year are now at or above 2019 levels. As we move into the second quarter, we welcomed Austin into our network last week. And we're bringing back Las Vegas to Maui in late May at which point we'll have all of our pre-pandemic routes back up and running. Finally, we'll launch four times weekly seasonal service in Phoenix Maui late next month, and adding it all up by June we'll be flying in North American network that is larger than our 2019 capacity. In the Neighbor Island market, the quarantine and pre-travel testing requirement continued to curtail demand. As we progress through the year, we've seen an uptick in traffic driven by North American connections and a moderate increase in local travel. In the first quarter, we operate at about 38% of our 2019 schedule and we expect to operate about 60% in the second quarter. The sequential increase is driven by an increase in capacity to Kauai as Kauai County re-entered the Safe Travels program in early April, as well as incremental frequencies across the geography to accommodate the increase in demand primarily from connecting traffic. As Peter mentioned in his comments last week, the State of Hawaii announced that Hawaii residents who have been vaccinated in the State will be able to use their vaccination card to bypass quarantine for travel within the state effective May 11. While it's still as early, we've seen a moderate uptick in booking activity for the back half of the second quarter since the announcement. But we believe further liberalization of travel within the state for all travelers is warranted necessary for demand to return to pre-pandemic levels. Regarding International, we operated only 12% of our 2019 schedule in the first quarter, and we expect to operate a similar level in the second quarter as we remain in an environment with strong cargo performance and weak passenger demand. We're continuing to operate with limited service to Tokyo, Narita, Osaka and Seoul, but temporarily suspended our service to Tokyo Haneda and consolidated our Tokyo operation at Narita for the time being. At this point, it's not clear when restrictions will be lifted in Japan. But we strongly believe there's pent up demand, and we should see increased booking activity once travel restrictions are eased in Japan. All other international remains insignificant from a capacity perspective as demand is hampered by travel restrictions and the prevalence of the disease in origination countries. If we roll all that up, we anticipate the second quarter system capacity will be down about 30% to 33% and that system revenue will be down between 45% to 50%, compared to 2019. Looking further ahead, we are maintaining or summer 2021 planning assumption of operating about 75% to 85% of our 2019 capacity at a system level. Well, this has been our assumption for several quarters now. The composition is a little different from what we originally anticipated, with more North America flying based on the strength of demand in that market, and less international given the continuing restrictions that abound internationally. Overall, we're optimistic about the future and encouraged by the signs of recovery in North America. While the timing of the recovery in our other geographies is still uncertain, our experience with the rebound in North America gives us confidence that we should see similar signs of pent-up demand in those geographies once restrictions are lifted. As we emerge from the crisis, we're continuing to think about how we adapt our policies and services to better meet the needs of our guests. We've eliminated fees and policies that are limited economic value and serve as an irritant to our customers. We eliminated change fees last year. And we recently announced that we have permanently eliminated mileage expiration for Hawaiian miles. This change will be particularly valuable to some of our less frequent guests from the mainland or international markets by providing them more flexibility and engaging with our loyalty program. Onboard, we delivered a higher standard of service to our guests, continuing to offer hot meals, unlimited beverage service in all cabins, even as our competitors were offering crackers and bottled water. We did so with great attention to safety for both guests and our employees. Beginning May 1 we'll reinstate priority boarding for elites and other groups which had been suspended to streamline boarding. And on June 1, we'll be bringing back other popular elements of our in-flight service, including snack and alcoholic beverage sales in the main cabin. We're sharing these changes with customers with humility, empathy and a commitment to earning their business as they begin to fly again. We stand well positioned to win the business with the best people, the right products to meet the needs of the Hawaii traveler. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks Bren and thanks everyone for joining us today. For the first quarter, we reported an adjusted net loss of $198.6 million or $3.85 loss per share. We closed the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, which includes the receipt of $109 million from our aftermarket equity offering, of which $68 million was raised in the first quarter, $167 billion from the PSP extension and $1.2 billion in proceeds from the loyalty bond private placements that we announced on our last call. This figure also reflects the repayment of our $45 million CARES Act ERP loan as well as our $235 million revolver. With our current $2.1 billion in liquidity, which includes our now undrawn revolving credit facility, we're confident we have the funds to weather the remaining period of uncertainty as the pandemic winds down. Furthermore, last week we received an additional $25 million of top up funds from PSP2 and $19 million from PSP3, with another 90 million expected later in the second quarter. We are no longer actively looking to raise capital, and have shifted our focus to strengthening our balance sheet over the long-term. While we are not yet ready to discuss updated leverage and cash targets, we know we will be building a long-term plan as there are limited opportunities for near term delevering that make economic sense. While, we have significantly increased our debt balance over the past year, our adjusted net debt is only $35 million higher than the balance as of December 31, 2019. Adjusted net debt includes debt, finance lease obligations, and seven times operating lease balances, offset by unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Although our higher cash balance will incur greater carrying costs, we believe it is appropriate in the near-term. Having said that, we are encouraged by the improving market conditions which are moving us closer to the return of consistently positive free cash flow. For the first quarter, our total operating expenses excluding special items were down about 33% compared to the first quarter of 2019 on a 49% decline in capacity, in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. While our fuel expense was higher than expected, it was more than offset by some favorability across various other cost categories. We expect our second quarter total operating costs, excluding special items to be down about 20% to 24%, compared to the second quarter of 2019 on 30% to 33% lower capacity. The sequential increase in costs compared to the first quarter of 2021 is driven by the variable costs associated with operating a bigger schedule. We remain committed to being cost competitive, even as we face areas of cost pressures such as airport costs. Having completed our fleet simplification initiatives before the pandemic, mainly the retirements of our 767s, our recent focus has been on fixed cost improvement in areas such as maintenance, planning and scheduling, to reduce heavy check time and cost. And last fall, we reduced management and administrative positions by 14%. Although not as evident when doing less flying, we've also reduced our variable costs, which will allow us to grow back our network more cost efficiently, including labor savings from important work roll improvements for our flight attendants, and process and technology improvements for airport staff. Although there will be a disparate impact on our unit costs, as the timing of bringing back certain parts of our network will vary. Given the same entity mix, we believe our unit costs excluding fuel would be roughly in line with 2019 levels if our network was fully restored. Our first quarter daily cash burn was $1.0 million, which was favorable to our original as well as our updated expectations primarily due to higher net sales. Our net sales for the quarter totaled $4.2 million per day, exceeding expectations due to the strength in North America bookings that Brent discussed. As a reminder, in addition to operating cash flows, our cash burn figures include debt service, interest payments, tax refund inflows, and CapEx and severance payments, but exclude CARES Act and other new financing as well as the repayments of our CARES ACT ERP loan and revolver. As Peter mentioned, we reached an important milestone in March when our operating cash flows or net sales less our operating cash outflows turned positive. Net sales are expected to maintain these improved levels as we continue to recover North America. And we should see another step change in net sales when our other geographies open up. Going forward, we're shifting our focus and guidance about the P&L metrics as we're satisfied that we have sufficient cash to carry us through to the point when we are generating consistent free cash flow. And our decision making will focus on returning to positive profitability and providing the foundation for long-term shareholder returns. As we move away from discussing daily cash burn, we believe adjusted EBITDAR will be a better metric to gauge our performances through the remainder of this recovery. We expect our adjusted EBITDAR to improve from negative 152 million in the first quarter to a range of negative 70 million to negative 20 million in the second quarter. On our current trajectory, we see a path to positive EBITDAR later this year, even when assuming minimal recovery of our international business. However, achieving positive pre-tax or net income will require a more substantial recovery both in our Neighbor Island and our international, particularly Japan geographies, which is unsurprising since Neighbor Island and international flying combined, represented over 45% of our revenue pre-pandemic. Although the timing is difficult to predict, given the uncertainty surrounding government travel restrictions, we are ready to restore our network and serve our guests in those markets as soon as we are permitted to do so. While the pandemic is not over, the crisis has substantially subdued and we're encouraged by our positive trajectory. We're focused on rebuilding our network and making investments that are in the best interest of the long-term profitability of our business. And with that, we can open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nHunter Keay: Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my question today.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks Peter.\nHunter Keay: So - hey Peter, how are you doing? So after your bankruptcy earlier this decade and after the GFC you guys decided that you needed to diversify a little bit and you did. You got bigger in Japan. You got smaller in the South Pacific. But now it seems like a lot of airlines out there globally these days are kind of just sitting around hoping that things go back to the way that they were sort of pre-COVID. Are you one of those airlines that are kind of hoping things go back to the way they were? Or do you see this crisis as a good reason to maybe overhaul something strategically like you did last time?\nPeter Ingram: Yeah, just to correct one part of the question. The bankruptcy was closer to 20 years ago than in the last decade. It was in 2000 and -\nHunter Keay: I meant century. I know it was my mistake. I'm losing track of time. But yeah, my mistake, you get the point. It was really after the GFC was whether the overall really occurred, I guess. So you get the question.\nPeter Ingram: Sure. And I think we had some things in motion. Even before that point with the fleet decision on the A330 to hundreds it was really positioning ourselves for more international. I think broadly speaking when the next 12 to maybe 18 months, I wouldn't expect anything dramatic, more evolution than revolution. But I think our business and our industry is going to continue to evolve. And we have to anticipate where things are going and position ourselves where we can be successful. I don't have any specific plans, obviously to announce them in that regard today. But we're continuing to look at a variety of options that are out there for us and I'm sure we're going to continue to adapt and evolve our business to position ourselves for success long-term. What I do think - where I do think we are particularly positioned well right now, though, is that even before the pandemic where we've seen leisure come back stronger than business and quicker than business travel. That's a continuation of a long-term trend where leisure travel has been growing very well. And I think we're particularly well positioned here with a premium quality of service and an approach to taking care of our guests that positions us well, for the continued evolution of the industry.\nHunter Keay: Okay, well, that's fair. And your ATL was back up to 690 million or so if I'm not mistaken, which is pretty much where it was in 1Q '18 and 1Q '19. But your capacity was still down 30%. I know that you said that's - June, you're going to be up, I think you said, but are you just booking way further out than normal? Have you locked in some really strong yields? Am I ever going to see like 90% load factors? How is that going to manifest itself those two metrics together? Thanks.\nPeter Ingram: Yeah. So maybe I'll start and then see if Brent or Shannon want to embellish a little bit. I think right now, as Brent said in his comments North America is booking out very similar to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. For the third quarter the bookings are basically in line. Second quarter, we're still a little bit below. I think what you see reflected in the ATL and why the balance may be a little higher, even though the international bookings are not there is we're still carrying some bookings for trips that were not flown from 2020, even though that balance has been working down as some of that rebooks and will continue to work down over time. And so you've got that that is at a higher level than what you would have seen before the pandemic, whereas you don't have the international advanced book in there. And those are largely offsetting I think and that's what you're observing in the ATL numbers.\nHunter Keay: Great. Yeah. All right, Peter. Thanks a lot.\nBrent Overbeek: Yeah, I think -\nHunter Keay: Yeah, go ahead.\nBrent Overbeek: No, to follow on to Peter's comments we have seen really the last, I'd say kind of eight to 10 weeks, we've seen tremendous strength across North America. And we've kind of hit a consistent intake of bookings that have been above 2019 levels for 2Q, 3Q and 4Q. As I mentioned, we've kind of close the gap from historical load factor for the back part of the year. And average fares in those periods have been more aligned. And frankly, average fares in the second quarter have continued to improve as we've moved through the period as well that have helped strengthen ATL.\nHunter Keay: Thank you, Brent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Maybe just a question on network given that I think to quote you guys, it's the biggest wildcard with internationals going to come back. Are you looking at shorter term markets where you could deploy your A330s? You know, I saw that some of your new routes to Orlando and Austin are using these aircraft. But I guess any short-term opportunities to deploy those aircraft just given the North America strength or do not like kind of quick or tactical in and out of market. Any color would be helpful.\nBrent Overbeek: Sure. Well, Cathy I think we actually already have taken advantage of some of that, as we alluded to in some of our prepared remarks. We've shifted gears a little bit with less international flying than we've planned in a bigger North American network than we had planned some of the changes that we've announced for the summer. We've made some up gauges for the summer on some 321 routes that will be flying us 330s. And we've also entered some stuff, seasonally for the summer that we might not have had the luxury to do before. So I think we're well positioned for the summer, and they have a really strong summer here in North America, we'll continue to look at that and assess the pace at which international is likely to come back. And how does that fit into our fleet and crew capabilities as we move in the fall and take advantage of that in the latter half of the year as well.\nPeter Ingram: And that I think Brent and the network planning team have also been very nimble over the course of the last year, looking for some opportunities in the charter market that we wouldn't have focused on as much before. Looking at flying cargo only flights with our aircraft, some of that activity is going to wane a little bit now as we have restored much more of our schedule, but to the extent we have availability of aircraft in the back half of the year, we still got the ability to look at those things as well.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it, so people getting spoiled on these life light 330s at least for this summer and then one more kind of I guess network type question. Maybe this is tough to fully derive in terms of just contract tracing, but are you able to pull out what proportion roughly of your interisland traffic was historically driven by international travelers, just thinking about this as the majority of your international flights do arrive in Honolulu. Thanks\nPeter Ingram: Yeah, international connecting traffic and Neighbor island was kind of mid to high single digits in terms of percentage of traffic. I think overall, if we look at our portfolio of connecting traffic, that was around 30% overall, which is a mix of our own online connecting stuff, domestically, and then as well as some of our partners and then a component of international as I mentioned, there.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi, everybody. Hope you guys are doing well. As you're thinking about these bookings that are coming in, they're 110% I think of 2019 levels is what you said. How are you - how are the yields on those? And I ask because you have a lot of new markets interspersed with markets that you're going back into. And I'm wondering if you have to be very promotional in some of those markets.\nPeter Ingram: So Helane I think since the last time we talked, we've certainly seen some improvement in the pricing environment. We still see some sale activity for the spring albeit those levels have clearly improved from where they were at. I think the probably the biggest change that we've seen has been just the progression in our ability to inventory managed flights. So when we're running load factors in the 30s, and 40s, and 50s. The revenue management side of my team is an extraordinarily busy, the pricing team is busy, but the RM team not so much. That has clearly moved forward and we've become a lot more active in that space. And so, really over the last I'll say four to five weeks, we've seen some continued progress in that. Furthermore, one area that we didn't include in our prepared remarks that's done - that we're seeing a good amount of strength is in our front cabin. That business has comeback exceedingly strong. And it's an area both on the pricing and the inventory side that we're going to push hard on and I think we'll come closer to 2019 levels and maybe even exceed some of our 2019 RASM levels in the front cabin as folks have had some money - some folks have some money pent up from the quarantine and are clearly interested in a higher end experience. And we look forward to delivering that. In terms of new markets, we've had to do a little bit of promotional pricing to get our name out in some of the select markets, so in places where our name is a little less known. Notably, in Austin and Orlando, we've done a little bit more promotional activity than we've had to do in places like Long Beach and Ontario, where our brand is well known on the West Coast. But overall, we're encouraged with how both booking and fare levels have come in those markets as well.\nHelane Becker: That's great. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow up question is, are you thinking about this from the perspective of people are travelling to Hawaii because they can't travel overseas? And so there's all this demand for Hawaii and you guys are like in the way, right. You're just there you have the capacity and so on. And then as international opens at some point in the next, I don't know when, but just a year or two. Are you thinking that you shift this capacity back to international? Or are you thinking, hey, this is working really well in North America to Hawaii. So let's just go out and buy more planes and do internationalize and add on, how are you thinking about that dynamic? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Sure. So - yeah, thanks Helane. And I'm glad to see you're travelling again now as well. Welcome back to the tide. I think the way I would put it people are travelling to Hawaii because they love travelling to Hawaii. And so I don't think it is because all of a sudden Hawaii became the alternative when they couldn't do what they wanted. What they've wanted to do for the past year is travel to Hawaii. And they were waiting until they could. And so I think that's what we're seeing. We do have a little bit more capacity in North America this summer than we did before the pandemic, but it is more on the margin than a sort of seismic shift of activity from - based on airplanes that were flying International. So I think we will largely be able to restore our international flying as demand opportunities improve. And to the extent we are having to choose where to put scarce aircraft capacity that's a high-class problem relative to some of the things we've been working on for the last 13 months.\nHelane Becker: Thank you. Okay, thanks very much. That's really helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Denardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph Denardi: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Brent, just kind of following up on Helane's question a little bit, it looks like your second quarter North American capacity is going to be pretty close to where it was pre-COVID. It looks like industry capacity is maybe up a few points. But what are your expectations for your North America PRASM in 2Q kind of as a result of those dynamics?\nBrent Overbeek: Yeah, well, Joe, we're not giving guidance at the geography level. I will say we expect to see continued progress relative to historical norms as we move throughout the quarter. And April will be okay, May, load factor will be better, average fare will be a little bit better on historical terms, anticipate continued progress in June. And then, as we get out to the latter part of the year, I anticipate that continuing to narrow. So not ready to give guidance there. But we continue to see material progress both on the traffic side and on the yield side as we move through the latter part of this quarter and into the third quarter.\nJoseph Denardi: Okay and then Peter, can you just talk a little bit about kind of confidence in Hawaii's ability to digest all of this demand or kind of the demand that's coming or any concerns from a labor standpoint or hotel capacity that sort of thing that that gives you pause, or No?\nPeter Ingram: In the short term, I don't think we're budding up against any hard capacity constraints. I think, in the first quarter as we saw demand inflect positively, very quickly, I think there may have been a little bit of a lag in some of the response to bring hotel capacity back on, I think there is - it was initially some hesitancy having seen fits and starts over the course of the past year to say, do we really want to be bringing capacity back on, bringing people back to do work in the hotels and other travel businesses not knowing if things were going to be sustained. I think there's a lot of confidence that things are being sustained right now. So I think we've got the capacity. There are a couple of things that I think are going to be more transitory, like rental cars are unavailable because of some overcorrection in inventory in that part of the business, but those are the sorts of constraints that work themselves back out. I think one of the things that I do have some concerns about and we continue to work with our partners at the State Department of Transportation on is with the Safe Travels process and the verification of test results and looking forward on Neighbor Island and perhaps following that on North America of vaccination results, just making sure we are working to process people through the airports efficiently. And so that that doesn't become a bottleneck is something that we remain concerned about. I think it is very solvable. But it is something we want to make sure that our partners in the system are keeping a focus on the guest experience as we continue to evolve going forward.\nJoseph Denardi: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg, with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Linenberg: Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Peter is there - with the PCR testing requirement in place, is there any move - anything behind the scenes high level that goes away maybe sometime this summer? And I'm just sort of mentioning it in the context that it seems like I'm hearing by Memorial Day, most - any sort of quarantine restrictions in the lower 48 should be over with. And so I'm curious if this summer we're going to see some movement on that? Or is - are you just working under the assumption that that testing requirement will be there through summer? And as peak demand hit like you said on the earlier question to Joe, you'll just have to - the airports will have to have the appropriate personnel to just deal with being able to check those people as they come in.\nPeter Ingram: Yeah. Thanks Mike. It's a good question. I think we're anticipating that some of these restrictions will continue to evolve over time. I think it goes without saying, having been under the strictest quarantine in the country in the second quarter and the third quarter last year that the government officials in Hawaii have taken a very cautious approach throughout the pandemic, especially with regards to travel. And so I think some of those restrictions may linger or some of those limitations may linger a little bit longer than we think. We're encouraged that we're making a step with allowing vaccines to replace testing for Neighbor Island travel going forward. There has been a suggestion and I think it is likely to happen that for North American travelers that that flexibility will be offered at some point, although we don't have a date certain on that yet. And I continue to advocate that the testing requirements on the Neighbor Island side should be lifted in the near term. And I'm hopeful that that's going to happen sometime this summer. Candidly, with North America, positivity rates and case numbers going down broadly and particularly in key places like California, it is going to present an argument that we should consider that sooner rather than later for travel from North America as well. So we'll continue to work with the state on that. Obviously, I can offer no assurances of what decisions will be made and when, but we're going to continue to work to try and let the restrictions when it's appropriate for the safety of our community.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then, I guess a question to Brent, when I think about interisland or Neighbor Island travel, you versus the competition, did you see any sort of evolution in share over the period. And I'm really trying to get at the fact that there were times where the competition in some markets basically that went to a skilled schedule or disappeared, you guys continued to maintain service, as the hometown carrier, you obviously employ a lot of people who live in the state, typically you'd see people rally around the local carrier and be supportive of the local carrier, anything that you saw through over time, and maybe some permanent gains through this process?\nBrent Overbeek: Well, I think it was obviously a - not only did our competitor pull down their schedule, we had a materially different schedule than what we'll have as we build that network and continue to strengthen there. I think our load factors were certainly impaired during that time period. And I think you can go look at the DOT stats and see how we performed on a relative basis relative to the other competitor in that market, but I'm not sure that that's a great indication going forward. But certainly, we believe that being the hometown carrier, having the right product, the best schedule, depth of service and breadth of market, I think we stand well positioned to succeed as that market comes back. And we certainly look forward to coming back later this quarter and into the back half of the year.\nMike Linenberg: Great, thanks and just if I could squeeze in a one on the fuel Shannon, the $1.75, is there an embedded hedge gate in there? What is your hedging position if yes?\nShannon Okinaka: Hi, Mike. Yeah, we hardly have any hedges right now. We just had a hard time last year forecasting our fuel consumption volumes, so I think there might be a little bit I don't even remember it. I think it was a gain, but it's really, really small, because we don't have very many hedges on the books right now.\nMike Linenberg: Okay, very good. Thank you.\nBrent Overbeek: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a lot of Dan McKenzie - Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, thanks guys. A couple of questions here, I'm just wondering if you can share where the conversations are at with respect to a travel passport. So we are seeing the EU embrace the idea of a passport, but I'm really not sure what's happening on the Pacific entity. And I'm just wondering are those talks ultimately going to be led by the DOT at the federal level? Or is that something that has to happen at the state level? And how are you guys involved with those potential talks?\nBrent Overbeek: So there's a variety of discussions going on globally. IADA has been working on this. Ultimately, one of the important building blocks that isn't in place consistency is government authorities need to set the policy standards. And that has been a moving target and jurisdictions, including here in Hawaii continue to have different requirements. And so that makes some of that evolution challenging and creates an environment where it's difficult for the private sector providers to really know what product they're building. Here in Hawaii, there have been a couple of pilot projects, including ones which we've been participating with common pass and clear to, to develop a digital authentication platform with the Safe Travels policies embedded in that. Those developments are ongoing, and we're continuing to work on those, but I don't have an ability to tell you today, when that is going to be in place and how it's going to be. I think it does go to the notion for as long as we do have either testing requirements or vaccines proof as an alternative to that having some way to electronically validate that is helpful to the guest experience in terms of processing people when they get in the airport. So we certainly encourage that and want to participate in any way we can. But we don't control the entire infrastructure.\nDan McKenzie: Okay, so is it - I guess, at this point, with respect to Japan is there any other specific, I guess, commentary going on or discussions going on with respect to that? I'm just wondering if you can kind of elaborate a little bit more on the country level here.\nBrent Overbeek: Sure. Yeah. Well, let me talk about Japan in particular. I mean, Japan and Korea are already part of the Hawaii Safe Travels program. So people arriving from Japan and Korea today and do today arrive with a test from an approved testing provider. And there is a network of those available in both of those countries. And that's been in place for some time. The bigger challenge we have candidly with travel to Japan and Korea where demand is being impeded. And I'll talk specifically about Japan, is the restrictions on the other end of the route from the Japanese authorities. And so in addition to needing to get a test to travel to Hawaii, someone returning to Japan would have to get a test before they leave Hawaii and another test after arrival. So now you're talking about three different tests, potentially some quarantine or stay at home restrictions on top of that. And just this past week, as they're struggling with the spread of the virus, some of the major cities in Japan, including Tokyo have moved back to significant lockdown restrictions and emergency declaration. So it's really less a case of the policies and procedures needing to be in place in Hawaii and more of a case of some of the challenges in the other home countries that we serve. That are - or why we say the timing of international as a wildcard. I think our optimism that international is going to come back strong is undeterred. And in fact we were encouraged by the experience we've had in North America, but the timing is a little bit difficult for us to predict right now.\nDan McKenzie: Understood, okay and then I could just squeeze one more in here for I guess Shannon. Going back to a question that's come up in the past and that's structural cost savings. And I guess with the worst of the pandemic in the rearview mirror, I'm just wondering you can share about cost of permanently commodity the operation? What that might mean for CASM ex versus 2019. I'm thinking Hawaiian has become a more efficient airline, but I'm just wondering if you can help us triangulate the dots on what that might mean exactly.\nShannon Okinaka: Yeah. Hi, Dan. Thanks. At this point, we're not really able to - we're not giving CASM guidance into the future. And the main reason for that is because our - we have three distinct entities, right, our very long haul with the International, your West Coast and your Neighbor Island. And the unit cost and the unit revenues of those entities are so different that the mix really does impact quite significantly the system averages and so things like not knowing the timing of the International return and how that mix looks against the North America plying makes it really hard for us to guide to unit costs. But yeah, we have done a lot of work on our cost structure. As I mentioned, we didn't have the real big bullets that some of the other carriers had with fleet simplification, because we had already done that. But when a lot of work stopped last year, what we were able to do was look at the costs as we brought them back to make sure that they were adding value for the airline that we now are not the airline that were two years ago. So sometimes we like to call it zero based budgeting, but sometimes you carry a lot on cost, because that's what you've done in the past. But when we stopped everything, we really did look at some things and found ways to do them better. So I mentioned maintenance, planning and scheduling. We also looked at our fleet and thought we had 20 717s and we knew that we could do the same amount of 717 flying with '19. And as we looked at things like parts cost, it made better economic sense to part out of 717. So that's what we did. We've also looked at things like in sourcing some things like purchasing or acquiring a 717 simulator. That will - right now obviously, it's hard to see the economic or financial benefits. But as we ramp up our flying again, we will definitely come back at a lower cost airline. So while I can't give you guidance, I've got a long list that we could walk through of these different types of cost categories where we've found savings.\nDan McKenzie: That's helpful. Thanks. Can you just put a big number, big round number around with all those cost savings might be without employing what that would mean for CASM?\nShannon Okinaka: No, not really, because some - a lot of them are variable, right, variable costs. And it really does - you can put numbers when you know how much you're going to fly and when you're going to fly it, but really is difficult to quantify until we know where we end up from a - when we're at a more stable point in capacity.\nDan McKenzie: Understood, thanks for the time you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow up question from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, everyone. Thanks for having me back on. It's a really quick modeling one that's actually kind of a follow up to the unit economics discussion you've had with Dan, but on the RASM side. How should we think about the impact of international being quite a bit smaller than normal going forward on RASM? Typically, you have some of your - all that all A330 driven a lot of premium seats, but also a lot of ASN. So as we go through the summer, should we - if international kind of stays in line with current levels, should we think about that actually being a boost to unit revenue or have gotten mixed up? Thanks.\nBrent Overbeek: Yeah, so if you compare, again, similar to Shannon's answer of having kind of three distinct pieces of a network in terms of short and medium and long, as we change the weighting of those and as we work through the summer, I think it'll - the pace of which Neighbor Island comes back will probably have a bigger influence on that overall. And so clearly it will have an impact, but kind of based on the uncertainty of how much will fly in Neighbor Island as we build that back will probably have a bigger influence in terms of overall unit revenue change in the second and third quarters.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, got it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris [indiscernible]. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking my question. So two here and maybe trying to get to Dan's question in a different way, but as we look at the ASM recovering granted, there's still work to do here with the return of Neighbor Island international travel. But could you help us frame or how should we think about the cadence of CASM Ex performance? And what are some of the metrics aside from that absolute number that we should be looking for? Is it something perhaps marginal cost per mile? And then just remind us on the fixed versus variable cost mix what that is in a typical steady state? And then how should we think about that as you ramp back up?\nShannon Okinaka: Yeah. Hi, Chris. Yeah, I think in general as we run backup capacity, our CASM will continue to decrease. Our fixed costs are pretty stable at this point, so really - just depending on what entity the capacity return is in, generally, the ASM additions will lower our unit costs. I don't think we're adding - like I said, it depends on the entity mix. But generally, we're not adding higher cost ASM than where we were in 2019. Our variable costs are not generally higher than where they were in 2019. It just really does depend on entity mix. From a fixed versus variable I don't have that off the top of my head as we - it's been changing, obviously over the past year. We can get back to you on some of what we said about that. But generally speaking, the percentage of fixed is decreasing relative to variable of course as we bring that flying.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. And then my follow up and I realize you may not want to give out your guidance here. But as we look at where pre-tax margins were in 2018, 2019, call it around 11.5% there on average, what do we need to think about - if you could put into buckets or weight these barriers, what we would need to see with respect to RASM appreciation and then savings from any structural cost reductions and then fuel and labor productivity. Thanks.\nPeter Ingram: Yeah. Chris, this is Peter. So Shannon said in her comments that as we see capacity overall, recover to 2019 levels, we would expect our cost - unit cost to also be in the ballpark of 2019 levels with - and that's made up of some improvements and things like the maintenance planning and the reduction in our administrative staffing, helping to offset some of the inflationary pressures that we another airline see, like areas like airport costs. Then sort of distilling that back to the margin question, the open question then becomes revenue. And I think on the revenue side we're really encouraged by the demand recovery in domestic and now that is ramping back up, and how as load factors come back to more historic levels that you can start to see an environment where yield can be managed, closer to historical levels and ultimately drive for improvements. We're not there yet in Neighbor Island, as we are getting there in North America. In international, I think the beyond the fact that we're sort of really in the starting blocks in terms of seeing any sort of recovery is the question of are we going to see any structural changes in the supply and demand makeup and the competitive sets in some of those geographies? And we internally will speculate some about what may or may not happen externally. I'm not going to speculate on that. But certainly, we're going to be in a position where we'll be looking for opportunities to drive revenue improvements in some of the international geographies as they start to come back online. So it's a little bit too early to be saying we're going to hit a pre-tax margin level of x by 2020 x. But certainly we're thinking through how some of those things can evolve, making sure we're doing what we need to be doing on the cost front and driving the revenue side as we have opportunities presented by the market.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for the time.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I'd like to hand the call back over to Peter Ingram for closing remarks.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo again to everyone for joining us today, we appreciate your interest and we look forward to updating you on our progress again in a few months.

Aloha, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We\u2019re pleased to have turned the page on a challenging and unusual 2020 and are looking forward to better days in 2021. We\u2019re optimistic about the year ahead, but realistic that recovery will not be a straight line. As you have seen in our press release today, our fourth quarter results were an improvement over the prior two quarters. But, we know that we still have a long way to go to return to where we expect to be. We took steps towards rebuilding our network, reduced our cash burn and further enhanced our liquidity. The quarter featured another extraordinary, collaborative team effort as we executed on and continued to evolve our plans in response to the pandemic. Looking back on 2020, although it was the most challenging year in the history of the airline industry, I\u2019m extremely proud of the Hawaiian Airlines team that time and again rose to the challenges we faced, created innovative solutions to navigate us through uncharted waters, and continued to deliver outstanding service and connect our guests with Aloha. It is inspiring to be a part of this team. Our Treasury team has continued to be active, ensuring that we have the liquidity to weather the coronavirus crisis, so that we may emerge strong and prepared to compete. Liquidity raising efforts include an at-the-market equity offering, through which we have added $41 million to our balance sheet so far, and today\u2019s launching of an $800 million financing of our loyalty program and brand assets. After completing this financing, we intend to pay back our initial draw of the CARES Act loan and exit that facility. Successful conclusion of these efforts will give us sufficient liquidity to weather the near-term financial uncertainties of the pandemic. Our focus now turns fully to executing commercially and operationally to return to the strong and healthy balance sheet we had pre-pandemic. Our ongoing efforts to reduce cash burn and ultimately return to cash generation from our operations position us extremely well for the unsettled days ahead and the opportunities beyond. We\u2019re also grateful to Congress and the U.S. Treasury for executing a four-month extension to the Payroll Support Program that will support our team members during this difficult time. Perhaps most importantly, during the fourth quarter, we reached an important inflection point in our business with the reopening of Hawaii to tourism on October 15th via the Safe Travels program, which gives travelers the ability to avoid quarantine with evidence of a negative COVID-19 test. It was terrific to start welcoming more guests onto our airplanes after two very quiet quarters. The good news is that the State of Hawaii\u2019s pre-travel testing program is substantially achieving its objectives. Hawaii has been able to begin rebuilding its devastated economy without travel driving a significant surge in cases. Notably, from the time of the October 15th launch of pre-travel testing through the end of the year, COVID case rates in Hawaii were flat to down slightly, even as disease prevalence on the mainland had been escalating. Since our last call, the program has been expanded to include pre-travel testing partners in Japan and Canada. And South Korea is expected to be added soon. As it became clear the testing was going to be the key to reopening Hawaii travel for the time being, we took steps to make sure that guests in the markets we serve would have access to test providers. And over the course of the past several months, we\u2019ve developed the best array of testing options in the industry for our travelers. Importantly, the key providers that Hawaiian has brought into the Safe Travels program do not offer medically necessary testing. So, their capacity has not been strained by the surge in COVID-19 cases on the U.S. mainland. As encouraged as we are by pre-travel testing, it isn\u2019t going to bring demand all the way back. Acquiring the test adds additional expense, the inconvenience adds friction to travel, the validation process at airports is cumbersome, and some travelers are going to continue to avoid venturing out for so long as the virus is amongst us. Compounding this, different rules for different islands in Hawaii creates confusion for travelers as do the changes in these rules which have continued. These inconsistencies coupled with the escalation in cases on the mainland and the conclusion of the holiday travel season, constrain our expectations for demand in the current quarter. As for Neighbor Island, it is unsurprising to us that we have not seen any substantial uptick in inter-island travel with the introduction of the testing program. To remind you of the chronology of events, travel within the islands was subject to a 14-day quarantine from the beginning of April until mid-June, when quarantine restrictions were lifted without a testing requirement. That continued until August 11th, when the quarantine requirement was re-imposed for travel from a Oahu, as a result of an increase in cases on our most populous island. When the testing program for long-haul arrivals was launched in October, a similar program was created for inter-island travel. The fundamental problem, however, is that the high costs of the COVID test relative to the total cost of inter-island journeys has deterred and will continue to deter people from making these short trips. As disease prevalence approaches parity between most of the islands, we hope that state will see that the cost of this program vastly outweighs its benefits and will permit travel between the islands without quarantine or testing requirements to resume. Overall, we\u2019re optimistic about the pre-travel testing program for long-haul travel in 2021, and believe it provides a way to safely build back tourism, which is essential, not only to our Company but to the economic health of our community. As we look out into 2021 with the pre-travel testing program in place for long-haul travel, we\u2019re maintaining our focus on our three key priorities, rebuilding and optimizing our network for the post COVID reality to drive revenue; reducing our cash burn; and strengthening our balance sheet. In this vein, we are excited to add four new routes in the coming months, including the addition of three new mainland gateways to Hawaiian Airlines network. In an environment where we expect it will take some time for demand to fully return in our traditional markets, these routes provide an opportunity to broaden our network to cities that have been on our radar for some time, with proven demand and the lack of nonstop service today. Coupled with our expectation of restoring service in previously served markets, we remain on track to operate 75% to 85% of our 2019 capacity in summer 2021. Near term, challenges remain. The combination of a seasonal demand trough and the prevalence of the disease in key visitor markets means we are not expecting improvement in our cash burn for the first quarter. But, this does not reduce our confidence for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. Like all of you, we are encouraged to see vaccines in distribution and look forward to that being a catalyst to move our industry and the broader economy beyond this incredibly difficult chapter. In our view, pre-travel testing is step one, but vaccination holds the true key to restoring demand closer to historical levels. Despite a challenging quarter ahead, I\u2019m optimistic about our future as Hawaii\u2019s carrier of choice, with leisure leading the recovery. As the industry progresses through the phases of recovery, the ability to generate superior revenue is going to matter again, and Hawaiian Airlines has a track record of coming out on top in revenue generation in the markets we serve. The reasons for this, our focus product, our unparalleled hospitality, and our competitive cost structure remain intact. We have the long-term structural pieces in place for a successful recovery. Hawaii will be a resilient vacation destination as the world moves beyond this pandemic. As vaccinations allow the virus to subside, the fundamental reasons people want to travel to Hawaii have not changed. Excess capacity from business markets may meander onto some of our routes in the near-term, but over the long-term, we have a better value proposition in terms of our revenue generating capability and a cost structure specifically designed for the Hawaii market. Our structural advantages, combined with our ample liquidity position us well for success in the years ahead. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brent to give you more details on our commercial outlook.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter. Aloha, everyone. I\u2019d also like to thank the team for their outstanding efforts this quarter. I\u2019ve been continually amazed over the past year by the team\u2019s ability to adapt, respond and collaborate towards solutions in the face of so many uncertainties and challenges. During the fourth quarter, total revenue was down 79% year-over-year on a 72% decline in capacity. Passenger revenue was down 86% year-over-year, while other revenue was down only about 3%, driven by continued strong performance in our cargo, charter businesses, and some year-end trips with our HawaiianMiles credit card partner. Our net sales for the quarter were up -- were approximately $1.6 million per day, which is slightly better than our initial forecast. We were on track to beat our guidance by a higher percentage, but the positive trend faded in December, after the changes to the requirements in the pre-travel testing program and the rising COVID cases on the mainland resulted in a dampening of demand. Before I get into our performance by geography, I\u2019ll share an update on the progress we\u2019ve made with our pre-travel testing partners. We implemented four new testing partners and opened four new testing locations during the quarter, and now have a total of five partners in seven dedicated testing locations. We are now testing approximately 60% of our in-plane passengers on any given day through partners Hawaiian Airlines has brought into the pre-travel testing program, and we anticipate this percentage to continue to increase over time. Our drive-through test with Worksite Labs remained the least expensive, unsubsidized state approved tests on the market. We know that consumer satisfaction with our exclusive testing partners is considerably higher than most of the other state-approved options. Because of the tighter restrictions for providing test results introduced by the state, many of the larger testing providers, who outsource their testing to commercial labs, have been unable to meet the state\u2019s 72-hour turnaround requirement, making it more difficult for travelers to find tests. This has validated our strategy of setting a proprietary testing capacity dedicated to our guests and performed by partners who are not doing any medically necessary testing. We\u2019ve had no difficulties meeting the state\u2019s time limit requirements with our physical testing locations. Test by mail options still work, but are higher risk because of potential shipment delays. We appreciate all of our testing partner employees who work hard to get our customers tested and one step closer to Hawaii. We\u2019re continuing to learn and adapt, and our experience leaves us optimistic about the testing program. We have the best options for consumers who are going to continue to expand our network of testing options further across our network. Moving on to our performance by geography. In North America, in the fourth quarter, we brought back service to Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Jose, Oakland, New York and Boston, as well as several North America to Maui routes during the quarter. We had initially planned to bring back some North America to Kauai routes in December but ended up rolling that back after Kauai elected to opt out of the pre-travel testing program on December 2nd. In the fourth quarter, we operated 37% of our North America schedule compared to the prior year, peaking at 53% in December. Looking ahead, as Peter mentioned, we announced the launch of four new North America routes this spring. We will begin nonstop service to Honolulu from three new mainland gateways, Austin, Orlando and Ontario, as well as nonstop service from Long Beach to Maui. The Long Beach and Ontario routes will allow us to increase our presence in Southern California and provide more convenient options for our guests and communities near those airports, while Austin and Orlando are both growing markets without nonstop service to Hawaii. We\u2019re excited to expand the breadth of our network with these new routes. And while it may take some time to fully develop these new markets, we\u2019re encouraged by the booking activity that we\u2019ve seen since the announcement. In the first quarter, we expect to operate just over 70% of our North America schedule compared to 2019. In the Neighbor Island market, our performance continued to be curtailed by the inter-island quarantine. As we expected, we did not see a positive impact from the implementation of the pre-travel testing program due to the high cost of the test. We also rolled back some of our plane capacity increases for Lihue due to the Kauai opt out. In the fourth quarter, we operated about 41% of our schedule compared to 2019, and we expect to operate about 39% of our 2019 schedule in the first quarter. Regarding international, we operated about 5% of our 2019 schedule in the fourth quarter. We brought back once-a-week service to Narita in October by converting one of our cargo-only operations to carry guests as well. And then, in December, with pre-travel testing partners in place in Japan, we expanded our Japan service to include both, Haneda and Osaka, as well as increased frequency to Narita. We\u2019ve since trimmed back some of the Japan service for the first quarter as the recent spike in cases in Japan and tighter government travel restrictions have dampened demand. While the pre-travel testing partners have not been secured yet in South Korea, we still proceeded with converting some of our all-cargo flights to include passengers in December, and currently expect to maintain that service. As for Australia and New Zealand, we do not have plans to resume travel until at least the third quarter of 2021. For the first quarter, we anticipate operating approximately 12% of our international network compared to 2019. We\u2019ll continue to assess the impact on demand from the executive order last week, and we\u2019ll make adjustments to our schedule if we have markets where the combination of cargo and passenger revenue doesn\u2019t make sense for us to sustain that level of service. Overall, in the first quarter, we expect our system capacity to be down about 50% compared to both 2020 and 2019 levels. This is about 10 points less than we were planning before the rise in COVID cases late last year. Looking further ahead, as Peter mentioned, we are maintaining our summer 2021 planning assumption of operating about 75% to 85% of our 2019 capacity at system level. We currently anticipate growing back our North America capacity at a greater rate than the system average with North America capacity reaching about 80% to 100% compared to 2019 levels. Now, switching gears to demand. Bookings for the first quarter were on a positive trend for most of the fourth quarter, increasing from about 15% of 2019 levels prior to the September 15th announcement regarding the launch of pre-travel testing in October to almost 40% in the weeks after October 15th, but started to slow down a bit in December as COVID cases increased on the mainland and West Coast state governments encouraged residents not to travel. We are currently seeing bookings come in at about a third of 2019 levels, with about 70% of those new bookings coming from cash versus travel credits. While still early in the booking curve by COVID standards, second quarter 2021 intakes are roughly about between a quarter and a third of historical norms. As progress is made and lowering caseloads and public confidence in the vaccine rollout grows, we anticipate that the second quarter booking intakes will accelerate. In terms of net sales for the first quarter, we are forecasting sequential improvement in net sales, increasing from approximately $1.6 million per day in the fourth quarter to approximately $2.2 million to $2.6 million per day in the first quarter. While the pace -- while booking pace has improved moderately, we anticipate this will pick up later in the quarter as vaccine distribution improves and guests gain more confidence in planning their travel for later in the year. Regarding revenue for the first quarter, while a lot can change, at this point, we don\u2019t expect a material improvement in the revenue compared to the fourth quarter. Overall, we are optimistic about recovery, despite an expectation of challenges in the next few months. We\u2019re excited about the upcoming expansion of our North America network. We\u2019ve got a great product, strong brand and ideal leisure-focused business model, which positions us to recover from this crisis. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Our adjusted net loss of $173 million for the fourth quarter or $3.71 loss per share, and adjusted net loss of $551 million for the full year 2020 or $11.96 per share reflect the devastating impact of the pandemic on our business. Our Treasury team has been hard at work boosting our liquidity. We closed the quarter with $864 million in cash and short-term investments, which includes the receipt of $41 million from the at-the-market equity offering that we announced at the beginning of December. Through the ATM transaction, we\u2019ve issued a little over 2.1 million shares at an average price of $19.79 per share. As Peter mentioned, today, we also announced our intention to refinance our CARES Act loan with a capital markets transaction backed by our loyalty program and brand assets. With estimated proceeds of $800 million, this new financing will generate significantly higher borrowing capacity than the CARES Act loans with a lower total cost of capital, better payment terms, and more flexible terms overall. This financing will put us in a better position as we begin the process of repairing our balance sheet. Including the new loyalty program financing as well as our $168 million allocation of funds from the PSP extension, we\u2019ll have an estimated $1.8 billion in liquidity, which puts us in a very comfortable position. This is obviously significantly more than our previously stated $500 million target, but is necessary in the short term to allow us to focus on the long term and to position us well to grow back our business when demand returns. We\u2019ll reassess our liquidity targets and deleveraging plans later this year after the financing transaction, and when we have a clearer sense of how demand will return. We continue to expect lower CapEx in 2021 with an estimated range of $50 million to $70 million, which includes some 77 spare engine PDPs as well as technology and facilities projects. While lower than previous years, we\u2019ll continue to make investments that we expect to generate positive returns and those that provide us the foundation we need to compete when travel resumes in full force. For the fourth quarter, our total operating expenses, excluding special items, were down about 45% year-over-year on a 72% decline in capacity, which is up about 15% compared to the third quarter, in line with our expectations. We expect our first quarter total operating costs, excluding special items, to increase about 20% while we increased ASMs almost 70% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. This cost efficiency is primarily a function of an increase in average stage length and fleet mix, which will continue to occur as we restore our operations and add back longer haul, widebody planes. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, that represents a decline of about 30% on about 50% lower capacity. Our fourth quarter daily cash burn was $1.7 million, which was favorable to our original forecast of $2.2 million, primarily due to a lower level of operations and thus lower costs and higher net sales. As a reminder, in addition to net sales and operating cash outflows, our cash burn figure also includes debt service, interest payments, tax refund inflows and CapEx and severance payments, but exclude CARES Act and other financing as we believe this more accurately depicts our cash flow results. We\u2019re currently forecasting cash burn in the first quarter to be $2.3 million to $2.7 million per day. Although that estimate is highly dependent on ticketing for second and third quarter flying, which as Brent mentioned, is unclear as of now. The sequential increase from the fourth quarter is primarily associated with the timing of semiannual debt service payments on our EETC debt, which accounts for about $600,000 per day. We expect first quarter net sales to be higher than the fourth quarter by about the same amount as the increase in cash outflows, both associated with operating a larger schedule. These two factors are expected to net each other out, resulting in first quarter operating cash flows that are similar to the prior quarter. Achieving cash breakeven remains an important goal, but we do not expect to get there during the first half of this year, as the key to achieving this milestone is an acceleration in the pace of bookings as the public becomes comfortable traveling again. As we await more widespread distribution of the vaccine and better control of the pandemic, we\u2019ll continue our focus on cost discipline and will monitor our capacity carefully to ensure we\u2019re on the path to positive cash generation. This has been a difficult year for our Company and the industry, but I\u2019m encouraged by what lies ahead. With our strong liquidity position, cost discipline and resilient leisure focus, we\u2019re ready to rebuild and succeed in the years ahead. And with that, we can open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolf Research.\nHunter Keay: Hey everybody. Thank you very much. I\u2019m kind of curious about the 7 ones again, or talking about that again, I realized. But, does COVID extend the useful lives of those aircraft because of the fewer cycles on them, or is it going to be -- does it shorten them because other operators are accelerating the retirement of the aircraft?\nPeter Ingram: Hey Hunter, it\u2019s Peter. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to have a big difference in how we view it one way or the other. As you know, we\u2019re planning on operating that fleet through the middle of the decade. Our view on that has not changed from when we announced that at I think the end of 2019, we locked in that decision. I think -- obviously, we\u2019re putting less wear and tear on them right now and fewer cycles. Unfortunately, we\u2019d like to be operating full airplanes at regular frequency. And that does, on the margin, extend the life. But, I really don\u2019t think that we were butting up against a very hard cycle limit that was constraining us in 2025. I think, we are comfortable that we\u2019ve got the service contracts in place with the key providers to work us through to the middle of the decade. And I\u2019m mindful that the largest operator in the world of this aircraft type is while they haven\u2019t announced their retiring it, the retirement is out in that mid-decade period anyway. So, I think we\u2019re still pretty comfortable with where we sit right there. If we have a change to our expected life of that airplane, we\u2019ll let you know. But right now, I think the middle of the decade is where our thinking is.\nHunter Keay: So, good. Okay. Thanks, Peter. And then, sort of a quick two-parter here. The first one is quick. Kind of curious, Brent, what the mix of one-way versus round-trip tickets that you sold in the fourth quarter was? And then, more broadly, just kind of curious if you\u2019re seeing more people relocate to Hawaii permanently or for getting indications that that might be a phenomenon that you\u2019re expecting over the next year or two? Thanks.\nBrent Overbeek: In terms of kind of customer demographics, we have seen a bit of a change as we\u2019ve moved through the pandemic. We are seeing a little bit more one-way traffic. I don\u2019t think that is frankly all that surprising, and I suspect it\u2019s quite true across most geographies frankly as customers are mixing and matching itineraries amongst different carriers with probably different levels of frequency and service across a variety of markets. And so, I don\u2019t have the exact number in front of me, Hunter. But, we had seen a modest uptick I would say, kind of mid-single-digits to high-single-digits uptick in terms of the volume of tickets that we\u2019re selling. But, I think that\u2019s really more indicative of round-trip customers who are just mixing and matching itineraries or they\u2019re booking an outbound and then waiting just because flights, frankly, aren\u2019t as full for us and our competitors. And so, they\u2019ve got more options as to when they book their returns. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything -- any structural migration to or from the islands. I think, it\u2019s just really a change in customer buying behavior. When you couple that with the fact that in general, customers are staying longer on their vacations as well. We\u2019ve seen a modest uptick in people staying more than a week or two weeks relative to their previous patterns.\nPeter Ingram: And Hunter, I\u2019d just add to that. I think, we have heard a number of anecdotal stories about as people change the way they work and a trend to more working remotely that has been common through the pandemic that that is creating some opportunities for people to choose where they live, irrespective of where their employer is based. I think, that is a minor influence and unclear how long it will be sustained, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big sort of structural change in what the demand for our service is going to be long term. I think, we are primarily going to be built around serving people who are traveling for leisure for five to eight days as we have been for a great number of years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker: So, I have a different kind of related question. Back, before COVID started pre-pandemic, there was some pushback among the residents of various islands on tourism. And I\u2019m just wondering how your -- how that\u2019s being balanced now with the lack of tourism? Is there more support for it or people being more -- we miss our livelihood so we hope you come back fast, or is it more of the same?\nPeter Ingram: Hi, Helane. I think, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, candidly. I think, there is a sentiment that is fairly common in Hawaii that as tourism has increased from 7 million or 8 million visitors a year to over 10 million a year in the last couple of years that there is a concern about that volume being too much and it putting pressure on parks and natural resources, and adding to some crowding. And I think, there is a segment of our population that absolutely has enjoyed the fact that things have been less crowded for the past several months, particularly that segment of the population whose employment and financial well-being is not dependent on the visitor industry. But, what -- if there was ever any doubt, we have certainly proved during this pandemic that the overall economy here in Hawaii is absolutely, at this moment in history and for the foreseeable future, reliant on a healthy and vibrant visitor industry. And we are troubled to see the number of small businesses and restaurants and entrepreneurs and retailers, and certainly, the hotel operators who are dramatically affected by the economic consequences. And I think, our community needs to be mindful of that as well. So, long term, I think, the answer to that is we need to find a good healthy balance and figure out how we have a healthy, vibrant visitor industry that is welcoming to our guests and provides the economic opportunities that we all desire in the community, but look at ways to make sure we\u2019re taking care of the cherish natural resources have and maintaining our oceans and our lands and providing that balance that gives us a basis for sustainability in the long term.\nHelane Becker: Thanks, Peter. That\u2019s very helpful. Could I just follow up with Shannon on one question. On the loyalty deal you\u2019re doing today, can you say what the loan-to-value is on that? Sorry, I just didn\u2019t read them. I was listening to you talk.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Sorry, Helane. Actually, so we\u2019ll probably -- we\u2019ll give you more of that information when we\u2019re done. So, we\u2019re just launching the transaction today. We\u2019ll spend the next couple of days marketing and we\u2019ll price and have some final terms probably on Friday, towards the end of the week. And so, we\u2019ll provide more of those details with that.\nPeter Ingram: But Helane, there should be some information in the memorandum with regards to the valuation. So, I think, the information is available to people there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: So, really, it\u2019s a little bit early here, I know even leisure booking curves are quite a bit shorter than they normally would be with every -- all the volatility around COVID. But, can you give us some early indication on how bookings are looking for the summer peak? And maybe how that changed since October 15? And then, kind of a last related question is that how much of an end-of-quarter pickup are you baking in to your 1Q daily net sales forecast is related to hopefully a pickup in those summer bookings as we get the vaccine out there a bit more? And I have one more quick follow-up for Shannon after.\nBrent Overbeek: Sure. So second quarter booking trends were kind of following similar to what we talked about in 1Q, and that they were quite sparse prior to the September announcement. Got a bit of a pickup with the announcement around testing and a little bit more of a pickup, probably a little bit less than what we had seen in -- for travel in 1Q. But things were moving along okay. We anticipated that to continue to progress as we moved throughout the latter part of the year. That slowed down a bit, and we were back down to between quarter and a third of what we had been -- of our historical kind of booking levels, if we track that back to 2019. Over the last few weeks, I would say, we\u2019ve seen a modest uptick in that, but there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in that. And I certainly don\u2019t want to call it a trend at this point as there are fair amount of moving things. But we\u2019ve seen a little bit more progress in terms of our historical comps. And Katie, what was your other question?\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Oh, yes. And then, just on how your 1Q net sales forecasts envision those ramping -- those bookings ramping from here?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. So, we\u2019ll continue to see progress as we move throughout the quarter. I think, our anticipation is that we\u2019ve kind of bottomed out in terms bookings in the front part of the quarter, and we\u2019ll continue to see that progress as we move throughout the quarter.\nPeter Ingram: And Katie, I might just add, I think you mentioned it, and Brent mentioned that there\u2019s obviously been a lot of compression of the booking curve. I think, the environment where that booking curve will start to stretch out again is really as we see demand come more in line with capacity and people really starting to think about, one, wanting to get their vacation plans on their books, but two, also being concerned that that capacity is not always going to be there. And if you want to get today\u2019s pricing, you\u2019ve got to have that urgency around booking it now. I think, that will happen at some point this year. We\u2019re really not in our first quarter net sales guidance projecting that that happens by the end of this quarter. But, I think that will be a catalyst for an acceleration at some point as we move through this year.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Got it, very clear. And then, one for Shannon. How should we think about CapEx over the next couple of years? I know you guys managed to reach an agreement following last quarter to defer those 787s. I think you\u2019ve only got one coming towards the end of 2022. But, how did CapEx went up from kind of these very minimal levels today through 2022, 2023, that time frame?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks, Katie. We actually will have two 787s delivered in 2022, very late in the year, but we\u2019ll put them in service in the early \u201823, early \u201823. So the depreciation would start in early \u201823. \u201823 is a bit more moderate with really, I think, no 787 deliveries that year. We\u2019ve decreased our non-aircraft CapEx this year a bit. And over the next couple of years, we\u2019ll just have to look to see what the environment looks like at the time. We didn\u2019t decrease it down to zero. I think, about half of our guide here is aircraft related and maybe a little more than half is non-aircraft related. So, we\u2019re still continuing to invest in technology and facilities related projects. So, I think, that\u2019s the piece that can vary over the next few years. If we find really good opportunities and if -- depending on what cash flow looks like, we\u2019ll invest more in those areas. If not, we\u2019ll just keep it maybe about this level. So, -- but that one, we\u2019ll have to kind of watch as time passes.\nPeter Ingram: And with the Boeing deal, I think, it\u2019s important to say, we didn\u2019t just push back the early ones and then bunch everything up. We really shifted back the entire delivery stream a little bit. So, we\u2019ve got the original sort of cadence and balance around that as we go forward from the time we start taking deliveries.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey. I guess, good morning, or maybe it\u2019s right around noonish, if I have my time right. Hey, Brent, I have a question for you on the ramp-up. You mentioned, what, 85% to 100% North American capacity by this summer. I mean, sort of where we sit today and we look at the various headlines and kind of how things are trending, it does feel somewhat aggressive. And I\u2019m just curious, as you look out to the forward schedules and you sort of try to anticipate the moves by your competitors that maybe there is an opportunity for you to gain some share here. I mean, you guys are all about Hawaii. It\u2019s what you\u2019re all about. And as they say, you want to strike when the iron is hot. So, I\u2019m just curious how much of that is driving that move to get back to basically 2019 levels in, I don\u2019t know, the next three, four months.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I mean, like, we\u2019re obviously really focused on demand coming back and the pace at which that comes back, and we\u2019ll manage our capacity commensurate with that. And so, we believe we\u2019ll start to see some more strengthening of that as we move through this quarter and into the second quarter. And, we made some adjustments to 1Q where that wasn\u2019t the case. But, I don\u2019t view it as us looking at to aggressively grow market share in the summer. We anticipate the market coming back stronger, and that will be a timing at this point where we see it coming back. And so, that\u2019s where we set our plans at this point.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Fair enough. And then, just second question to Shannon. Shannon, you talked about the $800 million debt deal is basically taking up the government loan. I\u2019m curious how you sort of think about the two -- on the PSP one and the extension, the sub loans to the government. I mean, I realize, I think it\u2019s five years at 1%. So, it\u2019s obviously very attractive financing. It\u2019s relatively small. Do you include that as well to get out from under the thumb of the government, or does it just -- because of the attractiveness of the financing and the terms, maybe you keep that small piece. Were you indicating that you\u2019re taking out all of the government debt?\nShannon Okinaka: No. I was just referring to the CARES Act loan for the reason you just stated. I think, the most expensive part of those loan components of the PSP were the warrants, and those are already issued. So, it really doesn\u2019t make sense to take those -- to prepay those. But, we\u2019re going to have to look at all the items on the table, really look at our balance sheet and get creative about deleveraging and look at things like pension. Because remember, too, a lot of our debt is at -- yen-denominated debt, which again has very, very low coupon. So, we\u2019re going to focus on deleveraging, but we\u2019re probably going to have to be pretty creative about how we do it. But we do have some natural maturities of our EETCs that are coming up, we\u2019ll look at paying down the revolver. But this is some of the planning activity that we\u2019re going to do once this transaction is done and over the summer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bert Subin with Stifel.\nBert Subin: Peter, sort of as a follow-up to Mike\u2019s question there. Can you talk about what you see as the stages of recovery for North America? How are you currently planning around COVID testing requirements? And maybe what are the knock-on effects for Neighbor Island?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Let me start on that and then see if Brent has any comments to add. I think, stage one for travel to Hawaii is the pre-travel testing, which allows people to get out of the blocks. And so, we\u2019re in that, and it\u2019s working well, and we want to make it work better. We want to make the testing as seamless as possible. Where we really project demand picking up further is really going to track along with the pace of vaccination delivery. And the more vaccination delivery can be accelerated, we think the better that is for demand for Hawaii and airline demand in general. One, because I think communities like ours will be less concerned about the spread of the disease, putting pressure on the health care system because that pressure will have been relieved by people being inoculated. And two, because people are venturing out more. And if you look at some of our demographics right now, even with the small number of travelers we have, one of the areas that\u2019s really taken a hit is people over the age of 60 or 65, who are more vulnerable to the effects of the disease. And so, I think, as those folks get vaccinated, they move into the potential traveler pool, and now we\u2019re looking for demand from a bigger pool of potential guests again. So, we think that is really the important thing to track. And then, the final thing, I think I would add is, we\u2019ve got to be mindful of what the government restrictions are. And at some point, we would hope that governments here in Hawaii and elsewhere would be mindful about the fact that as risks are going down, some of the restrictions and impediments to travel that have been put in place for public health reasons are removed, and they don\u2019t linger longer than they need to be to absolutely protect the public health.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I think, Bert, the only thing I would follow-on, and it\u2019s obviously closely tied to the rollout of the vaccine is just the instance of cases in general on the mainland, is that a base, whether it be through a vaccine or through just better management of it, we\u2019re going to see demand start to pick up, commensurate with that, and restrictions out of those geographies as well start to diminish. And so, while it\u2019s difficult to divorce those two, I think, it\u2019s equally as important in terms of managing that case slowdown as well.\nBert Subin: Thanks, Peter, Brent. That\u2019s helpful. Just one follow-up for Shannon. What percent of ASMs do you think you need to reach to get back to 2019 CASM ex levels? And do you think stage is going to be a big headwind as you replace some of that international temporarily? Thanks for the time.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks, Bert. We\u2019re not providing any CASM guidance at this time. And just over time, we know that there\u2019s going to be some positive and negative factors that are going to affect our cost structure. So, I\u2019m not really prepared to give you any time frame just now. But, we will remain disciplined about costs, and it is our goal. We will be cost competitive in the markets that we serve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global Securities.\nDan McKenzie: A couple of questions here. I guess, first off, to what extent are you involved with the travel passport? And what are the countries that you fly to you -- pardon me, the countries that you fly to telling you about the concept? So, is this something that Japan and South Korea are potentially looking at?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Thanks, Dan. It is something I think having a centralized clearing house to the extent that there\u2019s a standard that people can rally around I think is a way to manage some of this better. I\u2019m actually going to ask Avi Mannis, who is our SVP of Marketing, Communications, has been doing a lot of -- had a lot of involvement in this regard to maybe give his thoughts on it.\nAvi Mannis: Yes. Thanks. We\u2019re obviously quite interested in this area, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been engaging with both, with governments in some of our international markets, who I think are beginning to explore this, but also with the State of Hawaii, which obviously has restrictions. And we\u2019re eager to figure out how we can work to reduce friction in the travel experience to make that easiest possible. The standards are still emerging. There\u2019s a lot of technology out there. We\u2019re engaged with all of the providers and over what time what we think is it most important to have interoperable standards between the different technology solutions, so that it is as easy as possible to travel between those. So, we\u2019re continuing to work with both, State of Hawaii and any international markets that we serve to understand the implications for our guests.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. Any sense for line of sight with respect to when you might know whether or not this actually come into play, or what -- is there some kind of time frame for resolution or rollout of the technology?\nAvi Mannis: I think, there are things that are in pilot at the moment, but I don\u2019t know that we have a specific time line for when those technologies would roll out. And they\u2019re obviously dependent on the actions of the state and the national governments that are involved.\nDan McKenzie: I see. Okay. Then, I guess, second question here, just following up on an earlier question, I think, you referenced the 65 and older demographic. Of course, they\u2019re first up here to get the shots. Does Hawaiian potentially just get a bigger component of its revenue from that demographic versus peers? I guess, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how material that part of the revenue picture is.\nPeter Ingram: Dan, it\u2019s hard for us to say. I mean, I think Hawaii as a destination, in general, may attract a little bit more of that demographic. But, I have no reason to believe that amongst airline serving Hawaii that we attract a different age demographic than any other carrier.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve O\u2019Hara with Sidoti.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Hi. Just maybe on the -- circling back kind of on Mike\u2019s question, with the first quarter. Can you just -- what was the capacity growth kind of sequentially? And then, is there -- is the new routes that\u2019s driving that? Is it kind of the need to build back the network kind of in anticipation of the summer? Is it competitive factors?\nBrent Overbeek: So, it\u2019s really kind of two tranches there, Steve. The first is really a lot of, what I\u2019ll call, January and into the front part of March, is really just an extension of the latter part of our back half of December schedule. So, a lot of that was flying that we had initiated kind of mid month there and leading into the holidays. We\u2019ve made some minor puts and takes on some of that as we moved into the quarter. But, that schedule is relatively flat. It grows a bit in mid-March then, when we start to welcome some of the new cities into the network. And so, March, we\u2019ll have a bit more capacity than the other months.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. And then, on the total liquidity, the -- is the $1.8 billion you mentioned, is that after you repay the government loan, or is that kind of prior to that? And was the -- and how does that compare to kind of the expectation? I think the expectation was year-end of about $1 billion?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Hi, Steve. Yes, it does contemplate repaying the government loan. Right now, that loan -- we only drew down $45 million. So, it\u2019s pretty small. And that compares to -- so you\u2019re just comparing the $800 million loyalty financing with the potential $622 million CARES Act loan.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. And then, I mean, in terms of -- I mean I know you guys don\u2019t do a lot of corporate accounts or that\u2019s not your main business. But, I mean, are you guys seeing - in terms of -- I mean it seems like you\u2019re fairly confident that there is a good amount of pentup demand out there to be talking about the type of schedule that you you\u2019re looking at or potentially looking at in the summer. I mean, when is the kind of decision on that? What does that have to be made in terms of, if you\u2019re starting to see things that don\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen or will -- how early can you kind of maybe hit the gas or the brake?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Steve, we\u2019ve become very nimble over the last 10, 11 months in terms of managing our schedule. We\u2019d like to get into a cadence of actually projecting the schedule out a little bit further as we get a little bit more sense of the demand and the recovery, so that our guests have the opportunity to have a little bit more time to plan. So, we\u2019re capable of making adjustments within a couple of months or even inside that if we need to, but it would be our intention to try and get at least 2, 3 months out so we have a sufficient booking window, so that people can plan and so that we can build our plan and our staffing and be as efficient as we can be about providing that capacity. Thanks, Steve. And I thank everyone for the questions today. I just want to say mahalo to everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and look forward to talking to you again. Aloha.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Alanna James, Managing Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nAlanna James: Thank you, Michelle. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings\u2019 third quarter 2020 results conference call. Here with me in Honolulu are Peter Ingram, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Brent Overbeek, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management and Network Planning; and Shannon Okinaka, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have several other members of our management team in the room for the Q&A. Peter will provide an overview of the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and our vision for the future; Brent will provide an update on our commercial performance and trends; and Shannon will provide an update on our cash and liquidity. At the end of their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions. By now, everyone should have access to the press release that went out at about 4:00 o\u2019clock Eastern Time today. If you\u2019ve not received the release, it is available on the Investor Relations page of our website hawaiianairlines.com. During our call today, we will refer at times to adjusted or non-GAAP numbers and metrics. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers and metrics can be found at the end of today\u2019s press release posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. As a reminder, the following prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements including statements about our future plans and potential future financial and operating performance. Management may also make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them.

This includes the most recent Annual Report filed on Form 10-K, as well as subsequent reports filed on forms 10-Q and 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo, Alanna. Aloha, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. As you have seen in our press release today, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a severe impact on our business in the third quarter. The second and third quarters of 2020 will likely go down as the most difficult period of Hawaiian Airlines\u2019 proud almost 91-year history. In spite of that, it is touch my heart each day to see the dedication and care that our team has shown to our guests and each other. I\u2019m very encouraged that the Hawaii pre-travel testing program, which went into effect on October 15 will mark an important inflection in the trajectory of our business. Program allows the traveler to bypass the mandatory 14-day quarantine by presenting evidence of a qualifying negative COVID-19 test from a state approved provider. Since the beginning of April, we have operated a minimal schedule to serve the minimal demand for travel to and from Hawaii. Our experience in Hawaii corresponds to that in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere in the world that have utilized quarantines to mitigate the spread of the virus. Simply put, quarantine requirements when strictly enforced virtually eliminate all demand for travel. With the opportunity available, once again, to travel to Hawaii without enduring a 14-day quarantine, we expect demand will continue to improve in the months ahead and we are expanding and will continue to expand our schedule to meet this demand. The early returns are encouraging. The logistics of the process are going relatively well. There have been some teething pains to be sure that are being worked through by the state and that are improving every day. We have indeed seen an increase in our load since the 15 and have seen positive trends in our bookings, which Brent will elaborate on later in the call. While there is a very long road yet to be traveled, it is encouraging to have begun the journey. As for the Neighbor Island quarantine, at the time of our last call, the quarantine had been lifted, but due to a spike in cases on the island of Oahu, the quarantine was reinstated on August 11 for all travel to any island other than Oahu and a stay-at-home order was put in place for Oahu for about four-week starting in the last week of August. As things stand today, travel from Oahu to the neighbor islands without quarantine is possible only with a negative COVID-19 test. We do not believe that test exemptions are the right solution for Neighbor Island travel. As Neighbor Island visits are generally shorter in duration and lower cost overall for the traveler, so the $100 to $200 incremental expense and inconvenience of taking a COVID test is going to stifle much of the inter-island demand for as long as this requirement is in place. Our hope is that the prevalence of the disease on Oahu, which has been declining appreciably over the past several weeks reaches a level where the intrastate quarantine requirements will be lifted entirely. The biggest risk to the upward trajectory of our business is a scenario in which there is a significant increase in cases of the disease in Hawaii, leading to a retreat from the pre-travel testing program. While this is not in our control, we will do our part to make sure that travelers understand the testing requirements, that they arrive with state approved tests and that they are informed about their personal responsibility to keep our community safe. Importantly, more travel does not have to mean an unmanageable spike in COVID cases. We\u2019ve gone from a small number of untested travelers to a larger number of travelers, but with most being recently tested negative for the disease. Combined with ongoing efforts to reduce the community spread of COVID-19, our hope is that these actions keep the disease in check here in Hawaii. To help ensure that our guests get tested, we have worked to bring testing partners to the table in addition to the provider sourced by the State of Hawaii. We are continuing to pursue additional testing opportunities in order to make the testing process as seamless and easy as possible for our guests. We expect that market competition will make testing less expensive and more accessible over time. As this happens, we expect demand for travel will continue to improve. While the delay of the testing \u2013 pre-travel testing program, reinstatement of the Neighbor Island quarantine, and re-imposition of stay-at-home orders comprehensively stifled demand in the third quarter, we focused on what we could control. We were successful in accessing the financing we needed to endure the immediate crisis and feel we are in a good place from a liquidity perspective. We completed negotiations with our labor unions on voluntary leave programs and executed on the labor rightsizing efforts that were painful, but necessary to ensure we remain competitive as we fight through this challenging period and position our company to emerge successfully from the crisis. We reduced our active workforce by about one-third through a combination of voluntary leaves, voluntary separations and furloughs. About 87% of the reductions were voluntary separations or voluntary leaves. We also successfully completed negotiations with Boeing to push back the introduction of 787s to our fleet from early next year to the latter part of 2022. Shannon will provide more details on the adjustments to our fleet plan, but I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t note that Boeing has been a supportive partner throughout this process. The 787 is a terrific airplane and will be a vital part of our fleet in the future. But we don\u2019t need it in 2021. I\u2019m pleased that we were able to make this agreement to push back deliveries to a more appropriate time. As we look ahead to 2021, we continue to plan for our operations to be 15% to 25% lower in the summer of 2021 than there were in 2019. However, with less than two weeks having passed since travelers have had the ability to avoid quarantine, our assessment of the demand environment is sure to evolve in the days ahead. With this in mind, we are positioning ourselves to respond to circumstances as they unfold. In the near-term, we continue to focus on managing down our cash burn. We have done an admirable job of minimizing our expenses as we have run a much smaller operation. And we remain laser focused on controlling our spending. But there is only so much we can do to reduce costs, while maintaining our ability to rebound. Step function change in our cash burn requires us to generate more revenue. That\u2019s why the pre-travel testing program is so important. It allows us to begin to access the pent-up demand for travel to the world\u2019s premier leisure destination. Getting there won\u2019t happen immediately. While bookings have improved over the past few weeks, this is against a backdrop of advanced bookings well below historical levels for the coming months. As we compete for this demand and begin to ramp up our operations, we will necessarily increase our cash expenses. Even as we do so, we will be extremely judicious in these spending decisions. And we\u2019re going to continue to look at every aspect of what we do to make sure that it meets the new expectations of our guests, whether these expectations are permanent or transitory. At the core of this is our focus on the needs of travelers to, from, and within Hawaii. This has always been a source of competitive advantage for us and it is likely to be amplified in an environment where the travel process and guest expectations have been upended by the pandemic. One of the important first milestones in our journey back is to reach cash breakeven. I\u2019m not going to attempt to forecast the timing for us to do so as we don\u2019t yet have enough experience with demand in the pre-travel testing environment to provide a specific target. But we are on a positive path and our ability to, again, access demand gives us more confidence than we\u2019ve had that we are moving in a better direction. Looking further ahead, we need to restore balance sheet strength. Reaching cash breakeven will be an important milestone, but it is only a single marker on the road back to success. I joined Hawaiian as its Chief Financial Officer in 2005 shortly after the company emerged from a two-year restructuring. It was a company with many incredible and unique strengths, but the balance sheet was not one of them. Our team leveraged the strengths of our business to generate cash flow to build a strong balance sheet. It didn\u2019t happen overnight then and it won\u2019t happen overnight now, but I am certain we will do so again. There is much that gives me confidence as I look forward. Hawaii is, again, open for business. Leisure travel throughout the world is rebounding faster than business travel. And with the ability for guests to travel to Hawaii without quarantine, we\u2019ll be able to take advantage of this more so than we have been able to over the past seven months. As I look forward to 2021, I know that we are not yet out of the woods, but I know that we have the right team in place to get through this. I\u2019m continually amazed by the outstanding efforts made by my colleagues, both on the front lines and in the back office to deliver the guest experience and operational excellence that our guests expect from us. I would like to express my gratitude, once again, for the exceptional job they do every day despite the unprecedented circumstances we have faced together over the past many months. In particular, I want to acknowledge the contributions of our colleagues who accepted early out or retirement packages in September, in many cases, after decades of loyal service. I wish our retiring pilots and flight attendants could have enjoyed their traditional final flight, to allow us to honor their years of service to our guests. And I wish our departing ground employees could have had a final in person celebration with co-workers. While the pandemic robbed them of that, the legacy that has been left by all of these dedicated professionals will inspire our recovery. And we look forward to welcoming those on furlough and voluntary leave back to productive employment as soon as possible. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brent to give you more details on our commercial outlook.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter, and Aloha, everyone. I\u2019d also like to express my gratitude and appreciation to our team for all the work that has gone into building and executing our evolving plans as we respond to this unprecedented situation. This touches so many parts of the organization, and we as a leadership team, are proud of this collective effort. During the third quarter, total revenue was down 90% year-over-year on an 87% decline in capacity. Passenger revenue was down 94% year-over-year and other revenue was down 41%. Highlight in our third quarter results was the outstanding performance of both our cargo and charter businesses. As we adapt to the current environment, our team has been nimble and opportunistic has found ways to secure incremental business. Despite an 87% decline in capacity year-over-year, cargo revenue was down only 28%, driven by higher yields and extra cargo-only flying. We operated more than a 140 cargo-only long-haul flights in the quarter and we ramped up charter flying as well. We will continue to look for alternatives to utilize our aircrafts and resources to generate cash for the company, while our passenger business recovers. In North America, we operated just 18% of our schedule compared to last year. We added service to Portland, Sacramento and San Diego back in the beginning of the quarter. But then trimmed some frequency, due to the delay in the launch of the pre-travel testing program beyond September 1. Now looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to operate about 37% of our North America schedule, overall, compared to last year as we bring back more capacity each month. In October, we welcomed Las Vegas back to our network and we\u2019ll fly approximately 20% of last year schedule. In November, we\u2019re bringing back Phoenix, San Jose and Oakland back to the network, as well as several North America to Maui routes, flying approximately 36% of our schedule compared to last year. And in December, we plan to bring back New York, Boston and Long Beach, as well as more North America to Maui and Kauai service, and expect to fly about 54% of last year\u2019s levels, with that figure bumping up to the mid-60%s during the holiday peak. With these additions, we will have restored service to all 13 of our pre-pandemic origin points in the U.S. \u2013 on the U.S. mainland. Now moving over to Neighbor Island, our performance was negatively impacted by the reinstatement of the Neighbor Island quarantine by the Governor about midway through the third quarter. In July, with no quarantine in effect, load factors were in the mid-40%s, while after the quarantine reinstatement on August 11, load factors in August and September were in the 20%s, despite a schedule that was more than 20% and 50% smaller respectively. Our schedule for the fourth quarter is expected to gradually build back as we anticipate a modest increase in demand for connections aligned with the increase in visitors to the state. However, with the recently announced requirement for pre-travel Neighbor Island testing, we do not expect to see much demand recovery for local traffic, given the magnitude of the cost of the testing in relation to the fare. This could change, of course, and if we were to see relief in the quarantine and testing requirements for interstate travel. Overall, for the fourth quarter, we expect to operate about half of our Neighbor Island schedule compared to the same period last year. Regarding international, with government-mandated travel restrictions on both ends of the journey, we didn\u2019t operate any scheduled international passenger flights in the third quarter, but we brought back once-per-week passenger service to Narita in October to accommodate essential travel between Japan and Hawaii. We are encouraged by the recent announcement by the Governor of Hawaii that Japan will be included in the pre-travel testing program as soon as suitable testing partners are secured. And we expect that Korea will fall shortly \u2013 will follow shortly thereafter. Assuming that testing partners will be in place soon, we are planning to increase our service to Japan as well as to convert some of our all cargo flights to Korea to include passengers later in the quarter. As for Australia and New Zealand, we do not expect to resume service during 2020, as borders are still effectively closed. At this point, we anticipate operating roughly 5% to 10% of our international network during the quarter. Overall, in the fourth quarter across our network, we\u2019re planning to operate about 30% of our capacity compared to the same period last year, reaching a high point of 41% in December. Now switching gears to demand. We\u2019re encouraged with our inbound load factor from North America to Hawaii running at 57% in the first 10 days since we reopened the state. Bookings for the fourth quarter have steadily improved as travelers gain confidence in the state reopening. Before the State\u2019s latest pre-travel testing announcement in mid-September, bookings for the fourth quarter were coming in at about 10% of historical levels. After the announcement in mid-September, that improved to 25% to 35% with greater progress in the front half of the quarter. And since October 15, as travelers have seen the state finally implement the testing program, we\u2019ve seen steady improvement with bookings coming in at 35% to 55% of last year\u2019s levels with improved trajectory for the back half of the quarter. While still early in the COVID booking curve world, we are seeing some additional booking activity in the first quarter of 2021 as well. For most of the summer, we were seeing just about half of our new bookings being paid with cash. In recent weeks, this has changed and the level of new bookings being paid with cash has increased to around two-thirds. Although, we\u2019re clearly still at the beginning of the recent reopening of Hawaii and it is challenging to assess demand, our latest forecast for net sales for the fourth quarter is approximately $1.3 million per day. We\u2019re currently maintaining a cap on our load factor of 70% for all flights in our network to promote physical separation until December 15. We are encouraged by the recently published studies that demonstrate airplanes are among the safest indoor places with respect to the transmission of coronavirus. Given the sophisticated air filtration systems on board, the continual introduction of fresh air from outside the aircraft and the fact that all guests are facing forward. These environmental attributes are complemented by our requirement that all employees and all guests wear face coverings throughout the journey. The fact that a substantial portion of our guests are now being tested for the virus also gives us further confidence. We will continue to evaluate our distancing policies for travel beyond December 15 over the next several weeks. Overall, we look forward to the opportunity to bring back more of our service in the coming months and remain ready to respond to the evolving demand environment. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Today, we reported an adjusted net loss of $172.7 million for the third quarter or $3.76 per share, reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business. We recorded special items totaling $24.5 million related to the workforce rightsizing initiatives that Peter mentioned, which included voluntary separations executed in the third quarter, as well as involuntary separations effective October 1. Our total operating expenses, excluding special items, were down 52% year-over-year on an 87% decline in capacity. We closed the quarter with $979 million in cash and short-term investments, which includes the receipt of $459 million from new financing and CARES Act funding. More specifically, we received $376 million from the sale leaseback and EETC transactions that we mentioned on our last call, as well as $38 million of CARES Act PSP funding and $45 million from the initial draw of our CARES Act Economic Relief Program loan. We have an additional $577 million available to us under the CARES Act Economic Relief Program loan and we have until March of 2021 to draw any additional amounts. With access to $1.6 billion in liquidity, including the undrawn portion of our CARES Act loan, we\u2019re confident that we have sufficient liquidity based on our current view of the crisis. While our focus on liquidity was appropriate and necessary, the increased leverage and associated debt service over the next five years presents a sizable challenge. Until we reduce our debt load, we\u2019ll be constrained in capital spending, investments and growth. Over the coming quarters, as we get a better sense of the pace of growth of our cash inflows, we\u2019ll turn our focus to mending our balance sheet with an aim to get back to the strength we had pre-COVID, including our leverage target. This won\u2019t happen as quickly as we\u2019d like, but it is a critical element of our recovery. As Peter mentioned, we reached an agreement with Boeing to defer the two 787 deliveries that were scheduled for the first half of 2021 to September and December 2022 and subsequent deliveries to 2024 through 2026. The retiming of our 787 induction will provide significant relief in terms of the cash outlay related to our aircraft CapEx. Overall, this agreement defers over $500 million in aircraft CapEx from the 2020 to 2023 timeframe to 2024 to 2026. Our CapEx for the remainder of 2020 is estimated at $5 million to $7 million, bringing our 2020 total to between $107 million and $109 million, which includes one A321neo delivered earlier this year. Our CapEx for 2021 is estimated at $40 million to $60 million most of which is non-aircraft CapEx. We continue to make investments in the business, albeit at a slower pace, particularly in technology and facilities, based on our confidence in the positive returns from these investments. During the third quarter, we were highly focused on cost reduction and the resizing of our company. Our strategy has been to reduce costs, while maintaining the ability to meet increasing demand as nimbly and quickly as necessary. For the fourth quarter, while our capacity is forecast to more than double compared to our third quarter capacity, we estimate our operating expenses, excluding special items, will increase only about 15% compared to the prior quarter. We\u2019re currently at the point in our recovery, where we can bring back capacity relatively efficiently, as we have been carrying fixed costs and labor expenses that can now be spread over more capacity. Subsequent growth may not have the same cost implications. Our third quarter daily cash burn, excluding CARES Act funding and new financing and assuming net sales were equal to zero, was $2.9 million, which was favorable to our original forecast of $3.2 million, primarily due to lower volume of operations and a higher uptake in voluntary employee leaves. Net sales for the third quarter were approximately $300,000 per day, bringing our net cash burn for the third quarter, excluding CARES Act and new financing, to $2.6 million per day. This figure includes an average of approximately $400,000 per day and benefits from non-recurring tax refunds during the quarter, which resulted from provisions in the CARES Act, which allowed for the carry back of net operating losses to a period with a higher tax rate. For the fourth quarter, we estimate that our net cash burn, excluding CARES Act and new financing, will be approximately $2.2 million per day, which includes net sales, operating cash outflows, debt service, interest payments, CapEx and severance payments. Our cash burn in the fourth quarter is slightly better than the third quarter due to forecasted improvement in net sales, which are partially offset by costs associated with increased operations and the non-recurring tax refund that we received in Q3. As we look out into 2021, our priority is a swift return to cash breakeven. We know this will require a recovery in demand as we cannot get there on cost reduction alone. With the launch of the pre-travel testing program less than two weeks ago, we\u2019re not yet willing to forecast the timing of achieving this milestone. As we get a clear understanding of the pace of demand recovery in the period ahead, we should have a better estimation of when we will get there. As we rebuild our network, we\u2019re focused on balancing the need to capture demand where it exists, while also reducing cash burn. We\u2019re at the beginning of our recovery phase. And with the generally longer booking curve for travel to Hawaii, there may be a slight lag in the recovery of revenue relative to the increase in costs we\u2019ll incur to bring back capacity. However, we know that this is a critical first step as we restore our network and bring our fleet back to productive service. We will be nimble and aggressive and we\u2019ll continue to do what we do best, focus on the needs of travelers to, from and within Hawaii. While the events of this year have unfolded very differently from what we envisioned at the beginning of the year, we\u2019re confident we have a winning formula and we are positioned for long-term success. With that, operator, we can now open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nHunter Keay: Hey, everybody. How are you? A couple of quick ones on the 787 delivery schedule. Can you tell me what the new CapEx profile for 2021, if I missed it? And just so I\u2019m clear, you\u2019re taking two 787 in late 2022 and then your next one is not coming for like a year. Did I get that right, for like a year and a half after that? So you\u2019re only going to have two 787s for \u2013 about a year. Is that correct?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, that\u2019s the plan. I mean, Hunter, the deliveries of September and December as we will probably not introduce those into service until the early part of 2023, by the time it to go through proving runs and certification efforts. So we\u2019ll do a lot of that with the September delivery and then bring the December one in, and likely start in 2023 and then we\u2019ll have the next ones were scheduled in 2024. And I think on CapEx, Shannon, you gave the number for next year.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Hunter, our total CapEx is estimated at $40 million to $60 million for next year, most of which is non-aircraft CapEx. We really don\u2019t have very much aircraft related CapEx next year.\nHunter Keay: I\u2019m sorry, I missed that. Thank you, Shannon, appreciate it.\nShannon Okinaka: No, problem.\nHunter Keay: And then, is there an appetite, Peter, to \u2013 by locals to roll back the enforcement of the regulations on the STR market even only if temporarily there to bring some tourism back?\nPeter Ingram: That is a hot-button topic here locally. I think a lot of people are concerned about vacation rentals that have existed particularly in areas, where they\u2019re not currently zoned for that purpose. And I think sometimes the legal vacation rentals get wrapped up in the negative sentiment around those illegal operations. So it\u2019s not something that has been gathering a lot of attention right now. I think people are still candidly getting comfortable with the notion of having so many visitors back in the State right now and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for us to have a successful reopening. And make sure that we\u2019re making people aware of what they need to do to get tested. So that we can keep the cases down and we can just improve the overall comfort level with increased visitors in the State.\nHunter Keay: Okay, thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Sure. Thanks Hunter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Maybe one actually quick follow-up Hunter\u2019s question on the 787s. So if I understood you correctly, you\u2019re now going to have two 787s by the end of 2023 versus your original plan for seven, I think at least per the last 10-K. Was this decision based on your view of what international demand is going to look like over the medium term or is it more of a cash outlay decision, where you\u2019ll potentially keep some of your A330 less longer than plan. Thanks.\nPeter Ingram: So I\u2019m not sure that \u2013 we\u2019d have to go back and check the numbers. Seven seems like a lot for us to have had by the end of 2023. I would have thought it\u2019d be more like five, but then some coming at the end. But in any event, really what \u2013 this is less about a change in our view of the long-term and more about the fact that that short-term, we\u2019re just in a dramatically different demand environment than we were at the beginning of this year. It\u2019s going to take some time to build back. We have obviously had pressure on our cash levels and we\u2019ve had to do a lot of borrowing this year. So the complexity of entering a new fleet into the business and the inherent inefficiency, you have to go through it periodically in this business. But it is a lumpy process when you go through and we just wanted to move that to the right a little bit to allow us to focus in 2020 and 2021 on stabilizing, restoring and beginning the recovery of the business and we think we\u2019ll be in a much better position in 2022.\nBrent Overbeek: I might add \u2013 Catie, I might add as well that the timing \u2013 the original timing of the 787s really gave us the ability to kind of throttle our growth rate higher or lower as they were synched up with 330s in terms of lease returns. And so, given that we won\u2019t be pushing the existing fleet as hard in the period leading up to that, we decided to push some of that flexibility out into later years.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, got it. Understood. And then maybe just so \u2013 really this is probably very early for this, but do you \u2013 are you guys tracking data on travelers coming to Hawaii and the success of these testing programs in preventing inbound spread of the disease. And the reason I\u2019m asking just, the last time we saw a spike in COVID cases in U.S., this pre-departure test workaround got delayed. So I wanted to see if you guys were working with the government to show the efficacy of this program, just in light of the recent uptick in cases maybe as a way to avoid this being rolled back. Thanks for any color there. Appreciate it.\nPeter Ingram: Yes, let me start and then I might ask, Avi Mannis, who is in the room with us who has been doing a lot of interactions with the policy makers in the state around the program. We certainly are pushing to get some data. We really like to understand, what proportion of guests are being tested with test from the pre-approved providers. We\u2019d like to use that so that we can communicate that much better with our guests and make sure they know about what the requirements are and how to get the tests. We\u2019re still \u2013 today is 27, so we\u2019re 12 days since people started arriving without testing. We\u2019ve been on a positive trajectory certainly here in Oahu with cases in the last little while as a result of some of the interventions to prevent community spread. And really the spread recently of the disease has been from community spread. But, yes, we would certainly like to understand that and the whole purpose of pre-travel testing is to make sure that you\u2019ve got a much, much higher comfort level around the people who are traveling to and from, whether it\u2019s visitors or whether it\u2019s residents returning from travels on the mainland to have a comfort level about what it is coming into the state and we\u2019re hopeful that it\u2019s going to work. Avi, anything you want to add to that?\nAvi Mannis: Yes, I think I would just add, it\u2019s too soon for there to be a real data driven evidence of the efficacy of this. But there have been secondary testing protocols that have been implemented either on a sampling voluntary basis there\u2019s a surveillance study that\u2019s going on in the state. And for a period of time, Hawaii Island was requiring every arrival to take a second test. And I think what that demonstrated thus far is that there is a very, very low incidence. I think there have been maybe one case identified of someone on a secondary test. And so too soon to tell, but the results thus far are encouraging and I think the state remains very committed to continuing to roll out the program.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes, hi. Hi, everyone. Peter, you and Shannon spoke a little bit about kind of the structural cost improvements that are underway or efforts to variabilize the cost structure, I guess. And it\u2019s not entirely clear what that means from an earnings power standpoint post-COVID. So I\u2019m just wondering if you could speak to that a little bit, it would seem like one way to quantify that would be to, say, what level of 2019 capacity you think you need to get back to in order to get CASM ex, back to where it was in 2019. But some of your peers have struggled to answer that succinctly, so any way that you want to talk about that would be helpful. Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yes, I think the reason people have struggled to talk about is that there\u2019s just a lot of variables going on in there. I think what we have tried to do is take some of the cost structure permanently out of our business where we can. We \u2013 unlike some carriers, we haven\u2019t reduced our fleet or haven\u2019t removed an entire fleet type from our fleet. And so that \u2013 we haven\u2019t had that lever to pull but we have certainly reduced our labor costs and tried to, as you say, make the cost we are operating more variable. So if you end up being 15% smaller, you\u2019d like to reduce your cost by 15%. It is complex with some of the training requirements, particularly around the pilot group when you have a multiple aircraft type fleet that adds a certain amount of inefficiency in that. And that\u2019s inefficiency, we\u2019re just going to have to absorb because operating our network, which has got some varied missions. We need to serve that and the best revenue outcome we get is from serving that by having multiple aircraft types available, but that does create some complexity as we look to next year. I\u2019m not quite willing to try and give you a \u2013 if we get back to X percent of revenue, we will produce X result, whether it\u2019s CASM or breakeven or pretax breakeven or \u2013 sorry, positive cash flow. We\u2019ll \u2013 as we go forward in the next few months, we get a little bit more comfort on the pre-travel testing program, I think we\u2019ll be able to give you a little bit more comfort about what the world looks like as we\u2019re going into next year.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Sure. No, go ahead.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes, the only thing I\u2019d add there is, from a cost perspective, we did not in all areas bring our cost down to the minimal level of cost that we could have, because what we\u2019re trying to also maintain is that flexibility to ramp back up quickly, if demand is such that we should ramp the capacity back up. And part of the difficulty in giving you some forecast for 2021 is, I think a lot of the cost piece is dependent on how demand ramps back up. So if demand is low to ramp back up and we find that we don\u2019t need the flexibility that we\u2019ve given ourselves, then we can bring our cost down even further than we have, or if we find that we needed that flexibility and we need to ramp up back quickly, then we\u2019d have a different cost profile than the former situation. So that\u2019s where we have even more difficulty right now in giving you more concrete guidance for next year.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, got it. And then, Brent, can you just talk about the kind of competitive environment that you\u2019re seeing on the North America side. It seems like, to this point, it\u2019s been pretty benign because there wasn\u2019t much volume. But as it comes back, maybe what you\u2019re seeing and kind of what your expectations are for, in terms of how much revenue will lag the recovery and demand? Thank you.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, I think, at a high level, the industry has been adjusting capacity rather late. They\u2019ve been doing that kind of across the network. But certainly, Hawaii has probably been a little more extreme with that, kind of given the uncertainty of demand based on, where we were with the quarantine. So we\u2019re still seeing the industry continue to morph and adjust capacity in November and December quite a bit. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re encouraged with how demand is coming back. It\u2019s on a positive trajectory. We are obviously seeing quite a different booking curve. Our normal booking curve is much longer. That has been compressed quite a bit, which in the short-term clearly helps. We have started to see a little bit more promotional activity as the state has opened up, I would say, as we worked our way through the summer. Broadly speaking, there wasn\u2019t nearly the level of promotional fares put out there by the industry. That has ramped up a little bit more with opening up and it\u2019s something that it\u2019s important for us to be competitive, and while we\u2019ve got a bunch of competitive advantages that we\u2019ve talked to over time, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll make sure that we get our fair share or more of the traffic.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. Hi, guys, good morning everyone. Hey, Peter, I want to just go back on the testing for Hawaii. Is that the \u2013 to come into the State of Hawaii, is it the more intense PCR test, which obviously takes \u2013 it\u2019s a longer turnaround. Or is there some possibility that the State of Hawaii will be willing to accept the more rapid antigen testing. And I\u2019m just wondering if there is an opportunity to maybe implement that cheaper, faster test between the islands, because you have sort of the zero risk policy, which is not reliable in the world of commerce and mobility. And I\u2019m just curious what the State\u2019s appetite is with respect to that. And then just the Island of Hawaii, are they \u2013 I heard Avi talk about that second test. Is that still in effect and are you actually seeing much weaker demand to the Island of Hawaii because they have an extra step.\nPeter Ingram: So let me start on the test first and then maybe I\u2019ll let Avi chime in again on, where we are on the testing regime in Hawaii. And I\u2019m going to wow you with what I have learned about COVID-19 testing over the last several months here. The required testing in Hawaii is a Nucleic Acid Amplification test or a NAC test, and it has to be from a CLIA approved lab. PCR tests are a part of that category of tests, but they\u2019re not all of it. It also include some of the point of care Abbott Lab\u2019s device, but it doesn\u2019t include antigen tests. So antigen tests are a different classification. And I think as the policy makers were thinking about this, they really wanted to set a standard that had high efficacy and accuracy and responding to the concerns of the community about bringing more travelers back. I think as testing becomes \u2013 continues to evolve and it\u2019s evolved a lot over the last several months, there is ought to be an opportunity to expand the pool of acceptable tests, in our opinion, as long as they provide high efficacy and accuracy. So as long as you believe you can get a reliable result and we would like to see that that is something that is pursued. And particularly, as I said in my remarks, we don\u2019t think the sort of $100, $200 test is going to help unlock demand for Neighbor Island. A lower cost test might do better. Certainly the removal of the quarantine if we get to a more standard level of the prevalence of disease throughout the Islands would be the best outcome from a demand standpoint in that regard. Avi you wanted to just cover where the testing is between the Islands right now.\nAvi Mannis: Sure. So the \u2013 with respect to the Hawaii Island mandatory test, that was discontinued after about a week. So they did something like 5,000 tests and got a 10 false positives and one true positive and they decided to discontinue that and move to a voluntary model. And that was an antigen test. And one of the issues with the rapid antigen test is the false positive rate. False negatives create problems, but false positives are also an issue. And so I think it is a prudent decision to focus on testing that has very high sensitivity and specificity initially. I do think everyone here recognizes that technology is going to change and that this is a first step and they started with something that has both PCR testing, has both good sensitivity and specificity but also a very mature supply chain. And so \u2013 but I think everyone recognizes that over time, the State is going to migrate as technology improves to hopefully what are cheaper, equally accurate tests as they become more available.\nMike Linenberg: Thanks, Avi. Just Peter, just the second question on the shutdown of Ohana, what\u2019s the trigger in the pilot agreement that lets you restart that operation? And are you using your 717s to still try to connect. I guess what is it, Lanai and Molokai? Or are those \u2013 are they cut off from your network. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nPeter Ingram: Yes, sure. So the trigger is we have a requirement to allow us to operate a feeder/carrier relationship within the Hawaiian Islands. We have a requirement that if you do a 12-month look-back of the block hours of our Neighbor Island mainline airline flying that it is above 29,000 hours. And so as we\u2019ve reduced our schedules for April, May, June, July through to now, we hit a point in \u2013 we will hit a point here in October, where we go below 29,000 and we don\u2019t make that 29,000-hour look back. And that\u2019s why we announced that we were going to suspend the Ohana by Hawaiian service effective November 1. Subsequently, there is a couple of developments. We actually reversed that announcement yesterday, and that is based on the fact that although we do not accept, we have not historically accepted EAS subsidies for those. Those are to be essential air service markets and there is a notice requirement. And so we anticipate that the DOT is going to require us to continue flying those and so we\u2019re continuing. We\u2019ve now said we\u2019re going to continue flying those with a minimal baseline scheduled to Molokai and Lanai through at least the middle of January. As far as the 717s, we really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good option. The 717 relative to prior generations of that aircraft type and I know you\u2019re a long time [indiscernible] Mike, so you know that that\u2019s a predecessor of the old MD line and the DC\u2026\nMike Linenberg: Yes, the DC line.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. This airplane flies a little bit faster. And with the very short run ways and some of the obstacles \u2013 particularly obstacles around the runway in Molokai, we don\u2019t think that 717 is a viable aircraft for regular operations. And so if we\u2019re going to fly, it is going to be with the ATRs and operated by Empire in our Ohana livery.\nMike Linenberg: Thanks for that tidbit Peter, because I know Hawaiian used to fly with the DC-9s, so I thought maybe they can serve with the 71s, but it doesn\u2019t make sense. Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yes, sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody, and thank you very much for your time this afternoon. So one of my questions is on the industry capacity coming into the market. Do you feel you need to match the industry in terms of pricing or are you able, because it\u2019s your core market and the experience is so much better than on the peer group that you don\u2019t have to match?\nBrent Overbeek: Well, Helane, this is Brent. I would say that it is \u2013 we feel like we\u2019ve got a superior on board product and we are really grateful that the product, but the physical product that we\u2019ve got being tailored for Hawaii, but our frontline team is fantastic. And that as we\u2019ve talked about numerous times, that helps us generate a revenue premium, ultimately how that revenue premium versus our competitors is created, is ultimately really by creating better than average demand. And that can either be kind of more passengers and more volumes at competitive prices or a little bit more. And I would say right now, we\u2019ve seen a little bit of both. Networks are still shaking out and people\u2019s previous service in certain ONDs is changing and evolving as we move month to month and it\u2019s something that my team is keeping a keen eye on. And we\u2019ll continue to do to ensure we\u2019re making the optimal revenue decisions for Hawaiian Airlines today and going forward.\nHelane Becker: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then the other question, I know I think in your answer, actually to Joe\u2019s, it was kind of like you don\u2019t have the information, or you don\u2019t want to share the information. But I was listening earlier today to JetBlue\u2019s CEO say, they\u2019re doing $8 million of revenue per day and need to get to $13 million to $15 million to kind of reach cash flow breakeven. And I think you mentioned that you don\u2019t really have a number. But I was wondering if you can say where \u2013 prior to the pandemic where you are relative to that, A. And B, like where \u2013 what percent maybe of historical bookings you would need to get to, to reach that cash flow breakeven. And how quickly could you actually bring capacity and staff back if say, demand improves in December? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yes, so let me sort of try and respond to that in a couple of ways. One, I would say, part of the challenge for us in terms of thinking about what cash what revenue we need per day to get to cash breakeven has been changing pretty rapidly as Brent went through. Just what was in place between September 16 and October 15, we saw a big acceleration right after that and we\u2019re continuing to ramp up. And some of that frankly is getting an expansion of the booking curve because that provides a cash flow as well even above what you\u2019re flying today. As we ramp up our operations, that\u2019s the other side of the equation changes as well and that\u2019s why it makes it a little bit difficult to give these forecast, because you\u2019ve got to think about what load factor you\u2019re running, what yield you\u2019re generating, how much capacity you\u2019re operating. And all of those things are part of generating the revenue. I think generally you\u2019ve heard some numbers by other carriers and they all gravitate around the same general level of how much cash you need to get back to relative to where you were before. And our number is probably not going to be too terribly different from those. But we\u2019re not going to give a specific forecast about that while we\u2019re in a period of so much flux really as we just are 12 days into ramping back up to where we actually have an environment that is conducive to generating revenue.\nHelane Becker: Right. Okay, that makes perfect sense. Yes, Shannon, sorry.\nShannon Okinaka: And on your question on how quickly we could bring capacity back, we really haven\u2019t done very much from a fleet perspective to put anything in long-term storage. We\u2019ve deferred a little bit of maintenance. But for the most part, our fleet is generally completely available in December. We haven\u2019t gone too far down into pilot training that we couldn\u2019t reverse it if we had noticed probably around now, beginning of November. And as far as our flight attendants and ground staff, we can bring them back pretty easily as well. So we\u2019re very flexible in the near-term on capacity.\nHelane Becker: Okay, thanks very much everybody. Thank you for your time.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nDan McKenzie: Yes, hi, thanks guys. I guess just a clarification here, how many destinations have a pilot program for rapid testing in place? And if you \u2013 and I guess if it\u2019s embraced, what percent of the network could it realistically encompass here in the fourth quarter?\nPeter Ingram: So the pre-travel testing is in place for travel inbound from the U.S. Mainland. The State has indicated that there is \u2013 are discussions underway to identify testing providers in Japan, which is our biggest international market, Korea is in discussions, and Canada, which is not part of our historical route network is, there are discussions going on as well. So theoretically, for our network that brings the \u2013 all the destinations except for Australia and New Zealand, all the origin points that we bring people from back in play pretty quickly here by the end of the quarter. I would say that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we\u2019re going to be back at 95%. In fact, you heard Brent\u2019s forecast. We\u2019re not going to be at 95% of our capacity, because we\u2019re operating lower frequency and in some cases smaller aircraft based on the demand environment. But a substantial proportion of the sort of addressable demand is available to access that pre-travel testing here pretty soon as we go through the quarter.\nDan McKenzie: Got it. And is the expectation that the rapid testing would have a similar impact on travel volumes internationally as you are seeing domestically here or would they \u2013 is there some additional hurdles that might impact the kind of how those volumes might spool up relative to what you\u2019re seeing domestically?\nPeter Ingram: So the testing that is in place is, I talked about earlier with Mike, was the NAC testing from \u2013 in the U.S. from a CLIA approved lab, and it will be other regulatory approvals for the lab. So it\u2019s not the rapid antigen testing, although there are point-of-care NAC tests that are available. One of the other issues that as we think about some of these international destinations and bringing them back is it\u2019s not just a case of demand being limited by the two-week quarantine into Hawaii, but it\u2019s also the two-week quarantine on the return. So jurisdictions like Canada, Japan, Korea, they also have quarantines on the other end. And so that is something that is still going to be an impediment to accessing all of the historic demand that we have had.\nDan McKenzie: Got it. And I guess just with respect to that impediment though, is there a travel insurance policy you could sell people that if they got stuck in Hawaii for another two weeks that some kind of travel insurance could kick in for some reasonable price?\nPeter Ingram: I have not seen a product like that yet, but there is always entrepreneurs out there for everything.\nDan McKenzie: Okay, thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Steve O\u2019Hara with Sidoti. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Yes, I guess it seems like some airlines have at least or at least appear to be focused on offense rather than kind of just on defense. I think I can understand why you guys appear to be still more on the defensive. But I mean does that put you at a greater disadvantage longer-term relative to peers and might that change as cash burn improves?\nPeter Ingram: I don\u2019t necessarily accept the characterization that we\u2019re on the defense. I think we have always been prepared to and ready to compete. We\u2019ve had a home market and the core of our traditional network that has really been inaccessible \u2013 substantially inaccessible for the past several months. So I think that has limited our ability to do things. But now that we have the pre-travel testing in place, I think we intend to compete aggressively to win our share of revenue.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay, that helps. And then I mean I know you said your capacity is down 70% for the quarter \u2013 for the full quarter. Do you know what the competitive capacity is roughly? I mean obviously it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m sure it\u2019s in a constant state of flux. But I mean is it \u2013 do you expect to more or less have kind of similar share to what you\u2019d would normally have or any greater or lesser share just as of right now?\nPeter Ingram: As you mentioned, it is quite a bit in flux in that I think we are probably out a little bit ahead of some of the competitors in getting a, something that\u2019s closer to a final schedule out there. So we will certainly have to wait and see how other folks make adjustments particularly to December where some of the carriers still have a vast majority of their schedule published. But I think by the end of the quarter we\u2019ll be in a similar ballpark. It might be a slightly different trajectory to get there, but I think by end of the quarter, my expectation is, we\u2019ll look and feel more similar to the rest of the industry here in Hawaii. And one of the things that\u2019s important to us was getting to the point where we will be by mid-December, where we have all of the 13 origin points in North America back in the network. And we\u2019ve got the ability, we don\u2019t feel like we have to add every seat back in because we\u2019ve got the ability with our Neighbor Island connecting network to be able to connect those 13 origin points to all of the points in the island. So it gives us the ability without adding seats that there may not be demand to fill, to be able to provide the network breadth that will allow us to compete for all the revenue that we want to compete for.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay, thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nPeter Ingram: Sure. Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ingram for any closing remarks.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo, again, for joining us today. We are encouraged that we have reached an inflection point from surviving the crisis to beginning the recovery. There is much work yet to be done and we look forward to updating you again in a few months on our progress. We appreciate your interest, Aloha.\nOperator: Thank you.

Aloha everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you have seen in our press release today, the second quarter was an incredibly challenging period for our company and for the entire industry as we continue to face the unprecedented demand disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In our home state of Hawaii, we had a 14-day quarantine in place for incoming travelers throughout the quarter, leading us to operate a fraction of the schedule that we had planned at the beginning of the year. The human toll of the virus was also driven home last week with the passing of one of our long-time flight attendants. Jeff Kurtzman joined our ohana in 1986 and over the past three decades had become well-known to his in-flight colleagues for his passion for discovering new places, people and cultures, his terrific sense of humor and knack for easy conversation and his caring heart. He embodied the values of Aloha and Malama that we hold dear. He will not be forgotten. We're also reminded this past weekend that even as COVID-19 has rendered much of our operation dormant, mother nature's volatility is still in effect as Hurricane Douglas made a pass by the island chain. Hurricane season is a regular feature of living in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, but this one was a bit unusual for us to prepare for given that much of our fleet has been parked in Honolulu rather than spread throughout our network on a daily basis. In anticipation, we moved the majority of our long-haul aircraft to the West Coast and most of our neighbor island fleet to Kona which was further away from the direct path of Douglas. Fortunately for us, this most destructive winds associated with the storm stayed offshore to the North and all of the islands of Hawaii were spared a direct hit.  Throughout this unparalleled period, our team has been nothing short of remarkable. We've worked and are working collaboratively with the unions that represent our frontline employees to establish voluntary leave options and more recently voluntary separation and early retirement programs to mitigate the need for involuntary reductions to right-size our workforce.  Our employees have been active in our communities supporting food drives for people whose economic wellbeing has been overwhelmed by the crisis, delivering food to the elderly and infirm and revitalizing local schools among many other initiatives. My pride in being a part of this wonderful team has never been greater. In the second quarter, we stabilized our operation to sustain our business amidst the short-term pressures of nearly zero revenue and very limited flight activity. We closed the quarter with a comfortable cash position albeit short of our estimate as a result of a delay in certain of our planned aircraft financing activities.  I am pleased that subsequent to the end of the second quarter we have closed two sale-leaseback transactions raising $114 million and are presently commencing a double ETC transaction through which we expect to raise another approximately $262 million. Upon the successful conclusion of this transaction cash and liquid assets will exceed $1 billion.  Beyond these transactions, we expect to have access to a $364 million loan through the CARES Act loan program and we will have preserved a buffer of unencumbered aircraft following these transactions. While much remains uncertain about the months ahead, we are confident that the strong financial position we had entering this crisis has left us in good shape to manage through this ongoing uncertainty and positions us to rebuild as demand begins to recover in earnest.  The most impactful constraint on demand for our business currently is the 14-day quarantine for Hawaii travelers. So let me take a moment to review how this has evolved through the second quarter and up to today.  I'll start with the simpler part of the story which is the effect of the quarantine on our neighbor island business. This particular element of the governor's quarantine order went into place on April 1st and was lifted on June 16th. As you would expect, we have seen some recovery in demand since the lifting which has provided us the opportunity to restore more of our prior schedule.  Brent will provide you more details on the magnitude of demand recovery and our schedule in a few moments. The 14-day quarantine on incoming arrivals to the state which went into place on March 26th remains in place. In late June, Hawaii's Governor announced a plan to lift the first -- for travelers who obtain a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of arrival. As case count increased in recent weeks both in Hawaii and in our key visitor markets on the Mainland this August 1st date was pushed back to September 1st.  We remain engaged with state and county officials as specific protocols for the testing requirements are being established. On the surface, pretesting is an elegant solution to preserve Hawaii's low COVID incidents, while simultaneously stimulating our home state's devastated economy. There are many details that remain uncertain, however that will affect the ability of potential travelers to access tests and the corresponding level of demand we can expect. Certainly, the ability to avoid quarantine will open-up some of the demand that is currently suppressed, but there remains a high degree of uncertainty about the magnitude of demand recovery. A priority for us is for the state to finalize details about applicable tests and approved providers, so that we can provide this information to potential guests seeking clarity about what is required to unlock the Hawaii vacation they are looking for. Before I leave the subject of quarantines, I should note that, while Hawaii's restrictions have the single greatest impact on our ability to realize demand, we're also affected by quarantine restrictions in the international markets we traditionally serve. Brent will discuss this more in his remarks. Pivoting from dealing with the immediate circumstances, we have also spent significant effort planning for our emergence from the crisis. While we don't know the pace of the return to demand for travel to Hawaii, we know that it will occur, but we also know that it will take years not months to get back to pre-COVID-19 levels. With an uncertain demand recovery time line, our primary planning scenario focuses on being a smaller airline by about 15% to 25% next summer compared to 2019 levels. With this in mind, we are taking steps to right-size our company for this new baseline allowing us to build back the business over time from this smaller base. Key to managing this is adjusting our staffing level, and on that front we are working through each work group and engaging with union representatives, where applicable. Voluntary separation packages have already been offered to our administrative employees, and early retirement options have offered to pilots. Plans for other groups are in work. Our goal is to reduce the workforce through voluntary means to the extent feasible, but we acknowledge that it will \u2013 that it is likely we will need to proceed with in voluntary separations as well. We expect to issue WARN Act notifications to our employees who are at risk of being impacted by involuntary furloughs in the coming days. Having to shrink the company that, our team has worked so painstakingly to build is heartbreaking, but it is essential to preserve the viability, competitiveness and success of our business over the long term. We'll manage through this and emerge strongly. We have also continued to have productive discussions with Boeing to re-phase our 787 order. While not finalized, we do not expect to put the first two 787s into service until 2022 or 2023. As I think about the future, I know that demand for travel to Hawaii will return. While technology like Zoom and the emerging prominence of remote work may have a longer-lasting impact on business travel, the beauty of Hawaii can only be fully experienced in person. As the virus is brought under control, and the economy stabilizes, and eventually recovers, demand for leisure travel will return to its long-term growth trend. Our positioning as a premium leisure airline is ideal to be successful in this environment. I'll now turn the call over to Brent to give you more details on our commercial outlook. \nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter and aloha, everyone. During the second quarter system revenue was down 91.6% year-over-year, on a 92.1% decline in capacity. For the quarter, passenger revenue was down 96% year-over-year with cargo and other revenue down 50% and 48% respectively. From a low point in April, we saw gradual improvements in revenue as we progressed throughout the quarter. In North America with a 14-day quarantine for travelers coming into the state in place since the end of March, we've pared down our schedule to a barebones level and initially operated only two round trips per day, Los Angeles and San Francisco to Honolulu. Demand has returned somewhat as both Hawaii residents and visitors have begun to travel a bit more. During the second quarter, we added Seattle back to the network and have since welcomed Portland, Sacramento and San Diego back in the third quarter. We were encouraged by the state of Hawaii's announcement on June 24 that provided the option for guests traveling from the mainland to be able to test out the quarantine effective August 1. At that time, we had plans to reenter most of our mainland origin points. While we saw an initial increase in bookings for travel, particularly in early August, in the ensuing weeks as COVID cases on the mainland increased and details about the state's policy were sparse, demand unsurprisingly decelerated. We've since adjusted our August schedule to be similar to the schedule for the second half of July and estimate we'll fly just under 20% of our planned North America schedule this quarter. Looking beyond the summer, September book load factor is about a third of what it was last year, while October is about half of last year and subsequent months moderately improving throughout the remainder of the year. Needless to say, there's a fair amount of uncertainty around those numbers, given the status of quarantine here in Hawaii and the state of the pandemic in our key origin points. Consistent with industry trends, velocity of bookings has slowed in recent weeks. For travel in the latter part of the year, bookings made during the month of June were roughly a third of the last year's levels and has basically been halved over the past several weeks. Moving over to Neighbor Island. Performance steadily improved throughout the second quarter and we saw material improvement when the quarantine for travel within the state was lifted in mid-June. Load factors at the beginning of the quarter were running in the mid-teens. By May, they increased to the mid- to upper 20s and then in June in the mid-40s on additional capacity added in the back half of the month. We've ramped up our Neighbor Island schedule and the latest plan for the third quarter has us flying about half of our 2019 schedule. Load factors have leveled off and our July load factor will end up similar to June's in the mid-40s figure. With our reduced schedule, we've been seeing booking volumes run about 40% of historical levels for closer in-travel periods but that tapers off further out and more closely correlates to the volume declines we've seen in our long-haul markets. Regarding international, our plans for returning service remain uncertain, as there are government-mandated travel restrictions in effect in most of our international geographies, which in addition to the Hawaii quarantine essentially inhibit demand for travel to Hawaii. As those foreign restrictions left, we will have the ability to welcome guests back to Hawaii. We are confident that Hawaii will remain an attractive destination for those geographies. Our expectation at this point, is that we would re-enter Japan and the Korea markets before, Australia and New Zealand. Overall, in the third quarter, we're planning to operate about 15% of the ASMs we originally planned for at the start of the year. This estimate assumes we operate the same schedule in September, as we have planned for August. However, we are currently reviewing our schedule on an ongoing basis. And we'll make adjustments to our network to align with the demand environment. We are ready to bring back more service, as demand warrants. Throughout our network we've capped our load factors at 70% or less, depending on aircraft type to promote physical separation on our aircraft and at the airport. This policy will remain in place, through at least the end of September. The safety of our employees and guests is a top priority. And we'll continue to evaluate our policies. And make changes that we feel are necessary, to ensure their continued safety and gain their confidence, in resuming travel. Our team is working hard to adapt to this new environment, constantly adjusting our network and our policies to ensure we can succeed and continue to deliver the products and services that our guests value. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent. And thanks everyone for joining us today. Today we reported an adjusted net loss of $174.7 million for the second quarter or $3.81 per share, reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business. We closed the quarter with $761 million in cash and short-term investments, which includes the receipt of $263 million of CARES Act funding through the payroll support program. This amount was below our estimate of $1 billion, due to the delay of a few financing transactions that took a little longer than expected. But as Peter mentioned, we recently closed two transactions, raising approximately $114 million, to the sale lease back of two A321neos as well as announced a WTC transaction, through which we expect to raise approximately $262 million which will put us above $1 billion. The WTC is backed by six A321neos and two A330s. And we expect the price tomorrow morning and close next week. In addition to these transactions, we have the opportunity to take advantage of the economic relief program offered through the CARES Act. Our allocation of economic relief program loan is $364 million. And we expect to make a decision about the size of our draw, by the end of the third quarter. The combination of these aircraft financings and the CARES Act loan, provide us with access to $1.5 billion in liquidity, which puts us in a comfortable position. While we believe this amount of liquidity is sufficient to get us through the worst of this crisis, we will also have four unencumbered A321neo aircraft, valued at approximately $216 million. Our air traffic liability at the end of the quarter was $554 million, of which $116 million is related to travel in the third quarter. We continue to process refunds, which peaked in April and then declined in each subsequent month throughout quarter. In light of our deferrals of 787 PDPs, as well as non-aircraft CapEx we now expect our CapEx in the back half of 2020 to be between $9 million and $19 million totaling between $103 million and $113 million for the full year, which includes our last A321neos that was delivered in the second quarter. Regarding cash burn, the second quarter daily cash burn on expenditures, excluding CARES Act funding, CapEx and refunds was $3.3 million as compared to the forecast of $3.6 million that we provided on our last call. Going forward, we're modifying the way we characterize cash burn expectations. In addition to operating cash outflows and capital expenditures, cash burn figures will include debt service and interest payments and assumes cash flows from sales and ticket refunds net to zero. It will not include any impact from CARES Act funding or any new financing. Under this definition, for the third quarter we expect to burn approximately $3.2 million in cash per day as compared to $3.6 million in the second quarter. As we shift our attention from short-term cash conservation to medium-term planning, our focus is on determining the right size for our business. As Peter mentioned, we're in the midst of determining and offering voluntary separation and early retirement options to our workforce to mitigate the need for involuntary options, which will be necessary to better match the size of our workforce with the estimated level of operations in the future. To further manage our spend, the environments where we are long aircraft, we're ensuring close collaboration between our operations and network scheduling teams to spool up our operations in a way to maximize cost efficiency. We're uncertain when we will next see positive net cash generation, but it's clear that reaching a positive position will require an improvement in demand conditions. While the time line for demand recovery remains uncertain, we are focused on rightsizing our airlines to enable us to be competitive and have the flexibility to grow as demand resumes. With our leisure business model our delivery of authentic Hawaiian hospitality and focus on the Hawaii traveler, we're confident in our ability to emerge from this crisis and succeed in the long term. And with that, we can open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nHunter Keay: Hi, everybody. Thank you. Peter, are there \u2013 what are some of the long-term consequences or even benefits that you're expecting might be unique to Hawaii opposed to other vacation spots in say the lower 48? Are there any sort of like maybe quirky or unintended consequence-type things that you guys are expecting or planning for two to three years from now based on this situation? \nPeter Ingram: That's an interesting question, Hunter. I don't know that I can think of any really significant ones. I think obviously in the short-term there was a lot of economic damage here in Hawaii as so many people are employed by the tourism sector, but the physical plant is largely intact in terms of hotels and other accommodations. There's some properties that have decided to take advantage of the extended downturn to do some renovations and that may provide some additional improvement. I would hope that over time people are -- in the community are going to realize how crucial the tourism industry is for the overall state of the economy in Hawaii. And as we begin to try and recover and recover the tax base that supports the state government, I think, people are going to have an interest in building back tourism. But I think a lot of people are really focused near-term right now on health consequences. And surprisingly a little bit to me have not understood some of the real long-term negative effects from both the health and social issue as well as an economic issue of an extended period of significant unemployment. \nHunter Keay: Okay. And then when PSP came around whenever it was March, April, obviously, it was just take the money and we'll figure this out later. It was such a dark time. And now we kind of know what this is now. We kind of know what this virus is. We don't know when it's going to get better but we kind of know what it is. So there's been some chatter of around two on PSP. Is it a little bit more complicated now as you think about potentially taking that money if there's say like service requirements attached to it and things like that? I know you guys are largely exempt from a lot of that. But would the calculus be something like, hey, we can get another $300 million to maintain payroll for six months, but it might cost us $375 million because it's just going to impede our ability to take fixed costs out. So therefore stat as it may be it might not be the right decision. I know it's a little bit early to have this conversation potentially. But is that a fair way of thinking about it that the calculus to actually taking this money you've offered might be a little bit more complicated now than it was last time? \nPeter Ingram: Yes. Hunter on that one, I think, our view is very closely aligned with what you've probably heard from the A4A and some of the other carriers that have made comments on this that it is -- I think it would be very difficult for us to turn down something that would prevent us or delay at least the need for us to pursue involuntary reductions for our workforce who I'd remind everyone has done absolutely nothing wrong. They didn't cause this crisis they're victims of it as our investors are victims of it. So I do think we have to continue to think about making the long-term changes because as you said we do know more now than we did back in March and April. I think it's a lot more clear that this is going to take longer to build out of back in March. And the early part of April there was a lot of talk about V-shaped recoveries. I haven't heard anyone talking about a V-shaped recovery. If it is, this is the flattest pointy part of the V that I have ever seen. And I think we're all keen to get moving forward. But in a world where the restrictions on a CARES 2.0 were no different from what we saw in the first version of CARES, I think it is pretty clear that the number of involuntary job losses in the industry would be a lot lower in -- at the end of March than they are likely to be at the end of September. \nHunter Keay: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Thanks very much for the time.\nPeter Ingram: Sure.\nCatherine O'Brien: Shannon, I just got a question on the unencumbered asset balance. I think you said as long as I heard correctly you'd have $216 million in unencumbered aircraft after the WTC transaction announced today. And I was just wondering are there other loyalty or other intangible assets that are not included in that balance? And the reason I'm asking is really just to get some insight into the level of and what collateral you're looking to post if you do participate in the CARES loan program and what you're thinking of doing there? Thanks.\nShannon Okinaka: Hi Caty thanks for the question. For the CARES Act loan, we've been working with the U.S. Treasury on non-aircraft collateral, so specifically the loyalty program and so that -- while that wasn't included in my number for unencumbered assets, we are looking at that for financing with the treasury. Other than the four A321neos that I mentioned, we do have other unencumbered assets, but I think those would be a little harder to finance. We have 14 717s as well as our ATR fleet. But I think for the most part right now from a market perspective, we're really focused on the 321neos and then like in the WTC the A330s.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it. And I guess in your preliminary conversations with the Treasury, I'm assuming that whatever valuation you've got on the loyalty would that be sufficient to take the entire allotment under that program?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. We believe so -- I'm sorry I didn't answer another part of your question with other intangible assets. We have not yet looked to things like our brand for valuation or financing. But for the CARES loans specifically, where we stand today, we believe that the loyalty program is sufficient.\nCatherine O'Brien: Great. And if I could ask one quick one on cost. Given the fixed cost nature of this business not surprising that you're calling out operating costs will not decline in line with capacity in the third quarter. But could you give any color on how operating costs decline relative to capacity in the third quarter will compare your performance in 2Q? Should we be expecting to see a relatively smaller gap between operating costs and capacity declines in third quarter versus the second quarter as you ramp cost cutting measures or any other puts and takes there? Thanks so much for the time.\nShannon Okinaka: All right. We haven't done a lot of analysis comparing the second quarter to the third quarter in the way that you're asking the question. We've been focused on -- as we ramp up some of our flying, as we pulled out some of our flying, how to do it in the most cost-efficient way, so our analysis has been pretty different than what we've done before. Normally when we look at cost and how to control costs a big calculus -- a big factor in that calculus is aircraft ownership costs. And at this point, when we look at spooling back our operations, aircraft ownership is for the most part a sub-cost. So when we -- answering your question is a little difficult, because I don't know how much capacity we'll have in the third quarter. But what I can tell you is that, we are looking at our cost in a different way in that, when we bring back our flying, we're focused on the cost efficiency of that flying, which is more around labor and maintenance versus aircraft utilization, which like I said, played a big factor prior in our cost calculus.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. Thanks for the time, Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey. Good morning everyone. Two here. Shannon, the cash burn of $3.2 million for the quarter, underlying that forecast or guide, is that the quarantine is lifted on September 1, presumably? And if it were not to be lifted, how does that -- do you have a sense of how that would actually change? I mean, I'm just not sure how much would actually book up in the month of September and beyond actually.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Actually, because we were a little hesitant to try and guess when the quarantine would be lifted, for that cash burn number what we did was, we just assumed that for the quarter the cash flows from sales net out with the refund. So we had just assumed a net zero there. Because you're absolutely right that, the level of cash inflows from revenues really does depend on when that quarantine is lifted, or if there's some exception with testing and improving negative results. So I guess it's at zero. \nMichael Linenberg: Okay. And then on that note, was it zero in the June quarter, or was it in negative territory?\nShannon Okinaka: It was in negative territory in the June quarter, the second quarter. \nPeter Ingram: Okay, great. And then just, Mike, I may just chime in on that as well and I think Brent alluded to this in his remarks. When we were originally looking at the August 1 date, we had a pretty sizable ramp-up in our schedule anticipating the demand, some of which we began to book early on, but which faded a little bit. As we go into September, with the opening, you're moving into a seasonally weaker time of year, we've now essentially lost the entire summer bar, potentially one long weekend. And, I think, given the sort of progress of the virus on the mainland and the uptick in cases and you see in markets that are far away from Hawaii and its quarantine that booking trends have slowed down, we're a little bit more tempered on our expectations for what we think September is, relative to what we thought August might be back six or seven weeks ago.\nMichael Linenberg: That's very helpful Peter. And then just maybe one quick one to you. The two new Board members are you increasing the size of your Board? Are they replacements? And if you are increasing the Board why at this juncture? Why now? \nA \u2013 Peter Ingram : We have -- the two new Board members will be increasing the size of our Board. We did have one Board member leave the board for personal reasons last year, so we had gone down one, now we're going up with two. The reason for adding those Board members is we think they're going to be terrific assets to the Board overall. They bring a lot of expertise both in the airline industry in the case of Jayne Hrdlicka and expertise in terms of technology and a consumer-focused industry like Mike McNamara and we think they're both welcome additions and look forward to having them on Board. \nMichael Linenberg: Great. Thanks. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nQ \u2013 Joseph DeNardi: Hi, good evening. Peter can you just talk about I think you mentioned that from a planning standpoint you're thinking about capacity summer of next year being maybe 20% less than pre-COVID. Can you just talk about maybe why that's the right number how much rigor went into that? I mean it's generally in the ballpark of what some of your peers are talking about, but if there's anything more specific that gives you visibility into that? And is there a line at which you kind of can't get below in terms of your size where it just becomes too economically expensive to shrink below a certain level? Thank you.\nA \u2013 Peter Ingram : Yes. Thanks Joe. Let me take both parts of that and then I may see if Brent has any thoughts to add after I opine. I would say we've looked at it a couple of ways. We don't have -- there is so little information we have that is specifically gives us insight into demand particularly with the quarantine order being in place for the past four months now, four-plus months. So we had to look at this a couple of ways. Part of it was top down just looking at general macro expectations and understanding that there is some economic that has been damaged. Another one is a little bit more bottom-up and thinking about what -- how routes performed before and what has changed and what our expectations for some of them would be and so that does raise some questions about some things that were maybe marginal performers before, maybe they're not going to be able to manage marginal anymore and that route may not be there or in the case of some of the international markets the perspective of those nations and how they're dealing with the crisis tempers our view about when things -- the timing of when things will come back. So it's a little bit more art than science at this point, I think -- but I think we have tried to be thoughtful about our art.  As to the second part of your question, I think you are right that there is a pace at which -- a place at which it's too much to really think about shrinking that far and being able to manage down. And I've read some of the commentary after other carriers have reported this quarter about can you bring your cost structure down and be able to operate at a similar per ASM cost structure when you're operating smaller, it's counter to the thinking but it means you really got to go and think about getting some of your real fixed costs out and getting your infrastructure costs out. In this environment that is a little bit more doable than when we're thinking just in normal times. And we always try and do things bottom-up, but it's hard to shape the instinct that sometimes when you're doing budgets about rolling things forward and just thinking about the changes. So I think we can do more of that, but there is a point, at which we've built an infrastructure that it is -- it really supports a revenue base that can't go down too much more and that was part of our thinking about what we need to do in terms of planning for the long term. And just the last point on that, we refer to it as a planning assumption as opposed to a forecast. And that is a specific choice of words that mean something to us, which means we really don't have level of precision that we would use for something that we would internally refer to as a forecast. So we use it as a planning assumption and it's something against we will measure change going forward. \nBrent Overbeek: Yeah, just to\u2026\nJoseph DeNardi: Go ahead.\nBrent Overbeek: I don't have a whole lot to add other than I think Peter has been listening to what we've been saying to him over the last several months.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. Yeah. No that's helpful, Peter. Just in the context of American's partnership with JetBlue, is there -- are there any opportunities, or ways that you can do something similar to that and leverage your Neighbor Island network if there's going to be a period over the next few years, or maybe there's too much capacity on the long-haul side of your business? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Sure. We -- as you probably know we carry the code of -- in normal times at least, we carry the code of multiple airlines on the Neighbor Island, part of our network including international airlines but also including each of American, Delta and United and they utilize that code to different extents but that is -- it's always been for us a really valuable network asset and we would continue to look for ways to take advantage of that in the future.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi everybody, and thank you very much for the time this afternoon. So Peter one of the big issues that you were just addressing was the fact that there's a lot of damage being done to the economy in Hawaii, and you're one of the state's largest employers. When you meet with the governor, if you do meet with the governor, what doesn't he understand about keeping the state closed for extended periods of time and not trying to -- I don't know deal with the virus in maybe a different way than keeping everybody out of the state?\nPeter Ingram: Yeah. So I have -- in the last four, five months, I've spent a lot more time with the governor than I ever did before this. I will tell you, I -- the governor is in fairness to him he is very thoughtful about the challenges that the state is facing. I think he does understand the economic damages and the impact that this is going to have not only on businesses like ours, but the hotels restaurants and it even goes beyond things that you would think of. The biggest demand market for the agriculture business in the state is the hotels. If the hotels aren't getting that fresh produce from local Hawaii agriculture, then that local agriculture is really not economically set up to compete in export markets. It really needs that demand. So it is really a comprehensive impact. I would say, it is buffered a little bit. I think our business has obviously been hit dramatically. Small businesses that operate restaurants or retailers that are associated for tourism had been affected dramatically. I think for the average working person in a lot of these businesses, the impact has been buffeted a little bit by the fact that the unemployment insurance has been there although it hasn't always been as reliably delivered, but at least it is available including the $600 supplement from the federal government that is expiring. So, I'm not sure the workers that all those businesses have felt it as much as the owners of those businesses, but I do think that the governor understands all that. I think he also knows that this is a -- this is a fragile place in some ways in terms of health care capability. It is a -- there are a lot of multigenerational families living together. There is a closeness. And I think islands and isolated places sometimes have different responses to how you deal with a disease like this just based on the nature of the way people live and that is not that is not to say that it's right or wrong I think these are very difficult decisions. I do think and certainly share my views with the governor that the economic consequences are not something that will be passing there something that are very long term. And some of this is going to be difficult for the state to recover from over the next several years. And I think that's something that Governor Ige and other local leaders are going to have to think about as they craft their decisions going forward. \nHelane Becker: Thank you, very much. I really appreciate that. And then I have just one for Shannon. Do you -- I don't think you said anything about upcoming maturities and I think you might have one aside from the 364-day loan coming up in the early part of 2022. I'm just wondering if you could mention that for lack of a better word. \nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks Helane. So for 2020, our total debt service is about $75 million. And for 2021, it's just a little over $100 million and that's everything. It's all of our debt.\nPeter Ingram: Helane, we didn't take out one of the 364-day loans, so we don't have to worry about refinancing that like you've seen from some of the other carriers.\nHelane Becker: Right. Okay.\nShannon Okinaka: Maybe you're thinking about revolver? We drew down on our revolver and that right now contractually expires in 2022.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then just real quickly, I don't think you said how many WARN notices were going out. Do you have that number?\nPeter Ingram: We have -- we're -- what we said about the WARN notices is that we'll be releasing them in the coming days. We haven't given a number yet. And I haven't shared a number with our team yet, so I wouldn't feel comfortable sharing that number first on this call. \nHelane Becker: Okay. Well, that makes sense. Thank you. Thanks everybody for your time.\nPeter Ingram: Thank you. Helane.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Shannon, can you just maybe quantify on the sale leaseback what the lease terms are relative to maybe where the market was pre-COVID? Thank you.\nShannon Okinaka: Hi, Joe. I don't have the specifics in front of me, but obviously, what I can say is that unfortunately the terms now are not near where we were last year with below 1% yen financing. So, unfortunately, the terms are not quite not good. I just don't have\u2026\nPeter Ingram: Yes. But Joe the overall financing on that I think -- and Jay I'm looking at Jay Shafer as I say this right now, I think the way Jay and our treasury team characterized these two sale leasebacks is, the terms we got were something that would have been in the consideration set a year ago. So it really wasn't as onerous as we feared and that's why we initially started with -- the reason those two transactions were done on a bit of a serial basis is as we started working through initially an idea of doing one of those financings we were -- we went back and did a second deal with the same lessor and we thought that would be a good source of capital for us at this moment.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. Thanks, Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ingram for any closing remarks. \nPeter Ingram: Mahalo again to everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest. Aloha.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Alanna James, Managing Director of IR. Please go ahead.\nAlanna James: Thank you, Carol. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Here with me in Honolulu are Peter Ingram, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Shannon Okinaka, our Chief Financial Officer. We also have several other members of our management team on the call for the Q&A including Brent Overbeek, Senior Vice President of Revenue Management and Network Planning. Peter will be discussing the overall impact of COVID-19 on our business thus far and our response to the crisis. Shannon will provide an update on our cash and liquidity outlook as well as discuss our cash preservation efforts. At the end of the prepared remarks we will open up the call for questions. By now, everyone should have access to our 8-K filing that went out at about 4 o\u2019clock Eastern Time today. If you've not seen the 8-K filing, it is available on the Investor Relations page of our website, hawaiianairlines.com. During our call today, we will refer at times to adjusted or non-GAAP numbers and metrics. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers and metrics can be found at the end of today's press release posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. As a reminder, the following prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our future plans and potential future financial and operating performance. Management may also make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer you to Hawaiian Holdings' recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. This includes the most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K as well as subsequent reports filed on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo, Alanna. Aloha everyone and thank you for joining us today. In the eight weeks since our last call the world has changed dramatically. We are facing the most significant demand shock in aviation history and an unprecedented and sudden downturn in the global economy due to the Corona virus. Government-mandated travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and social distancing recommendations have the eviscerated demand for air travel and the timeline for recovery remains uncertain. As you have seen in our press release today, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our financial results. We reported a loss of $34 million and adjusted net income for the quarter or $0.74 per share. This result reflects a dramatic drop in demand that we experienced on our South Korea and Japan routes in February which then escalated across our network throughout the month of March. In response to this crisis we are focusing on what we can control, taking aggressive steps to preserve and enhance liquidity and developing plans to be ready for the resumption of a larger operation when conditions permit. I'll walk you through how we've responded as pandemic evolved and Shannon will provide an update on our cash preservation measures and liquidity outlook. Our actions to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic can be thought of in three broad streams of efforts. First, responding to the crisis as it emerged. Then stabilizing our operations and our business to sustain a level of nearly zero revenue and flight activity. And finally, taking action to prepare for the resumption of a fuller schedule as the air travel industry starts to recover. I'll talk a bit today about what we have done and are doing within each of these streams, starting with our immediate response to the crisis as it emerged. During our conference call with investors on March 9, we outlined the schedule changes we had implemented in South Korea and we're planning in Japan. Up to that point demand weakness in the remainder of our geographies was muted. However, you all know by now that the destruction of demand accelerated rapidly from there. Within three weeks COVID-19 cases escalated rapidly across the globe and severe restrictions on arriving passengers were imposed by governments in New Zealand, Australia, French Polynesia and ultimately here in Hawaii, where the Governor of Hawaii announced a 14-day self-quarantine mandate for any incoming traveler resident or visitor into the state starting from March 26 and for all non-essential neighbor island travel starting from April 1. In response, we reduced our schedule to a bare-bones level operating just two round trips per day to the U.S. mainland and 16 round trips per day neighbor island. As it became clear that the virus had spread beyond Asia and it would be a global crisis, we took quick action to scale back flying, reduced costs and support our liquidity. During March, we were challenged by the rapid evolution of disease spread and demand deterioration forcing multiple rounds of schedule adjustment and significant guest inconvenience. As the notion of a national grounding of airlines became a legitimate possibility we developed a plan to ground our entire fleet. This plan ultimately served as the template for the transition to our current schedule which we implemented following the Hawaii quarantine order. Since then we have reintroduced sub-daily service to Inchon, Korea carrying only cargo and third daily flight to the U.S. mainland. We expect to maintain this schedule through the month of May. Any increase flying beyond May will be dependent on the timing of a relaxation of the Hawaii quarantine and conditions in specific certain cities we serve outside Hawaii. With our bare-bones schedule in place our operational activity entered into a stable phase and we redoubled our focus on stabilizing the business. In this demand environment flying as little as possible or not at all is the best way to minimize costs. Shannon will detail some of the actions we have taken to make sure costs are as variable as possible and to minimize fixed costs while we manage through this hibernation period and beyond. We have fully drawn down our revolving credit facility as the working capital normally provided by our air-traffic liability is diminished. Entering the year with a strong balance sheet and a cash balance above our long-term target put us in a relatively advantageous position as the crisis emerged. The CARES Act payroll support program will help sustain our payrolls through the summer aided by the voluntary leads taken by many of our employees. We've applied for the economic relief loan program and will decide how much of this funding to access in the months ahead. We're also evaluating opportunities to use our unencumbered aircraft to access funding in private capital markets with certain of these opportunities likely to be executed in the current quarter. In assessing these options we seek to preserve as much long-term flexibility as possible even as we take action to address the immediate term funding needs of the business. Stated more clearly flexibility on being able to repay debt and fortify our balance sheet as conditions evolved are among our priorities. The final stream of work may ultimately prove to be the most important in successfully managing through this crisis. Modeling the pace of recovery and demand at this point is virtually impossible. Doing so would rely on assumptions for which we cannot provide any degree of certainty. Instead, our planning teams are evaluating multiple scenarios of quarantine duration and pace of subsequent recovery. It is against this backdrop that we will continue to assess our liquidity needs and manage our cost structure. Our fleet and network model provides us flexibility when we begin to build back. It's likely the inter-island quarantine restrictions will be relaxed before the restrictions on longer haul arrivals. When long-haul demand resumes our ability to connect to the neighbor island network will allow us to serve O&D markets that won't yet support direct service. And our A321neos offer a lower capacity options for markets that haven't yet built back to the point where they can support wide-body flying. It's too early to say exactly how this will evolve but we have levers to pull and are thinking through the phases when the market recovers. What is clear to us is that demand is not going to quickly snap back to the level seen before the pandemic. As of yesterday, May 4 book load factor is in the mid 20s for the third quarter of 2020 which is a mid-teens load factor point difference below a more normal year. Bookings are also building at a much slower pace and are far more susceptible than normal to erosion. In addition to the obvious economic effects of the pandemic on our future guests, Hawaiian and our industry will have to earn the confidence of our guests and the communities we serve so that travel can resume at scale while boarding the spread of infection. Like other airlines we are enhancing the sanitation procedures for our aircraft including the use of electrostatic foggers to disinfect aircraft surfaces. We are requiring all guests spacing employees to wear face coverings and have adjusted procedures to facilitate increased spacing between guests on aircraft. We have announced a requirement for all guests to wear face coverings throughout their journey which will be effective later this week and in place until further notice and we will revise product offerings and various policies as necessary. More fundamentally though, even if we can eliminate the transmission of the virus while guests are in our care we must address the fact that transporting people between communities raises the risk of geographic spread. Our Hawaii home has been very successful in minimizing the extent of outbreak. Hospitals have not been overwhelmed and daily case counts that peaked in the low 30s have been in low single digits in recent weeks. By acting quickly and aggressively we're as close to COVID free as any place in the country. At the same time we have led the nation in unemployment claims on a per capita basis. Hotels, restaurants and bars are shuttered and everyday activities for residents as well as guests are severely curtailed. Our community is faced with a fundamental conflict between the desire to relax restrictions on movement and economic activity while simultaneously trying to ensure that a new wave of cases is not introduced. Part of the solution to this problem is beyond the scope of the airline industry. Communities like ours need testing capability, contact tracing resources and treatment capabilities to manage cases as economic activity resumes. Within the scope of the travel and tourism sector we will need to do our part. I expect changes in passenger screening to be part of this. While testing all travelers for COVID-19 is infeasible given current technology and resources, we can look to some of the practices introduced in Asia in response to SARS as a model emulate. We are working with governments, tourism industry partners and the business community to help shape this future and we look forward to progressing on this swiftly but thoughtfully so that we can again begin to welcome the visitors who are and will remain the lifeblood of Hawaii's economy. Throughout this challenging and uncertain period my colleagues throughout the company have been nothing short of remarkable. In the face of uncertainty and worry they have continued to live the values that we share each and every day. Even as they face hardship and challenges in their own lives scores of our employees have volunteered time to answer phones when our reservation lines were overwhelmed and to deliver meals to the elderly as demands on food banks reach levels not previously seen. Over half of our employees have sacrificed compensation by taking voluntary leaves, voluntary schedule reductions or in the case of our executives voluntary pay reductions. I would particularly like to thank the leaders of our collective bargaining units for the spirit of collaboration they have demonstrated as we have worked to address this crisis. My message to this unparalleled team has been consistent. We will get through this and we will get through it together. I'll now turn the call over to Shannon to give you an update on our cash and liquidity situation.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks Peter and thanks everyone for joining us today. I would also like to express my gratitude to all my colleagues who are working tirelessly to serve and respond to our guests, our community and each other the true spirit of Malama and Aloha. A special thanks to those in the back office who are running hundreds of models to support our decision-making and to help us run the business. We closed the quarter with $815 million in cash and short-term investments, which is up from $619 million at December 31 and includes the $235 million we drew down from our revolver in March. With largely idle operations revenues down more than 90% in recent weeks and a significant portion of our costs fixed, we are aggressively working to preserve cash. In addition to the variable cost savings from scheduled reductions including fuel, landing fees and passenger servicing costs we're working to eliminate or defer non-critical spends. We have consolidated airport facilities in Honolulu and worked with the state of Hawaii to reduce airport costs. We've released external contractors negotiated significant payment deferrals and minimized marketing, advertising and other discretionary spend. We have also suspended our share buybacks and dividends program. While requirements of the CARES Act funding restrict our ability to involuntarily furlough or reduce pay rates, we implemented voluntary leave options of varying lengths and timing across our organization. These programs are critical as we know that the Payroll Support Program monies from the federal government cover less than 80% of our budgeted payrolls and benefits through September 30. Over 50% of our employees have participated in our voluntary leave programs for which we are deeply grateful. Through our scheduled reductions, the elimination or deferral of spends and voluntary leave programs, we estimate that we have removed approximately 57% of our cost in the second quarter compared to our original plan. We estimate our average daily cash burn on expenditures excluding CARES Act funding, CapEx and refund to be about $3.6 million per day declining from an average of $4.5 million at the beginning of the quarter to about $3.1 million per day at the end of the quarter. Turning to CapEx. We have deferred $50 million of non aircraft CapEx which results in about $180 million to $200 million of CapEx for 2020. Aircraft CapEx includes PDPs for 787s and a single A321neo delivery that was originally scheduled for March. Prior to the impulsive COVID-19, our intent was to pay for the delivery from our cash reserves. However, in light of the dramatic change in industry circumstances we have worked with Airbus to delay acceptance of this aircraft to the second quarter to allow us time to secure financing which will result in a net cash inflow. We are also planning to retire and part out one of our higher cycle 717 aircraft which will bring meaningful maintenance cost savings over the next several years and cash savings in the immediate term. In addition to reducing costs and CapEx we're actively managing our air traffic liabilities which as of March 31 is $624 million of which about one-third is related to travel in the second quarter of 2020. But we have modified some of our policies such as the deferring ticket expiration dates and waiving change fees to encourage guests to book for a later date, a portion of that liability continues to be at risk of cash refund as we have reduced our operations and canceled flights. We have refunded about $40 million to $45 million on average in each of March and April. While we expect the itineraries eligible for refund to decline as we build back our schedules and manage re-accommodations, we're mindful the needs of our guests knowing that as we emerge from this difficult period, our guests will remember how they were treated when times were most challenging. We're also aggressively exploring options to raise cash by financing a portion of our unencumbered aircraft which consists of 11 A321s, two A330s, 14, 717s and eight ATRs and have a market value of approximately $800 million. We expect to raise at least $270 million in financing in the second quarter as the A321neo in particular continues to be highly financeable, although at a higher cost than the financing we secured in 2019. We also expected to receive $292 million through the payroll support program of which $263 million will be received in the second quarter. In that scenario where we are successful with our aircraft financing efforts and refunds follow a similar trend for the remainder of the quarter from modeling our liquidity at the end of the second quarter to be about $1 billion. We also applied for $364 million of economic relief loans available through the CARES Act which can be an alternative source of financing. We began the quarter with a strong balance sheet but with the demand recovery timeline uncertain raising and preserving cash is our top financial priority. Our team is focused on managing through this crisis looking for ways to minimize our cash outflow during this time and securing these sources of funding.. And with that I'll turn the call back over to Peter before we take questions.\nPeter Ingram: Thank You Shannon. As you have seen the situation we are facing is severe. Despite the CARES Act and our own cash preservation initiatives no airline can withstand a zero revenue environment indefinitely. We need demand for air travel to return and the infrastructure and policies to facilitate this. When that happens we will be prepared to ramp up our operations, right-size our business to meet demand for travel to, from and within Hawaii and deliver our outstanding service with Aloha. Before I conclude, let me briefly acknowledge a few other important items. First, in mid-March we received the final order from the DOT denying our application for antitrust immunity with JAL. While the DOT deemed our partnership with JAL as pro competitive, they were looking for further clarification regarding the governance of JV including the integration of Zip Air, JAL's low-cost subsidiary, our capacity plans and the information technology development required to achieve public benefits. Our application was denied without prejudice which means that we can reapply if we choose to do so. We have been solely focused on managing the COVID-19 crisis since we received the news from the DOT. We remain committed to the strong Japan franchise we have built and looked to grow on this foundation over the long term. The absence of the JV does not diminish our enthusiasm for our long term Japan prospects. I'd also like to address our plans with respect to our 787 order. We remain committed to the 787 as our flagship aircraft of the future. This aircraft will be an incredible asset for us as we develop our business through this decade and beyond but with the uncertainty inherent in the current environment and the complexity, cost and capital investment associated with adding a new fleet type our previously intended first half of 2021 entering to service is no longer appropriate. As a result we've engaged with Boeing in discussions to determine whether our 787 deliveries can be re-phased. This dialogue is ongoing. So we won't be able to provide more specifics on these plans at this time. The final item I want to share is the important milestone that we reached. After more than three years of negotiations we reached an agreement with our flight attendants Union on a new five-year contract. We are pleased to provide our exceptional flight attendants with a contract that offers market wages while also addressing some provisions that limited our ability to operate as productively as we need to. More than ever it is important that our team is unified in confronting the challenges ahead of us. So it is great to have this long overdue agreement in place. And as I said earlier our entire team is being fantastic as this unprecedented crisis for our industry has evolved. As difficult as this period has been I have never been prouder to be a part of this team. Our employees are my heroes and they give me great confidence that we will have brighter days ahead. Operator we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes. Thanks. Peter, can you just talk maybe there's some of your conversations with the state in terms of how they're thinking about restrictions going forward and what you think needs to be put in place in order for folks to feel comfortable coming out there sometime soon? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. It's something we've been spending a lot of time on. The discussions are continuing to evolve. I think we've clearly with the case count as low end as it has been recently, I think there's pretty broad recognition that some relaxation of restrictions in the community are due and when we started to see some low risk activities opened up notably for some of the people in the room with me golf courses began to open up this past weekend and so bit by bit we are going to start seeing things coming back in the weeks ahead. Air travel is one that, for the reasons I articulated on the call is something that people are concerned about particularly as we bring people into the state. I think we are probably not very far away from some relaxation of the neighbor island quarantine restrictions for people just traveling on purely neighbor island itinerary recognizing that the COVID case count is not a problem on any of the islands and so I think each of the counties is starting to think about that. In terms of some of the longer haul flying which is the vast majority of our business and really the core of the tourism business that is, the backbone of our economy and the thing that's going to drive employment back up to somewhere better than it is right now. I think there are a number of calls for testing of all incoming travelers but I think there is a broad realization of that not being feasible in an environment where in most of this country there isn't enough testing capability specific for COVID-19 testing to even make sure that all the healthcare providers and first responders have adequate testing and so the notion that we're going to be able to scale that up and deliver that for people getting on airplanes in the near term is not feasible. And so I think it really is a layered and phased approach and one of the models we've shared with people from our own experience is thinking about the response from a security perspective after 9/11, where it was not one single element of change that was introduced but it was layers of security and protection to make sure that you could get an environment where people were overall safe and comfortable. And so I mentioned treating capability and community contact tracing, testing not just for air travelers but for people in the community is a way to make sure that as you reintroduce this activity you don't get hospitals to the point where they're overwhelmed and the community is able to deal with it. So that's a sort of a bit of a character of how this discussion has gone. What that means in terms of timing, I can't tell you with any specificity, yet but that it's not our call to make ultimately and I think it may, there may be some evolution by geography that we see over time that's the high level, Joe I think that's what we're seeing I hope that is responsive to your question.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes. That's helpful and then maybe just, I didn't hear a whole lot in terms of kind of structural changes to the fleet on the other side of this and so can you talk a little bit about to the extent that you think a long haul piece of the business comes back later, I mean how much time do you give that before you have to rethink with what the fleet should look like in the context of cash conservation and the liquidity. Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. So with respect to our fleet, one of the things as you know that we have done in recent years is we have been addressing the evolution of our fleet on a proactive basis and completed the transition out of our aging 767, 300 fleet and added the A321neo to our fleet over the last few years. So what that leaves us with particularly on the long-haul side of a business is very young fleet and there's nothing that is sort of sitting out there with a natural retirement date in the next few years. So we can accelerate to bring capacity down. So from our standpoint that leads us to a point where I don't think we are necessarily going to reduce fleet further but obviously, if we're as we're right sizing capacity one of the levers we can use is to reduce utilization of the fleet and manage capacity down in that standpoint. I think we're comfortable with the ownership cost structure that we have on those aircraft as Shannon alluded to, we can use the fact that we do have a young fleet with value and we've got equity in that fleet as a source of liquidity as we're managing through this but we're not out there thinking that we should take some number of aircraft and sell them right now into a weak market. I think we would more likely manage that through utilization in the near medium-term.\nOperator: The next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time.\nPeter Ingram: Hi Hunter.\nHunter Keay: That book load factory you talked about in 3Q that actually wasn't that bad. It sounded like to me. I'm kind of curious when you feel good enough about it being and I know what you said, it's susceptible to change and people canceling and booking incentives, I get all that but when do you actually feel good enough about it being sticky enough to where you can actually sort of start comfortably relying on it via schedules? You actually have to see these people get on the airplane. I mean how much volatility you expecting in that booking number and how do you know when it's actually real or like I said you just wait to see how many people get on the plane?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Let me start on that and then see if maybe Brent has some thoughts on top of that. But I think the first thing I'm glad you heard the caveat about it being susceptible to change because that was in the prepared remarks for a reason. I think the first thing we need to be able to make that reasonably sticky is to not have a quarantine because a quarantine is an incredible disincentive for someone who was planning to come for Hawaii for a week spending the entire time in the hotel is not the reason they bought that ticket in the first place. So without a removal of the quarantine none of that is real. I think once we do have a removable quarantine, I think there will be an interest in people traveling. I think on the one hand you've got people's concerns about getting out and interacting with people and moving around again but on the other hand I think people are tired of being cooped up and to the extent that they've got the flexibility and the economic wherewithal to do it they're going to want to travel and Hawaii is going to be an appealing place like it always is but even more so now perhaps because this is a place where the effects of this horrible disease haven't ravaged it as much. So I think that is the environment we're facing. It'll evolve a lot in the next little while and I don't think you can expect a summer of 80s and 90s load factor like we have in normal times but I do think there's an opportunity for us to build once we are able to open up again.\nBrent Overbeek: Hey Hunter, it's Brent.\nHunter Keay: Hey Brent.\nBrent Overbeek: I think Peter's comments are right on point in terms of the most important element will really be kind of the timing in terms of relaxation of the quarantine. We do have a bit more of a base built just given our booking curve relative to other folks, I think some of that is clearly at risk depending on what happens in terms of timing of the quarantine. I think speaking the kind of consumer behavior we've still seen some interest in terms of bookings in 3Q but more of that has probably started to shift out in the in 4Q. Obviously that subject to change based on what we see around the timing and any relaxation of the quarantine and I would say it's the only other thing at this point is it's probably the domestic market seems to be holding up a little greater interest under international markets at this point. \nPeter Ingram: And just one last thought I'd add Hunter and there's no precise way to measure this but one of the things we've been thinking about and as we discuss it with people in the community, we're anxious that we don't open too soon and too fast either because when the quarantine is removed and we start having more economic activity we'd like it to stay removed and to continue to have economic activity and not to have to toggle back and forth restrictions because I think that would be very destructive to consumer intent and demand if there was uncertainty about what the conditions were going to be. So we want to be thoughtful about this. We want the state and local and federal officials to be thoughtful about how they manage this and hopefully we can as a community we can work through that balance in the period ahead and get things to a point where we have something that more resembles what it was in the past, although I don't think we go back to things like they used to be right any time in the near term.\nHunter Keay: Right. Thanks guys. And then in the last recession Hawaiian decided that you guys needed to really diversify the network which you did. Do you see something like that happening after this recession is over?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Look I think there will be a number of things that this opens up our eyes about and perhaps in the long term has us thinking about them differently. I don't think those and I'm not going to give you everything that's rattling through my head as I think about that right now but I would say, I don't think those are 2020-2021 sort of decisions but I think this is something I sure wasn't smart enough to see coming and it does cause you to step back and pause and say are there things you could have had in place to have helped a little bit to manage through something like that and does that change how we think about our business for the long term and those are things once we get a little bit more solid ground under our feet, I'm sure we will spend some time thinking about.\nHunter Keay: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator and thank you very much Peter and Shannon and Brent for your time. So here's my one, I have two questions actually. My first question is in the press release, you said that you have 7500 people and then you say that half took the leaves. Is that, does that mean that 3,700 took the leaves or does that mean you had 15,000 and now you have 7500 left?\nPeter Ingram: No, we have 7500, we have roughly 7500 employees at the company. About half of those employees, a little more than half of those employees have taken some form of voluntary option and those voluntary options range from people taking leaves that range from two weeks at a time to six months at a time. It includes crew members taking reduced schedules that involve a reduction of hours and not working. So it's a variety of different things that add up to half of the 7,500 people participating and driving some pretty significant and important savings for us.\nHelane Becker: Okay and then my other question is just an explanation from I guess Shannon on the taxes where you have the tax and you talked about the tax related to the CARES Act. I kind of was surprised to see that in the first quarter as opposed to the second quarter. So I was kind of wondering if you could just explain that to me?\nShannon Okinaka: Right. So yes, there's a lot going on the tax piece and this is related to income taxes not ticket taxes, I believe Helane you are referring to. So our effective tax rate looks really odd this quarter because the CARES Act, if you recall the test release and dockets at back in, it seems like a long time ago, eliminated the tax laws carried back, you could only carry forward your losses but with the CARES Act you can now carry it back. So when we implemented the previous tax as we had to lower all of our tax related items to the new tax rates. So if you recall we were more at a 35% -- 38% tax rate and then we went down to a 21 percent-ish but now that we're carrying it back to those previous years, we get the benefit of the higher tax rate. So it's just the deferred tax assets being revalued. So it's on the income taxes not ticket taxes and it's just the result of being able to carry the losses back.\nHelane Becker: Great. Okay. Thanks Shannon. I just didn't understand what happened there. So I appreciate it and actually I am good with the rest of my questions for now. Thank you.\nShannon Okinaka: Great. Thank you, Helane.\nOperator: The next question comes from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hi everyone. Thank you so much for the time. So just a couple of quick ones here. On your current wide-body fleet, understanding you can't, you're not in a place to discuss your order book but any thoughts on how you're going to redeploy your current wide-bodies in your fleet, in the event that the rebound in demand your international routes to Asia-Pac is more extended than the rebound in the domestic U.S., just any thoughts there? I realize you said that you would reduce utilization likely rather than retire any aircraft in the fleet. So just wondering like how are you thinking about incorporating those potentially into your domestic network or should we expect to see some of those remain grounded over the medium term? Thanks.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. So Catherine you broke up a little bit but I think the question was about how we're thinking about redeploying the wide-bodies in particular the international network doesn't fully rebound and that is a good question and I think it is, is one for which the answer in the short to medium term might end up being different than the answer in the longer term. And of course in the longer term we do have more retirement capabilities because as we get out a couple of years we've got some lease returns coming up, lease termination opportunities coming up which would allow us to make different decisions about how many total we want to have. I think certainly -- the virtually I think all of our international flying requires us to have the range of the wide-body aircraft. So that's all wide-body. If we need less for the international piece of the business there are some places domestically where the demand is deep enough but it might benefit from that and where we have demand for cargo that helps but I think I can tell you we're going to be very mindful of not just forcing capacity into markets where there is not demand just because we have aircrafts available and so that is where we would play the utilization card to make sure we're matching supply and demand in an appropriate basis for whatever market conditions are going to be a few months down the road. Brent anything to add to that?\nBrent Overbeek: No. I think that covers. So I think we've got depending on how things evolve, the ability to particularly use Honolulu as a hub and be able to leverage the cargo capabilities that Peter mentioned on the 330s and connecting to our neighbor island network I think give us some unique opportunities should the opportunities exist but I think lot of things to stipulate as Peter mentioned.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. Maybe one quick follow-up to that one and then I have a second one but when do those lease terminations on wide-bodies start to happen?\nPeter Ingram: We've got some starting in about 2022, I believe.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Great. And then maybe just on your air traffic liability, it seems like over the past from airlines we've heard from so far most have been noting that very little of their March quarter end ETL will be subject to further cash refunds with the majority that's left for future travel going to wind up as vouchers. Is that similar for Hawaiian or is there something we should be keeping in mind with respect to your fairly large percentage of tickets sold internationally and just being that the majority of those are foreign point of sale? Thanks.\nPeter Ingram: So I don't know exactly what it looks like for other carriers. So I'll just speak to what ours is. The biggest susceptibility of that to refund is when we cancel flying and don't have a real combination option for people and our policy is that when we do not operate the flight, we provide a refund weather and if a guest were to call us back having changed their own and then we subsequently cancel the flight, our policy is that we will refund and so to the extent in particular that the quarantine order extends out further and it doesn't make sense for us to operate as much of our schedule then we have some exposure to the future refunds. Shannon and Brent and their teams have spent a ton of time on this. So let me just see if they have any other comments to add to that.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. I would just add a little bit, if you look at our network structure versus some of the other carriers, there are many routes that we fly once per day which makes us really difficult to re-accommodate people when we have like the quarantine restrictions. If you have quite a route that flies 5, 10 times a day, you can reduce a significant portion of that capacity but still be able to re-accommodate passengers. So I would just say do our size and our network in our frequencies, it becomes a little harder to re-accommodate and again we are balancing our cash needs with the needs of our guests because we needed people to want to come back to us once the quarantine is lifted. That's all I will add.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. And we did ,we have done things as Shannon mentioned in her remarks as well to provide more flexibility for people who do want to travel with this in the future. So extending the time period over what you can use your credits gives people a little bit more flexibility and certainty and some of those have been successful. So we're certainly mindful of it. We're managing it as best we can.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. That makes sense. Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Sure.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMike Linenberg: Hey everyone. Hey Peter the comments that you made about sort of re-phasing in the introduction of the 787, can you talk about just because I know you haven't put out your [K] yet but what pre-delivery deposits you currently have with Boeing and I know Shannon I think you even mentioned that 787 PDPs were part of your CapEx for this year. What's the magnitude of that?\nPeter Ingram: I don't know that the Q will have a specific number that you're going to be able to see on that. It's a material number and this is as we look at the things that single decisions that have a very material impact on our cash flow over the next 12 to 24 months, this is the biggest single one we can manage.\nSpeaker: Yes, that's what I thought.\nPeter Ingram: We're not doing this for a couple of dollars and we do want those airplanes absolutely for the long term.\nShannon Okinaka: And I would just say Mike that we continue to include it in our model until we feel like we've progressed with Boeing far enough to be able to take it out. So most of our models, if not all have the PDPs still in there which is why I reported it the way I did.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. No, that's super helpful. Then just my second question and maybe this is Peter and maybe even Brent I sort of think back in times past when we hit a demand crisis. It was always tougher for an airline like Hawaiian where was just the narrow bodies were neighbor island and wide bodies were long haul and Hawaii West Coast and yet here we are facing a significant fall of in demand and yet you have the perfect vehicle here the A321neo which would be a great airplane as you ramp up back into service. Except for potentially one issue which is, this whole social distancing mandate and I'm still trying to square whether or not an A320neo from Hawaii to the West Coast is a more cost-effective way to get there based on where demand is and yet incorporating the aspects of social distancing i.e. how many people can you actually fit on a small narrow body and trying to separate them out whether it's one per row or two per row versus a wide-body and so I'm sure you're going through that analysis right now about what's the right airplane in a perfect, a normal garden-variety recession hands down you would want to use the A321neo as you started to rebuild your schedule but now it just doesn't seem clear to me. So I'm just I'm curious sort of your thoughts on that. Anything? Thanks. Appreciate taking the time.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. It's an interesting question. I think we're not alone in having introduced policies and procedures to provide a little bit more distance for people on the airplane when they're traveling right now. But right now that is obviously an easier thing to do when across the industry people are carrying load factors that we are absolutely unfamiliar with in recent history certainly. I do think our expectation is that long term some of the distancing is not particularly sustainable. Maybe I'm not creative enough in thinking about different models but I am pretty decent with math and I kind of understand if we had an industry that had 10% pre-tax profit margins roughly at a time period when we were operating load factors in the high 80s that if you just without fairs going way-way up and moving the demand curve, you've got to have pretty full airplanes to have a sustainable industry and that math works for Hawaiian airlines. That math works for every airline that we compete with. So I think we've got to separate a little bit some of the things that are going in place right now while the entire world is in the throes of this crisis and what we evolve to as communities throughout the country and throughout the world are able to get the spread of this disease under control and we can start to relax some of the restrictions that we're putting in place in various aspects of our lives. \nMike Linenberg: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks everyone.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve O'Hara from Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nSteve O'Hara: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious maybe longer-term if you think about the industry overall, assuming demand comes back slowly but maybe steadily, I mean what do you, in terms of the competitive landscape and maybe the capacity that's out there, I mean, would you, give a feeling as to the size of the industry maybe versus what you might think normally in terms of capacity or do you think I mean, I would think there would be some change in service levels for markets that may be non-essential to somebody corporations route structure or business but I'm just kind of curious how you think about it longer-term?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I will make a couple of observations and then see if anyone else in the room wants to chime in. I think making a spot estimate on the percentage change in the size of the industry with all the uncertainty right now is sort of fraught with peril, I think and that's why we're modeling out a variety of scenarios, so we understand how we respond in our different scenarios but we just don't have enough certainty right now to say, it's going to be X percent smaller than it was. And I think that pertains to the markets we serve as well as air travel markets more generally. I do think that in terms of the competitive environment to, from and within Hawaii. My view has not really changed from what I would have told you six months ago that as we were, we've spent time the good old days when we talked about competition as oppose to how we were doing to raise liquidity. I would have told you six months ago and I did tell you six months ago that I didn't expect any our competitors to just abandon flying to Hawaii. I thought it would be part of their networks and they would continue to compete and I still feel the same way about that and I think it's just a question of what amount of flying is going through makes sense in the environment that we are competing in. And I read that because that's little bit different than 2008 \u2013 2009, when we were responding to the global financial crisis when there were a couple of carrier serving Hawaii at that time but seized flying altogether in the span of about one week. And that meant that there was little adjustments needed by the other participants in this particular part of the market. In fact, in 2008 Hawaiian Airlines was one of the few carriers in the world that actually grew at the time of the overall airline industry was in pretty severe contraction mode. So I don't think given the strength of the carriers that we have in the markets whether it\u2019s U.S. carriers or international carriers that we are going to see something like that whether it's a wholesale withdrawal from the market but I think people are going to have to adjust as demand is going to be different and how different I don't know yet but people are going to have to adjust to a different environment.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. No that's very helpful and then maybe just going back to Shannon's question or I am sorry, Shannon's commentary on liquidity was that including some action by Boeing or was that excluding that I wasn't sure if that was what she said?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. I think you are referring to my comments about ending the second quarter with  billion dollars in cash. If that\u2019s the piece it doesn't include any action Boeing. I have taken contractual obligations from that perspective.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Peter Ingram for any closing remarks.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo again to everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest. Aloha.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alanna James, Managing Director of IR. Thank you. You may begin.\nAlanna James: Thank you, Sherry. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. Here with me in Honolulu are Peter Ingram, President and Chief Executive Officer; Shannon Okinaka, Chief Financial Officer; and Brent Overbeek, Senior Vice President of Revenue Management and Network Planning. We also have several other members of our management team in the room for the Q&A. Peter will open the call with an overview of the business. Next, Brent will share an update on our revenue performance and outlook. Shannon will then discuss our cost performance and outlook. We will then open up the call for questions, and Peter will end with some closing remarks. By now, everyone should have access to the press release that went out at about 4 o\u2019clock Eastern Time today. If you've not received the release, it is available on the Investor Relations page of our website, hawaiianairlines.com. During our call today, we will refer at times to adjusted or non-GAAP numbers and metrics. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers and metrics can be found at the end of today's press release posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. As a reminder, the following prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our future plans and potential future financial and operating performance. Management may also make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer you to Hawaiian Holdings' recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. This includes the most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K as well as subsequent reports filed on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo, Alanna. Aloha everyone, happy New Year and thank you for joining us today. As you have seen in our press release today, our fantastic team continued to execute well this quarter and we posted adjusted net income of $45.9 million and adjusted EPS of $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter. For the full year of 2019, we posted adjusted net income of $218.9 million, adjusted EPS of $4.60 per share and adjusted pre-tax margin of 10.5%. This is a very good performance overall in light of the heightened competitive capacity environment we experienced throughout 2019. We delivered double-digit adjusted pre-tax margin in the year where we faced elevated competition within the Hawaiian Islands, between North America and Hawaii and from Japan. Delivering this financial performance is a testament to the competitive advantages that we have built in each of these geographies, giving us great confidence about our ability to continue to execute well in the years ahead. Our focus has been and will continue to be on what we can do to make our airline better at serving our guests. My thanks as always goes out to the 7,400 outstanding professionals throughout the operation and in the back office for keeping us competition fit, running the best operation in the business and delivering aloha to our guests day-in and day-out. I look forward to sharing the financial rewards for their accomplishments later this quarter when we deliver profit sharing and balanced scorecard payments to our team. At our last Investor Day, in December 2018, we outlined several priorities that would be the focus for the next several years. And as I reflect back on 2019, I'm proud of whatever our team has accomplished. We delivered products, our guests value with the introduction of Main Cabin Basic, the launch of new nonstop service to Boston and Fukuoka and the expansion of our North American network with the A321neo, the most fuel efficient airplane operating between the West Coast and Hawaii. Thanks to the A321neo, which now number 17 in our fleet, we have expanded our Maui hub to serve nine Western U.S. destinations. We advanced our aspiration to make travel effortless by improving our guests day of travel experience. We launched our new mobile app and renovated the lobbies of our Neighbor Island airports, replacing outdated kiosks. And then just recently in the fourth quarter, we completed the first phase of our Honolulu terminal one makeover with new kiosks on the initial phase of a transformative lobby redesign. These investments are already starting to pay off through improved net promoter scores and a more relaxed check-in experience for our guests. We made significant progress towards improving our cost competitiveness and we are solidly on a path to achieving $100 million in structural cost reductions by 2021. And we've been building the foundation for our future with investments in fleet technology and process redesign. We took delivery of six A321neos in 2019, executed lease extensions on three A330 aircraft during the year and in the fourth quarter we executed lease extensions on five Boeing 717 aircraft. Let me pause here for a moment and elaborate on the 717 lease extensions which were executed at the end of the year. We operate 20 717s in our fleet, 15 of which are HA owned and financially unencumbered and five of which are leased. We're often asked about our plans for 717 replacement and we usually answer that there is no plane flying today that is better suited for the unique missions we fly in the Neighbor Island network than the 717 based on its size, economics and durability. By extending our 717 leases to the middle of the decade, we are indicating that we are not planning to replace this fleet in the next five years. Concurrently, we've agreed to extend the power-by-the-hour agreement related to this fleet\u2019s engines and are planning to have a 717 flight simulator moved to Honolulu to allow us to do all of our simulator training at our home base. We'll continue to monitor options for the latter part of the decade, but for now we see no need to deploy our capital to replace these aircrafts. As we accomplished all of this in 2019, we continued to focus relentlessly on delivering authentic Hawaiian hospitality to our guests and executing our network missions better than our competitors. Looking forward into 2020, as you have seen in our guidance today, we are forecasting a challenging quarter from a revenue perspective. Brent and Shannon will elaborate on the guidance in a bit, but I wanted to take a moment to provide some important context. Based on current scheduled projections, the first quarter features our highest year-over-year increases in competitive capacity during 2020. The North America to Hawaii market has already absorbed a significant amount of industry capacity over the last two years with more to come in 2020 and in the Neighbor Islands, we have the recent entry of new competitive service in Hilo and Lihue while we have not yet lapped last year's entry, a new entry in Maui and Kona. Compounding this, the first quarter is typically the seasonally most challenging for our roots, so it's a tough environment to stimulate demand for the additional capacity. As we progress through 2020, the year-over-year competitive capacity changes are projected to moderate based on current schedules and seasonality becomes more favorable. So we will have a different backdrop as the year progresses. A challenging quarter does not dim our view that we have a winning formula and we will succeed in the long-term. Providing evidence to support this confidence, the recently released DLT revenue numbers for the third quarter of 2019 show that our North America PRASM premium versus our competitors increased yet again despite two years of above trend industry capacity growth and the fact that our results for this period did not yet reflect the addition of Main Cabin Basic to our product lineup. Our focus is on what we can control and the execution of our strategy with even greater proficiency. We will maintain our focus on the needs of travelers to from and within Hawaii, we have the right aircraft for each mission in our network, we will continue to strengthen our already competitive cost structure and we will continue to deliver authentic Hawaiian hospitality that our guests value every day. On top of this, the financial resilience that we have built in recent years allows us to invest for the long-term and withstand short-term macro pressures. 2020 will bring to a close our current A321neo expansion as we take delivery of our 18th A321neo in March and we will ramp up our preparations for our next phase of growth with the 787. We'll also continue our investment in improving our guest day of travel experience and we will deliver structural cost savings through our cost transformation initiative. 2020 also brings more growth in our successful Japan franchise with the addition of our third daily frequency from Haneda airport in Tokyo. Let me provide you an update on where we are with our application for antitrust immunity with Japan Airlines. We submitted our response to the DOT show-cause order on November 12th and our submission focused on a few main themes. We outlined the specific information technology investments that we are making to ensure that we can rapidly achieve the public benefits of the partnership, we expanded the geographic scope of the joint venture to the extent feasible given the nature of our network, We committed to using our partnership to grow service between Japan and Hawaii and we clarified the importance of achieving antitrust immunity in realizing the full public benefits of our growth strategy. Our submission is currently being evaluated by the DOT. And while there is no set time table, we expect a response within the next several weeks. If we are granted antitrust immunity, we expect to implement the JV towards the end of 2020. Japan continues to be an integral part of our growth strategy and we look to deepening our partnership JAL if we are granted ATI. I feel great about what the future holds for Hawaiian Airlines. We just celebrated our 90th anniversary in November and had a chance to honor the legacy of generations of employees, who built our terrific airline. As we enter our 10th decade, I'm excited that our team has never been stronger and that our business is built for us to compete and win over the long-term, irrespective of the competitive challenges we may face from time to time. We look forward to sharing more with you about our future plans at our upcoming Investor Day in March. And with that, let me turn the call over to Brent to talk about our revenue performance.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter, and hello, hi everyone. I'd like to echo Peter's sentiments and want to thank my colleagues for all their great work in 2019 and doing such a wonderful job of taking care of our guests over the past year. We wrapped up another strong quarter fueled by robust demand across our network. Our top-line revenue was up 1.5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter while RASM was down 2.1%, which was in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. Once again, our fourth quarter results reflect the strength of our diversified network as yield pressure from competitive capacity increases in our domestic network, but partially offset by strong performance in our international business. For the fourth quarter, industry capacity was up 9% North America and almost 12% in Neighbor Island, which contributed to yield pressure during the quarter and resulted in a year-over-year decline in domestic PRASM of roughly 6%. Part of the industry capacity growth in North America was from our own increase in A321neo service as we launched new service from Maui to Las Vegas during the quarter and expanded our breadth of service in key West Coast markets with service at different time channels. We are encouraged by the performance of these new services so far and expect them to continue to develop into 2020. We're also really happy with the performance of our Main Cabin Basic product which we rolled out across our North American network early in the fourth quarter. Given where we were in the booking curve when we launched the product the revenue impact for the quarter wasn\u2019t that significant, however it did exceed our expectations. While we are working on optimizing the product offering we are confident that we will be at least at the high-end of our $15 million to $25 million range for Main Cabin Basic once we reach steady state. And we'll be happy to share more details about our expectations for the product at our Investor Day in March. As Peter mentioned, we recently received DOT data to calculate our relative revenue performance for the year ending September, 2019 and our revenue premium in West Coast markets continued to expand. This once again demonstrates the strength of our North American network focused on the Hawaii traveler and our optimally configured aircraft. While the commercial team accomplished a great deal in 2019, we know we have much work ahead of us in 2020. Industry capacity between North America and Hawaii is expected to increase sequentially and it will be up 11% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2020. However, based on currently published schedules, it appears that the first quarter shouldn't be the high-water mark in terms of industry capacity growth. Our Neighbor Islands network saw continued yield pressure during the fourth quarter consistent with increased competitive capacity and persistent promotional pricing in the market. The outlook for industry capacity accelerates as we move into the first quarter with a 26% increase in year-over-year capacity, which will continue to put downward pressure on RASM. Overall demand for Neighbor Island travel remains solid and we're competing from position of strength in this geography with our schedule breadth, local loyalty program and superior ability to recover quickly from operational disruption. Once again, strength in our international geography in the fourth quarter helped offset pressures in domestic. We had another great quarter in international with PRASM up 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year PRASM improvement. Again, our Premium Cabin continued to perform well on international routes during the quarter with PRASM up 11% year-over-year We continued to grow our successful Japan franchise during the quarter with the launch of new service to Fukuoka, Japan in November. And we're off to a great start in Fukuoka and are encouraged by the performance of the route. Given our familiarity with Japan, the strength of our brand there, we expect this new service to mature quickly. We also launched sales of our third Tokyo Haneda to Honolulu service, which begins operating at the end of March. We're excited to continue to grow our Japan franchise through a partnership with Japan airlines and look forward to a positive response from the DOT regarding our application for antitrust immunity. Our value-added revenue streams had another strong quarter with value-added revenue per passenger up 10% year-over-year. I'm pleased to confirm that we surpassed our $100 million target and generated $107 million in extra comfort and preferred seat revenue in 2019. Revenue from the sale of Hawaiian miles also had strong performance in the quarter contributing meaningfully to our value-added revenue per passenger and we look forward to sharing more details on our growth expectations for loyalty revenue at our upcoming Investor Day. Cargo revenue for the quarter was down 9% year-over-year due to the continued macro economic conditions in Asia impacting exports from the region. Now looking ahead to 2020, we expect our year-over-year capacity to increase between 5.5% and 8.5% for the full-year 2020, with the largest increase taking place in the first quarter where we expect year-over-year capacity to increase between 7.5% and 10.5%. Our capacity increases in 2020 are largely driven by the annualization of new services launched in 2019 as well as our third Haneda to Honolulu frequency which starts in March. Our first quarter capacity is also a little higher than we had initially planned due to some short term up-gauges for operational reasons. For the first quarter, we expect RASM to be down between 4.5% and 7.5%. The sequential slowing of our RASM in the first quarter is driven by the elevated industry's capacity environment. The increase in our networks weighted average stage length, short term headwinds and fuel surcharge comparisons and the close in up-gauges that I mentioned. The first quarter is historically the lowest demand quarter of the year and there are a lot of seats coming into the market during low demand months. As we look out further into 2020, the increase in industry capacity tapers-off as we lap some of the ads of 2019 and we expect that seasonally stronger demand will help absorb some of the additional capacity. Our focus in 2020 will be to ensure we mature developing routes, continue to monetize our premium seat investments, grow the benefits from our Main Cabin Basic product and expand our partnership with Japan Airlines. We're excited about the future here at Hawaiian Airlines and we're planning for our next phase of growth with our 787s while strengthening our revenue generating capability with meaningful revenue improvement initiatives. I'm confident in our ability to continue to withstand competitive pressures through our diversified network focused on the Hawaii traveler and unmatched guest experience delivered with authentic Hawaiian hospitality. We look forward to providing more details on our future plans and revenue initiatives at our upcoming Investor Day in March. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks Brent. Hello everyone. Hau'oli Makahiki Hou, Happy New Year. I'll start with a brief recap of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. Today we reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $45.9 million or $0.99 per share and adjusted pretax margin of 8.9%. For the full year 2019, we reported adjusted net income of $218.9 million, adjusted EPS of $4.60 and adjusted pretax margin of 10.5%. As Peter mentioned, it's a strong result given our competitive landscape. In the fourth quarter CASM ex fuel and items increased 0.8% year-over-year, which was at the favorable end of our guidance range. As several anticipated expenses for the quarter came in lower than forecasted. Our economic fuel cost per gallon for the fourth quarter was $2.05 and our fuel consumption came in at the favorable end of our guidance range, which helped to offset some of the increase in fuel price. As in prior quarters we continue to see benefits from our A321neo fleet transition. As our fuel consumption grew only 1% year-over-year on a 3.7% increase in capacity highlighting the fuel efficiency of this aircraft. Additionally, in the fourth quarter we returned more than $23 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We bought back $18 million of outstanding shares, leaving approximately $29 million remaining of our current $100 million authorization. For the full-year 2019, we bought back 5.2% of our shares outstanding and when coupled with our quarterly dividends returned more than $91 million to shareholders. On the financing front, as Peter highlighted earlier, we executed lease extensions on five Boeing 717 aircraft, which will provide significant cost savings while securing our Neighbor Island fleet into the middle of this decade. As part of the transaction, we're also bringing a 717 full flight training simulator to Hawaii, which will allow us to centralize all pilot training in Honolulu and further reduce our costs. During the fourth quarter, we continued to make good progress on our cost transformation initiative. For the full year 2019, we achieved $26 million in benefits from our structural cost savings and have included a little over $60 million in our cost guidance for 2020. We're on track to achieve our $100 million structural cost reduction target in 2021 and our teams are actively engaged in evaluating additional opportunities for further savings in the future. We plan to lay out the details of our cost transformation program at our Investor Day in March. Looking ahead, to 2020 we expect the CASM ex-fuel on items to be down between 1.5% and 4.5% for the first quarter of 2020. Our year-over-year CASM ex performance will vary throughout the year, largely driven by the timing of maintenance events. For the full-year 2020, we expect CASM ex-fuel and items to be between down 2.5% and up 0.5%. This includes headwinds from the initiation of a A330 landing gear overhauls and 787 fleet transition costs offset by the maintenance cost benefit associated with a higher mix of A321neo flying as well as lower A330 and 717 aircraft ownership costs. Our CASM ex guidance for 2020 includes the expected benefit from our cost transformation initiatives, but as in the past does not include any assumptions relating to the amendable contract with our flight attendants union. We're eager to bring these negotiations to a close and reach an agreement which recognizes the contributions of our flight attendants to our company's success while maintaining our cost competitiveness for the long term. We're also entering into negotiations with the IAM, which represents our airport employees and mechanics among other employee groups. Although, the IAM contracts are not amendable until January of 2021 we have agreed with IAM to work toward reaching a new contract prior to the amendable date. It's also important to note that the CASM ex fuel metric does not reflect the benefit of increased fuel efficiency from our A321neo transition, but includes the increased ownership cost of the new airplanes. Keeping fuel price constant, the fuel efficiency benefit is expected to bring another half point of overall CASM improvement year-over-year at the midpoint of our guidance. Based on the fuel curve as of January 28th, our economic fuel cost is estimated to be $1.97 for the first quarter and $1.85 for the full year of 2020. As of December 31, 2019 consistent with our policy, we've hedged approximately 50% of our projected fuel requirements for the first quarter of 2020. Our CapEx for the full year 2020 is expected to be between $220 million and $260 million, which includes our 18th and final A321neo delivery, predelivery payments for a 787s and facilities and information technology investments. Overall, I'm pleased with our financial performance in 2019 and I'm optimistic about our future. We have a resilient business capable of producing solid returns in the face of increased competition. We have a strong balance sheet and we're well positioned for long term success. I look forward to seeing you in person and giving you more details on our future plans at our Investor Day in March. This concludes our prepared remarks and I'll now turn the call back over to Alanna.\nAlanna James: Thank you Peter, Shannon and Brent and we'd like to thank all of you for joining us today and for your continued interest in Hawaiian Holdings. We are now ready for questions from the analysts. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and if needed, one follow-up question. Sherry, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steve O'Hara with Sidoti. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve O'Hara: Yes. Hi. Good afternoon.\nPeter Ingram: Hi, Steve.\nSteve O'Hara: Hi. If you could, I guess in terms of the expected decline in revenue in the first quarter, is there a way to kind of talk about how much of that you think is self-inflicted in that you have a lot more capacity growth or something like that where you're adding capacity to the market versus what's being added to the market.\nPeter Ingram: Let me start on that, Steve, and then I'll hand it over to Brent to provide a little bit of detail. I think the situation you're seeing is a function of primarily of industry capacity growth. We've got something on the order of mid-twenties percent capacity growth from the industry in the Neighbor Island part of the network, which is still not having lapped the entry of service of a competitor into Maui and Kona last year. And then new service at Lihue and Hilo this year. Our Neighbor Island capacity is basically flat. So, in the context of your question, there's, there's really no impact there from our capacity actions, but it is a substantial industry capacity increase. I think, North America, which is North of 50% of our overall revenue, we do have some capacity growth, our investments have been performing well and \u2013 but we have seen industry growth as well. So, maybe Brent if you want to add any more color to that.\nBrent Overbeek: I think, we would grow more in North America in 1Q than we will the rest of the year and that's largely a function of timing of aircraft deliveries. And so, our North American growth rate will just taper off, as we get in 2Q and see if that's really just a function of timing as and when aircraft entered the fleet this year and last year.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just on the, I guess it was, kind of on the tech side with the JAL JV and the issues there. Can you just talk about, are these substantial investments that need to be made, and will they be made anyway, regardless of whether the JV is approved? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yeah. Let me talk about that. There were, when we go back to the show cause order that the DOT issued in the third quarter of last year, there were a number of things that they highlighted as wanting to see additional evidence from ourselves and JAL before they were prepared to grant anti-trust immunity. And, specifically those related to there were a number of them that related to technology and its technology in the context of things like, seamlessly transferring, connecting passengers between two airlines or having last seat availability on our website for connecting trips on JAL. These are the sort of IT capabilities that carriers that are part of global alliances have typically made investments over time and have in place. And in our case, entering into our partnership with JAL, we have not had a sufficient business case to justify those investments over time. The opportunity to deepen our partnership with JAL gives us the ability to have that business case.  And certainly that is further bolstered by the potential for antitrust immunity. We made some of those investments over the course of 2019. We're continuing to invest now, so we're building the capabilities. I think some of this is, if anything, it's an acceleration of an investment. And so would have been sensible for us in the long term and it just makes sense in the context of where we are with the partnership with JAL to accelerate those investment into the near term and prioritize them over other IT investments we might've been making this year.\nOperator: Our next question is from a Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nHunter Keay: Hi everybody.\nPeter Ingram: Hi Hunter.\nHunter Keay: Hey Peter. I noticed if I'm not mistaken, I think you bought those 10, 787s, like three weeks before you announced the JAL JV. So, I'm kind of, I know the JV is really more about growth and not pricing. So, the question is really how does the lack of a JV impact the decision potentially keep those planes and really do you need all 10 in the event that you can't get ATI and go forward with it?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, I'd say the timing of the order and I don't remember exactly when the time of the order was vis-\u00e0-vis the joint venture announcement. But really the 787 investment and the JAL JV are really independent. When we ordered the 787s that was an investment in an aircraft that we expect to be flying for the next couple of decades. I suspect we'll over time end up with more than 10, not just 10 aircraft. It is an aircraft that works well throughout our network today. When on routes like a Honolulu to New York, Honolulu to Sydney, a variety of our routes into Japan that would be the ideal aircraft with or without a JAL JV. So, I don't think there's any question that we feel very good. If we had, if we had to go in a time machine and see if we'd make the same decision again, I think we would make exactly the same decision again on the 787s. As far as, the right number, one of the things we've highlighted over time is, we have structured, over time our lease expirations and other opportunities to alter the size of the fleet. With regards to the 787s coming in and the potential for a A330-200 to go out in a way that allows us to within a range dial our capacity growth up or dial our capacity growth down in a way that allows us to match, supply of our product in the marketplace with the demand that exists out there. So we feel really good about where we are in that context.\nHunter Keay: Okay, thanks. And then, Brent, if I'm not mistaken, correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like you loaded some A321s on the Inter Island. Can you talk about that decision? Is this something that we should expect to continue or is this one of the \u2013 that to get back to that operational comment you made before earlier in your prepared remarks?\nBrent Overbeek: That is \u2013 thanks Hunter. It has actually attracted a unique amount of curiosity. It's not anything strategic that we're looking at changing. Frankly, as we were adding our Las Vegas-Maui service and adding some frequency into Honolulu, Seattle, we needed a bit of a bridge to get that airplane back and forth, as it is serving those two markets. And so, each direction, one direction each day a week, it's going back and forth and we've, we elected to do the scheduled service and it sits conveniently out of Maui in the heart of our bank there. So it provides some more connecting opportunity into here. But it's not any strategic shift, it's just a function of how we're routing airplanes and how we deployed our 17th, A321.\nHunter Keay: Got it. Thank you so much.\nPeter Ingram: Okay, thanks Hunter.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please proceed. \nDan McKenzie: Hey, thanks. A couple of questions here. So, I know you discontinued service to China in the first quarter of last year and you don't serve Hong Kong. But I wonder if you can size the revenue from that inbound demand that either comes through Japan, either directly or on your flights or via your relationship with JAL.\nPeter Ingram: Yes, it's, so it was actually, I believe it was the fall of 2018 that we suspended our service to Beijing. So, we've been out of that for about a year and a half. And part of that, the reason for that was that the business case for a direct service to China always relied on the market growing. And while we had seen growth it hadn't grown at a pace sufficient with delivering, returns on our investment and so we left the market at that time. Today we have very limited, service from China. And candidly, there's very limited service overall, very limited amount of the overall tourism in Hawaii is from China. I think I heard someone last night from the Hawaii tourism authority quoting a number of 1% or less than 1% of the overall visitors in Hawaii are from China. So it's a small part of the market today. I think in the long term there is still, an argument to be made that China is going to be a more important source of demand. But, as we sit here in 2020, it is really not a significant piece of Hawaii tourism overall and certainly not a significant piece of our business.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Understood. Okay, good. Another question here, just given the status of the buyback program and the dividend, I wonder if you can provide maybe a finer point on capital returns this year in what you might be targeting exactly. And I guess, what that might depend on and so I guess what I'm getting at is just given where the market cap is, are you inclined or are you considering, potentially accelerating the stock buyback program or potentially even augmenting it?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Let me, let me start with that, Dan, and then I'll see if Shannon wants to add any comments on top of mine. I think what broadly, when we think about deployment of free cash and we do expect to generate free cash flow this year and have some to deploy. We think about it in the context of what opportunities do we have to invest in our business that we believe can deliver returns in excess of our cost of capital. And that is typically our first priority and then beyond that, we look at opportunities to reduce debt and in the broad category of debt, I would also add to that things like paying down pension liabilities. And then we look at opportunities to return capital to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends. And I think we try and keep those balanced. It has not been our practice to accelerate, rapidly and to try the time the market on that. We are a little bit more, systemic about that in how we have treated it over time. But, that's sort of a high level philosophy around how we think about that. I think one of the other things we're mindful of, sometimes is it sometimes it makes sense to just hold a little cash because we're looking forward into capital needs in the coming years and rather than deploying it all and having to go and fundraise to get that money back in the future. We want to make sure we're thinking about the next couple of years ahead and just not 2020. Shannon, anything you'd add to that?\nShannon Okinaka: No, I mean, I would just add that, in 2019 we bought back a little over 5% of our total outstanding shares. Since 2015, we bought back almost 18% of our total outstanding shares. So, I think we've done quite a bit in this arena and we'll continue to look at it as Peter mentioned in a balanced way.\nDan McKenzie: Very good. And I'm wondering if I can squeeze one last one in here. On the $100 million in cost savings initiatives, it looks like the better end of the full year guide for CASM ex fuel in 2020 implies that it could fall 2.5%. And I'm just wondering, if that, that down 2.5% that better into the guide factors in the full cost savings or if there is or what that might sort of include exactly.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks Dan. It includes about $60 million of cost savings. And part of that is dependent on the timing of when we execute certain initiatives. So, it can be more if we can get it done quicker or you know, but we've built in about $60 million into the guide.\nDan McKenzie: Very good.\nPeter Ingram: And so Dan the $60 million, corresponds roughly to the midpoint of the guide. And I think the range around that is really just capturing the fact that, we're only a month into the year and there's some variability that, can exist both favorably and unfavorably on some of these numbers.\nDan McKenzie: Understood. Okay. Thanks for the time guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hi everyone Thanks so much for the time. So Brent, one for you I was just wondering what was the premium seat growth in 2019 and then what does that look like for this year? And then part two of that is what should we think of as the biggest driver of revenue growth for 2020 outside of capacity? Would that be either both basic economy or is there maybe some further fine tuning on some of the pricing of premium seats? Thanks.\nPeter Ingram: Katie, I don't have the premium seat numbers in front of us in front of me. We'll follow up with you on that. As I look out into 2020, I really see kind of multiple areas of growth. You alluded to the growth of Main Cabin Basic, the product is off to a really good start where we'll spend some more time talking about that at Investor Day. We're encouraged with the initial results, we're going to continue to fine tune that product as we look at its applicability across our network. So, I would say that that is one, I think we've got some continued improvement in optimization in the front cabin we've had multiple years of successful growth there. I think we still have some room in front of us, to continue to improve performance for that product. And then I would say we've got some opportunities as well, around ancillary product optimization. And we'll talk a little bit more about that at Investor Day as well.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Got it. And then actually two more for you Brent. So, you shared what total domestic RASM was, but can you just talk about the breakout between North American Inter Island and then also maybe a bit of a follow-up to Dan McKenzie's question, but have you seen any discernible falls in bookings from our international markets given what's going on with the coronavirus? Thanks.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. In terms of a breakdown of domestic, North America was down, mid-3s, Neighbor Island was down six, kind of consistent with what the overall number was, and then obviously the impact of stage length in their drags that number down to six overall.\nPeter Ingram: Maybe I'll just start on the coronavirus question. And it is certainly something I know all of you in the investment community are trying to calibrate the impact and it really is a difficult challenge at this point because I think there is \u2013 we all have so much uncertainty about what is going on here and how it's going to develop in the coming days. I think as we've looked at it and we've had some discussions internally over the last several days, as we sit here today there is obviously an enormous medical challenge in China and a rapidly growing epidemic in China. And from the perspective of airline industry that is manifesting itself in significant reductions in near-term demand. And I think you have seen in the last 48 hours the response of global airline serving China to that to rapidly reduce and in a number of cases eliminate capacity to China. So clearly that's an acute impact in the here and now. In terms of \u2013 and again, from our perspective, at Hawaiian, I'm not serving China, they\u2019re \u2013 we're not participating in that because we don't have a dog in that hunt. In terms of looking at our network, the next question then becomes what happens from here with the coronavirus particularly in countries outside China, whether it's in the Asia region or North America or Australasia as it pertains to our network. And there we've got again a lot of uncertainty in any of the countries that we serve to date there are single-digit typically reported cases of the coronavirus. Most of those are cases, the vast majority of those are cases that have annexes back to China. And so I think it's really difficult to extrapolate where it goes from here and whether the severe medical issues that are existing in China end up being exported at scale to other geographies. Whether that happens or not, then there's another fallout question of weather concerns about this as it gains more media attention starts to affect travel demand. Right now, we have seen very little evidence, but it is early days of that. And I think it is likely in our sense if that were to happen that it would manifest itself in the places that are closest to China like Korea in the example of our network and then spread out from there in the event that that the crisis continues to worsen, but it is purely speculative for us to say anything on that today. And maybe just Brent, I know your team has been looking to see if there are any signs of demand changes?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. So, I mean, it's a little bit challenging to measure as we're sitting in the midst of kind of lunar New Year and that impacts booking velocity and that moving around over the last several years. As we've looked at it close, no real discernible impact, particularly out of our major geographies. Japan demands holding up well; Australia and New Zealand, things are strong; and North America bookings continue to be strong. We have probably more lunar New Year impact in Korea, so we'll keep a close eye on that and how things transpire there. But as Peter mentioned from a macro impact, we haven't seen any real impact. Yeah.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. And it's obviously something we're going to be paying attention to in the days and weeks ahead because it would appear that that we're still in the early days of the developing health crisis.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thank you for all that color.\nPeter Ingram: Yeah. Thanks, Catherine.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey\u2026\nPeter Ingram: Hi, Mike.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Mike for Mike. Hey, just one on Japan with all the new Haneda slots for both the U.S. and Japanese carriers, we've seen a bit \u2013 we've seen some of the carriers moving their services over from Narita. But how do you view the overall market for Honolulu to Tokyo as it pertains to aggregate capacity and Hawaiian\u2019s positioning with that as \u2013 within that as we head into the summer?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. So in terms of changes related to Haneda and \u2013 those are going in at the end of March. Our service from Haneda to Honolulu, which will be our third daily Haneda flight is the incremental frequency associated with the opening up of Haneda access this year. JAL has or will be flying two services from Haneda. Those are replacing two services in Narita. ANA has got a service that was already there, that's been there for several years. And then, so there is one other incremental one. There's one other one at Haneda and that is Delta and that is again a sort of a swap of capacity that was in Narita. So really it's \u2013 our flight is the only incremental one there. And then at Narita, we see a little bit of incremental capacity from ANA continuing to expand their Narita flying and some other changes moving around in the marketplace, but not as much incremental from the Haneda movement as we might have thought directly tied to that event.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got you. Okay. Thanks guys.\nPeter Ingram: I think, you know, obviously it's \u2013 as we've talked about in our JAL filing and on other calls, it's a big deep market. We're going to add a frequency into it. We're excited about the trip. We're adding beyond just getting another trip into Haneda and offering some greater time of day convenience getting in at the time that we're going to be able to get in. We'll be able to open up a lot more connectivity with JAL into domestic Japan and we think that there's some \u2013 there's untapped market there that we'll be able to continue to grow with the additional capacity as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks guys.\nPeter Ingram: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes, thanks. Peter, just in terms of the international PRASM strength that you guys saw, is there any FX or surcharge tailwinds in fourth quarter? And then do you have any expectations for those factors affecting first quarter?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, let me turn that one to Brent.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. So when we look in 4Q, we actually had a little bit of a headwind from fuel surcharge and FX that grows a bit as we get into Q1. We had \u2013 last year was a little bit anomalous in terms of Japan fuel surcharge based on the timing mechanism. Fuel surcharges were a fair amount higher in 1Q in Japan last year, so we'll see a greater impact of that in 1Q. And then while it's a little early to forecast into 2Q, we do see some of that headwind will likely start to moderate a bit as we get into 2Q.\nJoseph DeNardi: Helpful. Peter, you've spoken over the years about how capacity in your markets finds a level over time. I'm wondering if you have a sense as to \u2013 maybe there's a rule of thumb, if your margins are x, all this capacity growth has pressured your margins, then industry margins excluding yours must be x minus something. Is there anyway to think about that just in terms of when capacity may start to rationalize a little bit? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yes, it's an interesting question and it's difficult to predict the timing. Obviously, our competitors don't consult with us on their capacity plans for serving Hawaii. I think some of it depends on what's going on in the macro environment as well, how carriers see opportunities in different parts of their system, what the fuel price environment looks like since this tends to be long haul flying with a higher fuel price component. But I do think that in a world with rational players, people should be making investment decisions on where they fly based on where they see the biggest opportunities. And I would say clearly a couple of years ago when our margins were in the high teens, it was easy to see opportunities in Hawaii. I think as, you know, our margins haven't fallen off a cliff, but they are in a more moderate range in the 10.5% range over the last year. And I think the \u2013 we would certainly expect over the next couple of years, I think, to see a little bit of a moderation of growth and perhaps over time some retrenchment by the marginal routes where people are generating lower RASMs and particularly if costs go up for a variety of reasons for other carriers. But for us right now we're really just focusing on making sure we're executing day to day and making sure that our capacity is not the marginal capacity in the market and we don't think it is right now.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes, that's helpful. Shannon, just quickly on the fuel cost guide for the year, the 1.85 seems a little low. Is that just kind of timing of when you guys did it? Or is there any hedge gain in there? Thank you.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes, there is no hedge gains in there. No, I'm guessing you're comparing to energy. If you recall, a lot of our fuel is purchased based on the [indiscernible] index, so it does differ from LA and WTI. So sometimes that explains that that difference between us and the industry.\nPeter Ingram: But I think there has been some decline in the last few days in the fuel price. I believe there's a footnote on the fuel cost guidance number that that will tie it right to the direct day that we did it.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes, it's January 28th. So that was \u2013 if you look at the fuel curve on the 28th and that's where we pulled it.\nPeter Ingram: Yes.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you very much.\nPeter Ingram: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.\nHelane Becker: Thanks, operator, hi everybody and thank you for the time. So, I guess, Peter, I have a different question on the China thing. As that capacity comes out from the U.S. carriers and others, do you \u2013 are you concerned that they put it on a temporary basis into Hawaii from sort of new markets or additional capacity from existing markets?\nPeter Ingram: Helane, that\u2019s the \u2013 we\u2019ll, get part of that answer as it's obviously up to them, not up to us again. I think if you look at and I've just monitored a couple of the announcements in the media in the last couple of days, most of what I've seen has been published capacity adjustments that go out from a week or two to maybe through the end of the first quarter. And so, I think in cases like that, if I was thinking about in the context of our business, we would not be thinking about redeploying that capacity necessarily anywhere in the short-term because if you're planning to go back into those other routes fairly quickly, you're going to need those airplanes. And it is difficult to just be toggling capacity in and out of markets on a short-term basis. So I put a relatively low probability on that, but again, you'd have to go ask some of those other carriers.\nHelane Becker: Got you. No, I think that's very helpful. Thank you very much. And then Shannon, for you I just have one question. You talked about the five lease extensions. And then I think you said something about how it would save you money, right. I kind of missed that part. But your rent expenses down for the quarter quite a lot and for the year. So is that like that the fourth quarter, is it new run rate we should be thinking about?\nPeter Ingram: So, let me start with that, Helane. I think some of the \u2013 some of what you're seeing in the rent expense in the fourth quarter doesn't reflect the 717 lease extensions at all. Those were done at the very end of the period. What we did do as I mentioned in my comments in the call during the year, last year, was we had some lease extensions related to a couple of our A330. So those were A330s that were right near the beginning of our original acquisition of that fleet back in 2010 and they were among some of the higher cost leases we had. And as I think most people are probably aware of the 330-200 market has moved considerably since that time. And so, I think that's what you\u2019re seeing reflected in there. In terms of the run rate, I think what's in the fourth quarter may does \u2013 certainly doesn't reflect the 717s, but it otherwise reflects our fleet from the perspective of the A330s and the A321neos.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's perfect. Thank you very much.\nBrent Overbeek: Sure.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like turn the conference back over to Peter Ingram for closing comments.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo again to everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest as always and we're very excited about our future prospects and look forward to talking to you more about them again at our Investor Day in March. Aloha.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Alanna James, Managing Director of IR for Hawaiian Holdings. Thank you. You may begin.\nAlanna James: Thank you, Diego. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings' third quarter 2019 earnings call. Here with me in Honolulu are Peter Ingram, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Shannon Okinaka, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brent Overbeek, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management and Network Planning. Peter will open the call with an overview of the business. Next, Brent will share an update on our revenue performance and outlook. Shannon will then discuss our cost performance and outlook. We will then open up the call for questions, and Peter will end with some closing remarks. By now, everyone should have access to the press release that went out at about 4:00 Eastern Time today. If you have not received the release, it is available on the Investor Relations page of our website, hawaiianairlines.com. During our call today, we will refer at times to adjusted or non-GAAP numbers and metrics. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers and metrics can be found at the end of today's press release posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. As a reminder, the following prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our future plans and potential future and financial operating performance. Management may also make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future performance, therefore undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer you to Hawaiian Holdings' recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. This includes the most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K as well as subsequent reports filed on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Aloha, Alanna. Aloha, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you have seen in our press release today, our team executed extremely well during the peak summer period and demand to, from, and within Hawaii remains robust. In the face of increasing competition, we reported strong results, which surpassed what we had expected entering the quarter. More precisely, we were well above our initial guidance range on RASM, while CASM ex fuel fell in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. We posted adjusted net income of $81.5 million and adjusted EPS of $1.72 per share. Our third quarter adjusted pretax margin was 14.6%, which brings us to an adjusted pretax margin of 11.1% year-to-date. These results are solid considering the competitive capacity increases we have seen across our network over the past two years, a time when many of our competitors have enjoyed a more benign capacity environment across their networks. And once again, these results demonstrate the resilience of our business model and the competitiveness of our airline. My thanks, as always, go out to my 7,300 fantastic colleagues both on the front lines and in the back office for their contributions to this performance and for continuing to run the best operation in the business. I am also pleased that we continue to make progress towards a variety of objectives we set out for ourselves this year. During the third quarter, we achieved an important milestone with the sales launch of our Main Cabin Basic product. Main Cabin Basic sales for our Los Angeles, Long Beach and Sacramento nonstop routes were launched on September 23, for flights commencing on October 21, and we continue to roll out the product across our North America network in the ensuing weeks. Bringing Main Cabin Basic to market was a complicated initiative and my thanks go out to all of the people in our organization, who have collectively contributed thousands of hours of effort to this initiative and bringing it in on time and on budget. With Main Cabin Basic, we now have the ideal product in our portfolio for those guests who value the lowest possible price for travel and quite importantly, a new competitive tool against other carriers offering basic economy products today. During the quarter, we took delivery of our 14th and 15th A321neos, continuing the build out of our fleet to support our North America growth strategy. As we've noted before, the A321neo is perfect for our network, not only because it is the right size for the mid-sized origin and destination markets that were more challenging to make work with our previous all-wide-body fleet, but also because it is the most fuel-efficient airplane flying between North America and Hawaii. Clear evidence of this is the 3.3% year-over-year decline in our fuel consumption this quarter compared to a 0.4% system capacity reduction. Three deliveries remain on our current neo order book, two scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2019 and our final one in the first quarter of 2020. I should also note that all of these deliveries are scheduled to be from Mobile, Alabama, and as a result we are not expecting any impact from the announced tariffs on European aircraft. On the international front, we were disappointed with the tentative DOT ruling to approve our partnership with JAL without antitrust immunity. Despite the clear benefits from our cooperation with JAL to date, we believe we need ATI to realize the full consumer benefits of the partnership. As many of you already know, we requested an extension of the deadline for our reply to the show-cause order until November 12, to allow us appropriate time to better articulate the need for ATI to deliver the public benefits of the joint venture is capable of. We have been granted this extension by the DOT and are working closely with JAL to supplement our application to address the concerns identified by the DOT in its order. In the meantime, we are continuing to pursue opportunities as they arise, and along these lines, our team is busy planning for the inauguration of our new route to Fukuoka towards the end of November. The response we have received from the community in Fukuoka has been overwhelmingly positive and we are excited to bring back nonstop service to the Hawaiian Islands to the residents of Fukuoka. Initial bookings are strong, giving us confidence that we can mature this new route quickly. We were formally awarded the additional Haneda slot for which we had tentative approval when we last spoke and we are on track to start the additional service in March of 2020. This new flight promises to add diversity to our flight times giving our Tokyo guests more options and enabling increased connecting opportunities for guests in parts of Japan without convenient service today. These connections in particular will benefit from our JV if we are permitted antitrust immunized coordination opportunities with JAL. At the beginning of 2019, we express confidence in our ability to continue to compete and win and to continue to be the carrier of choice to, from, and within Hawaii. And our team is justifying this confidence by relentlessly focusing on delivering authentic Hawaiian hospitality to our guests, and executing our specific network missions better than any of our competitors. Our ability to not only sustain, but grow our revenue premium over the other U.S. carrier serving Hawaii in a heightened capacity environment highlights the strength of our proven formula. As we move towards the end of 2019, I am pleased to note that we are delivering on the key priorities that we established at the beginning of the year, while also posting strong financial and operational performance. We are delivering products our guests\u2019 value with our North America Neo expansion, the launch of our new Main Cabin Basic product, our new route to Boston and the growth in our Japan franchise. We have made strides towards our aspiration of making travel effortless with the launch of our new mobile app, lobby improvements in Honolulu and the Neighbor Islands and other investments in our guests\u2019 day of travel experience. On this initiative, we have additional projects underway that will deliver an even better day of travel experience in 2020 and beyond. We are on track to generate important structural cost savings through our cost transformation initiative, which Shannon will elaborate on later. And we are building our foundation for the future with technology improvements, process optimization and investments in our facilities. Looking forward, through the end of the year and into 2020, I see us continuing to focus on some of these same initiatives. At our main hub in Honolulu, we are embarking on a phased approach to overhauling our check-in lobby to increase throughput and enhance our guest experience. We are currently working collaboratively with our landlord, the state DOT to finalize plans for this project. We are committed to delivering our cost transformation initiatives and 2020 will be an important year with analysis ending and realization of savings ramping up. We will take the final three A321neos on our current order and continue to prepare for our first 787s in the early part of 2021. And from a network perspective, we will return to Fukuoka in a little over a month and expand our presence in Tokyo next spring, as we continue to fortify our successful Japan business. How our team has handled increasing competition over the last two years convinces me that we are competing from a position of strength. I am proud of what our team has accomplished and optimistic that we have all the elements in place to be successful over the long-term as the carrier of choice to, from, and within Hawaii. I'll now turn the call over to Brent to talk about our revenue performance.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter, and aloha, everyone. Our third quarter revenue results reflect robust demand across our network and strong execution by the Hawaiian team. Our topline revenue, capacity and resulting RASM were all roughly flat year-over-year, which is a great result in light of the competitive incursions on multiple fronts, and a 7% increase in our own networks ASM weighted average stage length. Despite the industry capacity in our North America and Neighbor Island geographies increasing 7% year-over-year during the quarter, our domestic PRASM was down only 2.4% year-over-year. We saw a strong close in demand and solid pricing in North America during the back half of the third quarter. While our year-over-year traffic increase was largely expected in light of the weather events during the third quarter of 2018, we were encouraged by the relative yield strength in August and September that exceeded our initial expectations. Our A321neo routes and new service to Boston are also developing as expected and we are pleased with our performance thus far. Based on the most recent data available to compare our relative revenue performance on the West Coast to Hawaii, not only did we maintain our double-digit PRASM premium relative to our competitors, but we were able to moderately expand that premium. This reinforces the benefits of a strong North American network, optimally configured aircraft and a singular focus on the Hawaii traveler. The outlook for industry capacity shows a 9% growth next quarter. And while we expect some yield pressure from the increased capacity, we are confident in our ability to continue to compete effectively across a variety of market conditions. As Peter mentioned, we achieved an important milestone with the launch of sales for our Main Cabin Basic product on September 23. Prior to the launch of Main Cabin Basic, the lowest fare product we had offered, was our full service Main Cabin product. The introduction of Main Cabin Basic to our product portfolio will further strengthen our ability to compete in North America and will mitigate some of the downward pressure on yield. Although, we are in the very early stages, we are encouraged by the performance of the product to date and we have every reason to believe that the $15 million to $25 million annual benefit of this initiative will be achieved. I'd like to echo Peter's gratitude to the team involved in launching Main Cabin Basic. I am extremely proud of the collaboration, dedication and commitment of each of the team members, which resulted in the successful launch of this complex and important initiative. Demand for Neighbor Island travel remains solid. However, we continue to see pressure on yields due to the widely available promotional pricing in the market. The outlook for the fourth quarter has industry capacity growing 11.6% year-over-year, which we expect will have a continued impact on yields.  We are well equipped to compete in this geography for several reasons. We have a breadth and depth to our Neighbor Island schedule that meets the needs of local travelers, a strong loyalty program based here in the islands, the ideal aircraft for the mission and the ability to recover quickly from operational disruption and continue to deliver value to our guests. Internationally, we had another great quarter, with third quarter PRASM up 5% year-over-year. Demand for the Hawaii vacation was robust and pricing generally remained strong as we move through the quarter. The premium cabin continued to perform well on international routes with PRASM up 9% year-over-year. Overall, this was the 14 consecutive quarter of year-over-year PRASM improvements for the entity, validating the investments we've made in our team and our product. Japan performance remained strong during the quarter and we are excited to continue growing the franchise with the launch of Fukuoka service in November, while the DOT tentative ruling regarding our ATI application with JAL was disappointing, we are focused on preparing our response to the DOT and continuing to work on building our partnership with JAL. Our value-added revenue streams also continue to strengthen with value-added revenue per passenger up 10% year-over-year. Extra Comfort and Preferred Seat revenue performance continues to set records and we remain on track to comfortably surpass our $100 million target for 2019. Revenue from the sale of HawaiianMiles also set a new quarterly record and continues to contribute meaningfully to our value-added revenue per passenger. Cargo revenue for the quarter was down 9% year-over-year due to lower volumes out of Asia. Although we saw sequential improvement versus last quarter, the team has been working hard to adapt to the current macroeconomic conditions. Now looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect our capacity to increase between 3% to 4.5% year-over-year. The largest increase in capacity during the quarter for 2019. Our fourth quarter year-over-year capacity increase is driven by the launch of our new route from Maui to Las Vegas, the reintroduction of our Fukuoka route, the introduction of a second daily service from San Francisco to Honolulu and our new service to Boston, which started in April of this year. We expect continued strength in our international geography, as well as robust demand in our domestic markets, offset by average fare pressure in that entity. The net of this is, we expect our fourth quarter RASM to be down between 0.5% to 3.5% year-over-year. The nominal sequential slowing of RASM in the fourth quarter is driven by a number of factors. The sequential increase in industry capacity growth, the launch of two new routes later in the quarter, and the impact of our increased stage length. While we anticipate some benefits from Main Cabin Basic in the fourth quarter, we will come much closer to our annual run rate level in the first quarter of 2020, due to our longer booking curve. As we look beyond the fourth quarter and out into 2020, we expect our capacity growth in the mid- to high-single digits, which is higher than our targeted long-term growth rate of low-to-mid single digits. Our growth in 2020 is driven by the timing of aircraft deliveries and relatively low growth in 2019. This growth is largely fueled by the annualization of new services started in 2019 and the launch of our new Haneda frequency in the March of 2020. Overall, we are optimistic about the future and our ability to compete to win in the markets we serve. We are excited about our growth prospects as we come to the final phase our A321neo expansion. Bookings for the A321neo routes are on track with our expectations and we look forward to continuing to grow our North America to Hawaii network with an aircraft as ideally suited to the mission. We are growing and strengthening our North American network as freeing up wide-body aircraft to support growth in our long-haul markets. We anticipate meaningful revenue improvement through multiple initiatives, Main Cabin Basic, the JAL partnership, the continued monetization of our premium cabin investments and other value-added revenue, which will drive revenue performance going forward irrespective of the competitive environment. We are executing well against our plan for 2019. Our results demonstrate that we've built a strong competitive position through our diversified network in our unmatched guest experience with authentic Hawaiian hospitality. I am confident that this winning combination will allow us to withstand short-term competitive pressure and succeed in the long-term. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start with a brief recap of our third quarter results. Today, we reported third quarter adjusted net income of $81.5 million or $1.72 per share, and adjusted pretax margin of 14.6%. Our ability to continue to deliver strong financial results demonstrates the strength of our business model, the benefits of a diversified network and our resilience to competitive pressures. In the third quarter, CASM ex fuel and items increased 4.9% year-over-year in line with expectations at the beginning of the quarter. As a reminder, the sequentially higher year-over-year costs we experienced in the third quarter were an anomaly due to unique factors related to our fleet transition and the timing of maintenance events and are not evidence of a trend. Our economic fuel cost per gallon for the third quarter was $2.04, which is better than our expectations at the beginning of the quarter, despite the short-term blip in prices in September. On the financing front, we closed aircraft-backed Japanese yen-denominated financing transactions, totaling $220 million during the third quarter. The yen-denominated loans provide a natural cash flow hedge to our yen revenue exposure at a very attractive coupon rate of less than 100 basis points. We also extended the leases on three A330 aircraft resulting in meaningful cost savings. We've structured the A330 lease extensions in a manner that maintains flexibility in our fleet plan, such that we can adjust the growth of our network to our desired pace based on market conditions when we start receiving our 787 deliveries. Additionally, in the third quarter, we returned $26 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We bought back $20 million of outstanding shares, leaving approximately $47 million remaining of our current $100 million authorization. Year-to-date through the end of the third quarter, we bought back 3.9% of our shares outstanding. During the third quarter, we continued to make good progress on changing the way we do business to generate structural cost savings. Primarily through vendor management and aircraft ownership initiatives, we are now on track to execute on over $40 million of annualized savings by the end of 2019 and continue to see more opportunities in these categories and others such as labor productivity and overhead. Altogether, we have identified initiatives with the cumulative potential for annual savings of over $150 million and we are in the process now of evaluating their feasibility as well as prioritizing them against our strategic imperatives to ensure alignments. I am confident that we'll reach our $100 million target in 2021 and deliver on this important priority. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect CASM ex fuel and items to be up between 0.5% and 3.5% compared to last year, reflecting more normalized year-over-year changes. Our fourth quarter CASM ex forecast includes headwinds from contractual labor rate increases and the associated benefits totaling about 1 point, an increase in IT spend as we invest in our technology capability totaling about 0.5 point, an increase in variable compensation due to improved financial performance totaling about 0.5 point, the impact of maintenance credits received in the fourth quarter of 2018 not expected to reoccur in 2019, as well as an increase in aircraft maintenance events totaling about 0.5 point, and offsetting these pressures are savings from our A330 lease renegotiations totaling a little more than 0.5 point. We are increasing our full-year CASM ex guidance slightly primarily due to an increase in variable compensation due to improved financial performance as well as higher than expected fleet transition costs. Not included in our CASM ex fuel ranges are any assumptions relating to the amendable contract with our Flight Attendants Union. We continue our negotiations with our Flight Attendants under the oversight of the National Mediation Board. We are eager to bring these negotiations to a close and reach an agreement, which recognize the contributions of our flight attendants to our Company's success while maintaining our cost competitiveness for the long-term. Based on the fuel curve as of October 10, our economic fuel cost is estimated to be $2.02 for the fourth quarter and we are lowering our full-year forecast to be $2.05. As a September 30, 2019 we've hedged approximately 50% of our projected fuel requirements for the fourth quarter. Our CapEx for the full-year 2019 is now expected to be between $410 million and $430 million, which is within our initial guidance range. As we look ahead into 2020, we are expecting much lower CapEx than 2019 with only one planned aircraft delivery. This will give us an opportunity to focus on generating greater value from our current investments and prepare for our next wide-body growth phase, while driving long-term structural cost reduction initiatives. Overall, I am pleased with our financial performance, particularly given the evolving competitive environment and I am optimistic about our future. We are committed to cost discipline, which combined with our multiple revenue initiatives will position us for continued success in the long-term as we generate value for our guests and our shareholders. Over the years we've built a world-class airline with a strong brand and healthy balance sheet. We have the right aircraft with superior revenue-generating capability for each distinct mission in our network, and we deliver award winning authentic Hawaiian hospitality to our guests each and every day. This concludes our prepared remarks and I'll now turn the call back over to Alanna.\nAlanna James: Thank you, Peter, Shannon and Brent. We'd like to thank all of you for joining us today and for your continued interest in Hawaiian Holdings. We are now ready for questions from the analysts. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow-up question. Diego, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please state your question.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes, thanks. Good evening. Brent, I think, you said in the third quarter, North America PRASM was down 2% on a 7% increase in industry capacity, which is a really, really good result. Can you just theorize on what's driving that? Is it kind of demand stimulation from some of the new capacity in the market? Is it demand shifting from other markets? I'm sure some of it's your own good execution, but maybe just a little bit more color on what's driving that?\nBrent Overbeek: Sure. Joe, I think it's a combination of several things. I think it is, one, starting with kind of matching the right airplane for the right markets for us in terms of our 321 rollout plan and we continue to execute really well on those and generates a benefit of that fleet. Some of it is wealth, in our case is benefits of continued investments and extra comfort and premium cabin, which are driving performance in the front part of our airplane that is certainly helping the bottom line. And beyond that, I think, we had really good execution in that quarter, that was a bit choppier last year in terms of some weather events and so our execution as we got through the latter part of the quarter was quite good and we saw solid performance there.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then Shannon, sorry if you mentioned this, but I guess relative to Brent's kind of capacity commentary for next year, what should we think about kind of CASM ex trends into next year and then maybe beyond that as some of the cost savings initiatives take hold?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks Joe. So we're still in our planning process for 2020. So I'm not quite ready to give guidance, but we can talk about some of the puts and takes in Brent's ASM comment about 2020 is important, much higher than what we saw this year. Also we're fully baking in the $40 million of cost savings that we've already executed on this year, plus more. We haven't \u2013 like I said, I can't give guidance quite yet as we're still going through the planning process. But I'm very excited about that. As well as \u2013 we've got lower CapEx, not really related to CASM, but we've also got, trying to think \u2013 none of the guidance of course includes any of the AFA assumptions that obviously would probably be an offset whenever that's resolved hopefully soon. But \u2013 well, I can't give guidance. I can't say that I'm really happy with where we are as we look forward with costs. I'm really excited about our cost savings initiatives. So without giving guidance, that's probably the best I could give you.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve O'Hara with Sidoti & Company. Please state your question.\nStephen O'Hara: Hi, good afternoon. In terms of the capacity growth and the issues there with the capacity coming into the mainland, I'm just curious what the impact so far has been from the change in the regulations around Airbnb's and I guess their short-term rentals and things like that, I guess some of the government agencies seem that they are \u2013 I think it was [indiscernible] that was kind of negative in terms of the impact. Just curious you've seen anything there and maybe what you expect longer term?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Thanks, Steve. As of right now, we haven't really been able to see any impact on demand that we can attribute to the changes in regulations around vacation rentals. It is something that we continue to monitor and we'll look to see if there's anything we can identify going forward. But right now based on how we closed out the third quarter and our bookings in the fourth quarter and going into next year, we continue to see robust demand for travel to Hawaii from North America and from our international destinations.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay. And then I guess when I think about Hawaiian versus other airlines maybe U.S.-based airlines, I'm just wondering \u2013 it seemed like you guys have kind of short-haul and long-haul, not a lot of in between. But in terms of the opportunities that are out there, where do you see the better opportunity set, is it longer haul opportunities or is it shorter haul opportunities within maybe North America I guess or versus international? And then, are you able to source aircraft in a timely manner to kind of meet those opportunities? Or do you think you have the right kind of fleet going forward to target those? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Let me start and then maybe see if Brent has any additional comments. I would say we see opportunities in the future in a variety of places. I think in our market share of any of the geographies we serve with the exception of Neighbor Island is not so high that we don't have opportunity for gains and there has consistently been growing demand for travel to Hawaii. I think nearer term, obviously, we've got the Japan flights we're starting in November and March of next year, so that's a lot of the focus for the next year or so. I think we see continued opportunities in North America to build our franchise and certainly in Japan going forward and elsewhere internationally. So we've built a network that is really focused on the important sources of Hawaii visitors. And I think that gives us the opportunity to be opportunistic about looking at things that are available when they become available. And so currency and fuel and different macro factors will have an effect from time-to-time, but I think we're in a position with our diversified network to Hawaii of being able to take advantage of opportunities and also to adjust to circumstances. As far as your fleet question goes, I think, we do have aircraft on order. As Shannon mentioned, primarily once we get through these A321noes between now and March, the aircraft we have on order right now are 787s. 787s will allow us to, in some cases free up some narrow bodies for other opportunities or to grow long-term and will also be able to replace A330s. Beyond what's currently on order, I would say for the aircraft that we are likely to grow with, which is the ones that are generally in our fleet right now, there is considerable order book. So there is a bit of a lag to get to them, but we've anticipated that and we've got aircraft on order and we've got flexibility to manage our growth with retirements over time if circumstances warrant.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I think Peter laid it out very well. We've got a real ability to kind of grow opportunistically wherever we see the opportunity in the network, whether it be on West Coast, whether it'd be deeper in the North America, whether it be the international side. And the timing of 787 deliveries and what that does from a fleet flexibility really will enable us to be opportunistic as we look into 2022 and 2023 and beyond.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay. Thank you very much.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Please state your question.\nHelane Becker: Hey. Thanks very much operator for the time. And hi team, thank you very much for taking the question. Can you just talk about the acceptance or the increase that you're seeing in your corporate card? I don't know what's the right word, take rates in given the increased competition or capacity in the local market?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, sure, Helane. You used the term corporate card. I think you're referring to our co-brand credit card, which we does have a corporate program to it.\nHelane Becker: Yes, sorry.\nPeter Ingram: But most of it is personal focus. We've actually had \u2013 no problem, it's a great question and we've actually seen really strong demand. We are on track for a record in new card applications for this year and strong growth over 2018. So we're seeing great demand for the card. It is we've got terrific penetration here in Hawaii. It is also very popular with people on the U.S. mainland, particularly on the West Coast and we're happy with the continued growth of the credit card portfolio.\nHelane Becker: And is there any way you can like say, numbers or can you say we saw ex-percent growth in the quarter or in the year or some numbers that just give us a sense of what great penetration and excellent acceptance means?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, let me think about that one and we'll think about how we can give some more information going forward. I don't have it on my fingertips right now and I don't just want to sort of shoot off a number haphazardly. So let us take that one away.\nHelane Becker: Okay, fair enough. And then my other question is just with respect to aircraft deliveries. I think, your last aircraft on this order comes \u2013 you mentioned in the first quarter and then you don't get anything till 2021. So when we think about returning capital to shareholders next year, are you thinking about increasing the share repurchase program or are you thinking about storing \u2013 what is the right word, warehousing the cash for like the next round of aircraft purchases or how should we think about 2020 as \u2013 I don't know capital return year or cash generation year \u2013 what you do with free cash flow, anyone of those, like pick one? Thanks.\nPeter Ingram: Sure. Let me, start and I'll let Shannon chime in if she wants to add on to this. I would say first of all, Shannon gave the numbers we've been executing on the outstanding share repurchase and we're more than halfway through the $100 million program we announced in the latter part of last year. So we are continuing to think about capital returns. Also, we've got the dividend that adds to the capital returns profile. I'm not going to speculate on what will happen after the current program goes, but I will say that as we build our plans for next year, one of the features that Shannon mentioned, this was our CapEx is lower next year that combined with our expectations of our performance means, we would expect to have greater free cash flow generation next year and we will obviously be thinking about the priorities for that free cash flow generation, whether it is reinvesting in the business, seeking increases in capital returns. I think we've got a variety of options and we'll continue to be balanced in our approach to how we execute against that.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Usually, Helene, when we talk about the sources and uses, mostly uses of cash, we usually have a third bucket as well, in addition to shareholder returns and investment in the business, which is strengthening our balance sheet. I think our balance sheet is at a really good point right now. So \u2013 and that's why I think Peter mentioned only the other two and I think that is where our focus is. We've got a lot of facilities and technology investments that we're continuing to make, but we're always balancing that and looking at the shareholder returns as well.\nHelane Becker: That's all. Great. Thanks, team. I really appreciate the help there. Have a nice day.\nPeter Ingram: Sure.\nBrent Overbeek: Thanks, Helane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nRajeev Lalwani: Hi, thanks for the time. Brent, actually an international question or two for you, at a high level, could you just talk about how does supplies were looking there? I know there is always talk about A380 is coming through. Just wondering if that's already in the past now, and it's more of a benign setup going forward and then relating to that, it would be great to get an update on FX and surcharge impacts and if we're at sort of a steady state on that?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. So I'll cover your second question first. We didn't have any comments around Forex and fuel surcharge in the quarter here because it was \u2013 frankly it was pretty benign and in 3Q, we had relatively equilibrium in terms of that from a year-over-year perspective, as we look out in the 4Q at this point. We don't anticipate a material change to that right now. In terms of capacity on the international side, specifically around the 380, some of that capacity has come in and some of it has been offset by reductions in capacity in other parts of Japan. There has been some reductions in capacity in Osaka and some other carriers have trimmed a little bit of Tokyo capacity. So there is a bit more to go, I think in terms of what ANA has committed to and obviously we've got our own capacity growth in Tokyo, at the end of the first quarter in 2020. On the rest of the international franchise, there has been a little bit of capacity continues to come out of Australia, New Zealand, more specifically in New Zealand where capacity had ramped up a bit more in previous years and so we see some of that coming out of the marketplace.\nRajeev Lalwani: That's great and then Shannon, if I may, a quick one for you. I appreciate you're not giving CASM guidance for next year, but is there anything wrong with us assuming that with the big growth into next year, that's above trend that shouldn't lead to a tailwind on the unit cost side or is there some investments that would have to be made with all that capacity, whether it's on the labor side or elsewhere in the system?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks, Rajeev. I think real big difference in our business next year that would affect cost is obviously the AFA negotiation. We're pretty \u2013 we'll start up 787 fleet transition. So there'll be some costs there, but frankly we had some strangeness with the 767 and A321 transition this year. I can't, off the top of my head, think of any other really big differences in the business other than the AFA as well as the ASMs that Brent mentioned and our cost transformation, so yes.\nBrent Overbeek: And just follow on that, I think Shannon's got it absolutely right. We have the unknown. We have right now is where the AFA negotiation is resolved. I share Shannon's comments from the call that we hope that gets resolved sooner rather than later. But aside from that, we have normal inflationary increases. There are some step increases in existing labor contracts, but those are the normal sort of year-on-year increases that we have to deal with as a business. The capacity growth does provide us a good opportunity on the cost side next year. And as we go through the budget, we expect to make sure that we're realizing all the benefits of that that we can.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes. Hey, two quick ones here. I guess just to Brent, you talked about a lot of introductory fares in the inter island market. How would you characterize the extent of maybe the stimulation that you're seeing, if any? Is it really truly a mature market or we're just seeing share shifting around? Are we seeing some meaningful sort of pick up in number of people flying between the islands?\nBrent Overbeek: So Mike, if I just look at some of our own traffic \u2013 if I look at our own traffic that we generated in Neighbor Islands over the course of the quarter, our passengers more than they round were roughly flat year-over-year. And so any change to that in terms of the competitor having some traffic on that would have been stimulative and overall the market size, I think in 3Q, would have grown. Again, some of that is off of a base of a little more challenging quarter last year with some weather events we had here in the state.\nPeter Ingram: And Mike, this is Peter, just to add on to that, I've been around the Hawaiian market now for almost a decade and a half. And I think the way we have characterized it in the past and I think this is reflected now is that that it is a mature market. The price elasticity is less than one, but the price elasticity is not zero. So we do see some stimulation, but with an elasticity of less than one.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. That's great color. And then Peter, I want to ask you about the decision to start service to Honolulu, Fukuoka, I realize it was a market that you're in some time ago, you backed away, obviously, the world has changed a little bit, but I suspect that the decision to go into that market was probably with the view that you would probably see an antitrust immunized deal in place by the time that you either started or soon thereafter. And I'm just curious with the absence of ATI in your JAL agreement, how does that change the calculus on maybe your appetite to do additional secondary markets down the road? It would seem like that ATI would almost be an essential, whether it would be \u2013 I don't know, I think you had \u2013 at one point you either in Sendai, to go into some of these other markets. I just \u2013 your thoughts on that because I feel like it is maybe a bit of a game changer here, any elaboration would be great? Thanks.\nPeter Ingram: Sure. Let me talk about it in general and then talk about Fukuoka in specific. In general, I think one of the great public benefit opportunities we see from the ATI application is greater opportunities for growth in the long-term. And I think there are \u2013 on the margin, there are going to be opportunities that would make sense only with an ATI immunized partnership with JAL that may not be possible if we don't end up getting the ATI immunized partnerships. So I think the premise of your question is accurate. Let me sort of step back and talk about Fukuoka in particular, because this is one, we obviously announced without certainty about ATI and so obviously we had a level of confidence that either way this would be a good opportunity for us and I think you're right that it's a very different circumstance than we were operating before. When we were operating before, we had our 767 aircraft on the route, we know from putting that the 330 into Sapporo a while ago that the performance of that was positive even with a slightly larger airplane and so I think that's a tailwind to the Fukuoka opportunity. When we were operating Fukuoka before, there were 14 frequencies a week in the market and we are launching this in November with initially four frequencies per week. So that's a different circumstance and a different hurdle in terms of demand, we need to realize to make it successful. And we do have \u2013 even without ATI. We do have the benefits of some of the JAL co-operation that is available today, which is a different circumstance. So I think all of that is accrues to give us confidence about that opportunity with or without ATI. I would add in that our commercial execution over the last few years and how we've performed in Japan has we've move the bar higher on that. So I think Fukuoka is going to be a good opportunity, but that doesn't detract from some of the merits of the logic of your question that on the margin, what we can do with ATI in terms of growth is different than what we can do without ATI in terms of growth.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. Thanks for that.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Susan Donofrio with Macquarie Capital. Please state your question.\nSusan Donofrio: Yes. Hi, everyone. My question is for Peter. Just wondering how to think about basic economy, obviously, it just rolled out in select markets. Are you thinking of rolling it out fully or are you just really in testing it to see how it responds? Obviously there, the markets were \u2013 obvious why you selected those particular ones, but just how should we think about that going forward?\nPeter Ingram: So we launched it with three specific non-stop routes in late September. That was really part of a plan to have a phased rollout, so that we could do testing and make sure we weren't rolling it out to comprehensively before we had made sure that everything was working in terms of our technology and our process. When I referred in the prepared remarks to the subsequent rollout over the following weeks was actually, there have already been a number of phases and at this point, we are pretty comprehensively rolled out across our North American network, including in connecting markets and so that is something that is in place today. When we announced we were going to do Main Cabin Basic, what we said was that we were focusing on North America and that remains our priority right now. And I think we're going to see how everything works and then think about whether there are opportunities down the road to consider some of the \u2013 either Main Cabin Basic or using some of that technology in other geographies to give us a little more product variety.\nSusan Donofrio: Got it, okay. And then would you ever consider that in \u2013 I know some of the Asian markets. I know some of the LCCs had try to make a splash, but I did notice some retrenching of that. Would that make sense to do it, like in some of the Japanese market to further have more product offering there or does that not make sense, because I didn't notice like AirAsia X like some of them, it looks like they retrenched?\nPeter Ingram: So what I would say is, we're going to continue to be open-minded and one of the things that is a truism in this business is that the markets we operate in, continue to evolve over time with different products and services and airline business models. I would agree with your premise that some of the international markets are a little bit more traditional, and it may not make sense in the near-term, but I would also say if you look at some of the products that are available from our competitors in places like Australia and New Zealand already incorporate many of these concepts. So I think it will be a sort of market-by-market, country-by-country, or geography-by-geography look that we take about where we see opportunities.\nSusan Donofrio: Got it, okay. And then just a follow-up to an earlier question, and that was growth opportunities. When we think about international, Japan is clearly a growth area. When we think of the other countries, I know that China had been tried and obviously not the time to go back now. But in terms of when we think about your international would it be new markets or do you think you can additionally, add to Australia, New Zealand, et cetera? How would we think about that in terms of the growth?\nPeter Ingram: Sure. It's a terrific question. It is something we spend a lot of time talking about. And I think it is another thing that we expect to evolve over time. A year-ago we withdrew our three time a week service to China, coming to the conclusion that this was not the right time for service from China to Hawaii and that is something that \u2013 as we suggest in the near-term, we're probably not going back to, but I still believe that China is a market with massive potential and there will come a time again where it, China will become an important source of visitors for Hawaii and we may return to that market. I think in terms of the international places we serve domestically are currently including Australia, New Zealand and Korea. We see additional opportunities, I would say, again, you have to keep in mind the evolution of the macro environment. And right now we're in an environment where the U.S. dollar is very strong and has been strong for a while. The point of sale for flights to Hawaii is always going to be tilted towards the international end of the flight and so that may suggest that this is not the moment in time to really be doubling down on an international expansion. But, I will remind people that currency markets change over time and that will present opportunities over time and we're well positioned because of the network that we have built and selling structure and the market infrastructure and the evolution of our commercial execution to take advantage of those opportunities when they present themselves.\nSusan Donofrio: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. So as we go into the next year, how should we think about the ranking of the size of the contribution of some of your 2020 revenue initiatives between Main Cabin Basic, JAL partnership, some of the other ancillary as you mentioned, and then improved merchandising on the premium cabin and I think it's kind of like a follow up to that one? And how would that look if the DOT decides to reverse the initial ruling or if they don't decide to reverse that? Thanks.\nPeter Ingram: So well, we've shared some details around kind of Main Cabin Basic and our estimates evaluation in terms of $15 million to $25 million annually. And I think that's probably a pretty solid number for 2020 as we look out into that. We've got \u2013 we'll have a little bit of a booking curve impact from when we started and so first quarter will take a little bit of time to ramp up, but I'm pretty confident with where we're at on that. As we think of JAL, we continue to work with them. We continue to get benefits from the partnership today. Clearly, the importance of ATI and thinking that the value of those benefits grow materially if we're granted ATI and we can make the network choices and create the consumer benefit that we envision that we see exists frankly in terms of our proposals. We haven't put a number on that, and that's something that I think as we look forward into 2020 will firm up, but we think there is benefits there as well as when we look out into 2020. I think when I look at kind of credit card, when I look at extra comfort. There is continued run rate in those products as well. And just one thing I would add to that specific to the JAL partnership, I think one difference we have relative to three months ago with the show cause order having now being delivered is that, even if we are successful or if we are successful in convincing the DOT to reconsider it's tentative quarter, the timing of when we start because of the elongated regulatory process is probably going to be a little later into 2020, than what we would have been thinking a few months ago.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Understood. And then maybe just two quick ones for Brent, I know you gave the break out on PRASM between domestic and international, but could you give us maybe what North America and Neighbor Island is below that, and then maybe just a follow-up to Rajeev's question earlier. Could you give us a feel for what International industry capacity has looked like and what that looks like into year-end, maybe 1Q, 2020? Thanks a lot.\nBrent Overbeek: So in terms of 3Q performance in North America and Neighbor Island were quite similar in terms of RASM performance. And so they were quite close if we look at the two entities, the two sub entities that make up the entity. So I think again pretty consistent between those. If we look at the international side of the business, we've got international capacity down about 5% year-over-year in 4Q and down about 4% in 1Q. And that's just based on currently published schedules.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.\nHunter Keay: Hi, everybody. Thank you. So the Main Cabin Basic, I understand this is probably created defensively again saver fares and Southwest product, but they both have Wi-Fi and you're going to have to do that at some point. So I would imagine that product gap is going to get worse as Main Cabin rolls out and people understand that. So when do you have to make a decision on that and how much is going to cost? And is it going to run through the P&L or is it all going to be capitalized?\nPeter Ingram: So Hunter, first of all I wouldn't concede that we have an overall product deficit when you consider all of the other attributes that go into our on-board experience. I think we've got, we are the only ones with authentic Hawaiian hospitality on our flights and we've got some other attributes like complimentary meals in the Main Cabin that others don't have. But having said that, I would accept the premise that Wi-Fi is becoming more common for Airlines in general, I think we are obviously a bit of a late adopter to Wi-Fi as we having not adopted it yet. And the reason for that candidly is, one, it was initially more of a business-oriented product. I think that has definitely changed. Number two, the technology, the satellite technology for over water service, particularly over the Pacific is even today quite spotty. And I think there were some providers that have better coverage over the Pacific than others. We are continuing to evaluate what the options are. I have been on some airplanes with really very poor \u2013 a very poor experience in terms of the Wi-Fi flying over the Pacific, and that is something that we want to make sure that by the time we think about doing that we are in a position to deliver a product that is up to the standards of our overall experience. So it's premature for us to say that, but I do think over time, the technology is going to get there and it is going to become sort of more of a table stakes expectation for the overall in-flight experience. So I think that is something we will likely do in terms of how it's going to run through the income statement of the balance sheet. We're not even to the point of making a decision yet. So I'm not going to sort of get into answering that part of it, but I do think that eventually, it is something that we are likely going to invest in. I think it will give us an enhanced overall experience. I think we'll make sure we have a great product for over the Pacific Ocean. And that will be something that I would look to have an opportunity to use to improve demand for travel to Hawaii over time.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And then another CASM ex question, Shannon, I'm a little bit surprised that you guys aren't giving us more guidance on 2020 CASM given back in July, 2018, you said it would be flat to down in the years ahead. So you hardly talked about it and capacity growth is going to be substantially higher. So the question is the reason why you're hesitant to talk about it entirely because of the flight attendant negotiation or is there other inflationary costs in the business. Peter, what you kind of alluded to earlier as well, but really the main question is, what has changed since you gave us that flat to down in the years ahead middle of last year?\nPeter Ingram: So Hunter, I think the real reason we're hesitant to give you more specifics on our CASM ex for next year is that we're not prepared to give 2020 guidance yet today. This is earlier than we normally give guidance for the upcoming year and so we're still as Shannon said in the middle of the planning process, it's going to inform what that is. And when we have some guidance to give you \u2013 we will give it. I think we've talked about the puts and takes and there were certainly opportunities there, including very importantly the capacity growth that we have planned for next year.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thanks Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks, Hunter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. So I will now turn the call over to Peter Ingram for closing remarks. Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo again to everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and are excited about our future prospects. And I look forward to talking to you again in a few months. Aloha.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

We will then open up the call for questions, and Peter will end with some closing remarks. By now, everyone should have access to the press release that went out at about 4:00 Eastern Time today. If you have not received the release, it is available on the Investor Relations page of our website, hawaiianairlines.com. During our call today, we will refer at times to adjusted or non-GAAP numbers and metrics. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers and metrics can be found at the end of today's press release, posted on the Investor Relations page of our website. As a reminder, the following prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, including statements about future plans and potential future financial and operating performance. Management may also make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future performance, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer you to Hawaiian Holdings' recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. This includes the most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K as well as reports filed on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. I will now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Hello Alanna and hello, Hi everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we begin, I'd like to publicly welcome Alanna James to the Investor Relations team. Alanna has been with Hawaiian in various positions for the past 8 years, most recently at the helm of our Ohana by Hawaiian turboprop operation. We are excited to have Alanna join her first earnings call, and I know she looks forward to meeting all of you on the other end of the line. As we have seen in our press release today, we reported solid results in the context of an evolving competitive environment. For each of RASM, CASM ex fuel and fuel consumption, we were not only within but at the better end of the ranges that we guided to during our last earnings call. As a result, we posted adjusted EPS of $1.23 per share and adjusted net income of $59 million, which surpassed the latest Street's expectations. For the quarter, our adjusted pretax margin was 11.4%, which brings us to an adjusted pretax margin of 9.1% for the first 6 months of the year. This result leaves us solidly in the competitive mix with our U.S. peers, which is a credible outcome in light of some of the unique competitive dynamics ongoing throughout our network. But it's below where we were a couple of years ago, and we're focused on executing on several important initiatives to move us back towards the top of our peers set. There is no denying that the competitive environment and industry capacity here in Hawai'i is more active than it was a couple of years ago. But our ability to continue to execute well, both financially and operationally, demonstrates that Hawaiian is built to compete and win. For this, I have 7,300 fantastic colleagues to thank for taking care of our guests and running the best operation in the business. Let me spend a few moments on the competitive changes in Hawaiian's relative position. During the second quarter, Southwest ramped up to the schedule it announced earlier this year, and ANA launched A380 service to Hawai'i. All of this has been foreshadowed for many months. We remain extremely well positioned in the North America to Hawai'i, Japan to Hawai'i and Neighbor Island markets, even considering these developments. In North America, we continue to maintain an impressive revenue premium, and our A321neos are delivering the network advantages we have talked about for several years. On our Neighbor Island routes, we have the best schedule breadth, the right fleet and, importantly, the best cost structure. And in Hawai'i -- or in Japan, we have established a strong brand with a product suited to the market and a deepening partnering with Japan Airlines. I wouldn't change places with any of our competitors in any of these geographies. We have faced competitive challenges in the past and focused on making our business stronger, and our approach is no different today. And while others are looking at opportunities in Hawai'i, we see opportunity, too. In the second quarter, we launched A321neo service between Sacramento and Maui, growing our West Coast to Maui network to 8 routes. We also launched service to Boston from Honolulu, complementing our established service to New York with a new East Coast route. Both of these new routes are attracting robust demand and are off to great starts. On the international front, we announced new service to Fukuoka in Japan and have been tentatively awarded a new daily frequency between Tokyo Haneda and Honolulu starting in March of next year. This new flight is intended to give us a new time channel for Tokyo service to optimize connections with our partner JAL, which will allow us to access guests in parts of Japan without convenient service to Hawai'i today. Japan is the largest source of international travelers to Hawai'i by far, and the affinity Japanese visitors have for Hawai'i is unparalleled. We are ideally positioned to capitalize on this affinity as the only airline that can truly deliver authentic Hawaiian hospitality. These upcoming services demonstrate our enthusiasm for the growth potential of our Japan franchise, which will be further bolstered by the implementation of our proposed joint venture with Japan Airlines which is in the final stages of DOT review. We expect to hear a determination from the DOT on this by the end of the third quarter. All told, the strongest network to and from Hawai'i is getting stronger with each of these developments. Serving this expanding network is a fleet of aircraft tailored to each of our missions. We took delivery of 1 A321neo in the second quarter and remain on schedule to receive 4 more before the year is up. And by this time next year, we'll have our 18th A321neo, the final aircraft in our current A321neo order book on hand. The operating cost efficiency of this aircraft is remarkable, perhaps best illustrated by the noticeable deviation between our capacity and our fuel consumption in the first half of the year. To it, our capacity measured by ASM is up 2.6% year-to-date compared with the first half of 2018. At the same time, our fuel consumption is down 1.6%. If our fuel consumption had grown at the same pace as available seat miles, our economic fuel cost in the first half of 2019 would have been over $10 million higher. That, of course, was a defining feature of the business case for the A321neos, and the new fleet is delivering the benefits we expected. We continue to invest in making travel effortless, one of the 2019 strategic priorities I've spoken about since our last Investor Day, and these investments are paying off. Since we last spoke, we will have a new and refreshed lobby at our Maui hub in Kahului. Together with the new mobile app that we rolled out at the end of the first quarter, we're improving our guest experience on the day of travel with more to come in the periods ahead. And these improvements are resonating with our guests as evidenced by improving customer NPS scores during the period. The competitive advantages and accomplishments I just spoke to are rooted in a strategy that aims to serve the needs of the Hawai'i traveler better than anyone. It's what's brought us success to date. It's what's keeping us a step ahead of our rivals now as we face competitive incursions on multiple fronts, and it's what will drive our continued success over the long term. I'll now turn the call over to Brent to talk about our revenue performance in more detail.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter, and Hello, Hi everyone. Our revenue results were largely in line with expectations in the second quarter. Operating revenue was roughly flat on capacity growth of 2.7%, resulting in a RASM decline of 3.1% year-over-year. This included 1 percentage point benefit from the Easter holiday shift and offset a marginal headwind of less than 0.5 point from fuel surcharges and foreign currency in the quarter. Industry capacity growth and pricing pressure materialized as expected in our North America and Neighbor Island geographies in the quarter. North America industry capacity growth accelerated in the second quarter, a trend that we expect will continue in the third and fourth quarters, setting up the full year for growth in the mid-single-digit range. It wasn't that long ago we were talking about double-digit industry capacity growth from North America in 2018. In fact, when factoring in current schedules on top of the 2018 base, we see full year 2019 industry capacity between North America and Hawai'i that is nearly 17% higher than it was in 2017, the same year we were producing record unit revenue results in the geography. It's not surprising then that the industry pricing between North America and Hawai'i remains below the levels we observed in 2016 and 2017, and has remained as such since the end of the third quarter of 2018. Having said that, our average fares held up well and were in line with expectations in the second quarter. Our Neighbor Island routes saw a material increase in industry capacity in the second quarter. Similar to North America, we expect that trend to continue in the third and fourth quarters. Lower promotional fares continue on a couple of important routes, and while no other airline can compete with our robust interisland schedule, the persistence of these promotional fares is pressuring Neighbor Island yields in the short term. North America and Neighbor Island PRASM each declined in the mid-single-digit range year-over-year in the second quarter, which led to a decline in overall domestic PRASM of about 7%. The domestic PRASM result is roughly 2 points lower than each of the subentities due to our growing average domestic stage length, which increased more than 8% year-over-year on an ASM-weighted basis. Offsetting some of the domestic pressure was continued strength in our international geography. International PRASM was up nearly 6% year-over-year in the second quarter. Premium Cabin PRASM in international routes posted near double-digit growth, with year-over-year improvements in both load factor and yield as we continue to monetize the investments we've made in the Premium Cabin on our A330 fleet. We continue to perform well in Japan, buoyed by our JAL relationship. Notable on this period was improved performance in Sapporo, Osaka and Tokyo to Kona markets. Our value-added revenue streams also continue to show meaningful growth. Value-added revenue per passenger was up 15% year-over-year in the second quarter. Extra Comfort and Preferred Seat revenue performance continues to set records, and we are on track to comfortably surpass the $100 million mark for 2019. Similarly, revenue from the sale of HawaiianMiles set a new quarterly record and helped contribute to the record value-added revenue per passenger result in the second quarter. Finally, consistent with the rest of the industry, our cargo business faced difficult macro conditions that continue to pressure cargo volumes, especially out of Asia. As a result, cargo revenue declined 12% year-over-year in the second quarter. We expect pressure to continue in the coming months as uncertainty in trade and the global economy persists. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect third quarter RASM to be down between 1.5% to 4.5% year-over-year, and our capacity to be up between 0.5% to down 1.5% year-over-year. The third quarter year-over-year capacity comparison is lower than our second quarter and what we anticipate our fourth quarter growth will be. This is largely a function of the timing of deliveries of A321neos in both 2018 and 2019, as well as the timing of maintenance events this year. With over half the year behind us, we are now forecasting that our 2019 capacity growth will be up between 1.5% to 2.5% year-over-year. This is 1 point lower at the midpoint of our initial guidance as we adjusted for A321neo delivery delays and some modest trimming of capacity in shorter-term underperforming portions of our network. Looking past the near-term unit revenue pressures, the commercial team remains focused on building the strength of our underlying business. First, our North America summer bookings are on track, with where we'd expect them to be at this point in the year. While average fares remain below the level we'd seen in the last few summers, the trends are consistent with what we've seen in recent quarters. Next, our A321neos are performing to plan. The introduction of the A321neo has allowed us to grow and transform our North America network. We've launched 7 new routes with year-round service in the past 18 months. So just under 1/3 of our North America routes are still relatively new and developing as expected, with encouraging unit revenue performance trends. Still on the topic of our North America network, we maintained our double-digit PRASM premium between the U.S. West Coast and Hawai'i for the year ending -- the first quarter of 2019, the latest time frame we have data from the DOT. This is especially notable given double-digit industry capacity growth and this industry pricing levels below historical ranges over that time frame. On the product front, we are on track to launch our Main Cabin Basic product in our North America routes in the fourth quarter. Given our product segmentation success to date, we're confident that this new offering will more effectively tap an important segment of potential Hawai'i travelers and alleviate some of the downward pressure we've seen in our Main Cabin yields. Beyond North America, our partnership with Japan Airlines continues to strengthen. Codeshare and airline traffic are performing very well in absolute terms and on a relative basis compared to our previous partner. We look forward to deepening our relationship with JAL to deliver additional benefits to our customers, the communities we serve and our 2 companies in the quarters ahead. Finally, as Peter mentioned, we're excited to further expand our footprint in Japan, with Fukuoka joining the network in November. All of these is to say we're executing to our plan and competing effectively in all of our geographies. We're optimizing and growing our U.S. network by expanding our opportunities internationally with aircraft that are tailored for each of their unique missions. We're investing in products our guests value while delivering authentic Hawaiian hospitality, something that none of our competitors can claim. As we've seen over the better part of the last decade, we've built a competitive position that allows us to win in various market environments, which sets us up well for success in the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start with a brief recap of our second quarter results. Today, we reported second quarter adjusted net income of $59 million or $1.23 per share and adjusted pretax margin of 11.4%. We're delivering strong financial results despite the challenging competitive landscape. In the second quarter, CASM ex fuel and items increased to 0.3% year-over-year or a little more than 0.5 point better than guidance. The favorability was due to labor efficiencies from initiatives that are delivering value earlier than expected, improved rates from our ongoing emphasis on stronger vendor management and an unforecasted onetime maintenance credit we received in the quarter. Year-to-date, CASM ex fuel is up just under 1% year-over-year, which puts us squarely in line to post full year CASM ex fuel growth between 1% and 2.5% year-over-year. This is especially encouraging given our new full year capacity guidance is 100 basis points lower at the midpoint from the original range that we set at the beginning of the year. CASM ex fuel increases due to lower capacity growth are offset by cost reduction initiatives that are delivering benefits earlier than expected as evidenced in the second quarter. This underscores the confidence that we have in achieving our full year 2019 CASM ex fuel target as well as our long-term cost reduction goals. In the third quarter, we expect CASM ex fuel and items to be up between 3.5% to 6.5% compared to last year, which includes the following headwinds: a year-over-year increase in aircraft maintenance events totaling a little more than 1.5 points; the various rate increases including contractual labor and rent of about 1.5 points; and higher ownership and operating costs related to our changing fleet mix as we transitioned out of 767s last year, totaling 1 point. I'll underscore that the third quarter stands out as an anomaly in terms of year-over-year performance as a result of a number of unique factors in this year's and last year's results. As evidenced by the full year estimate of low single-digit [nonfuel] unit cost growth, the third quarter growth is not a continuing trend. Not included in our CASM ex fuel ranges are any assumptions relating to the amendable contracts with our Flight Attendant Union, which is in mediation. We're eager to bring this negotiation to a conclusion. And when we do, our next contract to become amendable will not do so until early 2021. Staying on the topic of cost. We're making important progress against our goal of reducing structural cost. We're on track to implement initiatives by the end of 2019 that amounts to a little more than $25 million of annualized savings. Beyond 2019, we currently have line of sight to initiatives worth about $50 million in annualized savings. We continue to build and stage a pipeline of initiatives that will increase labor productivity, reduce rates and improve terms throughout our supply chain and reduce our fleet and fuel costs, among others. In the pursuit of transformational expense reduction, we've established a dozen cross-functional working teams to thoroughly examine every significant aspect of our cost structure and challenge long-held paradigms in a way that the annual planning process doesn't always accomplish. I'd like to personally thank our teams that have been working tirelessly on not only achieving our $100 million cost reduction target but for promoting and strengthening cost discipline across the entire company. In closing, I want to underscore Peter's confidence in our future. Competitive interest in Hawai'i ebbs and flows. What remains constant is our focus on Hawai'i and the Hawai'i traveler. Simply put, we have the best formula to serve our markets, and we look forward to continuing to demonstrate we are the carrier of choice to Hawai'i. This concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll now turn the call back over to Alanna.\nAlanna James: Thank you, Peter, Shannon and Brent. We would like to thank all of you for joining us today and for your continued interest in Hawaiian Holdings. We are now ready for questions from the analysts. [Operator Instructions] Omar, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Susan Donofrio from Macquarie Group.\nSusan Donofrio: A question on your CASM guide. It's a pretty wide range for next quarter. Can you just go over a little bit on the puts and takes that are going into it, just to give us some sense?\nShannon Okinaka: Sure, Susan. It's Shannon. We usually give a 3-point range for the quarter, so that's what we've done. We've got a bit of puts and takes here. You're right. We got about 1.5 points from aircraft maintenance events in the quarter, and it's just volume. More aircraft maintenance events this quarter versus last year. We've got about 1.5 points related to just various rate increases, some being just contractual labor increases. And we've got some rent increases and about 1 point of just ownership and maintenance costs relating to our changing fleet. As you recall, about this time last year, we were exiting our 767s and now we're bringing in 321s, and as we were at the end of life on some 767s and adjusted our plans with delays in the 321 timing, it just changed the natural ownership and operating cost for the 767 fleet.\nPeter Ingram: Susan, maybe just one thing that I'll add to that. Our capacity growth in this quarter is lower than it is in the other 3 quarters of this year. And again, that is a function, as Brent said in his comments, of the timing of deliveries this year and last year. It's also a function of the fact that last year, when we were suffering from some A321 delivery delays, we were flying bigger airplanes, which produced more ASMs on some of our routes in North America. And so there's a little bit of an anomaly in there that is driving the denominator in that CASM calculation a little bit this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Crissey, Citigroup.\nKevin Crissey: Can you talk about the importance of frequency in the interisland market? You talked about having that advantage. Can you talk about how that plays out?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Maybe I'll start and then turn it over to Brent to see if he has anything to add to that, Kevin. I think it helps in a couple of ways. One, we have a lot of frequent customers who are local customers who travel to the islands for business or personal reasons. And they have different -- they value the ability to choose different flight times and to if, for some reason, their schedule gets delayed, maybe push their flight back a couple of hours. And so it's valuable in that regard, in terms of providing utility to people who travel regularly. The other thing that I would say that's important about it is as we connect to our longer-haul trips including our international trips and also other airlines' longer-haul trips, it gives us the ability to access connecting traffic at different time channels for arrivals from the long-haul trips to Honolulu. So that's a couple of the big important things. Brent, anything you want to add to that?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I think Peter covered the highlights, so the only thing I would add a little bit is around kind of our customer segment difference here in Hawai'i versus some of the mainland markets. And that we start our schedule 5:00 a.m. in the morning. It's unusual to have people going to render medical service or construction workers while looking for that kind of time of coverage. That's really kind of unparalleled in terms of what we offer. And so having a bunch of unique products and our customer base that we serve here in the islands, it's really important to have that breadth of schedule.\nKevin Crissey: Terrific. Maybe on the capacity topic again, can you talk about and remind us what your structural thoughts are on that for 2020 and beyond?\nPeter Ingram: Sorry, Kevin. You're sort of wondering what we're thinking about capacity-wise for next year?\nKevin Crissey: Yes. I'm not looking for a specific number. I'm talking not necessarily just next year but generally. Are you a [4-ish, 3 to 5]? Is there a range that you think of is appropriate given maturity of your network or so, et cetera?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Let me -- let Brent start on that one.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. Kevin, we've talked about in the past that kind of our intent is to grow mid-single digits kind of over time. That growth is important in terms of our economic model here. This year -- over the last couple of years, it's been a bit more fluid given transition of fleet, and next year, while we don't have a specific number to guide to, we will have a little bit more long-haul flying. As Peter mentioned, we'll have the additional Haneda frequency that we intend on flying beginning in late March of next year. We'll have the annualization of Fukuoka in there for most of the year. And so while we're not ready to guide to a specific number next year, I think it's fair to say that we'll have a bit more international growth next year.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. And that's also a function of having some of the deliveries packed at the end of this year, which gives us growth in the next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hunter Keay, Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: So you've been scaling back from Neighbor Island capacity now for a few months, but just over the weekend, you added some back. I was wondering what changed? Did you maybe cut too deep, or is there a little bit of a demand rebound? Or is this maybe in response to some of the changes in the competitive landscape?\nPeter Ingram: Hunter, some of it was just kind of typical Neighbor Island cleanup. We had some stuff that we trimmed down in a few select markets and quickly brought in back over the week. It was a combination of, really, several things. One was frequency on high demand days. In Maui, we had some ads that we put in for the state paddling championships where, over the next full while, the demand has been exceptionally strong and we wanted to be able to meet the need of groups wanting to go and really travel for that. And then there was a bit of -- a kind of [day-week frequency ads] later in the quarter. So nothing kind of material in there. A bunch of little things and tweaks that we are making, similar to tweaks that we're making a little earlier in the quarter on the other side.\nHunter Keay: Okay. And then I'd love to get -- I have a question for Peter or whoever, but I'd love to get the corporate view of the effort to take control of the airports away from the state DOT and establish an independent airport corporation. Can you talk about the risks and opportunities for you guys if that happens? I'm thinking maybe nicer facilities but maybe with some higher costs. Let me know what the puts and takes are on this, not necessarily whether or not you think it happens, but maybe the risks and opportunities in the event that it does.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. For the benefit of those who may not know as much about this as Hunter does, Hawai'i is one of 3 states in the United States where the airport is not controlled by an airport authority or some sort of an airport corporation. The state of Hawai'i airports are managed as a department of the State Department of Transportation. And we have -- we and the other members of a group called the ACH, which is the Airlines Committee of Hawai'i, which is all the airlines that operate into Hawai'i, haven't supported for the past several years the establishment of an airport corporation or an airport authority to give us more consistent management of the airport [Technical Difficulty] in session throughout the year if we have capital projects that need to be approved or modified. We don't have the ability today to do that throughout the year. It has to be done. Those changes have to be done when the legislature is in session. When we have a change of administration, we are susceptible to capital projects that are in the planning phase being replanned and reguided to match the whims of a changing political environment. And we're also subject to a fairly prescriptive and restrictive procurement code that isn't always the sort of flexible procurement rules that you would like to have for a business where you are willing to trade off sometimes a little bit of cost for quality and for reliability and dependability, particularly when we're talking about expensive long-term construction projects. So we've advocated for that -- for I think going on 4 sessions now. We have been hopeful at various times that that would be passed most recently. There was a bill in place during the legislative session this year, but that bill unfortunately died before the end, and we didn't -- we weren't successful and it's not clear whether a bill will be introduced in the next legislative session, which stars in January of next year. I should point out that we have, in the past, attributed some of the challenges, with the oversight of the airports, to some of the delays in construction projects and a famous one was our maintenance hangar that we moved into a couple of years ago, which was several years late. Importantly, I should point out that we're -- even though we haven't been successful in getting a change to establish an airport corporation, we're working very closely with the Department of Transportation and the administration to make sure that the big construction project that is ongoing at the airport right now, which is the creation of a new Mauka Concourse, which is a real positive development in terms of giving more gate capability and the state is tracking. And that project is, in fact, on track and construction is going well. And we're optimistic that that will be ready to move into in 2021.\nOperator: Our next question is from Catherine O'Brien, Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O'Brien: So Shannon, maybe one for you first. So the $25 million that you have in productive cost savings this year and then you said you have line of sight on another $50 million going forward, is this all part of the $100 million cost program you guys introduced last year at Investor Day? And I guess, could you help us bridge kind of the $25 million to $50 million to $100 million, over what time period are you looking for that?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes, this is all part of the $100 million program that we have. We didn't start the program with a bunch of ideas in the bank. We didn't know that we are -- we had 80% of it identified. We really eventually started on this this year. So for 2019, the projects and the initiatives that we will be able to execute will result in a $25 million annualized savings run rate. We also have line of sight to another $25 million worth of projects that we haven't quite initiated yet. But we know how we'll execute and we just have to get through those projects. So that gets us to about half of our total project. And as we're speaking, we have about a dozen working groups just looking at all different types of cost areas in the company to find the other $50 million. So the target is to identify and execute on the $100 million annualized run rate by the end of 2021.\nCatherine O'Brien: Great. Maybe just one clean-up modeling question for Shannon, and then one for the group. Shannon, in the June quarter, you said you had a onetime maintenance credit that was unexpected. Could you help us size the impact so we can think about that modeling going forward?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. I think that was about 0.3 percentage -- year-over-year percentage points.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay, great. And then maybe just -- you spoke of some of the trends in international. It sounds like PRASM has been strong there. Have you seen any discernible change in the fare environment since ANA rolled out its latest [upgrading] efforts this month?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. So for those of you who aren't as intimately familiar with the ANA schedule, they started service with the A380 around Memorial Day and then have been upgrading service. I think there are 10 a week now and will find their way to double daily. It really hasn't had that much of an impact in terms of market performance. There was some initial pricing activity that was a bit more stimulative in nature. That seems to have dissipated. And somewhat offsetting some of the ANA ads has been some OA capacity decreases in those markets as well. And so certainly, there was a lot of press around the ANA A380 entry in the service, but overall we're really encouraged with the performance we're seeing in Japan in total but certainly in Tokyo as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi, Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: I went off to adjust my model for the state paddling competition. When you look at PRASM by route, are you seeing -- just on the North America side, are you seeing kind of PRASM pressure across the board? Or is it isolated at this point just to the routes where you're seeing the increase in capacity?\nBrent Overbeek: No, it is -- Joe, it is really kind of a route by route impact. Some of it is capacity driven. Some of it is industry-pricing driven. I would say, in general, there is a degree of conformity around performance with some of the markets where we were new entrants. Last year, we were just ramping up service. We've seen more improvement in some of those markets, in getting the right-sized gauge airplane on there in terms of A321s. So it's really kind of a mixed bag. And frankly, it's a bit of a difficult comp given some of the scheduled turmoil we had both last year and this year as we're working through some of the 321 delivery issues.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. And then maybe one for you Peter. You guys are on track for a few hundred basis points or so in margin compression in 2019. And just based on what the new competitor there said last week about some new route announcements coming, it seems like maybe it's similar capacity environment next year, at least on the North America and Neighbor Island side. Can you just talk about what initiatives you guys think you have to offset another year of margin compression or is that just kind of what we should expect until, I don't know, supply and demand region equilibrium?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. So a couple of thoughts on that. One, a little early to talk about all the impacts on 2020 capacity. Certainly, as you pointed out, one of our competitors has indicated that they plan to make some announcements and that is as foreshadowed as some of the announcements that they made earlier this year. So we've been expecting that. But there may be some other capacity changes as well. So it's a little early to say exactly how the 2019 competitive landscape lays out. In terms of initiatives, I'll highlight a couple of big ones that are going to be coming in late this year or early next year that I think are important in terms of swinging our revenue performance. And one is Main Cabin Basic that we've been talking about for a while. And as Brent said in his comments, we are expecting to have that roll out as we've been talking about for a while in the back half of this year and be flying Main Cabin Basic passengers before the end of the year. The Japan -- joint business with JAL is another very important one that we're rolling out. That will help us take advantage of some of the new capacity we're putting in Japan, which is in a different geography, but obviously that helps boost our numbers. So those are a couple of the key things that we have going, in addition to the new routes that we talked about in my comments, with the Fukuoka and the new Haneda route. Joe, there are 2 other things I should mention. One, obviously the cost transformation initiative is another piece. So in addition to doing what we can to turn around the revenue environment, the important initiatives that Shannon mentioned, having $25 million of run rate doesn't mean there's $25 million in this year's numbers. So we'll realize all of that and then some of the [$50 million run rate] that we've identified and maybe some more as the teams identify more. So that helps. And then one, just one little bit of modeling help to your earlier comment about the State Paddling Championship. Next year, it's going to be in Oahu, so there's fewer teams that will be traveling. So you should factor that in your detail in August for next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg, Deutsche Bank.\nMatt Fallon: This is actually Matt Fallon on for Mike. So how much of the capacity reduction in the new 2019 guide was due to Neo delays, and how much was trimming?\nBrent Overbeek: I don't have the specific number in front of me, but it was a bit of Neighbor Island trimming, particularly in the front part of the year, most noticeably in kind of 1Q and a little bit of 2Q on Big Island in terms of responding to softening demand that we had seen earlier in the year there. We trimmed a bit of Australia off-peak capacity and so that's probably in the couple of tenths percentage-wise and some of the off-peak periods as there has been a bit of currency pressure. And then the vast majority of it then has been A321 delays. Things have really just gotten pushed to the right. And so some of our initial plans, for example, we're going to start up a second San Francisco-Honolulu later this year. That was originally in -- our original plan was within the second quarter and now that's going to be actually in the fourth quarter. So things like that, where we've had to slide somewhere growth out to the right. We've had to rejigger some of our maintenance planning to accommodate that. It has been a little bit more challenging, but the vast majority of it has been A321 delays. But like I said, a bit of puts and takes in some other markets as well.\nMatt Fallon: This is a quick follow-up. If you don't really see yields or cover to where you are comfortable with, do you think there can be more cuts in the margin maybe like Q4 '19 or even into early 2020?\nBrent Overbeek: At this point, I think we're pretty comfortable with our capacity position. We are producing above average. We've got a nice revenue premium relative to our competitors. In North America, we're encouraged with our performance. On a relative basis, they are even while the macro environment remains off of its historic highs in 2017 and 2018. And we're certainly focused on delivering kind of the breadth and depth of schedule in Neighbor Island that our customers have come to expect from us. And so, at this point, I don't think we see any material changes to that going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani, Morgan Stanley.\nRajeev Lalwani: Shannon, first, a question for you. You highlighted a handful of cost initiatives ahead. What's the overarching goal? Are you trying to get back to that sort of flat to down CASM trend? I think that's what you were previously guiding to. So just some color there would be helpful.\nShannon Okinaka: This cost exercise that we're doing is less about 2019, more about long-term structural cost. Sometimes when we focus on the current year or even the budget process, when we're focused on the next year, we're really limited to what we can do in the short term. And then you playing with timing things and things like that, and that doesn't really help our underlying business. We're not doing this cost exercise because we're at the point of bankruptcy and we really need to save on cash. It really is to allow us to grow more efficient [Technical Difficulty] range at this point of 1 to 2.5 points. The cost initiative definitely feeds into that. We've incorporated the benefits that we believe we'll achieve in 2019, but really on the big $100 million cost initiative, it's really more about long-term run rate savings.\nRajeev Lalwani: Okay. Great. And then a revenue question for Brent, Peter. As it relates to competitive capacity that you've seen come into the market, how quickly has pricing in some of those markets improved? Have you seen sort of rapid maturity and lot of that discounting going away quick? And is there any difference between what you've observed on the interisland side versus the North America side? Hello?\nPeter Ingram: Rajeev, you broke up there real quick at the end. Can you be repeat like the last 10 seconds of your question? Sorry.\nRajeev Lalwani: Yes. I'm not sure what the last 10 seconds of my question was. Just generally, in terms of as you've seen competitive capacity growth come through, how quickly have the markets matured? Has pricing rebounded at all? And is there any difference, I think maybe this is what you were referring to, between the interisland side and the North America side as far as resilience and rebounding and pricing, if there is any?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I would say there was certainly -- when we got on and talked last quarter about the North America pricing environment, there was a lot of discussion or a lot of focus on some promotional activity that's been put into the marketplace by some of our competitors. That wasn't really that reflective in what actually selling fares were in, a large part, North America. Our view has been that promotional pricing -- we really just see pricing as kind of continue off the trends we'd seen in 1Q and 4Q of last year. So nothing kind of material in terms of step changes there. On the Neighbor Island side, we have seen a fair amount of activity in promotional activity across a couple of our markets. And while that has seen probably sequential improvement over the course of the quarter, those are kind of incremental steps in terms of week changes, in terms of applicability or nominal increases in fare amounts.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan Mackenzie, The Buckingham Research Group.\nDan Mackenzie: Going back to more international growth next year. Can you just remind us how these routes typically spool up? Should we think about this growth as being margin additive or diluted upfront? And what would be driving kind of the -- one or the other, the revenue side or on the cost side?\nPeter Ingram: Sorry, Dan. You broke out again. Which routes are you referring to? You're talking about the new Japan routes?\nDan Mackenzie: Yes. The international growth next year. I was just wondering if you can remind us how these routes typically spool up. Should we think of the growth as being margin additive or margin dilutive upfront?\nBrent Overbeek: In terms of the big international routes that we've got adding next year, adding a frequency into Haneda, we've got a well-known brand there going into the preferred downtown airport, we're going to open up some new markets in terms of domestic connectivity into more secondary cities into Japan. And so we're really excited about that. And while it's additional capacity, I think, our view is between that and the JAL relationship, that's going to hit the ground running. In terms of Fukuoka, I think, it is a well-established market. It is one where we think we've got the right formula to succeed. Again, the benefits of the JAL partnership are going to be there. We've got the right level of frequency, having a premium cabin and extra comfort. Inevitably, there'll be a bit of a ramp-up period. But in my view, this will be relatively shorter compared to other international markets.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. And I would echo that. We've talked about maturity of international routes before. But they're really -- they're not all created equal. And certainly, the maturity of Japanese travel to Hawai'i is different from anything else international into Hawai'i. And Tokyo, in particular, is the most mature city of the most mature country in terms of how it develops. And that's been our track record since we've been serving Japan for about a decade now.\nDan Mackenzie: I see. A second question here. Just regarding the new law restricting Airbnbs in Oahu. I'm just wondering what your initial thoughts are around how that might impact demand in Hawai'i. How are you guys thinking about that?\nPeter Ingram: Dan, it's an interesting one and we don't have a real precise assessment to be able to give you in terms of what the impact is going to be. We do expect that there will be some curtailing of the availability of vacation rental accommodations in the coming months. That will either make it potentially more expensive or more difficult for people who want to have those sort of accommodation experiences. And that may manifest itself in some pressure on demand from North America. It's really hard for us because this is a fairly opaque market to understand exactly how big that is. But I think we're optimistic that, based on our strong position in the market and our revenue premium and the breadth of our service and how strong our brand is, we will be able to withstand any of that pressure better than any one of our competitors.\nDan Mackenzie: Understood. If I could maybe squeeze one more here. Just looking at the 10-Q, as you guys were kind of going through your script, the one thing that struck me was the stock buyback in the quarter seems like it was a little light just given where the stock is. And I guess I'm wondering, why not be a little bit more aggressive and perhaps signal a little bit more confidence in the outlook here?\nPeter Ingram: Dan, I don't know that I agree with your characterization of it being a little light. I think we bought back a little bit more in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. We've got a buyback program that we have executed against over a period of time. And we've had, in addition to the capital we're returning to investors in the form of dividends, which we have been declaring quarterly, so we're going to continue to be opportunistic about how we buy back. We think there is tremendous value in doing that right now when we balance out with our other capital needs as we always do.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker, Cowen.\nHelane Becker: I just have 2 questions. One, as you think about market opportunities as -- and growth over the next few years, how do you think about the difference between domestic and international, A. And B, as you think about adding international capacity, how do you think about markets like Japan? I think you served Fukuoka at one point in the past and you're going back, but there are other markets that you've been in and out of. Is there a time when it makes sense to go back to some of those markets?\nBrent Overbeek: In terms of -- one of the things that we've established over time is really a balanced network and the flexibility to be able to grow and react to market demand, whether it be on the international side, the West Coast or even deeper into the mainland. So we've got a flexible view of how we can adapt and change to changing market conditions there. In terms of the international side, I think I'll pick on Fukuoka specifically. It is a much different market than when we previously served it. Industry capacity is going to be down north of 60% from when we previously served it. If I looked at our ability in terms of commercial execution, having the right airplane with a lie-flat product, our ability to put Extra Comfort in and monetize that, our relationship with JAL and what that brings, both today in terms of just their presence and down the road in anticipation of getting ATI, I think it is a comparison of 2 very different things. And so I think as we look at the market now, we expect very different results from where we were before.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call back over to Peter Ingram for closing remarks.\nPeter Ingram: Thank you, Homer. hello again to everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest, and we look forward to talking to you again in a few months.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Daniel Wong, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Mr. Wong, you may begin.\nDaniel Wong: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings' First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Here with me in Honolulu are Peter Ingram, President and Chief Executive Officer; Shannon Okinaka, Chief Financial Officer; and Brent Overbeek, Senior Vice President of Revenue Management and Network Planning. Peter will open the call with an overview of the business. Next, Brent will share an update on our revenue performance and outlook. Shannon will then discuss our cost performance and outlook. We'll then open the call up for questions, and Peter will end with some closing remarks. By now, everyone should have access to the press release that went out at about 4:00 Eastern Time today. If you have not received the release, it is available on the Investor Relations page of our website, hawaiianairlines.com. During our call today, we will refer at times to adjusted or non-GAAP numbers and metrics. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers and metrics can be found in our press release or in the Investor Relations page of our website. As a reminder, the following prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our future plans and potential future financial and operating performance. Management may also make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. We refer you to Hawaiian Holdings' recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. This includes the most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports filed on Form 8-K. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo, Daniel. Aloha, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Daniel noted, by now, most of you have seen the results we reported for the first quarter, which reflect the solid start to 2019. Relative to the expectations we provided at the beginning of the period, we came in right in line, if not at the better end, in terms of revenue, cost, capacity and fuel consumption. I'll let Brent and Shannon take you through the more granular detail later in the call, but suffice to say there were no big surprises in the period. Our team continues to do a terrific job of delivering the aloha spirit to our guests, and since we last talked, it has been confirmed that we were the nation's punctuality leader for a remarkable 15th consecutive year in 2018. We've also been moving steadily up the industry baggage handling rankings, coincident with our implementation of baggage scanning throughout our system over the course of 2018. My sincere thanks go out to the best team in the business that continues to deliver day in and day out. I am incredibly proud to be a part of their team. Of course, we understand that investors remain focused on the evolution of our competitive environment, especially from the western U.S. to Hawaii. During the quarter, we witnessed the confirmation of the initial phase of Southwest capacity to Hawaii with flying commencing late in the period. Nothing we have seen so far deviates materially from what has been foreshadowed over the past 18 months. And nothing has changed our view that we should continue to execute our strategy and focus on the things we need to do to serve the needs of guests traveling to, from and within the Hawaiian Islands better than any other carrier, just as we have done for many years. In this context, at our Investor Day late last year and on our fourth quarter earnings call, I spoke about a number of priorities that we are focusing on in 2019 that we believe will bring value to our guests, our team and our investors. Thanks to the tireless efforts of my colleagues, we've made solid progress against these priorities right out of the gate in 2019. Let me take a few moments to share some highlights of our progress. Delivering products our guests value is a key area of focus. Earlier this month, we launched non-stop service between Sacramento and Maui, and between Boston and Honolulu as we continue to expand our network. Sacramento marks the eighth North American origin point linked to our growing Maui hub, taking advantage of the A321neos that are the ideal aircraft for the midsized origin and destination routes to Maui from the U.S. West Coast. Since adding the A321neo to our competitive arsenal just a little over a year ago, we have deployed it on five routes to and from Maui, following through on the strategy for this aircraft that we shared with our investors since we announced the order a few years back. Boston, meanwhile, marks our 13th U.S. gateway city to Hawaii, more than any other airline, and taps into the largest market for Hawaii visitors that was previously without non-stop service to the islands. Both of these new routes are off to a great start, and we expect them to be core routes in our network portfolio going forward. While I'm on the topic of connecting more guests to Hawaii, I'll take a moment to provide an update on our planned joint venture with Japan Airlines. We were notified by the DOT at the end of March that our antitrust immunity application was deemed substantially complete, which moved us to the next phase of the process whereby public comments on the application were accepted up until April 15. Our response to these comments is due this week, and based on where we are in the process, we are optimistic that ATI for the JV can be approved later this year, which would allow us to initiate the joint venture either late in 2019 or early in 2020. We're encouraged to see the process moving forward and look forward to building on the strong results we are already seeing from our partnership with JAL. And at the same time that we are focused on growing our partnership with Japan Airlines, the DOT initiated a proceeding during the first quarter to allocate new route authorities for Haneda Airport that are expected to be made available for the 2020 summer season. We applied to add three new daily services between Tokyo's Haneda Airport and Honolulu, which will allow us to build on the successful operation we have established in Tokyo over the past eight plus years. We're confident the DOT will see merit in our proposal to add service to the largest O&D market between Japan and the United States and provide compelling and unique connecting service to smaller markets elsewhere in Japan, which have excellent potential for growth if more attractive schedules can be made available. We also continue to make strides in preparing our Main Cabin basic product for introduction later this year. As Brent will explain shortly, Main Cabin basic will enhance our ability to compete against similar products currently offered by our domestic competitors between North America and Hawaii. Another priority for 2019 is improving the guest experience and aspiring to make travel effortless. Guest experience is at the core of our ability to differentiate our service and generate a unit revenue premium. And we have several initiatives underway here. Our near-term focus is particularly on the day-of-travel experience and how we elevate our guests' airport experience. To this end, we launched our brand-new mobile app in the first quarter. The primary features of the new app feature on the day-of-travel experience and guiding our guests through the airport with greater ease. We'll continue to evolve the app over time, but the first release is already a step-function improvement in functionality that has been recognized by our guests. Even more visible work related to this priority is taking place at our airports, particularly here in Hawaii. Late in 2018 and into January, we decongested our lobbies in Honolulu by moving check-in for our Japan flights to a new location. This will allow us to address some of the deficiencies in our existing space with less customer impact and help to improve passenger flows and lobby throughput. We also have plans to overhaul our check-in spaces at other Hawaii airports, replace aging kiosk hardware and develop the phased rewrite of our kiosk software. All of these upgrades will move us closer to our goal of enabling effortless travel. And of course, there's a lot going on behind the scenes. As I noted earlier, the introduction of baggage scanning throughout 2018 has contributed to a marked reduction in mishandled bags. These initiatives I've just highlighted and others we have in the works will not only improve guest experience, they will also allow us to operate more efficiently and improve our cost structure, which is another of our 2019 priorities. As Shannon will speak to later in the call, we see the use of technology, fuel efficiency, labor efficiency and process effectiveness as the key levers that will allow us to bend the cost curve and achieve at least $100 million of annual run rate cost improvements over the next couple of years. And finally, our fourth priority is building a foundation for the future. This speaks to improving our processes and technology to allow us to scale our business more nimbly going forward. To that end, we launched our mainland technology center in Phoenix, Arizona during the first quarter. When fully operational, this center will improve our ability to be more responsive in the rapidly changing IT space and deliver innovation more quickly and at lower cost. So what you are not hearing me say is that in the heightened competitive environment, we are shifting our strategy 180 degrees. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Our products and services are uniquely designed to serve the specific needs of guests traveling to, from and within the Hawaiian Islands, and our outstanding team is focused on serving these needs at the highest level. Can we execute this strategy more effectively? Sure. In fact, continuous improvement is part of how we've achieved success up to now, and it will be essential as we move forward. The initiatives I highlighted will accentuate our strengths, shore up our weaknesses and position our unparalleled team to deliver the outstanding authentic Hawaiian hospitality that has become our hallmark. As we deliver on these initiatives, I'm confident that returns will be delivered to our bottom line, and shareholder value will be enhanced for the long-term. With that, let me turn the call over to Brent to review revenue performance.\nBrent Overbeek: Thank you, Peter, and aloha, everyone. RASM for the first quarter was down 3.7% year-over-year, which was in line with our latest guidance update and just under a point better than the midpoint of our guidance on our last quarterly earnings call. This result included one percentage point of collective benefit from fuel surcharges and foreign currency in the quarter offset by about one percentage point of headwind from the Easter holiday shift. First quarter domestic PRASM was down 7% year-over-year due to pressure on average fares in North America; continuing demand softness to Hawaii Island and our Neighbor Island network; and the continued evolution of our network, which drove domestic stage length up 6.5% year-over-year. To highlight the impact of stage length growth on our results, North America and Neighbor Island entities' year-over-year performance were each two to three points better than the combined domestic total. Meanwhile, international PRASM was up 2.6% year-over-year as continued strong performance in Japan, partially driven by the aforementioned benefit of fuel surcharges, helped us set pricing and currency pressure in Australia. Cargo revenue declined 2.6% year-over-year in the first quarter. Consistent with industry trends, we've seen some moderate softness for business departing Asia, which is more than offsetting some of the yield improvement we've seen out of the North America market. Revenue growth for value-added products remains strong. Extra Comfort continues to perform well, driving seat upgrade revenue - revenue growth of 29% year-over-year in the first quarter. Revenue from the sale of HawaiianMiles was up over 40% year-over-year during the quarter as we lap the anniversary of our new credit card deal with Barclays. Looking ahead, we expect our second quarter RASM to be down between 2% to 5% year-over-year on our own capacity growth of 1.5% to 3.5% year-over-year. While the midpoint of the RASM range is similar to our year-over-year RASM change in the first quarter, the puts and takes of how we arrive there is quite a bit different. We estimate the Easter holiday shift will benefit the quarter by about one percentage point. However, fuel surcharges and foreign exchange will become a headwind of roughly 0.25 percentage point. All of this coincides with the backdrop of a material sequential increase in industry capacity in our domestic markets. Finally, we anticipate our domestic stage length will grow by 8.5% year-over-year, putting further pressure on RASM. Clearly, we're not satisfied with the year-over-year unit revenue declines, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing in our underlying business and the execution of our long-term strategy. In North America, demand for the Hawaii vacation remains robust. Our North America load factors remained at high levels and, in fact, grew a little more than one percentage point year-over-year in the first quarter. Clearly, some of this is a function of the current industry pricing in the market. But we remain optimistic considering North America-to-Hawaii industry capacity is still elevated compared to historical levels. Next, our A321neo rollout is right on track. We took delivery of our 12th A321neo in the first quarter. And as Peter mentioned earlier, we continue to benefit from the aircraft's superior ability to connect midsized U.S. West Coast markets to Hawaii. We launched - we launched our first transpacific A321neo just 15 months ago. By the end of the second quarter, we'll have deployed the aircraft across 13 routes between the West Coast and Hawaii, including four brand-new routes and nine routes that were previously served by our wide-body 767 aircraft, the last of which we retired in January of this year. In addition to serving midsized U.S. West Coast markets, the 321neo allows us to optimize service to our larger U.S. West Coast markets. Starting in October, we'll be supplementing our daily wide-body service between San Francisco and Honolulu with an additional A321neo service, thus offering more choices and time-of-day coverage for our guests traveling to and from the bay area. By the end of the year, we'll have 16 A321neos in the schedule, with the last two of our orders entering commercial service in the front portion of 2020. We're also quite excited about the opportunities our Main Cabin basic product will provide when it launches between North America and Hawaii later this year. While the industry's deployment of basic economy has been slower in Hawaii than on the U.S. mainland, we know there is value for both Hawaiian and our guests once we are able to offer the product. Notably, Main Cabin basic should help us alleviate some of the downward pressure we've experienced as of late on our Main Cabin yields, especially as the competitive landscape intensifies for the routes between North America and Hawaii. At a steady state, we expect Main Cabin basic to contribute between $15 million to $25 million of incremental revenue annually for North America. We're also working on the optimal plan for the product elsewhere in the network, so there is potential for further upside to these numbers long term. In our Neighbor Island network, we've adjusted our capacity to reflect the new reality of a smaller market size to Kona and Hilo on Hawaii island. These adjustments we've made to the schedule reflect the market environment while still allowing us to maintain a robust schedule to meet the needs of our Kamaaina [ph] and visiting guests. And we'll continue to work with local tourism officials as to how we can effectively drive traffic back into the Big Island. Internationally, our comprehensive partnership with Japan Airlines continues to deliver strong results. Co-chair and airline traffic exchange between Hawaiian and JAL is 25 times higher over the past 12 months versus the comparable measurement period between our previous partner in the region. And I echo Peter's earlier comments about the tangible enthusiasm both here at Hawaiian and at JAL for the benefits our joint venture can deliver to our guests and the communities we serve. Revenue from our value-added products remains strong with sales of HawaiianMiles, Extra Comfort and a bit of upgrade products all performing well. And finally, while the international cargo side of our business has slowed, the domestic business is holding up well, and we look forward to expanding our Neighbor Island all-cargo operation in the back half of the year. And now with that, I'll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start by briefly highlighting our first quarter results. Today, we reported first quarter adjusted net income of $32.6 million or $0.67 per share and an adjusted pretax margin of 6.7%. And though our first quarter profitability reflects the challenging revenue environment that Peter and Brent spoke to earlier, we still expect to be in the top tier of our domestic peers in adjusted pretax margin during our most seasonally challenging quarter. Now turning to costs. Non-fuel unit costs were up 1.4% year-over-year in the first quarter, which is in line with our revised guidance range and about one point better than the midpoint of our original guidance range. The improvement from our original guidance range was primarily due to lower-than-expected costs relating to our cargo freighter business. For the second quarter, we expect CASM ex fuel to range from down 0.5% to up 2.5% versus last year. This includes headwinds of a little less than one percentage point from higher wages and benefits expense from contractual rate increases, filling of vacancies and related payroll taxes; and a little over 0.5 point due to maintenance costs, driven by power-by-the-hour rate increases and feed mix. Nonrecurring credits received in the second quarter of 2018 were completely offset by lower volumes of heavy maintenance events in 2Q '19. This keeps us on pace for full year CASM ex fuel to be flat to up 3% year-over-year. And consistent with our past guidance practices, these ranges exclude assumptions relating to the amendable contract with our Flight Attendant Union, which is currently in mediation. Turning to fuel. Fuel rates have increased since last quarter's call. Based on the fuel curve as of April 10, we expect our economic fuel cost to be approximately $2.19 per gallon for the second quarter and $2.16 per gallon for the full year. Helping to offset the impact of rising fuel rates is our improved fuel efficiency. In fact, fuel consumption decreased 1.2% year-over-year in the first quarter as we grew our capacity by 2.5%. Altogether, this benefited CASM by more than 0.5 point. As Peter mentioned, we're focused on our goal of reducing our structural costs by an annual run rate of at least $100 million by the end of 2021. We've made progress identifying and analyzing opportunities, and I remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal given the projects already underway and others that are in the planning stage. The areas we believe we have the largest opportunities are fuel efficiency, labor productivity and overhead. Building on the fuel efficiency gained from our fleet transition, we're targeting saving another 2% of fuel consumption longer term. Corporate focus is being placed on technology and process improvements, both guest facing and for our employees. Improving the day-of-travel experience for our guests includes providing better tools and data for our employees, allowing them to work more efficiently. Initiatives such as improving the gate and boarding experience and replacing our kiosks will benefit our guests, employees and bottom line. Quicker access to data, improved back office systems and automation of processes will allow us to focus on value-add decisions and analyses rather than transaction processing, which will result in lower overhead expense and provide managerial capacity for quicker and more nimble decision-making and action. Cost of sale is another significant category of spend where we have opportunities for cost savings, primarily through more efficient distribution and payment acceptance strategies. This is a company-wide effort. We're making investments in our people and organizational abilities, which is integral to sustaining meaningful cost discipline in the years ahead. By the end of 2019, we expect to have executed initiatives worth about $25 million of annualized savings. While there is more work to be done, I'm proud of the progress we've made to date. Having this be a multiyear effort means that we can do this in a smart way. We'll continue to invest in initiatives that grow revenue and strengthen our infrastructure, and we are avoiding short-sighted cost cuts that would diminish the high-quality product and service, upon - which our guests have come to expect. We'll keep you updated as we identify additional specific initiatives and tally the savings achieved. We're focused on executing our strategy. We're actively addressing near-term pressures while continuing to grow with an eye toward the long term. And we're doing it while creating value for our employees, our guests and our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll now turn the call back over to Daniel.\nDaniel Wong: Thank you, Peter, Shannon and Brent. I'd also like to thank all of you for joining us today and for your continued interest in Hawaiian Holdings. We're now ready for questions from the analysts. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Helane Becker, Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nHelane Becker: Great. Thanks very much, operator. Hi team, thank you very much for the time. You know, maybe, this is a question for Brent. As you look out to the second quarter, I know it's still fairly early, but can you just talk maybe a little bit about how bookings are shaping up? And also how your customers are responding to the A321neo?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. So in terms of advance bookings, we continue to see a strong demand environment certainly reflected in the guidance that we've given. April has helped that a little bit by the Easter shift. But overall, we're really encouraged with where we're sitting for the quarter and where total demand is at, in the face of some heightened industry capacity. In terms of customer acceptance of the neo, they've really enjoyed the product. I think some of the comments that we've heard, obviously, new, fresh, clean airplanes as well as delivering products and services on board, and our team are doing a fantastic job.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then as you - maybe, this is a question for Peter. As you think longer term about your business, you mentioned that the A321neo gives you an opportunity to fly more in Midwest cities to the island. And then what about international? For a while, you guys were growing international, and now maybe you're going to do it through the JAL joint venture. But are there opportunities for additional international service to other markets? Or - a; and b, maybe, with respect to the demand picture on the Midwest cities, are there enough - is there enough demand for people wanting to go from those locations to Hawaii that it would support frequent service?\nPeter Ingram: Sure. Thanks, Helane. I guess, in response to where the growth opportunities are for us, I think, there, certainly, is demand internationally. And you highlighted the JAL joint venture, which is a crucially important initiative for us. The - we're hoping to take advantage of that in particular with the new opportunities that are available or becoming available at Haneda in 2020. And we think we've got a very strong application for some new services there, and I think we see other opportunities in Japan. I think one of the things I would highlight about international markets, generally, is that we've been in a period the last couple of years where the currency environment has been more challenging for people visiting the United States and Hawaii, in particular, as the U.S. dollar has been strong. But currency markets change over time, and I think we're encouraged - I know we're encouraged by the fact that we're well positioned in the important visitor markets for Hawaii with the network that we have built in Australia and New Zealand and in Korea. And we see that over the next couple of years, as demand evolves, there will be more opportunities to grow on that strength because even as we are well positioned, it's not like we're 100% of market in any of those places. And I would say the same thing about North America. While we have a leadership position, our seat share from North America is in the high 20% range. And so there is ample opportunity for growth there. So we see a lot of runway of opportunity throughout our network, and we're in a position because we are well diversified to be opportunistic to pursue what makes sense at a certain point in time based on the demand environment that is out there.\nHelane Becker: Great, that's very helpful. Thanks, Peter. Thanks team.\nPeter Ingram: Sure, thanks Helane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Crissey, Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin Crissey: Hi, thank you so much for the time. Wanted to talk about the inter-island business generally with two questions. The first is: Can you help me understand why there has been - the root cause of the weakness on the inter-island?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I think it's somewhat twofold. I think we've had a softening demand for travelers from a long-haul perspective to the Big Island. And that's reflected not just in our own numbers, but reflected in tourism numbers if you look at occupancy rates and visitor data that we've seen there for people whose sole destination has been going to the Big Island, and we've seen some declines there. We've also seen some declines from people doing multi-island trips. And so people who are either coming here to Oaho [ph] and hopping over to the Big Island for a multi-day trip. Or combining the island of Kauai and the Big Island, we've seen some declines there as well. And so most of the decline, in what we've seen, has been tourist based, visitor based, and we've seen kind of our closing demand, core demand to what we see in our network within the Neighbor Island has been quite resilient throughout this process.\nKevin Crissey: And is that initially\u2026\nPeter Ingram: Kevin, if I could just add to that a little bit. If you step back in 2018, when we initially saw some of the impact on demand to the Big Island it was at a time when we had - the volcano on the island was erupting. And even though that affected only 10,000 - or 10 square miles of the 4,000 square miles of the island, it did serve to suppress demand for a little bit, and it closed Volcanoes National Park, which is one of the major attractions and the most significant attraction for one day tours that go to and from the island. That situation has evolved. The volcano is not erupting right now. But it did. The one day tours don't have as much to see with the volcano not erupting. And so that traffic hasn't come back entirely. And I think there is an opportunity for us to see if we can - as Brent said in his prepared remarks, to work with tourism officials throughout the state and make sure that we're doing what we can to stimulate the demand for travel to Kona and to Hilo, which still have a lot of great attractions for people to come and visit.\nKevin Crissey: Is any of this a function of the direct flights as - didn't more of your network connect in the past? I'm just wondering whether the strategies of direct connect had or direct flights had an impact overall. Or if this is just a near-term blip?\nBrent Overbeek: So Kevin, in terms of our own network development, as we've grown more direct service into Kona, into Lihue, we've expanded the Maui hub, we anticipated and forecasted that some of this connecting traffic of our own was going to move away on to direct non-stops over time. We also saw over the course of 2018 that a lot of the industry capacity that was going into the market from North America to Hawaii was actually going in directly to the Neighbor Islands. And so while we got partnerships with all three and co-chairs with all three of the big U.S. carriers, some of that traffic started traveling a little bit more direct on those carriers. And it's something that we could see in the forward schedules, and it was quite small overall, but we knew it was coming and have baked it into our plans.\nKevin Crissey: Good. If I could do one more follow-up. The - on the inter-island also, it's - has there been a time where two carriers have done well? I mean, I'm sure it's probably happened. It's just been a long time since I covered this space. I haven't really seen two carriers that operate in the inter-island business do well. Is there times where that can happen?\nPeter Ingram: I have to admit, Kevin, I don't have the full sort of 60 or 70 years of history of when there has been multiple competitors in the market. I would say, I don't see why it wouldn't be possible, but I think, what we're focused on making sure that we're successful. And I think we're well positioned to be successful because of the strong history we have serving here, how we've tailored our product for the Neighbor Island, the breadth of service we offer, the great products and our team that continues to do a great job every day. So we're focused on Hawaiian Airlines being successful.\nKevin Crissey: Thank you. I know those were some difficult questions. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hi, everyone thanks for taking the time. So could you just give us some color between how inter-island and North America PRASM trended underlying that domestic total down 7%. I know you noted that they are each two or three points better on the individual basis because of the stage length adjustments, but - I know last quarter, you give us the update on the breakup between the two. That would be very helpful.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I don't have the detail in front of me, Katie, but, call it, I think Neighbor Island was down about 4%, and North America was down about 5%. I think it's fairly close.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. Great. And is that sequential improvement in the inter-island from last quarter, do you think that's driven by your capacity reductions?\nBrent Overbeek: So it is a little bit better than where we were in 4Q, and some of that is a reflection of the capacity that we pulled down to the Big Island in 4Q - in 1Q to meet the new level of demand there.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. And there's the - if you could ask one more. I think, Brent, you noted earlier in the call that you were seeing - and correct me if I'm wrong here, you've seen 25% greater connecting passengers over the last 12 months with JAL versus your former partner. I guess, one, is that right? And then two, what percentage of total passengers are your connecting passengers today? And is there some sort of corresponding increase in RASM with that increase traffic?\nBrent Overbeek: So Katie, the number we gave was 25% - 25 times increase in the exchange of revenue that we had between ourselves and JAL, and that was inclusive of both international service from Japan to Hawaii as well as business within the Neighbor Islands. So we don't have it broken out specifically across the two geographies, but it is a material increase from where we were with our previous relationship.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. And does that increase drive a RASM increase? Is it PRASM positive, neutral, negative?\nBrent Overbeek: Oh, it's - we view it as certainly positive, and there is more room to grow as we grow our relationship with JAL. So we've been able to effectively exchange traffic just in the co-chair environment, offering customers more choice across our network and JAL's network from Japan to Hawaii. So it's not uncommon to see customers mixing itineraries from Osaka to Honolulu with JAL in one direction, Hawaiian in another. We believe that greater choice offers opportunities for customers but also improving our unit revenue. Furthermore, the amount of traffic that JAL's putting on us within the Neighbor Islands has also increased, and that's certainly accretive to RASM as well.\nCatherine O'Brien: If I could just squeeze in one more. How does the competitive capacity outlook change from maybe first quarter to second quarter to third quarter? Just any quick broad strokes would be really great.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I think I'll talk in North America specifically. So North America industry capacity in 1Q was up about 1% year-over-year. As we work our way into the second quarter, that increases, based on currently published schedules, to about 6% and moderately higher into 3Q about one point higher in 3Q. On the Neighbor Island front, industry capacity was down about 5% in 1Q and up about 2.5% right now we've published in 2Q as well.\nCatherine O'Brien: And then on the international?\nBrent Overbeek: On the International side, you got some puts and takes. So in 1Q, in markets where we operate, international capacity was up about 1% in 1Q. In 2Q, we start to see a little bit of industry capacity change in Osaka and Auckland with some declines there. So industry capacity goes down in the mid-four percentage point range. And then in 3Q, a little bit greater decline as we move our way into 3Q, kind of in the 5% to 6% range based on published schedules right now.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thank you very much for all the time.\nDaniel Wong: Thanks Cathy, another quick reminder. If we can keep the question, so one question, one follow up that would be great.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi, Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys, this is actually Bert on for Joe. This one is for Peter or Brent. Just wondering have you seen North America front cabin sales trends remain strong. And do you have the ability to flex premium or Extra Comfort sales in markets where it makes sense?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. So front cabin continues to perform really well. I don't have the specific details in front of me, but I want to say that front cabin RASM in North America was kind of mid-single digits percentage better than overall RASM performance. So we continue to see strength both for the lie-flat product and the 330s, but the 321 product's off to a good start as well. In terms of flexibility around both Premium Cabin and Extra Comfort pricing, it's stuff we'll continue to evaluate over the normal course of business. And we've got some additional technology improvements that we foresee coming over the next while that will help us be able to meet that at a more granular level than we currently have today.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. That's helpful. Just as a follow-up. Shannon, wondering if you could talk about the CapEx profile over the next few years. And where you see being free cash flow positive as far as corporate priorities?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Thanks. So from a CapEx perspective, I don't have numbers in front of me, but just talking through - most of our CapEx is in aircraft obviously. So for this year, we are accepting six 321 neos, one more next year, and that's it for aircraft deliveries in 2020. Our 787s will start arriving in 2021, and that first year has two. So fairly moderate after this year. This year's got a little bigger bubble with aircraft deliveries. Profitability, pretax margins, positive cash flow, those are all high priorities for us, and it's a big reason why we're doing our cost initiative. We balance all of those things. We're still investing in infrastructure for the long term, but really one of our bigger focus areas is ensuring we're reducing our costs and investing in revenue growth opportunities as well, like Main Cabin basic. So profitability and cash flow generation is definitely top of mind. This year, we are forecasting free cash flow - positive free cash flow, obvious, smaller than in prior years, but even with the aircraft deliveries, we are still forecasting positive free cash flow.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks so much everyone for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRajeev Lalwani: Hi, Peter, Brent, Shannon.\nPeter Ingram: Hi, Rajeev.\nRajeev Lalwani: Brent, in terms of the guidance that you put out there for RASM, does that reflect currently published schedules? Or is it schedules plus some assumptions on what may or may not come?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. Rajeev, that's our best view of the marketplace at this time. And so we've done it based on what we think is going to be in the market. I think at this point, we're not going to speculate as to what and when other people are going to put additional capacity into the market.\nRajeev Lalwani: Okay. That's fair. And then this may be for Peter, but you as well, Brent. In terms of the Hawaiian Airlines customer, how have they reacted to the entry by Southwest? I mean, is it a product that they're even interested in? Or something they're looking at? What have you been able to gather from talking, again, to your core customers?\nPeter Ingram: I think what I'd say is that we have a variety of customers, and they are across the spectrum of interest. And candidly, that's why we offer different products ranging from the Premium Cabin to Extra Comfort to Main Cabin and soon adding Main Cabin basic to that product portfolio. So some of that product base or customer base surely overlaps with demand for Southwest. I think there will be customers who make choices based on a variety of attributes. Again, we would come back to saying, \"Overall, we've tailored our products, our services, everything we do, how we schedule our airplanes and the great hospitality provided by our guests to serve Hawaii travelers, in general, better than anyone else.\" And we think we're well positioned to do that today and continue to do that long into the future.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you. I'll respect the two questions.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks, Rajeev.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hunter Keay, Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nHunter Keay: Thank you So Peter, I got to say given the - I'm surprised that how resilient pricing has been from the West Coast to Hawaii over the last five years or so relative to the amount of capacity that's been added. And obviously, we discussed earlier in the call with this good conversation with Kevin about maybe there is like a channel shift going on there away from some of the inter-island. But holding that aside for a second, why do you think that is? Why do you think pricing has been so resilient relative to the capacity? If I were to say, is it more a function of the West Coast U.S. economy being really, really strong? Or is it sort of the absence of ULCCs creating kind of a more traditional competitive environment?\nPeter Ingram: Well, demand has been strong for a number of years, I think that's right, and certainly strong economic performance in the core Western regions. Western U.S. is the largest source of visitors to Hawaii. So that has certainly helped. Over the course of five-year span of time, we've seen a variety of different capacity environments. We saw a period earlier in there where capacity was more benign and we were able to generate improved revenue for ASM and yield in that environment with the strong demand with more capacity. This year, we've certainly seen some pressure on yield that we've talked about. But demand remains very, very strong. Visitor counts to the islands are very, very strong. And I think some of it, in addition to the economic strength in the West Coast, some of that is just a testament of the enduring allure of Hawaii as a destination. We are the world's premier leisure destination. And it is even more accessible from the Western U.S. than it is the eastern U.S. And I think that just draws people back over time, and we look forward to that demand continuing for a long time.\nHunter Keay: Right. Okay. And then could you give us a little more color on the co-chair relationship you have with the Big Tree? Can you remind me is that a one-way co-chair? Is that a two way co-chair? And I'm wondering if that'd become a little bit lopsided in their favor. And how we should think about that going forward, particularly now that you've got little more gauge flexibility and options with the A321s?\nBrent Overbeek: So it's one-way, them coding on us just within the state of Hawaii. It's long-standing relationships we've had with all three carriers. And we intend to continue those going forward. We think it's a good transaction for us. It is - offers some utility of our Neighbor Island network for parts of the U.S. that we don't serve. And as we have evaluated the business, we're very happy with it, and we'll continue to do that and offer that utility to them but also to the people in the state of Hawaii as well.\nHunter Keay: Thanks guys. I appreciate it.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks, Hunter\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, two quick ones here. Peter and Brent, you could probably jump in on this. Just the application for Honolulu, Haneda. Let's say you get - maybe, you get three, maybe you get two, but you have two flights a day right now. So essentially we're talking about a doubling of capacity and presumably there may be some others who come from Haneda into Honolulu using some of the other sort of slots or route authorities that will become available. Peter, did I hear you correctly that it sounds like that rather than a local market, you also look at potentially connecting secondary over Haneda with some of those additional frequencies? Because that would seem like, if you're just concentrating or focusing wholly on the local market, that we would probably see some meaningful pricing pressure given the capacity increase. Just your thoughts on the strategy there.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Maybe, I'll start and then ask Brent if he wants to chime in with any other comments. First, just to recap what we have flying to Tokyo today. We fly 11 flights a week from Tokyo to Honolulu, plus another three from Tokyo to Kona, all from Haneda Airport. Plus, we've got other Tokyo service with a daily flight from Narita to Honolulu. So a total of three a week total flights from Tokyo area airports into the - or three a day flights from Tokyo airports into Hawaii. The application we have because of the availability of more daytime slots that are expected with this grant allows us, if our application is granted in its entirety, to offer flights in some different time channels into Haneda. And one of the things - and Mike, I know you're a student of the industry, and you would know this well. A lot of the domestic service in Japan is into Haneda, not to Narita. From some of the smaller places in Japan, they have flights to Haneda. If you want to connect to Tokyo, and you don't have good connectivity to a - one of the few direct Haneda flights into Honolulu now, you would have to transport a rather lengthy transport out to Narita to get connectivity out there. So it's really not as easy today. Certainly, we would expect to attract more local demand in Tokyo, and there is well into the double digits of overall flights a day from Tokyo to Honolulu. So it's a big market, and we would expect capacity to ebb and flow with demand over time overall. But our flights, with being able to operate in the time of day that we have proposed, would add a pretty unique opportunity to connect to some of the communities that really don't have good connecting access to Hawaii today.\nBrent Overbeek: Mike, as Peter mentioned, the local market itself is a big deep market with a variety of carriers serving it today. And in many cases, a lot of these secondary cities in Japan really - if they have an option of a single one-stop connecting in Japan, it is through one ANA flight. And so we'll be able to offer a variety of options, if we're granted what we applied for, for numerous cities, some of which don't even have a single one-stop connecting service today. And given the affinity that Japanese consumers have for coming to visit Hawaii, we think that's a really compelling proposition and an underserved market relative to what exists today.\nMike Linenberg: Great. And then Brent, just one quick one. FX, you called that out as a headwind in the second quarter. So presumably, with even the fuel prices are up, there is a bit of a lag. So if it's a headwind in the second quarter, does it potentially become a tailwind in the third quarter given the movement in fuel of late?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. So the currency - the fuel situation drives more of the volatility than the currency, Mike. The - probably the easiest way to think about it is particularly in Japan with the index being a bit lagged, we had, in 1Q, so for ticketing in January through March, call it, we were - on a year-over-year basis, we were between JPY 4,000 and JPY 4,500 one-way, up year-over-year in terms of fuel surcharge. Then when we actually switch into April and May, we actually are down JPY 2,000 year-over-year. And then as we look forward, while we don't have definitive numbers into the rest of the summer, I think we'll be much closer to parity year-over-year as those come into play. So it's a bit perplexing based on the timing of the measurement period, particularly as you can...\nMike Linenberg: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: No worries.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Mckenzie, Buckingham Research Group.\nDan Mckenzie: Hey, thanks for the time. Going back to Japan. And JALPAK switched on a year ago. In the back of my mind, I always thought that could be a material driver of revenue, and international PRASM was up 2%. If, I guess, you look over the past year, how has the JALPAK relationship trended? And what are the impediments from better monetizing that relationship?\nBrent Overbeek: So Dan, it's gotten off to a really good start. We are the only carrier that JAL has put in JALPAK besides themselves. We were able to sell a good amount of JALPAK. But I think we are certainly not done at this point. They have today - in essence, our relationship with JALPAK is that of an agency and an airline. And so we've got a relationship that incentivizes them a bit to sell our product, but certainly as we get into - with anticipation of granting ATI, we anticipate that their incentive to sell on us in a metal neutral fashion will continue to grow that opportunity that much more for the network that we have today where we overlap with JAL but certainly in places where we don't overlap. And we've seen great success in places like Chitose, where it was a unique, new offering for them.\nDan Mckenzie: Right. I suspect you don't have any ability to sell a basic economy fare?\nBrent Overbeek: That - we haven't talked about those specifics with them. And at this point, we haven't announced any plans to put basic economy in international markets. And so at a time when that becomes appropriate, we would - and we have ATI, we would be ready to have that conversation with JAL.\nDan Mckenzie: And that actually leads to my second question here. Thanks for the new info with $15 million to $25 million in new revenue from basic economy. Just wondering if you can just provide some take rate and average upsell fare amount behind that estimate? And the reason I ask is the estimate seems pretty conservative.\nBrent Overbeek: Well, thanks, Dan. As we went and seized the opportunity, we've looked at largely what's selling in the West Coast to Hawaii amongst the existing products in terms of what we can discern in terms of take rates from industry data sources. Certainly, what other carriers report on a macro perspective is their whole network. And having a different customer mix in terms of business and leisure is something that, certainly, they have factored in their macro numbers. As we try to seize the opportunity, we really focused on the information that we've got is to what viab [ph] and what people are doing out of competitive channels in the West Coast as well with competitive pricing in the market. So I wouldn't extrapolate what other carriers are doing at a system whole compared to what that's doing for them in the West Coast to Hawaii.\nPeter Ingram: And I would just underscore that basic economy is still a very new product overall in - from any North American carrier. And it's just been evolving a little bit in Hawaii. We did want to get some estimates out there, so people could have an opportunity to put some scale around what the expectation is as we roll our Main Cabin basic out in North America. I do expect that to continue to evolve over time. And I think the more - most important thing about it is having products that are available to target, consumers who value different things in their air travel products. And I think having the right product suite out there, which we think this moves us into the direction of is going to be positive for our competitive posture overall.\nDan Mckenzie: Okay. I appreciate, thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott O'Hara (sic) Steve O'Hara, Sidoti. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve O'Hara: Hi, good afternoon.\nShannon Okinaka: Hi, Steve.\nSteve O'Hara: Hi. Just curious on the application for the Haneda slot. If I recall, you guys did go on for a slot or a couple of slots the last time. And you didn't get it. I'm just wondering why you think your case is stronger this time versus last time.\nPeter Ingram: Actually, Steve, I think we got what we asked for last time. We were the only applicant for a night time slot, and we have the night time slot. And I believe we asked for one daytime, and we received the one daytime slot. And I think our application is strong this time. There is a total of 19 applicants for 12 available frequencies or 12 frequencies that are expected to be available. Our application focuses on the largest O&D between Japan and the United States. And as we talked about earlier, we've got a compelling case for being able to provide connectivity to some really underserved markets. So we think we have a strong case, and we look forward to hearing the DOT's determination in the months ahead.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay. Well, understand correctly. And just the follow-up, maybe. It seems like UHERO [ph] has kind of taken back their economic forecast, and there seems to be a lot of concern at least on their end for the HPA [ph] about visitor growth, visitor spending, et cetera. And I'm just wondering, I mean, as an outsider, I mean, it seems like there is some sort of a change happening in terms of the - maybe the welcome that visitors and tourists are likely to get in Hawaii. And I'm just wondering if that's - if you see that as being a potential headwind, or that's more just posturing maybe trying to raise fees down the road or something like that, raise revenue to kind of alleviate some of the choke points at tourist attractions, et cetera?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Steve, we've seen a lot of growth in visitor arrivals over the last few years to the point where, I think, 2018, we were very close maybe even a little above 10 million visitors overall to the island. As we've gone into the latter part of 2018, I think that growth started to flatten out. And early part of 2019, as we look at the visitor data, it's been flat to, if anything, down very low single digits in the first couple of months. I don't know that I would read too much into that. I think there is a period of time when there is expansion in markets that things settle out a little bit. I think there is a discussion that is going on and should go on about how we manage tourism sustainably in Hawaii. And that is sustainable from an environmental perspective and sustainable from a community perspective and very much sustainable from an economic perspective because we need to keep in mind that tourism is the core engine of the economy of Hawaii. And so keeping it healthy and strong is something that is important to everyone in this community. And certainly, as we go forward, at Hawaiian Airlines, we're very keen to be a part of that discussion and make sure we've got sensible policies in place to manage tourism growth for sustainability in all those areas I've mentioned going forward.\nSteve O'Hara: Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nPeter Ingram: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call back over to Peter Ingram for closing remarks.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo, again, to everyone for joining us today, and we appreciate your interest and look forward to talking to you, again, in a few months.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Daniel Wong, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nDaniel Wong: Thank you, Sherri. Mahalo everyone and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Call. Here with me in Honolulu are Peter Ingram, President and Chief Executive Officer; Shannon Okinaka, Chief Financial Officer; and Brent Overbeek, Senior Vice President of Revenue Management and Network Planning. Peter will open the call with an overview of the business. Next, Brent will share an update on our revenue performance and outlook. Shannon will then discuss our cost performance and outlook. We will then open the call up for questions and Peter will end with some closing remarks. By now, everyone should have access to the press release that went out at about 4 o'clock Eastern Time today.

This includes the most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K as well as subsequent reports filed on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. And with that, I will turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Hello, Daniel. Aloha, everyone, happy new year and thank you for joining us today. We had quite an eventful year in 2018. Through it all, our team has done an incredible job taking care of our guests and as we total up the financial results for the year, adjusted net income of $275 million, adjusted earnings per share of $5.44, and adjusted pre-tax margin of 12.6% and more than $126 million returned to shareholders standout as highlights. Given the increased competitive capacity we faced entering 2018 and higher fuel prices through much of the year, I am not sure many expected us to be able to deliver results like this and remain in the top tier of the industry from a profit margin perspective. Thanks for this goes to the 7,200 people with whom I have the honor of working everyday at Hawaiian. Their tireless effort, selfless dedication and passion for this company, is truly inspiring. I could not be prouder of what they continue to achieve everyday. I spent time on each of earnings calls in 2018 speaking to the headlines of the moment. The competitive capacity growth, weather events and aircraft delivery delays were top of mind at various points throughout the year, but we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that our team once again delivered in spite of the obstacles that came their way. We also produced strong operational results. We carried a record 11.8 million passengers in 2018, our 14th straight year of passenger growth and we did this while leading all U.S. carriers and on-time performance through October 2018, the period most recently reported by the DoT. We expect to remain on top when the full year\u2019s tally is complete, which will mark our 15th straight year of leading all U.S. carriers and punctuality. On top of this, we delivered on our key priorities for 2018. In early January 2019, we flew our final 767 flight. With 11 A321neos now in our fleet and 7 more to come, we are well underway on a multiyear fleet transition that unlocks new opportunities for our route network. Back in March, we selected the Boeing 787-9 as a flagship to aircraft for our future and the preparations for its arrival in early 2021 are right on track. We extended our partnership with Barclays, Bank of Hawaii and MasterCard for our co-brand credit card and enhance the customer value proposition for this product. Finally, we launched successful partnership with Japan Airlines, which we will build upon even further once we receive approval for our anti-trust immunized joint venture from U.S. and Japanese authorities. On our second quarter 2018 earnings call, I remarked how the year was shaping up like a road with more curves than straightaways. And while that certainly remained the case throughout the year, the fact is over the past several years, we have developed great resilience here at Hawaiian to see us through these kinds of challenges. Let me expand on that for a bit. We knew that 2018 would arrive with more competition, but we also know the competition makes us stronger and that our formula is a winning one. In 2018, we generated 52% of our passenger revenue between North America and Hawaii. In this geography, industry capacity increased nearly 11%. Unsurprisingly, this created a difficult environment to generate revenue growth. Nonetheless, for the time periods that we have competitive data from the DoT, we have not only held on to our revenue premium, but we have grown it. And as we sit here today, we are still talking about posting the second highest pre-tax margin in the industry for the full year. People ask me why I remain steadfast in my confidence about our prospects in the face of potential future competition. We have become the carrier of choice to, from and between the islands of Hawaii by relentlessly focusing on delivering authentic Hawaiian hospitality to our guests and executing our specific network missions better than any of our competitors. This is what we will continue to do and we expect to continue to be successful. As we look at our business in 2019, we are focused on a number of priorities that we believe will bring value to our customers, our employees and our shareholders. The first is building on our successful history of delivering products that our guests value. In 2019, this will include introducing new service to Boston starting in April and introducing main cabin basic to expand the range of options available to our guests later in the year. Second is making it easier for our guests to navigate the complexities of modern air travel. Most visibly, this will include investments in airport facilities and digital interaction channels, areas where we know we have room for improvement. Behind the scenes, it also includes investments in tools and practices that will improve our ability to deliver more efficiently the authentic Hawaiian hospitality that has become synonymous with Hawaiian Airlines. Third is improving our cost structure. Strong cost discipline and high productivity is critical to our long-term success. It\u2019s an important part of delivering value to our guests as well as our shareholders while ensuring we maintain our competitive edge. Fourth and finally is building a foundation for the future. This pulls together the priorities I listed in a way that ensures the improvements we are making in the business are sustainable for the long-term. This also means ensuring we position ourselves to grow more efficiently going forward, so we can continue to deliver value to our guests, our employees and our shareholders. Our success in 2018 reinforces my confidence that the Hawaiian Airlines team is positioned for even greater things in 2019 and beyond. Our employees will continue to deliver authentic Hawaiian hospitality unmatched by any of our competitors. Our fleet is better positioned than ever with fuel-efficient aircraft ideally suited to our network missions. This in turn opens up new network opportunities in North America just as our partnership with JAL will open new opportunities in Japan. Our team is ready for 2019 and I am sure they will continue to deliver results. And now, I will turn the call over to Brent to talk about our revenue in more detail.\nBrent Overbeek: Thanks, Peter and aloha, everyone. Total revenues for the fourth quarter grew more than 2% year-over-year to a record $697 million. Fourth quarter RASM was down 3.3% year-over-year on capacity growth of 5.6%. These results reflect about 130 basis points of benefit from fuel surcharges and foreign currency in the quarter. Our results came in a bit better than the midpoint of our final guidance revision as yields came in a bit stronger on international routes as did holiday traffic in North America. Turning to each geography, domestic PRASM was down 7.6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter with challenges for both North America and Neighbor Island routes. An increase in domestic stage length also impacted the overall decline as a result of each of the North America and Neighbor Island entities was more than a point better than the collective total. The fourth quarter represented the high point of our capacity growth in North America with Hawaiian capacity increasing nearly 11% year-over-year due to the timing of our A320neo deliveries. For the full year, our fleet transition enabled us to grow North American capacity by more than 9% year-over-year and launch year round service to 4 new markets. As we have previously discussed, the competitive pricing environment in the North American market remained challenging on a year-over-year basis as we worked our way through the latter half of the year. Not surprisingly, declines in main cabin average fares had the most material impact on this entity\u2019s results. On our Neighbor Island network, we continue to see demand softness, most notably for Hawaii Island and in response we have trimmed capacity on our Neighbor Island network and now forecast first quarter 2019 Neighbor Island year-over-year capacity to be down roughly 6%. We have also been increasing our marketing and promotional activities to support the weaker conditions. And overall, we will continue to evaluate the market and respond accordingly. Our international routes continued their strong performance. International PRASM was up 3.3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This was the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year PRASM improvement for this geography. Business class PRASM continued to perform well, especially in Japan and Korea, where we saw year-over-year business class PRASM increases in the high-teens. However, currency and softer market conditions in Australia pulled the entity results down a bit. Shifting to our value-added products, fourth quarter was another record setting period for Extra Comfort product, which produced $23 million in revenue, up 31% year-over-year. Revenue from sales of miles was also strong reflecting our new Barclays agreement, improving nearly 40% year-over-year. Finally, our cargo team capped a record year eclipsing $100 million in annual revenue for the first time. Consistent with the industry trends, our cargo revenue growth slowed sequentially and was down a bit more than 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and a slight reduction in freight volume. The replacement of some of our wide-body flying with A321neos, the suspension of our Beijing route, and slightly softer volume from our international business led to the slight decline. Despite the softer fourth quarter, we closed the year with revenue up nearly 10%. Reflecting back on our performance for the full year, system revenue came in at $2.8 billion, up 6% year-over-year. 2018 system RASM was flat year-over-year, matching a record-setting performance in 2017. We accomplished this despite significant industry capacity increases, most notably in North America, Osaka and New Zealand as well as the other challenges Peter referenced in his opening remarks. Our investments in the Front Cabin and Extra Comfort continue to reap dividends. Full year front cabin PRASM outperformed the Main Cabin by roughly 7 points and Extra Comfort had another great year, growing revenue by 33% year-over-year. With 2018 in the books, our attention is squarely on 2019. I will start with capacity. We expect our capacity to be up between 1.5% and 3% year-over-year in the first quarter and between 1.5% and 4.5% year-over-year for the full year 2019. As I mentioned at our Investor Day last month, our 2019 capacity growth is more in line with our historical average over the latter part of the decade. From a product perspective, the large majority of our 2019 capacity growth will come from Extra Comfort as product inventory grows with each A321 delivery. We expect first quarter RASM to be down 3% to 6% year-over-year, which includes a couple of notable headwinds. First, we have a difficult comparison with the first quarter of 2018 that benefited from strong performance, a favorable Easter calendar and a profit-sharing payment from our co-branded credit card. Second, industry pricing pressure on our North America routes that I mentioned earlier will continue to pressure yields in the quarter that has traditionally been our seasonal trough period. That said we are still quite positive about 2019 and ready to compete and win regardless of the environment. Underlying demand for the Hawaii vacation remains solid, our product investments are paying off and our fleet and network optimization efforts are positioning us well for the future. Later in 2019, we expect to start realizing the benefits of our JAL joint venture, pending regulatory approval and we will also add Main Cabin Basic to our product portfolio. Overall, there is a lot to be optimistic about. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent. Happy New Year everyone and thank you for joining us today. As Peter noted, we delivered a 12.6% adjusted pre-tax margin and an adjusted EPS of $5.44 in the face of significant competitive capacity increases, aircraft delivery delays and numerous weather events. Some of these were expected at the beginning of the year, but many were not. In the fourth quarter, we rounded out our year with adjusted net income of $49 million or $1 per share and adjusted pre-tax margin of 9.3%. In addition to generating profit margins in the top tier of the industry, since 2015, we have bought back more than 7.4 million shares of our common stock and including the 10.9 million shares we avoided issuing through the buyback of our convertible note, we have reduced our shares outstanding by about 27%. And as Peter mentioned earlier, we returned more than $126 million to shareholders in 2018 through $102 million in share repurchases and $24 million in dividends. Our announcement of a new $100 million share repurchase program authorized through December 2020 underscores the confidence that we have in our business and our people and reaffirms our commitment to growing long-term shareholder value. As discussed at Investor Day, cost control is at top of mind. Technology, labor productivity and process efficiency are the key levers we will utilize to bend the cost curve and we will always focus on ensuring we get good returns on our investments in the business. Our fourth quarter and full year 2018 CASM ex-fuel and special items were in line with the guidance that we provided earlier in the month. Fourth quarter CASM ex-fuel declined 1.9% year-over-year and for the full year was up 1.8%, which is consistent with the expectations we laid out in April after adjusting our plans for A321neo delivery delays. We delivered on the expectation we laid out in early 2018 that the back half of the year would show improved cost performance. Similar to 2018, our 2019 non-fuel unit cost story will have a number of moving parts. Compared to 2018, we expect full year 2019 CASM ex-fuel and special items to be in the range of flat to up 3% and we expect the first quarter to be up 1% to 4% year-over-year. Note that the year-over-year changes in 2019 CASM ex-fuel and special items will not be steady throughout the year due to the timing of ASM growth, the impact of our fleet transition and the differing maintenance costs for each fleet type, the timing of non-recurring A321neo maintenance-related credits received in 2018, and the timing of cost savings initiatives that we expect to realize during the year. Consistent with how we have previously guided CASM ex-fuel, these ranges exclude any assumptions relating to the amendable contract with our Flight Attendants Union. Notable cost headwinds for the first quarter as compared to 2018 include maintenance costs, which drive 0.5 point of the year-over-year increase; wages and benefits, which drive about 1 point due to contractual rate increases for various labor groups as well as labor costs related to our investments in technology; and about 0.5 point due to our freighter business, which has contributed to our cargo success, but does not generate related ASMs. Our non-fuel unit cost trajectory is moving in the right direction. At the midpoint of the range, our full year 2019 guidance is the lowest year-over-year cost growth we will have delivered in the last 5 years. As we focus on cost control, we are continuing to invest in the business. Our investments include technology to support revenue generating initiatives, such as Main Cabin Basic as well as initiatives to enhance the guest experience, which simultaneously allow us to improve our efficiency. For example, facilities improvements at our airports and enhancing our self-service capabilities will increase labor productivity while providing a better experience for our guests. Our new Mainland Technology Center and our JAL partnership are other examples of 2019 investments that we are confident will deliver long-term value to our guests, employees and our shareholders. We have a track record of delivering returns on invested capital that far exceed our cost of capital and we expect 2019\u2019s investments to continue that success. While we normally focus on CASM ex-fuel, this particular metric ignores the benefit we expect to see in what has historically been the first or second largest expense line on our income statement, aircraft fuel. Holding 2019 fuel rate steady with what we saw in 2018, nearly all of our 2019 unit cost pressures are offset by fuel efficiency gains we will see from transitioning from 767s to A321neos. Now, turning to other notable points in our 2019 outlook, we expect our full year 2019 CapEx to be in the range of $380 million to $430 million. This includes taking delivery of 6 new A321neos in 2019, which will bring our A321neo fleet to 17 aircraft. And it also includes 787-9 pre-delivery payments as well as non-aircraft investments, mainly in facilities and technology. The current forward fuel curve shows a year-over-year decline in 2019. At current rates, we expect our 2019 fuel hedges to settle at a loss of just under $7 million using the curve as of January 18. This compares to 2018 gain of nearly $26 million. Consistent with past practice, we have hedged about 45% of our projected fuel consumption for 2019. Lastly, we expect our effective tax rate in 2019 to be between 25% and 27%. In closing, I am encouraged with our performance in 2018. We returned record amounts of cash to our shareholders. We are continuing to invest in the business and expect our track record of generating strong returns to continue unabated. We have a management team committed to improving our cost competitiveness and we are building a foundation that will allow us to grow more efficiently in the future. This concludes our prepared remarks. And I will now turn the call back over to Daniel.\nDaniel Wong: Thank you, Peter, Shannon and Brent. I would also like to thank all of you for joining us today and for your continued interest in Hawaiian Holdings. We are now ready for questions from the analysts first and then the media if time permits. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and if needed, one follow-up question. Sherry, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nHunter Keay: Hi, everybody. Thanks for getting me on. Peter, what is your long-term philosophy on the importance of market share?\nPeter Ingram: Market share is not one of the metrics that we use as a guiding principle for the business. We certainly are aware of what our market share is and it can be a reference point for relevance in the market. But I look at market share in some ways as more of an outcome than something that you need a philosophy for. And if you are positioned as a strong competitor, you are superior at generating revenue, you have a more competitive cost structure then inherently you will be more successful and that will tend to equate to being able to grow your market share over time.\nHunter Keay: Got it. Thank you for that. And then what\u2019s been the response to the Main Cabin Basic announcement from the travel agency community and how are you planning on selling that through JAL pack? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: So I think that our focus with Main Cabin Basic is North America initially as we announced that, that\u2019s where we are initially going to roll it out. And in North America, of course, more of our focus is on direct channels, one. And two, I would say there is a familiarity with the concept of Main Cabin Basic, because most of our \u2013 all of our competitors to Hawaii have it and most of the competitors within the U.S. are using it. So it is something that people are familiar with. We haven\u2019t at this point envisioned we have thought internally, but we haven\u2019t really gone forward with thinking about where that product would sit internationally or in the Neighbor Island geography. That is something that we will certainly look at over the long-term, but we understand that both of those places are a little bit different. And the way we apply the principles of Main Cabin Basic to those are likely going to be different than how we apply it in North America where the ground is largely tilled already by others.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thanks, everybody. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Susan Donofrio with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.\nSusan Donofrio: Hi, everyone. So the question I have is related to Japan. Could you just expand on what is going on in that market? It does look like you have had little bit of a pull down by Air Asia, Asiana, but it does look like some other competitors are increasing. So could you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on there from a competitive standpoint?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. There are some moving pieces. Maybe I will let Brent go ahead and walk you through some of those.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, Susan. I think you appropriately characterized there is a lot of moving pieces within Japan. So, on the kind of puts and takes, Osaka from a market perspective has had a fair amount of capacity added over the course of 2018 based on forward-looking schedules that increase that stays in place until kind of the end of 1Q. As we get through 2Q that moderates a bit year-over-year as the second frequency that JAL had in the market comes out. And then as we get in to the latter part of the quarter, Scoot has announced that they will be exiting the market. So you will see a fair amount of capacity come out of that. There is some gauge movement around in Tokyo to Honolulu. Specifically, probably the most noticeable is ANA\u2019s addition of the A380s beginning in late May of 2019 and then ramping that up over the course of the summer. But if you look at kind of overall puts and takes across many of our Japan markets, in 1Q, they are generally down a little bit with the exception of Osaka like I mentioned and then Tokyo has a little bit of growth in 2Q, but not a whole lot. Osaka remains relatively flat and then visibility into 3Q has Osaka capacity moderating a bit more.\nSusan Donofrio: Great. And then just as a follow-up unrelated, but with the government shutdown before, did you notice any softness just because the national parks were closed? I am just wondering if you saw anything intra-island?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes, we didn\u2019t\u2026\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. There wasn\u2019t a discernible impact in terms of any of the traffic that we saw as a result of the government shutdown.\nSusan Donofrio: Okay. Alright, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Linenberg: Yes. Hey, good afternoon or good morning everyone. Brent, I guess two questions to you. The Neighbor Island softness and I know you indicated I think in the March quarter, you are taking capacity down 6%, what\u2019s driving that? Is that the Hawaiian economy or is it the fact that now you are flying non-stop from some of the other islands rather than Honolulu to the mainland? Is it all of the above, what\u2019s behind that?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. Michael, it\u2019s predominantly a local story. So, we have seen a nominal decline as we anticipated between our own \u2013 with food traffic from North America going to the Neighbor Islands. That was largely forecasted and we knew that was coming with the addition of our own ads with the 321s as well as OA capacity ads into that market. So that\u2019s probably impacted, I would say about a quarter or so of the overall decline, but that is explainable clearly by capacity. Frankly that the more frustrating piece for us or disappointing piece for us as we pore through the data is the local traffic decline there. And as we peel back the onion, we are seeing no real impact for our top tier and Hawaiian Miles guests. It is really guests who we have the least amount of information on and a lesser relationship with that we have seen the decline and again most notably to the big island. In response to that as you mentioned, we cut capacity 6% in the first quarter, we\u2019ll continue to monitor the situation and adjust capacity as needed we have also stepped up some of our marketing efforts here within the state in terms of creating ensuring proper awareness of attractive price points that we\u2019ve got in the market for discretionary leisure travel to get some of that back in further out-booking periods.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. And just my second question when you look at March Q RASM, you listed it was a litany of headwinds that you\u2019re dealing with and you called out Easter, you called out the profit-sharing piece to the credit card company from a year ago can you just can you break down those impacts, like that Easter impact? Is that like 1, 1.5 points of RASM, just walk through? It sounded like there were three or four different pieces that are impacting the March quarter just so we can kind of discern what?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes well, the benefit would be in the June quarter with the Easter bounce back up.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes Easter, right now, we\u2019ve our analysis has Easter at about a point shifting from 1Q to 2Q and, yes, disproportionately in March where Easter was early last year on the profit-sharing piece, that\u2019s roughly a 0.5 point of headwinds that we want there.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay.\nOperator: And our next question is from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph DeNardi: Good morning. Brent, normally, you break down North America between, I guess, the U.S. piece and the Neighbor Island piece are you willing to do that now for fourth quarter?\nBrent Overbeek: I don\u2019t have that right in front me, I can dig it up real quick but in 4Q, I think Neighbor Island PRASM was down. Looking real quick in our binder, I think Neighbor Island was down.\nPeter Ingram: I think they were in similar ranges in this period and as Brent mentioned in the in his comments, there was also a stage length impact in there as we\u2019ve grown North America more, which is much longer length of haul lower stage length, so that stage length impact served to drag the overall domestic total down as well.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. And then, Peter, I\u2019m just wondering if you could kind of clarify something on how you think about the JAL JV? Do you see kind of the bigger opportunity as allowing you guys to grow more in Japan or to enhance the profitability of your current business there?\nPeter Ingram: Well, I think they\u2019re related and actually ties a little bit into what I said about in response to Hunter\u2019s initial question to the extent, we have a better customer proposition broadly, and we think the combination of the longstanding Japanese carrier and Hawaiian carrier really is the best of both worlds on either side of the Pacific will be that much more that will enhance our profitability and that will create opportunities for growth so services that may not have made sense before will make sense in that environment, and we think that will manifest itself in the ability to grow over time and add service and add benefits to guests traveling between Japan and Hawaii.\nBrent Overbeek: Joe, to get to your first question, Neighbor Island was down in the mid 5%, North America was mid-6s and the total was mid-7s.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.\nHelane Becker: Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time. Just a couple of questions here. Is there a way from a technology perspective, you could introduce basic economy quicker than towards the latter half of the year?\nPeter Ingram: Helane, that\u2019s something I ask people every day and you know we\u2019re working on a pace to get it out in the latter half of the year, as you noted we do want to make sure that we roll it out well and don\u2019t stumble into it and so it\u2019s important to make sure that we\u2019ve got the process and the technology, and we\u2019re not confusing people as we roll it out so, I would part of me wants to tell the team to go faster, faster, faster all the time the other thing I always say is, but we\u2019ve got to get it right.\nHelane Becker: Okay that\u2019s a fair thing. And then on government shutdown, I think you or Brent mentioned that you haven\u2019t really seen any impact, but there were some reports last week that TSA agents in some of the Hawaiian airports were actually handing in their resignations and I was just kind of wondering if security issues hampered your operations at all and if we should be mindful of that and if that\u2019s included in the first quarter RASM guidance?\nPeter Ingram: To be honest, Helane, I didn\u2019t see those reports in the context of Hawaii we did not see any disruptions here we were obviously concerned that if the government shutdown had continued, that some of the effects we were hearing about elsewhere in the country would have manifested themselves in the places we fly but it really wasn\u2019t something that hit our day-to-day operations there were a couple of things administratively that we couldn\u2019t accomplish because the people at the FAA that do those approvals weren\u2019t there to do those approvals but there was no moment where I felt the safety or security of the system was in danger, and obviously, that would have been a much more serious problem than the administrative burdens we had to deal with.\nHelane Becker: Okay, got it, okay. Well, thanks very much.\nPeter Ingram: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nRajeev Lalwani: Brent, just wanted to follow up with the some of the comments you made earlier on demand softness I think previously you noted that you saw it on the North America side as well and not just on the Neighbor Island side how is that looking now? Has it stabilized on that part of your network?\nBrent Overbeek: Sorry, Rajeev can you repeat the question?\nRajeev Lalwani: I think previously, you said that demand was a bit soft, not just on the Neighbor Island side but also going to North America how is that demand looking now? Has that softness dissipated?\nBrent Overbeek: When we look at kind of overall traffic levels in North America, they remain, I would say, pretty good load factors are generally still relatively high the industry pricing environment that we\u2019ve seen to get to those levels has really been the bigger strain in terms of generating demand, Rajeev.\nRajeev Lalwani: Okay. And Peter, a question for you there is obviously some concern out there about the environment getting tougher and to the extent that it does, what are some of the levers that you can pull to sort of keep your health and margins and maybe stabilize top line trends? Is it margin is it capacity, is it maybe buybacks, cost cuts, what are sort of things that are at your disposal, if you will?\nPeter Ingram: Well, I think that our focus is really on making sure that we continue to execute very well at the things we\u2019re doing I went through some of the priorities for the year and the things that we know that we can get better at and improve our own effectiveness at and if we do that, it will position us even better I would say, again, I\u2019d go back to where we\u2019re coming into right now, the competitive environment is very similar to what we saw throughout 2018, first of all I should say that we are aware of the prospect of changes in the competitive environment going forward, but we\u2019re coming into 2019 from a position of strength we are a leading competitor in all of the geographies we serve we have got a great product that people love interacting with, our employees do a terrific job taking care of people, and all of those things are strengths that we think position us to be very competitive going forward.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Hackel with Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Hackel: Hi, team. Thanks for sneaking me in here. Just a couple of quick questions for me. First of all, just on fuel surcharges, just curious where those have those gone back to zero? I know those had obviously been at zero for a while since maybe last year and with fuel moving up, that was a bit of a tailwind for you guys I\u2019m just curious where those are now and sort of how the comps are for that as you get throughout the year?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, I mean, Adam, I will talk a little bit about kind of where we are at in 1Q and then it gets a little choppy on that as you\u2019ve got things moving around last year and uncertainty around this year\u2019s base in 1Q, it will actually be a bit of a tailwind the primary market where we collect fuel surcharges is Japan and the mechanism is lagged and so with the look back mechanism, fuel surcharges are going to be at \u00a511,000 effective February 1. Certainly, what\u2019s happened to fuel in the last little while, we anticipate that those will those are likely to moderate as we get further out.\nAdam Hackel: Got it. And I guess it\u2019s still sort of a secondary question on sort of the RASM as you get past 1Q obviously, you guys have a lot in terms of comps from this past year, as you guys mentioned, between the weather and then the volcano and some of the delays and all that but just looking at it compared to where The Street has you guys for \u201819, which is basically dime a dollar in earnings year-over-year and just sort of based on what you gave out today in terms of the guidance sort of implying estimates anticipating this sort of level of decline between the fourth quarter and what you got for the first quarter as you get throughout the year so I\u2019m just curious just how we should think about from a modeling perspective? So, the comps as you get past were in the first quarter and you started to last some of these sort of one-time events from the past year?\nPeter Ingram: It\u2019s difficult to give guidance going out I think certainly, there are a couple of things about 1Q that are uniquely challenging one is it was as Brent said, it was our toughest comp of the year generally it was a period where the pricing environment in North America remained stronger than it did throughout certainly the back half of the year and we\u2019ve got the Easter shift and the unique aspect of the credit card payment that we received that went to revenue so all of that is sort of unique about 1Q and suggests that other parts of the year will be better and certainly, we feel that way, there is a wild card in there and that is we don\u2019t have a crystal ball about what changes there may be in terms of industry capacity as you go through 2Q to the end of the year and so it\u2019s hard for us to put a precise number to that, and certainly, it\u2019s hasn\u2019t been our practice in any event to give guidance beyond the quarter we\u2019re in from revenue because of those factors that are out there so we feel optimistic about our ability to compete, but it\u2019s a little too early for us to be putting a precise number to it.\nAdam Hackel: Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks, everybody.\nPeter Ingram: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question.\nDan McKenzie: Thanks, guys. Couple of questions here. One on costs, one on revenue but on when I look at the sort of capacity dashboard, if you will, for the first quarter, I\u2019ve seen you know 2% more ASM\u2019s on 1% fewer departures, essentially 2% fewer seats and when I kind of look at that sort of a dashboard, I would have guessed that maybe the non-fuel costs would have been a little bit less for the first quarter so it seems like there is some pressure maybe unique to the first quarter I guess I got the pressures for the full year, I didn\u2019t really understand sort of how what\u2019s really unique to the first quarter. I\u2019m just wondering if you can elaborate maybe a little bit more on that?\nShannon Okinaka: Hi, Dan. Yes, for cost for the first quarter, we have we just have a bunch of moving pieces throughout the whole year we have got some our maintenance costs this year are have a lot of moving pieces because some of the shuffling that we had to do last year with the 321neo delays and then with the credits, the maintenance credits that we got, which were scattered throughout the year, they weren\u2019t necessarily consistent throughout the year. So, the maintenance piece for the first quarter drives half a point and that just changes throughout the year. The \u2013 some of the other pieces are probably a little bit more consistent throughout the year, but we also have differences in throughout the year of our ASM growth that I had mentioned. So, yes, unfortunately, the year-over-year changes throughout the year, looking at quarter \u2013 at the different quarters is pretty lumpy and there is no one underlying message, it\u2019s just kind of a mixture of all different things moving in and out.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. This seems a little bit conservative. That\u2019s \u2013 I guess that\u2019s my only point. And then on the revenue side, if I could just circle back for a second, obviously, I caught the 1.5 point headwind from the things you guys have already mentioned. But when I look at capacity from the West Coast to Hawaii, it\u2019s flat. When I look at competitive capacity, I\u2019ve got 55% of the capacity shrinking 4% to 6% United, American and Delta. So, your toughest competitor shrinking between the West Coast and Hawaii, when I look at competitive capacity in the international side, it\u2019s essentially flat. So, again, on the revenue side, it just sort of seems like a conservative revenue guide. So, maybe I can approach this a little bit differently than just saying it\u2019s conservative. And I guess maybe, Brent, what are \u2013 what\u2019s the average up-sell that you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace, the place from your competitors that you\u2019re missing out on? And so I guess, just ask this a little differently, when you analyze the revenue landscape, you\u2019ve obviously concluded you\u2019re missing out on some up-sell revenue that your peer set is able to collect. Is that just simply $25 per passenger or is that something closer to $50 or $75? What\u2019s that revenue opportunity that you\u2019re missing out on today that you\u2019re going to be able to potentially capture later this year?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. Well, Dan, I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not going to specifically answer because I don\u2019t know what our individual competitors are reaping in terms of kind of percentages of a buyout from basic economy if that\u2019s what specifically you\u2019re asking for. We haven\u2019t guided in terms of a basic economy number and we\u2019ll do that later in terms of \u2013 later in the year around our expectations around that. In terms of the benign capacity environment in 1Q, as Peter mentioned, the \u2013 last year we saw a similar thing with RASM performance being a bit lagged relative to changes in capacity, and we saw a big spike in industry capacity in 1Q. The pricing environment was generally a bit slower to react to that and we saw positive RASM \u2013 pretty strong RASM results in Q1. And so there is a bit of a lagged impact and I think we\u2019re seeing some of that now as well.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. If I could just follow-up one last one here. Are you \u2013 does the revenue guide factor into Southwest entry into Hawaii sometime in the first quarter?\nPeter Ingram: The revenue guide really doesn\u2019t. We don\u2019t see that in the market right now and it\u2019d probably be the very tail-end of the quarter to the extent that anything could get in. So, no, that\u2019s not really something that\u2019s factoring in our revenue guide.\nDan McKenzie: I see. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for getting me in here at the end. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but had one for Shannon. The effective tax rate for 2019, 25% to 27% seems a bit above kind of the \u2013 certainly, the run rate this year much higher than what we were expecting in our model. What\u2019s the reason for that?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. Hi, Andrew. The 2018 effective tax rate includes the benefit that we got from a $50 million pension contribution that we are applying to our 2017 tax return. So, we\u2019re getting that higher deduction rate for that, which is why 2018 is unusually low for the current tax regime or the current environment. I think we\u2019re generally a little closer to \u2013 without that, we\u2019d be a little closer to that normal 25% range. So \u2013 and at this point, we\u2019re still trying to work through the 2017 tax return, so \u2013 sorry, 2018 tax return and we\u2019ll do that throughout this year. So, I don\u2019t think we have anything unusual going on in our taxes in 2019. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a little higher than 2018s because 2018 was a little unusual with that contribution.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. So, the 25% to 27% is just a good run rate over the next couple of years as things stand right now?\nShannon Okinaka: As far as I can see, but of course, we\u2019re still going through a bunch of the changes, the tax policy changes going through, our tax policy changes on areas like revenue recognition, we had some big book changes there, which drives some tax changes. So, there are still some moving pieces in how we\u2019re looking at taxes and we can probably give an update throughout the year on that.\nPeter Ingram: And I\u2019d say even going back in the way-back machine when I was CFO was sort of a \u2013 the rule of thumb I used to use was the federal statutory rate and generally plus about five for state and local taxes, which is right in line with the guidance that Shannon\u2019s using for this year.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve O\u2019Hara with Sidoti and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Yes. Hi, good afternoon.\nPeter Ingram: Hi, Steve.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Hi. Just on the \u2013 can you just talk about competitive capacity growth in your markets, maybe by quarter this year, what you\u2019re expecting right now?\nBrent Overbeek: So, in terms of North America based on kind of published schedules right now, Steve, kind of flattish in 1Q, slightly down, up a little bit in 2Q, obviously subject to change based on what happens with industry dynamics. And published schedules are up kind of mid-single digits as we get out into 3Q in terms of \u2013 sorry, 2.5 in 2Q and 3.5 for the industry as we get out into 3Q. The international side, a bit lumpier. We talked a little bit earlier about some of the puts and takes in Japan, inch-on capacity is down a little bit sporadically in 1Q and 3Q, as well as Auckland being down a bit as we lap some of the competitive changes in that environment.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. And does that include Southwest or North America?\nBrent Overbeek: That\u2019s only published schedules.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. And then can you just remind me what the revenue benefit was in the first quarter that you talked about from the credit card or what the impact on RASM was?\nBrent Overbeek: About 0.5 point.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: 0.5 point, okay. And then just from a, I\u2019d see here, the \u2013 sorry, you said the fuel surcharges kind of a tailwind in 1Q and then that will kind of trail off as that trails off throughout the year. And when do you expect to have a more firm timeline on the JV and when that\u2019s good to go when you can start talking about the benefits?\nPeter Ingram: So the JV, Steve, is in front of the regulatory authorities on both sides right now. Like a number of things over the past month, the good people at the DOT had a little bit of unplanned downtime over the last month and are now getting back in. We don\u2019t know exactly what the specific timing of our approval will be, but we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll be hearing something \u2013 hopefully, we\u2019ll hear something in terms of a feedback in the first half of this year, but it is not something that we can put a specific date on yet because they\u2019ve got to go through their process.\nSteve O\u2019Hara: Okay. Alright, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the time. Can you give us an update on how much of your $100 million targeted annual cost cuts are built into your 2019 CASM ex-guide?\nShannon Okinaka: Hi, Katie, it\u2019s Shannon. Yes, we \u2013 I don\u2019t have a number for you because that plan goes out about 2 or 3 years. And so I don\u2019t know off the top of my head exactly how much of that was built into \u201819 versus just over the 2 years. So \u201819 has a mixture of cost initiatives that we started in \u201818 that will then finish up in \u201819, and we\u2019ll get some of those benefits. But again, two, we\u2019re continuing to put some of those \u2013 some of that money back into the business with initiatives such as Mainland Technology Center, which will get us a lot of benefits from a technology delivery perspective at a more efficient rate. As well, we have a lot of operations and process type initiatives for labor productivity. So, we do eat through a bunch of the $100 million. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s half, because we have a bunch of initiatives that we\u2019re working on this year that we won\u2019t get the full year benefit from. So, in 2020, you\u2019d see a lot more of that full year benefit on those initiatives.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. So, just one quick follow-up on that one and then maybe one on revenue, so you are saying, Shannon, that something less than half of the $100 million would find its way into this year\u2019s cost guide?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Is that \u2013 okay, okay, got it. And then can you guys \u2013 can you give us some color on the performance of Extra Comfort PRASM versus the system maybe in the December quarter over the course of 2018? Thank you.\nPeter Ingram: We don\u2019t \u2013 Katie, we don\u2019t calculate Extra Comfort PRASM as we don\u2019t treat it as a standalone product \u2013 we don\u2019t treat it as a standalone cabin. In terms of revenue growth, it was in terms of kind of revenue growth per Extra Comfort seat, it was consistent with our capacity growth. So, if you want to back into that way, it was kind of flattish in terms of per unit production with production growing in the neighborhood of about 30%.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, understood. And maybe just one quick follow-up to that, it sounds like a lot of your capacity this year is driven by growth in that cabin. So, do you think you\u2019ll be able to maintain about a flattish-type RASM again or do you think given growth there that could put some downward pressure on that number?\nPeter Ingram: No. I mean, I think we\u2019ve got every intention of maintaining and growing it. I think there\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve got some initiatives that we believe we can grow it where you got to \u2013 we\u2019ll be introducing the product in some markets that haven\u2019t had it traditionally, where we\u2019ve had 7 6s [ph], and we need to drive some awareness there. But we don\u2019t see any reason that we shouldn\u2019t be able to maintain that.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hello. Peter, you mentioned that kind of one of the wildcards for 2019 is what maybe other airlines do with capacity. So, I feel like that\u2019s opening the door to my question a little bit. Kind of based on your experience seeing capacity come and go from the U.S. to Hawaii, are the returns that you\u2019re seeing on the market still good enough to attract more capacity or are we at a point where you think some of the non-strategic capacity should start to come out just based on the returns that you\u2019re starting to see there?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. We don\u2019t talk about returns in specific geographies. What I will say is \u2013 my best view is of our returns and obviously, our pre-tax margins were, as we\u2019ve said, in the top tier of the industry, not the absolute highest, but very much qualifying in the top tier. So, we\u2019re still doing very well. It is also the case that we know we generate a revenue premium in North America. So by definition, that means that our competitors have a lower revenue input and we don\u2019t think that our competitors have particular cost advantages that mean they should be generating higher returns. But I don\u2019t know exactly what their returns are, what their decision criteria. I do know that it\u2019s a big competitive market. Water does find its level over time. There can be periods where capacity environment is very nice from the company perspective and you can generate really good returns, but typically, that\u2019ll attract incapacity. And there were other periods when capacity growth exceeds some demand growth over time and it may take a little bit of time, there is a bit of a lag before carriers react to that environment. But we fully expect that over time, things find a balance. And the important thing for us is making sure that we are extremely competitive. And so to the extent we hit a point where capacity needs to be rationalized, we would look forward to that not being ours, because ours is the most competitive and continues to generate good returns.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer question. I would like to turn the call back over to Peter for closing remarks.\nPeter Ingram: Alright. Mahalo again for joining us today. We are optimistic about 2019 and look forward to speaking to you again on next quarter\u2019s call. Aloha.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo, Daniel. Aloha everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a very eventful summer and what is proving to be an eventful year. Our third quarter financial performance was solid, but fell short of the expectations we shared on our last earnings call as a series of severe weather events in the latter part of the quarter affected our business in the period. Second quarter flooding in Kauai and volcanic activity at Kilauea the way to hurricane and typhoon-related disruptions in Hawaii and Japan in the latter part of the third quarter. Each of these affected our financial performance and specifically our revenue to varying degrees. Brent will walk you through the specific third quarter impacts later in the call. Through it all, our team once again rose to the challenge and remained focused on delivering outstanding customer service to our guests and supporting our communities in times of need. Their continued commitment and dedication is an inspiration to all of us and gives me great confidence for the future. As we enter the home stretch of 2018, it's worth taking a moment to reflect on our progress against the key objectives we had laid out for the Company entering the year, and frame how that progress positions us for 2019 and beyond. At the top of the agenda for the year was transitioning A321neos into our fleet and phasing out of our 767s. Though, delivery delays in the first half of the year forced adjustments in our network deployments in the second and third quarter. We're now substantially back on track and expect to end the year with the 11 A321s we expected when we started the year. As we have noted previously, the A321s unlock important new opportunities for our route network, allowing us to tap into midsized city pairs between the Western U.S. and Hawaii that were not economically feasible with a wide body only fleet. In addition, the continued deployment of these aircrafts will afford us the opportunity to redeploy A330s to the large market and long-haul routes that utilize the aircraft's full potential. Our announcement in September that we will watch non-stop service between Boston and Honolulu, starting in April of 2019, is one example of this. Shortly after the Christmas and New Year peak season, we'll retire the last of our 767s. This event will leave Hawaiian mainline with a simplified fleet of just three aircraft types; 717, serving shortfall neighbor island routes; A321 serving the mid-haul; and A330s flying a more optimal mix of long-haul routes and high demand mid-haul routes. Every one of our cabins will have been reconfigured or new within the last five years. And each of these three types will have a single configuration, optimized to their mission, providing us superior revenue generating capability, operational efficiency and flexibility. Including investments in lie flat an extra comfort seating, our fleet is better positioned now than it has been at any time in the past decade. Also, at the beginning of the year, we laid out plans to move quickly on our partnership with Japan Airlines. With our mutual code sharing distribution through JALPAK and Frequent Flyer reciprocity now in place, we have turned our attention fully to preparing our organization for the joint venture, which our application is in front of regulators here in the U.S. and Japan. The timing of regulatory approvals remains uncertain but our working expectation is that we will complete the process by the early part of 2019, which would allow us to implement the joint venture a bit later in the year. We're eager to get started and our teams continue to engage in planning with the JAL teams to the extent permitted prior to antitrust immunity being granted. Finally, when we started the year, investor focus was at least as much on changes in our competitive environment as on the things we were doing to position ourselves for the future. With three full quarters of elevated competitive capacity growth behind us, we are continuing to deliver margins in the industries' top tier and have maintained our revenue premium. In the just completed quarter, we were on track for a modest year-over-year gain above last year's best ever RASM performance. Alas, multiple weather events pushed the third quarter year-over-year RASM into negative territory, so that particular record will stand for the time being. Looking back over the last few years, you'll see that we consistently produced solid operational and financial results, while competing against the industry's largest domestic and international airlines. Over the better part of the last decade, we've grown from a successful niche airline into a durable carrier that is built to compete. We're executing our plan for disciplined profitable growth built on a combination of superior hospitality and operational focus. Irrespective of the competitive environment, no airline is better positioned to serve the needs of guests traveling to, from and within Hawaii. As we continue to build on our strengths, we will continue to thrive as a carrier of choice for Hawaii. Now, let me turn it over to Brent to take you through our revenue performance and near term outlook.\nBrent Overbeek: Thanks, Peter, and aloha everyone. Top line growth in each of our geographies, strong performance in our value-added products and another record quarter for our cargo business, led revenue growth of 6% year-over-year to $759 million. Despite setting a record for third quarter revenue, Mother Nature had her presence known during the quarter with two hurricanes in Hawaii, typhoon in Japan and lingering impacts from volcanic book away, all of which pressured RASM, which declined 2% year-over-year. Adjusting for these unforeseeable events that occurred in the quarter, system-RASM would have been essentially flat, which was in line with our original guidance range given in July. The RASM performance is inclusive of 1.25 point benefit from fuel surcharges and foreign exchange gains. Domestic PRASM, which includes our North America and Neighbor Island services, was down 6% year-over-year. Roughly a third of the decline was due to entity mix as longer states like North American capacity grew high single digits and Neighbor Island capacity was down slightly year-over-year. Our North America services were impacted the most from hurricanes Lane and Olivia where PRASM was down more than system average year-over-year. Despite the storm disruptions, North American yields were solid while facing industry capacity growth of 8% year-over-year. Neighbor Island PRASM, which was up in the mid-single-digit range again this quarter but below expectations given the impact of the storms and some residual impact of the volcano earlier in the booking curve. We've seeing booking trajectories generally improve in North America and Neighbor Island markets following both hurricanes, though some revenue softness is expected to carry forward into the fourth quarter. As several analysts have noted, the industry pricing environment to Hawaii has weakened a bit over the past seven weeks. Our international markets showed their resilience once again this quarter. International PRASM was up nearly 4% year-over-year driven by strong demands, especially in Japan that led to solid load factors and higher average fares in the quarter. Strength in the region helped offset the effects of typhoon Jebi that closed Osakas Kansai airport for 10 days. Our operations have returned to normal but we do anticipate a nominal impact on traffic, particularly in the front half of the quarter. When we spoke back in July, we noted the tough comp we were facing this quarter against our highest ever absolute RASM performance in the third quarter of 2017. Looking beyond year-over-year comparisons, though, our revenue performance remains encouraging from historical perspective. The double-digit industry capacity growth we faced in 2018 on our North America services, which accounts for on average about half of our total revenues, has been met with strong demand for the Hawaii vacation. Notably, overall North America traffic was up 5% against our own capacity growth of more than 8% in the quarter. The midsized U.S. West Coast markets we're entering with our A321neos are trending positively. We're operating nine routes exclusively with A321neos today and by years' end that number will increase to 11. Our premium cabin continues to perform well with front cabin PRASM growth outperforming the main cabin. The extra comfort product investments we made on the A330 and A321 fleets continue to reap benefits. Extra comfort and preferred seat revenue increased by 35% year-over-year in the third quarter. Our seat upgrades and Hawaiian mile sales continue to drive strong value-added revenue growth as well. In the third quarter, value-added revenue per passenger was up 23% year-over-year. And finally, our cargo performance continues to benefit from the strong global economy. Cargo revenue was up nearly 13% this quarter to more than $27 million, a new quarterly record. This quarter, we watched all cargo Neighbor Island freighters service. While it represents a small part of our overall cargo business, it complements our existing 717 operation and adds the ability to seamlessly connect containerized cargo with our long-haul network. It was fitting to inaugurate this service by shipping construction and household supplies to Kauai and Hawaii Island to support disaster relief efforts for those communities. Now, looking ahead to the fourth quarter. Following 2018s peak capacity growth in the third quarter, we expect fourth quarter capacity to moderate and grow between 4.5% to 6.5% year-over-year. This puts us on track for full year 2018 capacity growth between 5.5% and 6.5%, which we've narrowed a bit since our last guidance. And while it's too early to share formal 2019 guidance, as Peter and I have said in prior quarterly calls, we expect 2019 capacity growth to be less than 2018s year-over-year capacity growth. We expect RASM will be down 2.5% to up 0.5% in the fourth quarter, which include some lingering effects from August and September storms and reflects the current pricing environment. While we're never satisfied reporting lower year-over-year RASM, our performance in the third quarter was credible given the capacity environment and everything Mother Nature through our way. As Peter mentioned, we're built to compete. We've built a durable airline and our performance this quarter reinforces our confidence and our ability to deliver solid results regardless of the competitive environment. We're excited about our opportunities ahead and look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day in December. And now, I'll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks Brent and thank you to everyone for joining us today on the call. To briefly recap the quarter, adjusted net income was about $97 million or $1.91 per share. We delivered what we expect will be among the industry's highest adjusted pretax margin of about 16% despite competitive pressures and rising fuel prices, which increased over 38% over the same period last year. Total operating expenses were up about 18% year-over-year this quarter, driven mostly by the increase in fuel costs. With fuel rates continuing an upward trajectory, it's worth taking a moment to mention our fuel hedging program and how it offset some of the pressure of rising fuel costs. Given the unpredictable nature of the fuel market, we use our hedging programs to give a short term protection on rising fuel rates to ease us into changing market conditions. Our focus on call options allows us to fully participate in the benefits of a decreasing fuel rate environment and provide some relief as the industry adjust to rising fuel costs. In the third quarter, we realized fuel hedging gains of $8 million net of premium and for the full year, we expect our fuel hedges to settle at a gain of more than $31 million net of premiums. Underscoring how much fuel has risen this year this expected gain is nearly 2.5 times what we expected it to be at the beginning of the year. A gain on the fuel hedge line, however, indicates an increase to our overall fuel costs. In the third quarter, our economic fuel costs per gallons increased nearly 30% over the prior year. And in the fourth quarter, we expect our economic fuel costs per gallon to increase between 20% to 25% over the prior year. Now, switching to our non-fuel unit costs. CASM, ex-fuel on special items, increased 1.2% year-over-year in the third quarter. This included about 2 percentage points of headwind from contractual increases in maintenance rates, increased benefits costs and costs related to the start up of our Neighbor Island cargo business. In the fourth quarter, we expect non-fuel unit costs to be in the range of down 2% and up 1% year-over-year. This includes about 1 percentage points of the same headwinds we saw in the third quarter. This puts us in line with our prior full year CASM ex-fuel guidance above 2% at the midpoint. Both fourth quarter and full year CASM ex-fuel guidance ranges exclude any assumptions relating to the amendable contract with our Flight Attendants Union. During the past quarter, we jointly filed for mediation with the National Mediation Board with the Association of Flight Attendants, which is scheduled to begin next month. We hope that the commencement of mediation will lead to a comps resolution of our negotiations. Overall, our 2018 cost story is playing out as anticipated. The CASM ex-fuel and the special item growth we saw in the first half of the year has given way to flattish year-over-year growth in the back half of the year. We\u2019ve lapped the increases that we saw in the first half of the year, the most notable of which was from wages and benefits. And we\u2019re benefiting in the back half of the year from increased productivity from our A321neo deployments and 767 retirements. The cost to benefit from our fleet transition will continue into 2019 as we retire our last 767 and grow our A321neo fleet by about 50%. The improvement in the fuel burned for ASM of the A321neo\u2019s versus the 767 is significant and important in this rising fuel environment. Concluding this three year transition is key as it help to set a more stable base for our cost improvement efforts, while establishing a solid foundation for our next stage of growth when our 787 deliveries begin in 2021. We\u2019re committed to a culture of continuous improvement and value generation, ensuring that the dollars that we spend and invest positively impacts the bottom line. Finally, last quarter I mentioned that we were reviewing our expected uses of capital. During the third quarter, we bought back 31 million in share repurchases and issued 6 million in dividends. We also made $15 million pension contribution, the timing of which allowed the payment to be a deductible expense against our 2017 taxes. This is particularly notable because this deduction offset taxes at last year\u2019s higher federal tax rates. As a result of this pension contribution, we had a lower than usual tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 and now expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to fall between 21% and 23%. We're pleased with our financial results this quarter and look forward to a strong closing of 2018. We look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day this December and sharing more about our future plans. This concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll now turn the call back over to Daniel.\nDaniel Wong: Thank you, Peter, Shannon and Brent. I'd also like to thank all of you for joining us today and for your continued interest in Hawaiian Holdings. We're now ready for questions from the analysts first and then the media if time permits. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow-up question. Hector, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nHunter Keay: So as we're heading into '19, you're kind of limping into '19 on RASM. And that\u2019s obviously a little bit Island air benefits still in there and that\u2019s before anything about the competitive environment changing potentially. So, how do we think about what offsets you guys have in the fleet to offset, or the network itself to offset or to say, maybe this is a reverse that trend next year?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, let me start and then maybe turn it over to Brent to see if he has any comments to add to mine. I think if you look at the last couple of quarters, we've had a fair bit of noise from natural events, particularly affecting the Neighbor Island North America networks but also Japan. If you assume that some of that doesn't exist in 2019, or not that we can count on nothing but I think it's been an unusual year for some of these. There's some opportunity there, some little stability perhaps in the Neighbor Island network. I think we are maturing into some new route additions in the Western U.S. They're not necessarily brand-new markets for us. But I think we will expect to mature and see better performance in some of those. And of course we've got the joint venture with JAL that we expect start to more positively impact our results going into 2019. So, we think we've got a lot to look forward to. And I think -- I take your comment from a year-over-year basis about \"limping through the back part of the year\". I'd say if you look at where our pretax margin is going to be, we're going to be near the top tier of the industry on a full year basis, stripping out all the seasonality. I think we are coming off very different comps in 2016 and 2017 than many of the other carriers you follow. So I don\u2019t think I would characterize it as limping, I think we\u2019re executing just fine in a competitive environment. We\u2019re focused on managing our costs into next year, which will give us some benefits as well. And we\u2019re really excited about the fleet transition.\nHunter Keay: So let\u2019s talk about the other side of that, exactly as you mentioned is the CASM mix is there -- because there\u2019s only so much you can do obviously on the RASM side, the market is going to do what it's going to do. But do you feel like you\u2019re in a position next year where you can grow your RASM more than your CASM ex or your RASM shrinks more slowly than your CASM ex and you\u2019re setting up for like a positive controllable margin year in 2019. Do you feel good about the spread between your RASM and CASM ex moving through the year next year as you see it right now?\nPeter Ingram: I think it\u2019s a little early for us to be talking about specific guidance going into 2019. I think -- and we\u2019re in the budget process now, and I'll turn it over to Shannon to talk a little bit more about the costs. We\u2019re in the budget process but we are confident about moving into a period where we'll have better cost performance. Getting through the fleet transition is very helpful in that. I think the entire team here is very focused on the fact that the world has got more competitive in the last couple of years and you expect that when you're leading the industry and margin that you are going to see more competitive capacity and we have to sharpen our pencils. So I am not going to give a RASM/CASM spread forecast for 2019. But I would say on the cost side, we've got a lot of confidence that we can continue to manage things well. Shannon, maybe just see what's there's anything you want to add to that.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes the only thing I would add. I agree on everything with that Peter said regarding our CASM ex and controllable costs. Sometimes we tend to think of fuel as not being controllable but there is a piece to fuel that is somewhat controllable. And I think our fleet transitions, especially as we get into this environment of rising fuel cost, is going to be really important when you\u2019re talking about RASM/CASM spread. Obviously, we\u2019re looking at profitability and margin. I think in addition to all the things that we\u2019re doing with labor productivity and automation and things like that, I think the fleet transition will also contribute a lot to better fuel burn and fuel efficiency and that\u2019s an important part of that profitability prospectus.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DiNardi with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph DiNardi: Just piggy backing on Hunter's question a little bit. Peter, you mentioned that your returns are going to be towards the high end of the industry. And I think what we\u2019ve learned over the past few years is that it\u2019s hard for airlines with superior returns to maintain them unless there's some structural advantage that they have. I am wondering if you think Hawaiian possesses some structural advantage that will allow you to maintain above average margins. Or if this is just a question of increased capacity coming in until your margins normalize, whether that'd be southwest or united or whoever else? Or is there something that allows you to maintain better margins?\nPeter Ingram: I would say there are a number of things. And some of it is reflected in the comments I had in the prepared remarks about no airline being better positioned to serve guests to, from and within Hawaii than anyone else. And some of that is very much structural. I think our fleet as we are moving into this coming period is, as I said in the prepared remarks, more optimally positioned than we have been in a decade really for as long as I've been here. I think having a mix of products on the airplane from our front cabin product, to extra comfort, to our main cabin product that is specifically targeted to the needs of people traveling to and from Hawaii is an advantage relative to competitors that appropriately configure their airplanes for a broader mix of markets as opposed to specifically for applying here in Hawaii. I think we've got an advantage on the revenue side and we've seen this bear out in our customer service -- customer experience scores that with the hospitality that our employees deliver on every flight, and that has served us well over time and that gets reflected in the revenue premium in the markets we serve. So, I think there's a variety of things that we can count on to continue to execute very well. On a relative basis, period-to-period as competitive environment changes, there will be some differences in our performance. But we are very confident that we are built to compete and we are positioned to succeed in whatever the competitive environment is.\nJoseph DiNardi: Just on the JAL JV, I'm wondering if you could just talk about economic impact. Is it a rounding year in 2019, it's more 2020, any color there? And is the idea that on a like-for-like basis, you guys are just earning a PRASM discount to JAL on some of these routes for whatever reason? And once you turn this on that that discount should go away. Is that how we should think about it?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, it's difficult at this point to put a precise number to it. And candidly, because we are in the pre-antitrust immunity phase at this point, we don't have specific insights into their route level revenue performance and they don't have insights into our route level revenue performance. I think we do know that the benefits of commercial partnerships in this industry are correlated to how well you can align the interest of the participants. And so code share is better than interline at aligning interest. Joint ventures are better than code share in terms of aligning interest. And we think we bring two carriers together in this partnership that have different strengths in terms of their presence in Japan, their network behind our gateways in Japan, our presence in Hawaii, our history serving Hawaii, our gateways connecting routes behind Hawaii that will allow us to serve guests very well and should allow us to generate positive returns as we get into the joint venture.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys, it\u2019s actually Matt on for Mike. Could you just talk about competitive capacity over the next few quarters, looking at both domestic and international, or more specifically, transpacific to Asia and transpacific to the continental United States?\nPeter Ingram: Right now, it looks like fourth quarter industry capacity from North America to Hawaii will be up around 7%. That\u2019s about a point-less year-over-year than what we saw from an industry perspective in 3Q. Based on what is currently published and obviously some time for that to change, industry capacity looks pretty flat as you look into the front part in the first half of 2019. On the international side of the business, again, it looks generally flat. You've got individual markets up and down a little bit. You still have some competitive capacity being up in Osaka and a bit in Auckland. But absent that based on what\u2019s currently published in the front half of \u201819 is quite moderate, up in the 1% to 2% range and in terms of 4Q, a similar percentage.\nUnidentified Analyst: And just as a quick follow-up. How much of fuel surcharge is adding to pricing in the Pacific?\nPeter Ingram: In 3Q, we had -- on the international side of the business, fuel surcharges were added just under 5% benefit in the third quarter, which was disproportionately in Japan.\nBrent Overbeek: And to clarify that, that\u2019s RASM on the international, not a system impact.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRajeev Lalwani: Peter or Brent, a question for you, in your prepared remarks, you talked about just some softness in yields from North America. Can you just provide some color as to what\u2019s driving it? Is it demand? Is it capacity? Is it just folks getting ready for Southwest? Just any color that you can provide there. And then just as a quick follow-up, I think you mentioned that there\u2019s some lingering effects that you\u2019re assuming around storms et cetera carrying into the fourth quarter. Can you just quantify some of that?\nPeter Ingram: Let me start on the first part and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Brent, and he can maybe answer the second part on that about the lingering effects of the storms. I\u2019d say and this might disappoint you a little bit, Rajeev. But it's really hard for us to speculate on what is driving the competitive action in the marketplace. We monitor it very closely every day and we'll come up with our own theories. But if you really want to understand what's going on in terms of pricing of others, you\u2019re better to talk to them and then they\u2019re probably not going to give you a very straight answer either. So we mentioned it in the call, I would say, because we have seen conversation about it in some of the commentary on the industry. And we think that it's important for us to acknowledge that we do see some softness out there. But really when it comes to pricing and forward outlook, there is not very much more we can add on top of that.\nBrent Overbeek: And in terms of storm impact and natural disaster moving in the 4Q, Rajeev, we didn\u2019t explicitly call out and we didn\u2019t specifically tag it as a direct dollar impact. It's inherent in the trends we're seeing and the baseline that we're doing our forecast off of in 4Q. So we don\u2019t have an explicit call out right now in terms of what we put in the 4Q.\nRajeev Lalwani: Would it be possible again I can bite at the apples?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, we can take a look at it. We'll have to triangulate on a bit. But I think it's something that we can have Daniel follow up on.\nRajeev Lalwani: Peter, I just wanted to follow-up to your answer, maybe I'll parch it a bit of different way. I mean, as it relates to fuel prices moving up. Can you maybe talk about your confidence or your ability maybe to recapture that just given that you're more leisure market and so the elasticity of demand and pricing obviously is a factor to consider, so maybe approaching it that way in terms of how you're going to handle that as you move forward in some of the fuel hedges roll off?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, I think what I would say is it gives us a lot of confidence and it doesn\u2019t necessarily manifests itself in a particular quarter. But I think our ability to consistently generate a revenue premium and to operate at efficient cost structure means that as capacity and competitive balances shakes out, it should shake out with Hawaiian in a better position. So, we don't think anyone is better positioned to earn positive returns travelling from and within Hawaii than we are. And so as the competition settles out over a period of time, we think we'll be in a good position to cover our costs and then some.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nHelane Becker: Just a couple of questions here. Have you noticed any change in the way people redeem their Frequent Flyer miles? Have they been maybe increasing their redemptions or is it about the same, I don\u2019t know if you get ready for some of these capacity changes that are going on?\nPeter Ingram: So, Helane, in terms of redemption as a percentage of traffic, it's pretty consistent year-over-year. Certainly, as we've grown the airline and grown the Hawaiian miles program, redemptions have increased as we've got more miles, more engaged customers. And so, overall, load factor contribution, which is probably the easiest way to look at frequent flyer. Load factor contribution in the third quarter was pretty consistent year-over-year.\nHelane Becker: And then the other question I had is Peter and [Kim] I've been following the Company on and off for a very long time now. And one of the things I don't really ever recall is the airline talking about weather and weather events. And it seems like there's been more of that in the past year or so. And I'm just wondering are you seeing more -- I don\u2019t know how to ask the question. Are you seeing more disruptions than you would've expected to see? Or is what you're seeing just -- it's not an anomaly, it's just normal weather events and we just never really heard about them?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, so I can just talk about it somewhat anecdotally. But I've been with Hawaiian now for just about 13-years. And I would on the one hand agree with you that that we've had more tropical storm activity here around Hawaii in the last four or five years than we did in the first four, five or six years that I was here. Interestingly, we actually haven't had a storm with hurricane force winds hits the Island and almost -- hit any of the islands in almost two decades. Although, we have had some near misses and some tropical storms that did some damage, which obviously I wouldn't want to minimize. There's a little bit of an ebb and flow of the storm activity based on whether it\u2019s El Nino or La Nina and the temperature of the waters in a particular year. What we do know is a storm doesn\u2019t have to actually hit the islands to disrupt our traffic. As there is uncertainty and we all have -- see lots of weather reports there, we saw in the days leading up to hurricane Lane impact, which here Oahu was a bit of a non-event in terms of a weather event. It was barely even raining during the point of closest approach. But by the time we got to that point on a Friday morning, a lot of people had changed their plans and canceled their trips. And we were flying some empty airplanes for a couple of days. And, so it has an impact on the business, even sometimes if it doesn't have an impact on the people living here at the time the storm hits. The other thing I would add is I think it was a particularly active, and I probably can\u2019t say past tense yet, because I think the tropical storms even goes through November. But it has been a particularly active tropical storm season in Japan. And that is a big part of our business and they've really seen a lot of activity this year. Credit to our Japan team, it seemed like every couple weeks we were dealing with a storm event and they really rallied up and performed well. But obviously that was disrupting to the business in this quarter.\nHelane Becker: And then just one other question, as you transition aircraft types and from the 767s to A321s. So I am assuming you get -- I think Shannon you actually said fuel cost benefit, fuel efficiency. What about on the RASM side? As I recall, there's a greater percentage of premium fleets. So is that a RASM positive I should think about it that way?\nPeter Ingram: Helane, we\u2019ve got a lot of moving parts as we work through it. And like-for-like where we have swaps, I would say clearly should be RASM positive. We\u2019ve got higher proportion of premium seats. As you mentioned, we've got the ability to monetize extra comfort, which is there. But in a lot of markets we've deployed already, we've actually had a fair amount of moving parts where we've taken the 330 in a market like Portland and split that into two A321s. And so, we'll have some examples where will be increasing the capacity within an individual city that makes it a little harder to isolate the pure economics of down gauging 321s. But certainly going forward, we'll have a few more in terms of cleaner comparisons.\nBrent Overbeek: I'll just underscore the extra comfort piece, in particular, which has been a great story for us over the last few years. We never invested in putting an extra comfort cabin into the 767s knowing that they were only going to be in our fleet for a relatively short number of years after we launched that product. The revenue capability of that is, therefore, something that is incremental as we replace 767 capacity with A321 capacity. And you're seeing that reflected this year and we expect to see more of that as we go into next year and more 321s are in the marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin Crissey: Quick question on FX. Does FX become a headwind in Q4 or does it remain a tailwind as it was in Q3?\nPeter Ingram: Right now, our anticipation it would become a bit of a headwind. It was a bit of a tailwind in 3Q and it will become a bit of a headwind in 4Q.\nKevin Crissey: And speaking of the extra comfort seating and just maybe speaking broadly about the concept of extra comfort, it seems to be -- that type of product seems to be very successful across the sector. Can you talk about why that is working now? I understand why you wouldn't have put it on an aircraft fleet that you were ultimately getting out of. But can you talk about why that works now, and maybe it wasn\u2019t a product that was used 10 years ago 15 years ago? Why does these products -- are they being successful now? And why shouldn\u2019t an investor think that this is just a pro-cyclical opportunity as opposed to a structural opportunity?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, I'll tell you what I think and then see if Brent wants to add on to it. But I think about going back 15 or 20 years ago and you think about the first premium economy product that was out there, I think it might've been economy class on United was launched. And it was really a product that was designed to attract a greater share of business traffic and corporate traffic in a very competitive market. And given the distribution capabilities at the time that was the -- it was really still priced as part of your main cabin fare structure but you are trying to basically attract demand to get to a better part of the booking structure by attracting more demand than your competitors. For a carrier like Hawaiian with a direct-to-consumer selling proposition, we didn\u2019t have a real way to monetize that. So it wasn't something we were talking about when I joined Hawaiian. What changed for us is distribution capability. And as we had more direct distribution, we had the ability to actually charge a separate fare in the main cabin versus the extra comfort seating and price it as an add-on product on our Web site and that was where it first really took off for us. And now we've got the distribution capability through third-party technology to be able to do that in third-party channels as well, which helps us in the international market. So I think it really is a different situation than it was 10 or 15 years ago. This is not a product that we've lived through many cycles with and the difference is distribution capability.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, I agree with Peter. I think distribution has done a whole lot. And as we went through earlier this year, in terms of opening up distribution to third-party through EMD that has clearly benefited us on the international side of the business. And I think the other is really just customer choice and that is really recognizing the value in the product. And I don't think as airlines we did a great job of marketing that at first in terms of the benefits and what consumers were getting out of that. And once we were able to get that message across and empower them with technology to be able to make the purchase quite easily from a distribution perspective, those two synergies really hold together and we\u2019re seeing strong results from it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question.\nDan McKenzie: Just had a few questions. So there\u2019s a lot of background noise in the third quarter and fourth quarter RASM trends. And I guess just going back to an earlier question, I think it was Rajeev. It is helpful to strip out Mother Nature just to get a sense of whether trends are improving or deteriorating on a sequential basis. So we don\u2019t have the hurricanes. But we\u2019re also lapping the exit of Island Air here in October in last year, so that creates even more noise. And so I guess just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more about how we should think about these trends sequentially?\nPeter Ingram: Let me let Brent take that one.\nBrent Overbeek: So Dan as you pointed out, there\u2019re a lot of moving parts. And as we said with Rajeev\u2019s question, we don\u2019t have Mother Nature specifically broken out in terms of 4Q. With respect to Island Air, we all are getting to a point where a good chunk of that is in 4Q already. So, if you look at their operation, they were winding down in October of last year. They've pulled their schedule down quite a bit and we've seen some strong traffic even in October as a result of that and then there cessation of service in early November. So a good chunk of that was already in the 4Q base from last year.\nDan McKenzie: So sequentially, third quarter and fourth quarters, do we think about it just being steady, a little bit better, a little bit worse. How do we think directionally?\nBrent Overbeek: Overall, I would say with some of the pricing environment that\u2019s existed from the third quarter into the fourth. I would say, sequentially, a bit worse in North America specifically.\nDan McKenzie: And I guess if I focus on the North America and those weakening trends. At least when I look at the data, it seems to be more East Coast driven than West Coast. West Coast demand actually looks pretty firm. I am just wondering if you would share that view or is there -- am I maybe missing something here.\nBrent Overbeek: I think demand overall is holding up reasonably well. I think we\u2019ve seen -- it varies from market to market, Dan, in terms of some of pricing activity that we\u2019ve seen. And I won\u2019t go into specifics there. But yes, there have been some pockets of pricing in the Midwest and the East Coast that have been pretty highly discounted. But we've seen some fairs off the West Coast as well that some of our competitors have taken some more aggressive action from a year-over-year perspective on.\nDan McKenzie: Brent, I think average up-sell the comfort plus. How is this I guess transformed over this past year? What was that average up-sell? Where are you at today? And I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of what inning we're in with respect to the opportunity there.\nBrent Overbeek: So, we'll share a bit more at Investor Day in December. If we look at this year, it was a year of rapid growth in terms of the supply of extra comfort seats. And so we will continue to see that in terms of through the fourth quarter of this year and into 2019 as we will have additional 321s joining the fleet and the annualization of that. So, utilization remains quite good. We continue to expand our distribution internationally, and our take rates there have continued to go up. But I think there's still some more opportunity for us to succeed in that space and we'll share some more information around that at Investor Day.\nDan McKenzie: If I can squeeze one last one in. I guess, just one for Shannon. What has to go right or wrong to hit the better or worst end of your cost outlook? It looks like it was about the usual gap that you guys provide, but it's not a $0.20 EPS. I'm just wondering what your thinking could swing that one way or the other.\nShannon Okinaka: So, assuming you are talking about fourth quarter, I think, we have a pretty good handle on fourth quarter for us, because we are small sometimes and unexpected maintenance event can swing some numbers. But it would really be an unanticipated event for the fourth quarter. Other than something like that, I really can't think of what would really changed our course on our guidance, maybe if we got to an agreement with the ASA in the fourth quarter as our guidance doesn\u2019t include any assumption about that. Looking ahead to 2019, really most of the 2019 -- we're still working on the details of the budget. But a lot of -- the guidance for flat to down, unit cost in '19 is really about fleet transition. And so getting the 767s out in the first quarter, flying the 321s more, so getting actual productivities from, all the labor that we have hired in 2018 is important. So, I guess if something changes with that transition plan that could cause it. If or some reason we had delays in 321neos, we had people unable to fly air planes then maybe that could change some of what we see. That is still a little controllable. We have a lot of investment dollars we are continuing to make an IT and I think that\u2019s really important for the long-term. So I don\u2019t know that I'd want to pull that back too much. But I mean if we really needed to pull some levers, we do have some levers that we can pull on the cost side to come down if things changed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen O'Hara with Sidoti. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen O'Hara: Just on I guess the A321s. I mean, there are bit of issues with delivery delay, et cetera. I mean, what's your confidence that those issues are behind you and your plan going forward won't be interrupted by that?\nPeter Ingram: So obviously we had a big setback in the first quarter back in February when deliveries halted for a period of time. As we said in the prepared remarks, we are substantially back on track now. I think that setback has caused some other challenges in the supply chain in the production process that affected some of the deliveries and 3Q. But right now, we've got a lot more confidence with nine airplanes on property and another two coming by the end of the year, or about delivery timelines. I can\u2019t speculate about the unknown unknowns. But based on the known unknowns, I think we are in a mode now of where delivery dates are swinging a few days or a week one way or the other as opposed to where we were back in the first quarter. And hopefully, our partners on the manufacturing side of the industry can keep that performance up and 2019 will be a little bit more quieter in this regard.\nStephen O'Hara: And then maybe just on the flat to down. I guess language about 2019, I think at the last Investor Day there were some comments about the CASM -- overall CASM impact of the fleet transition with the A321s, 767s et cetera redeploying the A330. And I mean could you update that at all, I mean, is that still on track? And then what does that mean for 2019 or 2020? Thank you.\nShannon Okinaka: Actually, we\u2019ll get into a lot more of that detail at Investor Day. So at this point, I think I\u2019ll not comment too much on it. We plan to go through some of that math and impact of the CASM at Investor Day.\nPeter Ingram: But Steve, I\u2019ll just say there\u2019s nothing about the cost performance of the 321 that has changed our view of the positive effect it will have on our route network.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Susan Donofrio with Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nSusan Donofrio: Just a couple of quick questions, first, just with respect to the extra comfort. Are you able to fully sell that now on all those seats? I know there was an issue just because you do have 767s now. So if you could just clarify that.\nPeter Ingram: So, we don\u2019t have extra comfort on our 767s. We do have exit row seating that we sell on the day of operation on the 767s as what we call the preferred seat. But that\u2019s just day off because we\u2019ve got some different configurations on there. But as we get those 767s retired, we will have the dedicated extra comfort seats on every one of our mid-haul and long-haul flights. And we do have extra light room seating also on our 717s.\nSusan Donofrio: And then I am just curious, Peter. You talked about the weakening of pricing over the past seven weeks. Any idea if you think it\u2019s more due to the competitive environment or it's due to some of these severe weather events and just getting some bookings back. Do you have any color on that?\nPeter Ingram: We obviously can\u2019t speak for anyone else. I think we feel that bookings have recovered substantially from the weather events, say generally particularly on the long-haul flights affecting more for the particular period in question. So we feel pretty good about demand overall. But really can't speculate about what maybe motivating others and what they are looking at in their numbers as they decide what pricing to have available in the marketplace.\nSusan Donofrio: And then just last, just for you -- what was your stage link in third quarter and what the expectations for fourth quarter and first half of next year?\nPeter Ingram: Why don\u2019t we -- I'll have the team get those numbers and take that -- talk to you off-line about that, Susan, we will follow up.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Peter Ingram for closing remarks.\nPeter Ingram: Thank you, Operator. Mahalo to everyone for joining us today. Despite some twists and turns in the first nine months of 2018, our performance throughout the year so far reinforces our confidence in our plan and our ability to successfully compete in any environment. We intend to continue to execute well and look forward to closing out 2018 on a strong note. Lastly, I'd just say please save the date for upcoming Annual Investor Day in New York on Tuesday, December 11th. We look forward to seeing many of you there. Aloha.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Daniel Wong.\nDaniel Wong: Thank you, Dana. Hello everyone and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Here with me in Honolulu are Peter Ingram, President and Chief Executive Officer; Shannon Okinaka, Chief Financial Officer; and Brent Overbeek, Senior Vice President of Revenue Management and Network Planning. Peter will open the call with an overview of the business. Next, Brent will share an update on our revenue performance and outlook. Shannon will then discuss our cost performance and outlook. And we'll then open the call up for questions, and Peter will end with some closing remarks. By now, everyone should have access to the press release that went out at about 4.00 Eastern Time today. If you've not received the release, it is available on the Investor Relations page of our Web-site, hawaiianairlines.com. During our call today, we will refer at times to adjusted or non-GAAP numbers and metrics. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers and metrics can be found in our press release or on the Investor Relations page of our Web-site. As a reminder, the following prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our future plans and potential future financial and operating performance, and management may make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. For a more detailed discussion on the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement, we refer you to Hawaiian Holdings' recent filings with the SEC, including the most recent annual report on Form 10-K as well as reports filed on forms 10-Q and 8-K. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter R. Ingram: Mahalo, Daniel. Aloha everyone and thank you for joining us today. Today we reported second quarter adjusted net income of $73 million or $1.44 per share, with a pre-tax margin of 13.7%. I'd like to thank my colleagues for another quarter of solid financial results and for demonstrating day in and day out why Hawaiian remains the carrier of choice for Hawaii. Seems like we've spent a lot of time this year talking about challenges facing our business. Higher industry capacity, aircraft delivery delays, increasing fuel prices, flooding in Kauai, and volcanic activity on the Big Island of Hawaii, all come to mind as subjects that have dominated the commentary around our Company at one point or another early this year. And while these are all realities that we are facing or have faced, we shouldn't lose sight of the big picture, Hawaiian Airlines continues to perform very well both operationally and financially. Our financial performance is strong by historical standards, underscoring as we are likely to end the year among the U.S. industry leaders on a pre-tax margin basis. Our on-time performance led the industry throughout the second quarter, as it has for almost a decade and a half now, and we continue to deliver Hawaiian signature hospitality to our guests day in and day out. I could not be more proud of our team of over 7,000 aviation professionals who continue to deliver this performance. I mentioned the volcanic activity on Hawaii Island a moment ago, and indeed our second quarter results would have been even better had we not seen the slowdown in bookings during the quarter on our Hilo and Kona Neighbor Island routes in particular. To be clear, there has been a financial impact from the volcanic activity but it is isolated to a narrow portion of our network, and with the exception of an extended closure of Volcanoes National Park, the tourism infrastructure of the state is up, running, and open for business. We have seen some demand recovery in recent periods but we would not say that things are back to where they were before the volcano became more active. So, our third quarter estimates reflect some continuing impact. Our thoughts go out to the residents of the affected area whose lives have been more profoundly affected than our business. As was the case earlier this year with the flooding on Kauai, our employees have stepped up to support those in our community who are facing real hardship. This is the spirit of Hawaiian Airlines and it is what makes me most proud to be part of this 'ohana. For our part, we're focused squarely on execution and that which we can control. To start, we're now inducting A321s into our fleet at a rapid pace. Since our last earnings call, we have taken six deliveries. This brings our fleet to a total to eight. Over the remainder of the year we expect to receive another three aircraft, which will bring the fleet to 11 by the end of 2018. As we get to the back half of the year, you'll see more A321-only routes emerge, as we build critical mass with this aircraft. Over time, this allows us to optimize our A330 wide-body deployments on long-haul and large market routes while also enabling the retirement of our remaining 767s. By the end of the year, we expect to have A321s serving 11 routes between the West Coast and Hawaii. Early results on our A321-only routes are right on target, as is the aircraft's operational performance. In concert with our other fuel conservation initiatives, the A321s will contribute meaningfully to improve fuel efficiency. We are anticipating improvement in ASMs per gallon in the second half of this year and an even more notable improvement in 2019. Transitioning into the A321s and phasing out of our 767s is one of the defining near-term initiatives for Hawaiian. The reward at the end of this transition is a competitive advantage of a fleet ideally suited for each of our network missions, and very soon we'll be at a point where the number of days before our final 767 flight is fewer than the number of days since our first A321neo introduction. Another important strategic priority for Hawaiian this year is cultivating our new partnership with Japan Airlines. Just last month, our two airlines filed applications with both the U.S. and Japan authorities for antitrust immunity for our proposed joint venture. We hope to win approvals from the relevant governmental authorities in both countries later this year, and assuming we do, we expect to be in a position to formally launch the joint venture in the second quarter of 2019. The customer benefits of this partnership are real, as are the opportunities it creates for Hawaiian and JAL in the years ahead. In the meantime, we are very encouraged by our first full quarter of codeshare and JALPAK bookings between the two airlines. We look forward to building on this momentum as the year progresses. Other pieces of our 2018 plan are also falling into place. The remodeling of our A330 cabins is now complete with the 24th modification finished during the second quarter. This caps a multiyear effort to introduce a lie-flat seat premium cabin product and increase the number of our tremendously well-received Extra Comfort seats on each aircraft. Coupled with the introduction of A321neos and retirement of 767s that don't have Extra Comfort seats, the successful monetization of our cabins is a great story that is positioned to get even better. Complementing these product improvements, earlier in the year we implemented technology that allows us to sell Extra Comfort seats through third parties at the time of booking. This is particularly important in international markets where a larger portion of our bookings are made through these channels. On the cost front, we are reaching an important inflection point. Over the last few years, our unit costs have grown as we've invested in our growth and executed some transitions in our business. We expect to turn the corner on cost performance this year with non-fuel unit cost growth declining sequentially in each quarter of 2018. As Shannon will remind you later on the call, this sets us up for flat to down CASM-ex in the years ahead. Solid cost control is important irrespective of the operating environment, but it's even more important when fuel prices are moving up, and this year we expect total fuel expense to be up about 35% year-over-year. Fleet renewal, our fuel efficiency initiatives, fuel surcharges on our international routes, and our fuel hedging program, all serve to mitigate pressures from high fuel prices, but the more lasting countermeasure is disciplined cost control. We look forward to reporting better results on this facet of our business going forward. Now as we pause to take stock of where we are at the year's midpoint, we have a tremendous amount to be encouraged about. With various puts and takes throughout the first half of the year, some expected, some not, our 2018 financial results are shaping up to be largely in line with what we anticipated going into the year, if not a little better. I want to thank the entire Hawaiian 'ohana for showing their mettle yet again, in a year that has so far had roads with more curves than straightaways. We're running a strong airline, producing financial results at the better end of the industry, and growing our business profitably. Our performance reinforces the confidence we have earned over time and serves as continuing evidence that no other airline is better suited to win in Hawaii than Hawaiian. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Brent.\nBrent A. Overbeek: Thanks, Peter, and aloha everyone. Total operating revenue in the second quarter grew nearly 7% to $715 million, a record for the June quarter. Top line growth in all geographies, a robust quarter for our cargo business, and a nearly 20% growth in revenue per PAX from our value-added products, contributed to system-RASM growth of 0.7 points year-over-year. These are solid results considering that the second quarter of 2017 saw the highest year-over-year unit revenue growth in our recent run of success. Fuel surcharges and foreign exchange collectively accounted for about 1.5 point of our year-over-year system-RASM performance, which helped offset headwinds of about 0.75 point from the Easter holiday shift and a little less than 1 point from demand weakness attributed to volcanic activity on the Big Island. Our cargo business had another remarkable quarter, growing more than 17% year-over-year on strong volume and yield growth. Year-over-year freight transport remained strong, a trend that we expect will continue into the back half of the year. We're also excited to begin our dedicated all-cargo service within our Neighbor Island network next week, as we expand into this line of business. Value-added revenue per passenger was up 20% year-over-year in the quarter, with strength across all product lines. Extra Comfort revenue per seat continued to grow despite adding 25% more capacity year-over-year. The ongoing deployment of the 321neo fleet will be a driver as we increase Extra Comfort capacity throughout the remainder of the year. HawaiianMiles also provided a significant boost to our value-added revenue stream this quarter. This was the first full quarter of our new agreement with Barclays and we are encouraged with the results. As part of the new agreement, we were excited to launch our enhanced HawaiianMiles World Elite Mastercard earlier this month, providing additional earning opportunities for our cardholders. We're optimistic that the enriched customer proposition will continue to propel new card applications, deeper engagement, and increased spend from our existing cardmember base. Now turning to each of our geographies; domestic PRASM, which includes our North America and Neighbor Island services, was down 5% year-over-year this quarter. North America markets were the most impacted by the Easter shift and second quarter PRASM was down a bit more than the domestic average year-over-year. Double-digit industry capacity growth between North America and Hawai'i was met with strong demand, but did put some moderate pressure on yields and load factors throughout the quarter. Industry capacity growth between North America and Hawai'i begins to taper off a bit in the back half of the year but remains elevated compared to the same period in 2017. As it currently stands, industry capacity is expected to grow about 8% in the third quarter and about 8.5% in the fourth quarter. Neighbor Island PRASM was up in the mid-single-digit range this quarter. Although below what we originally expected, there is an uptick in the intensity of volcanic activity on the Big Island led to some booking softness to Hilo and Kona. Booking trajectories have improved but they are still below where we were seeing earlier in the year. In response, we trimmed a few flights between Honolulu and the Big Island during periods where we had sufficient frequency to maintain a robust schedule, meet market demand, and serve those communities. Unlike our North American peers who often contend with winter storms that disrupt service for a predictable period of time, there is no way to predict when the volcanic activity on the Big Island will subside, let alone end. This particular volcano has been active for the last 35 years, with the last eruption that caused significant damage nearly 30 years ago. We'll continue to monitor the eruption's progress and respond appropriately. Helping to offset the domestic PRASM performance was another strong quarter in our international markets. International PRASM improved 10% year-over-year in the quarter on continued demand strength, higher fuel surcharges, and strong premium cabin performance. Japan and Korea markets performed notably well. As Peter mentioned, our partnership with JAL is off to a good start. Despite only starting to sell the Hawaiian-JAL codeshare in late March, we exchanged roughly 10x more codeshare revenue for travel within the second quarter of 2018 with our new partner than we did with our previous partner during the same period in 2017. Overall, robust second quarter results cap a solid first half of the year. Looking ahead, the third quarter marks the high point of our capacity growth in 2018, with capacity expected to grow between 7.5% to 9.5% year-over-year. We'll be in the heart of our fleet transition and by mid-August we'll have eight A321neos in the schedule. For the full year, we have narrowed our capacity guidance to be up 5.5% to 7.5% year-over-year, shaving 50 basis points off each end of our prior guidance. Year-over-year RASM comparisons are difficult, remain difficult in the third quarter as we compare against the highest ever absolute system-RASM in the third quarter of 2017. Elevated industry capacity on several of our routes and continued traffic impact on the volcano on the Big Island have a moderating impact on our RASM expectations. Despite these headwinds, we expect our RASM to be between down 1.5% to up 1.5% in the third quarter. On the whole, we're continuing to compete very well in the face of higher industry capacity and we remain on track for another year of solid top line growth, despite setbacks from natural disasters and aircraft delivery delays. We've built a durable airline that can overcome these challenges and more. And with that, I'll turn it over to Shannon.\nShannon L. Okinaka: Thanks, Brent. As Peter said earlier, we continue to produce solid financial results as we grow and invest in the business. Between share repurchases and dividends, we've returned more than $35 million to shareholders this year. A quick recap on share repurchases; we have a $100 million program in place through the end of 2019, under which we have bought about $23 million to date. In the second quarter, we were slower to repurchase shares as we reviewed our expected uses of capital for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. We remain committed to the program going forward. As we expect will be the case for our peers, rising fuel prices pressured earnings this quarter. Operating expenses were up nearly 17%, most of which was due to a year-over-year increase in fuel expense of about 50%. We expect a similar year-over-year increase in total fuel expense in the third quarter. Helping to offset this were realized gains from our fuel hedging program of nearly $11 million, net of premiums. Based on the latest fuel forward curve, our fuel hedges are expected to settle at a gain of more than $28 million, net of premiums, for the full year. We remain disciplined in our approach to fuel hedging, with a focus on decreasing operating and economic risk. On the financing front, we entered into two Japanese yen denominated loans this quarter, collateralized by the two A321s we received in 2017. The A321's popularity makes it a highly financeable aircraft and the Japanese debt market was a compelling option for us given very attractive interest rates and because yen-denominated loan repayments create a natural hedge to our Japanese yen revenue exposure. Going forward, these loans have the potential to cause the movement in our non-operating income each quarter as we account for the impact of exchange rate changes between the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen on our balance sheet. We will exclude this impact from our adjusted results to provide clearer comparisons. Shifting to our cost performance and outlook, we're seeing sequential improvement in non-fuel unit costs, as expected. We're beginning to put some of our A321s' delivery delay costs behind us and are starting to see the benefit from improved productivity as we put more A321s into service. In the second quarter, CASM ex-fuel was up 4%, which was at the bottom of our original guidance range and 2 points below the midpoint of our revised guidance range. The one-time maintenance and labor increases that led us to raise the midpoint of our guidance range came in lower than anticipated. In addition, aircraft induction delays and timing shift for certain investments into the back half of 2018 further lowered our second quarter CASM. With the first half of the year now behind us, we are at an encouraging inflection point in our 2018 unit cost story. Looking ahead, we expect third quarter CASM ex-fuel to be up between 0.5% and 3.5% compared to the same period last year. This includes headwinds totaling about 2 percentage points from contractual increases in maintenance rates and costs related to the startup of our Neighbor Island cargo business that Brent mentioned earlier. Altogether, year-over-year CASM ex-fuel growth should be flat in the back half of the year, resulting in a full year increase between 1% and 3%. Consistent with our prior guidance conventions, these CASM ex-fuel ranges exclude any assumptions related to the amendable contract with our flight attendants union. In May, I highlighted the momentum we are building in controlling and driving down costs. In addition to the structural unit cost benefits we'll receive from transitioning of fleet from 767s to A321s, we are also focusing our attention on labor, fleet maintenance, cost of sales, and overhead. I'm encouraged by our unit cost performance outlook this year and I'm confident these improvements will continue. One of my key goals is to ensure that good, disciplined cost management is fully entrenched in our DNA. In fact, I'm confident that over the next couple of years we'll deliver flat to down unit cost year-over-year as we continue to grow long-term shareholder value. In closing, our 2018 results are shaping up quite well despite a few curves in the road. We have built a strong, durable airline with a solid financial foundation that has proven its resilience time and time again. I'm proud of this quarter's performance and look forward to the second half of the year. This concludes our prepared remarks and I'll now turn the call back over to Daniel.\nDaniel Wong: Thank you, Peter, Shannon, and Brent. I'd also like to thank all of you for joining us today and for your continued interest in Hawaiian Holdings. We're now ready for questions from the analysts first, and then if time permits, questions from the media. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question, and if needed, one follow-up question. Dana, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nHunter Keay: So, the CASM-ex, you guys talked about flat to down in I think you said over the next couple of years, and then you said in the years ahead. Given you're going to be exiting at negative CASM out of this year, is there any reason why that should not apply to next year as a whole?\nPeter R. Ingram: Hunter, I think we'll stick by the comments that we've got out there already. It's premature for us to give more specific guidance for 2019. But we're obviously expressing confidence about the cost trajectory of the business over the next couple of years and we do have a good position we'll be exiting this year from. So, we have every reason to believe we are going to deliver on that.\nHunter Keay: Okay. Thanks Peter. And then I was hoping you might be able to share with us some statistics at a very high level, I know this is competitive so I don't want to drill you down too much, but what percentage of your interisland passengers have credit card or HawaiianMiles account? And if you rather me ask the question sort of a backwards way, what percentage of your loyalty plan members or your credit card holders are residents of Hawaii? Either one of those, any metrics you can share on that would be great. Thanks.\nPeter R. Ingram: I'll give you a couple of facts that we have said publicly before. One, we actually have more HawaiianMiles members on the U.S. mainland than we do here in Hawaii. That's obviously not to say we don't have deep penetration of the program here in Hawaii. It's just we've got a population of about 1.4 million people and there's a lot more people on the mainland United States. So, we are excited that we have opportunities for the HawaiianMiles program and for the credit card in both those geographies, and really designed our loyalty program and the credit card benefits around serving both of those vitally important audiences for us. In terms of the mix of traffic on our Neighbor Island flights, what we see as local itineraries, so people just buying in Neighbor Island segment is something north of 60% of what's on the airplane and the rest comes from \u2013 the biggest portion of the rest is connections from our network and then obviously we've got connections from our interline and codeshare partners.\nHunter Keay: Thanks Peter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DiNardi from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph DiNardi: Peter, if you look at Department of Transportation data for you guys, it shows that I think your profitability on the international side is about breakeven. I know there are some issues with using that, but speak to how accurate it is, if you'd like. But I guess what I'm interested in is, how big of a catalyst is the JAL JV for improving the profitability on that side of your business? And I think what you've said is that you expect all aspects of the network to earn their cost of capital. So, can you just talk about what you view that business' or that side of the network's cost of capital to be?\nPeter R. Ingram: So, let me start by saying, we don't as a matter of policy from a competitiveness standpoint talk about the profitability from period to period in a specific geographic region of the business. We have said, as you accurately attributed to us, that over the long term each of the routes and each of the parts of our business needs to be profitable, and sometimes there are different factors affecting each. One thing I will say about the international is, we for a long time had the practice of talking about the three geographies that we operate in. Of the three, the international is quite clearly the least homogenous in terms of how it performs. And so, we have different factors that affected it. It tends to be longer haul. So, it's more fuel sensitive. Foreign exchange can be a big tailwind or can be a headwind, depending on certain periods, and that varies from country to country within where we serve. We've done I think a very good job of building the international business over the last decade. Japan in particular is vitally important to that as they are by far the largest source of international visitors to Hawaii. We are pleased with what we have built in Japan and we are really excited about the opportunity to build on that further with the partnership with JAL.\nJoseph DiNardi: But Peter, is it fair to say that it's been a few years since you think the international side has been profitable or earned its cost of capital?\nPeter R. Ingram: I didn't say either of those things.\nJoseph DiNardi: Okay. How much of the Pacific revenue is tied to fuel surcharges that you would kind of view as formulaic that are kind of controlled by the government? Do you have that?\nBrent A. Overbeek: Joe, Japan in particular is quite formulaic, albeit slightly lagged. And so, we'll see that generally move and cover most of the cost of fuel on a slightly lagged basis. And that would be between 50% and 60%, probably about 50% of our international revenue would be tied into that.\nJoseph DiNardi: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nHelane Becker: Brent, I'm wondering if you can answer this question. As we think about the volcano and the impact second, third quarter, can you kind of say what the RASM impact was for the third quarter maybe, so that we have a good sense in how it looks for 2019 assuming the activity moderates?\nBrent A. Overbeek: I think it's tough to predict kind of the recovery. From what we've seen initially, we saw a more material slowdown on bookings kind of further out from departure as people were trying to understand the situation, particularly people not familiar here with Hawaii, as they were trying to understand the situation, and more discretionary trips were probably impacted in Neighbor Island bookings closer to departure. And so, we have seen kind of both of those improve as we worked our way through the second quarter. Nonetheless, the impact has been a bit more material in the third quarter as a little bit more of that discretionary traffic was booking in May and June for the third quarter. And in terms of 2019, I think it's premature to speculate as to what that means in terms of, A, what's going to happen with the volcano, and B, how that's going to materialize in the marketplace.\nHelane Becker: So, would you say it's sort of like 0.5 basis point of impact for the third quarter?\nBrent A. Overbeek: No, I think it would be north of that. But again, it's a bit premature, and seeing how the volcano evolves in the weeks and months ahead.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then just, do you think people from the Mainland or from Japan who are avoiding the Big Island were going to other islands?\nBrent A. Overbeek: We've seen a moderate uptick in traffic for travel to Kauai, particularly post floods, and there we have seen that traffic recover well. As well into Maui we've seen traffic going to there as well. So, I would say, yes, we've seen some recovery into islands away from the Big Island.\nPeter R. Ingram: And just to clarify some points around the impact of the volcano, one of the things that was challenging for the tourism community here in general or really in the period when the volcano was getting a lot of media coverage was not the world's best understanding of the geography of the Hawaiian Islands. The affected area from this latest round of volcanic activity is about 10 square miles on the Island of Hawaii, which is about north of 4,000 square miles in total. The Hilo airport is 20-odd miles away from it. Kona is probably closer to 100 miles away from it. And most of the area that is sadly been affected is a long ways away from where tourists generally go. So, I think there's two things that we can't predict. One is what the volcano will do next. The other one is, how that is covered in the media. And it is really the combination of those two that caused some of the bookings weakness in the second quarter. As Brent said, we've seen that start to abate but not completely go back to where it was before.\nHelane Becker: Okay, great. Thank you so much for that, Peter. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Linenberg: Two questions here. Brent, you gave us the FX and fuel surcharge impact on RASM, I think the 1.5 points. I think that was on a system basis. Would you be willing to give us that on the impact to international only?\nBrent A. Overbeek: I don't have that in front of me, Michael, but I would put it at \u2013 kind of working backwards on math, I would put it, given that international represents about a quarter of our revenue, I think that would be a safe assumption.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, good. And then just my second question, and this is either to you and/or Peter, if we go back a few years when JAL and American announced their JV, in their press release they did indicate the size on a revenue base. They indicated it was about 1.5 billion back then. And obviously it's got bigger since then. I think in your filings, I don't think you've put a revenue number around that. Would you be willing to just give us kind of a rough sense of kind of in year one what the size of that JV is, so we can think about the potential upside in modeling, et cetera?\nPeter R. Ingram: Mike, I don't have \u2013 I don't know exactly what we said or didn't say in our filing right now. So I don't want to put a number out there that's not public. Let us take that one off-line and maybe we can come back to you and see what we can communicate that's consistent with what we said publicly up to this point.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin Crissey: Wanted to understand your outlook for capacity growth in the next couple of years. You talk about flat to down CASM-ex. Are we talking about a similar growth rate of capacity in future years as in this year?\nBrent A. Overbeek: No, Kevin, we haven't guided capacity out kind of beyond 2018. I think we feel really good and comfortable with our ability and the flexibility that we've got to be able to manage that capacity growth, either up or down kind of dependent on how situations warrant, but I think we've got \u2013 we are comfortable with the flexibility that we've got today. And I think as we look at 2019, that will likely come down a bit from where we are at right now.\nKevin Crissey: Okay, thank you.\nPeter R. Ingram: And just to add to that a little bit, this year we've got the 321s coming in. There we've seen some delays but we've able to maintain most of our capacity guidance for this year despite the delays by substituting some other airplanes. As we go into the back part of this year and into next year, we start to see more of the 767 requirements. And so, that just from a fleet perspective caps down our capacity a little bit, but we are still finalizing the plans for next year. So, we don't have a specific guidance number but I expect ASM growth in 2019 to be a little less than what we had in 2018 on the basis of our fleet profile.\nKevin Crissey: Terrific. Thanks. And can you talk about the way customers purchase tickets in Japan and whether that has changed over time? I think I remember block purchases and certainly more travel agencies. I'm not sure if that's still the way things are being done. Maybe you could talk about how that distribution pattern differs from your other parts of the network?\nBrent A. Overbeek: Sure, Kevin. It is a bit different than other parts of our network, albeit it has evolved over time. And so, there's a bit more packaging business that gets done with blocks with some of our bigger partners, albeit that has generally declined over time. And so, if you compared it to where the market was three or four years ago to now, that evolution looks more and more like the rest of our international distribution, albeit it's a bit unique still in terms of blocks being a higher percentage of our overall onboard traffic.\nKevin Crissey: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve O'Hara from Sidoti & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen O'Hara: Could you just talk about, with the CASM-ex profile going forward, how much of that is driven by the aircraft and the improving network structure with the 321s, 330s optimized versus I guess better cost control generally? Thank you.\nShannon L. Okinaka: This is Shannon. I'll answer that. Yes, you are right, we are going to get some structural unit cost benefits from changing out the 767s for the A321s. We haven't given specific guidance for 2019 or beyond that, so I don't want to get into percentages or portions. But we are also seeing unit cost benefits and improvements from some of the other things that we've talked about, labor productivity, contract negotiation, overhead, and cost of sales, we have got initiatives in a lot of different areas. So, the unit cost discussion that we are having about 2019 and beyond being flat to down is really a combination of all of that together with the fleet changes.\nPeter R. Ingram: And just to underscore that a little bit, fleet transitions are always a challenge whenever you go through them. You have to go through them from time to time to move on to the fleet that is better suited for your future. But you end up with inefficient crew deployments on the way winding down in a fleet, inefficient crew deployments as you are building a fleet up to critical mass, and that's obviously affected the 2018 numbers, and we are through that more as we get into the beginning and certainly deeper into 2019. The other thing I would say about the last couple of years of our cost performance is, one of the things that we have highlighted as a profit enhancer for us, and we have highlighted it as such because it absolutely is, is the reconfiguring, remodeling of our A330s. That actually took seats out. So, even though it was profit accretive, it didn't do us favors in terms of cost per ASM. That's obviously fully in the base now with the last one of those completed. And so, there's a number of things like that, but I think Shannon is also very right to point out that we are very focused on just managing the business as well as we can and making sure as we go through and build our detailed plans for 2019 that we are also just managing the nuts and bolts of a budget and a cost structure, and we expect that to reflect itself in a better cost outlook going forward.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay. And then just maybe on the JV and where that stands, I mean, has there been any change in maybe your optimism that you get approval based on some of the increase in protectionist rhetoric or is that something that wouldn't be affected by or potentially affected by that?\nPeter R. Ingram: We submitted the application in the second quarter. We have been and remain optimistic about approval. We think there are very real customer benefits of combining our business with JAL's in a joint venture and we know that the DOT has approved joint ventures for many of our network carrier competitors in a variety of geographies, and we think that our application stacks up very well. So, that really hasn't changed with anything over in the political, geopolitical situation in the last little while. That is what we felt before we submitted the application. It's in there now, we still feel that.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay. And then maybe just on maybe longer term modeling outside of fuel, I mean can you talk about maybe your ability to improve your margins or what you think is maybe an appropriate margin improvement on an annual basis aside from fuel and maybe contract negotiations and things like that?\nPeter R. Ingram: Look, our focus is on making sure that we are absolutely competitive across all the geographies we operate in, and we make business decisions, whether it's fleet deployment or product decisions or staffing decisions, based on looking to optimize the trade-off of revenue and cost in the business. How that plays out over the long term is really difficult to predict with a lot of precision, but I think we have demonstrated that we have built a defensible, competitive position in all the geographies we serve and we think that positions us well for future success.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Susan Donofrio from weighty capital. Please proceed with your question.\nSusan Donofrio: So, just a question on cargo revenues, and Brent, probably for you, can you just talk a little bit about how you're doing with that? And then, when we think about going forward with further cooperation with JAL, would the cargo be included in that as well? If you could just give us some color, that would be great.\nBrent A. Overbeek: So yes, in general on the cargoes, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, has done very well. We've seen really solid strength through the latter part of last year and through the first half of this year. Probably most noteworthy is the performance in our international markets where we've seen strength in tonnage and in yield coming into the U.S., and so we are encouraged by that. Japan in particular has been quite strong for us. We look forward to the back part of the year as we induct the Neighbor Island freighters, and while that will start off relatively small with just a couple of flights each night within the Neighbor Islands, we'll continue to kind of ramp that product up through the latter part of the year and into early next year. In terms of the relationship with JAL, cargo is certainly an area we are going to look at, and it will be an area where if we can find some mutual synergies, we'll do that, but that is something that's a bit premature to talk about until we get things approved with the DoT.\nSusan Donofrio: Got it, okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph DiNardi from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph DiNardi: Peter, just on capacity, how you're thinking about that over the next couple of years? It seems like maybe recently you would have preferred to grow more than you have. You've been short-aircraft a little bit. To the extent that that changes and you have the aircraft you want, the demand environment seems pretty strong, should we think about you guys maybe growing at this type of rate going forward, just kind of how you are thinking about that? Thank you.\nPeter R. Ingram: So, as I said to one of the questions earlier, I think 2019 will be a little bit lower than this year with somewhat big capacity growth was bunched up as we have taken A321s in a bunch which is in some ways not optimal, and given that the deliveries have shifted around, it wasn't even entirely by design. We did have them spread out a little bit more in terms of the earlier delivery profile. But it does get us up to critical mass, which we are approaching now, and we are excited about that from a cost and efficiency standpoint. Longer term, I don't want to sort of be too prescriptive about what capacity growth is going to look like. I think if we continue to deliver pre-tax margins and profitability towards the top end of the industry and if we see good opportunities to grow profitably, then I think it should very much be in our plans to continue to grow. We want to do that at a pace that we make sure that it is profitable growth and that will be the focus of the management team to make sure we continue to execute on that.\nJoseph DiNardi: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the demand side, can you just talk about how you guys think about forecasting demand on the U.S. side, on the North American side of your business, and whether there you're running into any capacity constraints in terms of hotel rooms within Hawaii?\nBrent A. Overbeek: Joe, I think if you've looked at this year, certainly industry capacity and seats into Hawaii is well documented, have been up kind of double-digits. If you look at hotel occupancy rates, they have nudged up and in some places, particularly in the Neighbor Islands, they've seen a disproportionate benefit there largely as there has been a bit more seats there. But at every point in time kind of when we look historically across kind of visitor growth rate and occupancy rates in Hawaii, we found a way to continue to grow visitors into the state, and despite quite high occupancy rates, the secondary market with the likes of Airbnb and other products have enabled us to continue to grow visitors to the state despite really a relative lack of growth of hotel rooms over the last little while.\nPeter R. Ingram: One other thing that makes the supply situation of accommodations hard to track here is that hotels aren't the whole picture anymore. We've had timeshares, and timeshares continue to be an area where there has been some growth, certainly more growth than in hotels. Brent alluded to the alternative accommodations of vacation rentals and things like that. And it's an interesting trend, particularly for North America, that a decreasing proportion, and I think it's less than half now, of visitors from the Western U.S. are actually staying in hotels when they are here in Hawaii. So, we have from time to time worried about the lack of growth of hotels, but at the same time we have had long-term worries about that. We have seen visitor arrivals continue to grow and demand continue to grow. And so, it is not something that we think is necessarily a burning issue for the hearing now.\nJoseph DiNardi: Thanks Peter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDan McKenzie: I've been kind of punching in and out, so my apologies if this has been asked, but my question really just ties to JALPAK, what has been done so far, what is left to do, and I'm just wondering if the revenue contribution from this potential demand stream has begun to impact the P&L at this point?\nBrent A. Overbeek: So, we are still in kind of our infancy in terms of rolling that out. We rolled out our agreement with JALPAK in the front part of this year. We are certainly encouraged with the volumes we have seen out of there. As they get more and more familiar with selling our product, we think that there is a lot more opportunity in front of us. Like you said, early results are good, but we think there's more opportunity in front of us. I think one of the things that's been most encouraging to us out of JALPAK has been their propensity to sell higher-value products. So, whether it would be premium cabin or products like Extra Comfort, they've done a very nice job with their distribution channel with being able to sell those higher-value products onboard our equipment.\nDan McKenzie: Okay. So, when you say you like the volumes, can you just help us size what the volumes are and kind of what inning we are in at this point and where we should think about that going? And then just I guess related to that, once the JV is ultimately approved and implemented, is there sort of another leg to that demand side of the story.\nBrent A. Overbeek: I'm not going to give you a specific number. I'll say I think we are probably somewhere between the second and third inning on our evolving relationship with them. Once we do get immunity, obviously assuming we do, that just increases \u2013 it's another catalyst for us to work even further with them and that they will further share in the benefits, the revenue and profit benefits of our relationship with JAL.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nHunter Keay: Thanks for getting me in again. Do you guys get data from Bank of Hawaii around how your credit card holders spend money broken down into spend bucket, like gas, groceries, travel, stuff like that?\nPeter R. Ingram: Yes, we do get some data on the spend categories.\nHunter Keay: What's the biggest category?\nPeter R. Ingram: It's been a while since I've looked at it.\nHunter Keay: Is it gas?\nPeter R. Ingram: Hunter, let me follow up with you. I don't want to just sort of pop-up with some speculation on here. It's been a while since I've looked at it. But certainly what I would tell you is, as we were launching the redesigned card, which Brent mentioned on the phone, we focused on creating some incentives for people to spend more and engage more with the card, and the incentives we put on the consumer card were around gas, groceries, and dining, which are big everyday categories for our credit card and really for any credit card, and we think that the combination of those benefits really helps the engagement. And in fact, we've got HawaiianMiles partners. So we have extra incentives with here in the island for our members here. So, you can go to a Hele gas station and you can get extra HawaiianMiles when you use your HawaiianMiles credit card at Hele, on top of what you get on the credit card. When you go to Foodland, there are extra incentives for engaging with the HawaiianMiles program on buying your groceries. And we have a variety of dining programs throughout the state. So, a lot of things that we have done to really increase the utility of the HawaiianMiles program for our local members in particular. As well we have some national partnerships for our broader base.\nHunter Keay: What I'm getting at, Peter, thanks for that, is like if 40% of the spend comes on gas, I'm wondering if given that how high fuel prices are in Hawaii, if you actually see some needle-moving revenue from your credit card when gas prices go up? So, just another way high oil prices help airlines, I'm wondering if this actually is one of them.\nPeter R. Ingram: Yes, I think you may have that number a little bit exaggerated. It sounds like\u2026\nHunter Keay: No, I know. I made that up. That was ridiculous. I know, but you see the point. So okay, that's fine, we'll follow up later. Thank you.\nOperator: We have finished the list of analyst questions and have time for one media question from the line of Adrian Schofield from Aviation Week. Please proceed with your question.\nAdrian Schofield: Just a question on the turboprop freighters, just is the plan still to launch with two aircraft and then add a third later in the year?\nBrent A. Overbeek: Yes. So, Adrian, we are going to start with two aircraft. We'll have kind of one live every night and we'll have one spare. I mean, one of the important things as we get this product up and running is we want to ensure \u2013 we've got a great customer service reputation on being able to serve cargo customers today. As we launch this product, we want to make sure we are able to do that. So, we are highly spared up initially as we get this up and running, and as we get the third airplane out in the latter part of the year, we'll continue to grow the business.\nAdrian Schofield: Okay. And just one more thing I'm just a little curious about, with the volcano, do you think we'll reach a point where the volcano activity actually becomes a positive for tourism to [indiscernible]?\nPeter R. Ingram: Adrian, I think it may take a little time, but candidly, the volcano hasn't been a tourist attraction for much of the last 35 years. And in fact, for those of you who have had the opportunity to visit Volcanoes National Park, it's really a remarkable place when you can get into it, and it is fascinating to see that. So, I think it will get to that again over time, and in fact we have seen people taking boat tours and helicopter tours to go and look at the volcano. All of that takes time, and obviously with the activity picked up as it is right now, you want to make sure that those tourist attractions are well-managed and safe and properly accessible for people.\nAdrian Schofield: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back to Peter Ingram for closing remarks.\nPeter R. Ingram: Mahalo for joining us today. We are very excited for the second half of 2018 and look forward to speaking to you again at the end of the next quarter.

First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Daniel Wong, Senior Director of Investor Relations.\nDaniel Wong: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Hawaiian Holdings First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Here with me in Honolulu are Peter Ingram, President and Chief Executive Officer; Shannon Okinaka, Chief Financial Officer; and Brent Overbeek, Senior Vice President of Revenue Management and Network Planning. Also in the room with us are members of our senior management team to participate in the Q&A as needed. Peter will open the call with an overview of the business; next, Brent will share an update on our revenue performance and outlook; Shannon will then discuss our costs performance and outlook; and we'll then open the call up for questions; and Peter will end with some closing remarks. By now, everyone should have access to the press release that went out at about 4:00 Eastern Time today. If you've not received the release, it is available on the Investor Relations page of our website, hawaiianairlines.com. During our call today, we will refer at times to adjusted or non-GAAP numbers and metrics. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers and metrics can be found in our press release as well as on the Investor Relations page of our website. And as a reminder, the following prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our future plans and potential future financial and operating performance, and management may make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and do not guarantee future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement, we refer you to Hawaiian Holdings' recent filings with the SEC, including the most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K as well as reports filed on form 8-K. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Ingram: Thank you, Daniel, and aloha, everyone. I'm honored to be leading this earnings call, my first since taking over the reins as CEO of Hawaiian Airlines. I am blessed to have a wonderful group of colleagues throughout the business who have helped to make our leadership transition as seamless as possible. They deliver unparalleled hospitality to our guests and are the heart and soul of our business, which translates into outstanding results for our investors. We have a lot going on in the business right now and tremendous opportunities for the future. There is nowhere I would rather be.  2018 is off to a great start. Our operating revenue and adjusted earnings per share results were records for the March quarter. Total passengers carried was also a record. Higher industry capacity on several of our routes this year has been met by strong demand, particularly for the Premium Cabin, allowing us to continue to post strong revenue performance. At our Investor Day last December, we highlighted how we've succeeded in the face of aggressive competition over time, and how we're better equipped to compete today than ever before. Our first quarter results reflect that competitive strength and just as importantly, they reflect how far we've come as a company. We're more resilient today, both operationally and financially than we were just a few short years ago. Consequently, we're better able to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace and overcome any challenges that arise. And indeed, there were challenges in the first quarter. Most notably, double-digit competitive capacity growth between North America and Hawaii, additional competitive challenges on some of our international routes, higher fuel prices and delivery delays affecting our A321neo fleet plans.  Let me put the resilience I'm talking about in perspective. The first quarter is traditionally our seasonal trough. In many of the years between 2000 and 2013, we generated pretax losses in the first quarter and relied on the summer peak to work our way back into the black. This year, despite well-chronicled competitive incursions, we posted an adjusted pretax margin of 11% for the first quarter, which sets us up nicely for a successful 2018. And as good a year as we expect it to be, we are frustrated that it could be even better, were it not for the A321neo delivery delays. At the beginning of 2018, we had 2 of these aircraft in the fleet and expected 9 more to be delivered throughout the year. The delivery schedule was frontloaded in the year such that we expected 7 of these deliveries to be available for our summer peak. We still expect 9 deliveries this year, but the first 7 are delayed. In most cases, by about 3 months compared to what we had planned for at the beginning of the year. As a result, even though we built some buffer into our fleet and network plans, we've had to adjust our schedule on shorter notice than our customers deserve. We won't be able to add as much seasonal flying as we had planned to take advantage of the summer peak period demand. We've delayed the start of some new year-round services. We're incurring expenses to return the 767s to a service that we had planned to retire in the first quarter; and we're making less efficient use of pilots trained for the A321neo than we should be. A decade ago, this could have been a catastrophe for us. Today, it's a regrettable setback. What remains unchanged is that the A321neo is the optimal aircraft for midsized West Coast to Hawaii routes. The 2 we have in service are performing in line with our very high expectations. And as we build out our fleet over the next couple of years, we have no doubt that it will be the competitive asset we envisioned. We look forward to further demonstrating that as deliveries resume next month. In other fleet news, we announced in March the signing of a letter of intent to acquire 10 Boeing 787-9 aircraft starting in 2021, with purchase rights for a further 10. The 787's size and operational efficiency will allow us to upgauge our largest markets and take advantage of other long haul opportunities well into the next decade.  And as A330-200s approach lease expiration dates over the next decade, we'll have the opportunity to calibrate our growth optimally for whatever economic conditions exist. We're thrilled by these prospects and our team is already hard at work thinking about how we will equip our flagship aircraft for the future. Another milestone this quarter was the official start of our comprehensive partnership with Japan Airlines. Late last month, we initiated codeshare flights between the 2 airlines. This agreement extends our reach in Japan, our largest international market and the largest source of international travelers to Hawaii, and will help growth both our network and distribution capabilities. In addition to Japan to Hawaii flights, our guests will now have access to 36 domestic and 11 international destinations within the Japan Airlines network. Our flights are also now offered alongside Japan Airlines in JALPAK tour packages, capping a distribution channel that has thus far been the exclusive domain of Japan Airlines. In addition to codeshare flights kicking off, we remain on schedule to submit our application for antitrust immunity in the second quarter. It's very early days but the partnership with JAL is off to a strong start. Our entire team is eager to capitalize on the opportunities that will open up for both parties and to deliver the significant benefits that we'll provide to consumers in the years ahead. Japan Airlines shares our guest-centric view, and this alignment of interest gives me enormous confidence in the future of the partnership. Finally, this quarter, we signed a new agreement with Barclaycard U.S., our co-brand credit card partner since 2014. Our partnership with Barclaycard U.S., Bank of Hawaii and MasterCard has been extremely successful since we launched the current card in 2014. New accounts opened during the 4 years of the program were nearly twice what we recorded in the preceding 4-year period. And total cardholder spend in 2017 was more than 50% higher than our previous program yielded in 2013. The new agreement brings improved economics and importantly, it also opens up the door to enhancements to our co-brand card offering that we are certain will further grow our cardholder base and customer spend and even better engage our loyal guests with the Hawaiian Miles program. We'll have more to share on this in the periods ahead. All in all, we have a lot to be optimistic about as we look ahead. As we look into the next quarter and those beyond, we'll continue to focus squarely on execution. We're confident that the same execution that led us to deliver industry-leading unit revenue growth, robust profit margins and a stronger balance sheet over the last 2 years will carry us through any challenges we face in 2018. We're growing our franchise, we're growing long-term value for our shareholders, and we're connecting more guests to Hawaii than ever before. And with that, I'm happy to welcome Brent to the rare pleasure of participating in the quarterly earnings call. Brent and his team has been one of the cornerstones of our commercial success over the past few years, and it was a pleasure to promote him to Senior Officer and expand his organizational responsibilities earlier this year as we reorganized the commercial team coincident with my move into the CEO role. Over to you, Brent.\nBrent Overbeek: Thanks, Peter. Aloha, everyone. I'm pleased to be joining the call for the first time. Let me start by thanking the entire Hawaiian Airlines team in delivering our award-winning authentic Hawaiian hospitality to our guests every day, to driving strong commercial execution that once again did a fantastic job in the first quarter. I've met many of you on the call at our Investor Day events over the past several years but for those of you whom I haven't met, I'll briefly introduce myself. I joined Hawaiian in 2014 to oversee our Revenue Management and Network Planning functions. And a couple of months ago, I added our growing Cargo division to my responsibilities. I began my career at American Airlines where I spent nearly 20 years in a variety of revenue management-related roles. From there, I spent some time in the Middle East at Etihad Airways, leading their revenue management team and then found my way here to Hawaiian. We've got a great team here at Hawaiian and I'm proud of what they've accomplished over the past several years.  I'll now walk through our revenue performance and outlook. In the first quarter, our system RASM increased 4.9% year-over-year. Strong passenger revenue performance across all geographies, nearly double-digit growth in our value-added revenue per guest, a record first quarter for cargo and an unforecasted profit sharing tailwind from our co-branded credit card punctuated the quarter. PRASM for the period was up 3.7% year-over-year. The earlier Easter holiday benefited first quarter unit revenue by about 1 percentage point. Fuel surcharges in the international markets where they exist increased during the quarter, driving approximately 1 point of system unit revenue growth. Domestic PRASM, which includes our North America and Neighbor Island services, was essentially flat year-over-year, a solid outcome considering this comparison is to a very strong first quarter 2017 that's had double digit gains over the same period in 2016. North America to Hawaii PRASM was down slightly in the quarter. Both yield and load factor performed well in light of the 14% increase in industry capacity in our markets. Neighbor Island PRASM was up in the mid-single-digit range, mostly on load factor gains for the first full quarter following Island Air shut down. This momentum is expected to continue as a year-over-year industry capacity stabilizes over the balance of the year and is more in line with 2016 levels. International PRASM was up 11.9% in the first quarter on strong demand, higher fuel surcharges and nominally more favorable exchange rates. We saw gains in both load factor and average fares despite increased industry capacity in South Korea and select Japan routes. We're also seeing strong demand for our premium cabin product on our international routes with double-digit year-over-year PRASM gains since we introduced the new lie-flat product in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a matter of fact, our first quarter 2018 international front cabin PRASM was nearly 40% higher than the same quarter just two years ago. Excluding a profit-sharing gain from our Barclays partnership, we had another record quarter, with value-add revenue per guest up [indiscernible] percent year-over-year. Our Extra Comfort product continues to perform exceptionally well with our first $7 million month in March, and revenue from our front cabin upgrade products increased significantly, driven by our product optimization efforts. Cargo had an exceptional quarter, delivering record first quarter revenue of $24 million on strong yields and robust demand across all markets, especially from Japan. Overall, a very strong first quarter performance across all lines of the business.  Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect our capacity to be up 5% to 7%. And for the full year, we now expect our capacity to be up between 5% and 8%. This includes some upgauging of what were intended to be A321neo flights to wide bodies, offset by some delays in starting new routes due to later than expected A321 deliveries. Despite tougher year-over-year comparisons and continued elevated industry capacity on our North America routes, we expect year-over-year system RASM to be between flat to up 3% in the second quarter. For our part, we remain focused on realizing the full potential of our revenue initiatives. By mid-May, we'll have completed our final premium cabin modification on the A330s. Once this is done, we'll be able to further monetize this investment. By the end of May, we'll launch another A321neo route where we connect Long Beach with Honolulu. Southern California travelers are showing a strong interest in this convenient alternative to LAX, and we're encouraged by the early booking trends we're seeing. By June, we'll complete the first full quarter under our new partnership with Japan Airlines. While it's still early, codeshare and JALPAK booking trends have been quite strong. Needless to say, we're excited about the potential of this deepening relationship. As Peter said, we've had a lot going on in the business right now. No other airline can boast the service, product, fleet or network tailored for the Hawaii traveler like we can. We're the carrier of choice to Hawaii for a reason, and it underscores the confidence we have going forward. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shannon.\nShannon Okinaka: Thanks, Brent. To briefly recap our financial performance this quarter, adjusted net income grew to $55.8 million or $1.09 per share, and our adjusted pretax margin was 11%. We also returned more than $26 million to shareholders in the first quarter through $20 million in share repurchases and $6 million in dividends. As I mentioned in our Investor Day in December, growing long-term shareholder value remains a priority. Our record first quarter adjusted EPS reflects our strong revenue performance. In addition, we're focused on improving our cost structure with direct benefits to the bottom line. CASM, excluding fuel and onetime charges, was up 4.3% year-over-year in the first quarter, which was at the better end of our guidance range. A timing shift of planned investments and reductions in maintenance expense stemming from A321neo's fair engine delivery delays as well as savings from negotiated maintenance contracts more than offset higher selling cost associated with our strong revenue performance. We had 2 onetime charges this quarter related to the fleet plans that Peter highlighted earlier. The first was related to the purchase of 3 Boeing 767 aircraft, previously on long-term leases. This acquisition and a related agreement to sell these aircraft later this year are an important component of our plan to retire this fleet as we enter 2019. The second charge was related to the cancellation of our Airbus A330-800 order. Together, the two charges totaled $35.3 million. Our first quarter results also reflect a $4.6 million year-over-year benefit in nonoperating expense from the settlement of our IAM and salaries merged pension plans and partial settlement of our pilot postretirement medical plan, which creates a new runway going forward. Looking ahead, we expect second quarter CASM, excluding fuel and onetime charges, to increase between 4% to 7% from last year. This includes expected headwinds from the following, increased maintenance costs, primarily due to more A330 heavy checks, totaling 2 percentage points; pilot wage and related 401k burden tied to A321neo delays and training that account for a little more than 1.5 percentage points; increased airport rent and landing fees of a little less than 1 percentage point; and increased benefit costs representing about 0.5. We expected a number of moving parts to our cost story of this year. However, this year will be a tale of 2 halves. We expect unit cost in the second half of 2018 to be about flat compared to 2017, and there are a few reasons for this. First, we'll have lapped the increase in pilot hiring associated with our A321neo deliveries preparation and seasonal summer needs. We'll also have fewer heavy maintenance events in the back half of 2018 compared to 2017. And finally, we'll benefit from increased productivity as we deploy the new A321neos. Looking ahead, we'll continue to apply the same level of rigor and diligence to managing our business and driving down controllable costs. We expect our full year CASM excluding fuel and onetime charges to be up 0.5% to 3.5%, which is down slightly from our prior full year guidance, due primarily to the reduction in maintenance expense I mentioned earlier. Keep in mind, second quarter and full year non-fuel unit cost guidance excludes assumptions relating to the amendable contracts with our flight attendants union. And as a reminder, the next of our CDAs to become amendable occurs in 2021. Lastly, our 2018 CapEx remains on target to be between $375 million to $425 million, which is unchanged from our previous guidance. In closing, our outstanding first quarter results underscore our position as a carrier of choice to Hawaii. We're excited for the year ahead. And as Peter mentioned, even though 2018 would be even better were it not for the A321neo deliveries setbacks, we've built a durable business that is primed for success across any competitive landscape. This concludes our prepared remarks and I'll now turn the call back over to Daniel.\nDaniel Wong: Thank you, Peter, Shannon and Brent. I'd also like to thank all of you for joining us today and for your continued interest in Hawaiian Holdings. We're now ready questions from the analysts first, and then the media if time permits. As a reminder, please limit yourself to 1 question and if needed, one follow-up question. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Hunter Keay, Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: You guys obviously deserve a ton of credit for what you do on the RASM side. There's really no ifs, ands or buts about that. But the CASM performance has really not been good. And I know there's a lot of reasons to why that is, which you laid out. And I realize, Shannon, the back half is going to look better than the front half. But can you give us some line of sight on how you're thinking about CASM beyond this year? The 67s are going to be gone, you should be through the woods largely on neo, you have these productivity things. Can you give us some qualitative sense for how you're thinking about CASM next year and beyond?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. And yes, thanks for recognizing that the second half is quite different than the first half. We've got a lot of initiatives. We've spent a number of years, quite focused on revenue. And if you could look at some of the investments we've made in systems and people, a lot of it at the beginning part of the decade, was focused on the commercial team and commercial initiatives. And we've got a really good line of sight on costs now. Our cost initiatives are mainly focused in the operations and back-office area, but we're focused on a lot of technology projects that focus on productivity. We're making a lot of investment in continuous improvement resources. So that's where we're looking at for both those changes. Unfortunately, those kind of initiatives take time to implement, time for change management. We're getting some -- what you're seeing maybe a last year or this year, we're getting some benefits from some large contracts that we've been able to renegotiate. But you can't do that if -- you don't get a new contract to renegotiate at every quarter. But those are really the areas that we're focused, is labor, productivity through automation and process change and some of these big contract negotiations.\nPeter Ingram: And Hunter, I'd just emphasize that it is a real point of emphasis for us, and it's really part of delivering value to our guests is making sure that we can continue to deliver our product at a competitive price and keeping our costs down. We will get some important benefits as we get to the deliveries of the 321neos in. It's a lower fuel cost, more efficient airplane to operate. And also, the simplicity of getting the 767s retired will be an important benefit that will really be a tailwind for us as we go into 2019.\nHunter Keay: And I put the question the way I did because I'm really just paraphrasing your own words. I believe from your Analyst Day, you guys cited a dissatisfaction with the cost performance. So it's good to see that, but as we think about 2019 CASM, and this is my last question, is it fair to assume that it's going to look similar or better to what it looks like in the back half of '18, holding capacity growth sort of neutral? Is that fair? Is there anything on the horizon? You mentioned labor contracts are done through '21, basically. Was there anything that we should be aware of the terms of modeling '19 so that exit rate of '18 should not look similar?\nShannon Okinaka: Hunter, we get our CASM swings quite heavily with just heavy maintenance checks. So I'd have to look to see the heavy check schedule predictor before I could answer that. But on a -- just running the business, just normal everyday cost perspective, we are working hard and we've had a bunch of investment-type costs this year as well as last year with a lot of the 321 inductions that we wouldn't necessarily see so much -- as much next year. Plus, we have the ASM from actually flying the 321neos. But before I could actually give you anything quantitative, I'd need to check the heavy check schedule.\nPeter Ingram: And Hunter, just to clarify one thing in your question, you mentioned the labor contracts. We do have the one that is currently amendable with our flight attendants. The other ones, as you noted, are all buttoned up until 2020.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg, Deutsche Bank.\nCatherine O'Brien: It's actually Catie O'Brien filling in for Mike. So first, could you just update us on the competitive capacity outlook for mainline U.S. to Hawaii for the next couple of quarters? I believe on last quarter's call, you called out that that's going to bend down to high single digits from mid-teens in the back half of this year, does that still stand?\nBrent Overbeek: Catie, I don't have the numbers right in front of me. I think 2Q is around 12% and it tapers off a little bit more in 3Q, down to kind of high single digits, and then kind of mid- to high single digits published right now in 4Q.\nCatherine O'Brien: All right, got it. And then, can you guys give us a little bit more color on how the Neighbor Island market has evolved since the exit of Island Air just maybe in terms of forward bookings for next quarter? Should we expect to see a ramp there in RASM? And then also, any chance you could give us in terms of the delta on margins from the period when Island Air was ramping up to what you're seeing now that they've exited or maybe before they entered the market be better comp?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Maybe I'll start on that one and then turn it over to Brent for a little bit more detail. First of all, I would say, the long-term booking trends are a little bit different to glean because this is the part of our network that does have a tighter end booking profile, so we really don't have a lot on the books beyond the quarter that we're in right now. That said, I think the market from our perspective in the Neighbor Islands, looks a little bit more like 2016 than it does 2017. We've increased some of our capacity to replace what Island Air no longer has in the market, but we've been able to absorb that capacity with higher load factors year-over-year while keeping our prices in the local market relatively stable and producing, therefore, a better, more positive result in terms of RASM. We don't comment on the profitability of any of our parts of the network. Our view over time is that each of the parts of the network will have different competitive situations and environments, and they all need to produce on their own merit. And maybe Brent, if you want to add anything to that.\nBrent Overbeek: No. I think Peter hit the nail on the head. I think we're encouraged with the performance in 1Q. The comps year-over-year move around a little bit as we move from quarter-to-quarter, and I think there was a bit more industry capacity in the second quarter of last year, so the comps will change a little bit more favorably in that. But again, we're managing this for the long-term and we're encouraged with how performance looks.\nPeter Ingram: And just one other thing I would say in terms of how we're managing the market is, we've been careful about adding capacity to make sure we are properly serving peak periods, particularly around holidays. We've got Memorial day coming up, we've got some extra flights scheduled for Memorial day. We did similar things around Easter. So making sure that we are adequately serving the market and appropriately serving the market throughout the year as demand ebbs and flows with certain seasonality.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Hackel, Imperial Capital.\nAdam Hackel: Obviously, even with the results you guys are putting up, we obviously have a competitive dynamic on the West Coast industry and particularly in California. And obviously, a lot of that kind of revolves around frequent flyers and mileage programs and things like that. I'm wondering, what does your frequent flyer look like? What are the sort of demographics behind your typical frequent flyer and how does that compare to some of the other guys in the industry?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. I'd say that one of the things that's interesting about our loyalty program, the Hawaiian Miles program, is that we've actually got more members on the U.S. mainland than we do in Hawaii, which some people find surprising. But obviously, we are a smaller share of a much, much larger population base on the West Coast mainland in particular than Hawaii, where we have very, very deep penetration of a smaller population. I think our members are more infrequent travelers, particularly the mainland members are more infrequent travelers than you would think of as loyalty members of some of the bigger airlines. But typically, they have a very strong affinity for Hawaii and travel to Hawaii and that's why things like our credit card program are really, really important for us because the credit card program gives people the opportunity to earn miles even when they're traveling infrequently and use those miles as an alternative form of currency to buy their travel to Hawaii. So we've got great engagement and the credit card program is an absolutely integral part of our overall offering to consumers.\nAdam Hackel: Great. And just the last one, a quick one for me. Just you talked about Long Beach and it sounds like it's off to a pretty good start. Is there sort of a deeper long-term potential that obviously, you guys are tied in pretty well with JetBlue and they have a -- they sort of named that as one of their focus cities. I mean, what's sort of the potential there? Is there much more you can do and is there anything you can do with JetBlue? Or would you have to even start thinking about like an antitrust immunity type of thing for that even sort of growth beyond what you guys can do organically?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. With regards to Long Beach in particular, most of our focus and the timing of our flight is suited to the local markets. So there may be some limited connectivity opportunities and we certainly will pursue them as they exist. But most of our focus is going to be attracting the local market to the south of the Los Angeles airport. Longer-term, we have a great relationship with JetBlue. It's been very helpful and in particular, for our New York service. And I think we would look -- we're always looking for opportunities to work more closely with them to the benefit of all of our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Didora, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nAndrew Didora: I guess, Peter, Brent, very impressive RASM results here. And particularly, I thought on the international side, 12% growth, very solid. I understand the FX perspective. What else is really driving this? Maybe you can give us a sense of how much the fuel surcharges helped and how maybe we should think about them going forward in terms of future impact on RASM.\nPeter Ingram: So fuel surcharges at the system-level were about 1 point -- just under 1 point of benefit. They will continue to fluctuate. Kind of as we go forward, I think you've got to base, particularly in Japan, that moved around a bit in 2017 and so, those comps will oscillate as we work our way through the year. But in terms of overall performance, I mean, that was a small portion of it. Like I mentioned though, Premium Cabin performance was very, very strong. We continued to execute very well in Australia and New Zealand, and our traffic from Japan did very well. And frankly, we had some markets that had inflated or had increases in year-over-year competition and we performed very well in those markets as well. So a really kind of strength across the business driving that.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And maybe sticking on the fuel topic. Shannon, with the move in crude since January, it looks like your full year fuel hedge gain went from $13.5 million to $19 million on sort of a $3 moving crude based on your disclosures. Is there any guidance you can give us kind of on your hedge book per, I don't know, for each $1 move in crude or is it not as linear as that?\nShannon Okinaka: Let me think. I think you might have a sensitivity but I don't have it at the top of my head. But our program remains the same, Andrew. We are buying out of the money call options. About 1 year out, we buy about 15% more each quarter as we head in. So as we go into any quarter, we're about 60% hedged. I don't have in hand, the detailed numbers in front of me to be able to give you an idea, but we really haven't changed the program. I mean, for us, we consider the hedging program more of an insurance policy. We're not doing it to actively trade or try and make assumptions about the market. So I'll follow-up with you when I have some numbers in front of me. I'm sorry, I don't have anything quantitative right now.\nAndrew Didora: Okay, that's fine. We can follow up off-line. And then just one last more of a housekeeping question. But your other non-op line came in positive in 1Q but I thought pension costs were running through there at about $4 million to $5 million a quarter. Is 1Q a good run rate for that or was there something one-off in that line?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. That line also includes the translation of our foreign currency balance sheet account, so our cash accounts in foreign currencies. So that line includes the pension fees but also some other things. So that foreign translation of the balance sheet piece moves up and down every quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker, Cowen and Company.\nHelane Becker: Can I ask that FX question differently? Can you say the 12% increase, I guess, in international, what percent is attributable to FX? And then what percent in the guidance for the second quarter would be attributable to FX gains or losses?\nPeter Ingram: Yes, Helane, I think we were looking at the fuel surcharge and forex impact on a system RASM basis. So we'll have to go get that one, but I think if you think about it, international runs about 25% of our overall passenger revenue.\nHelane Becker: Okay, so that's helpful. And then my other question is, on the credit card extension, did that come with -- maybe that's the wrong way to phrase it, with additional revenue associated there that we should think about?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes, there are improvements in the economics. On a steady-state basis, if we ran like we were doing, we would see something probably mid-double digits improvement in our revenue associated with the new deal. And we've also, as I said, we've rolled some of the economics into some enhancements that we have to the consumer offering, which we'll be rolling out in the periods ahead. Those revenue benefits we have will actually give us a bit of a boost, a bigger boost in terms of the overall profitability of the program because it sort of flows more directly to the bottom line. And then I would say, the impact of that was relatively limited in the first quarter. I think we signed the deal on the 9th of March and so, it's only for the last few weeks of the quarter that we recognize the benefits in this period. So you will see improvements in the economics going forward, and that's built-in to our overall revenue guidance.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Can I just ask, what do you mean by mid-double digits? So are you saying like 50%?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Plus or minus 15%. Yes.\nHelane Becker: 1.5 or 5.0?\nPeter Ingram: 1 5. No, sorry. No I don't want to be confusing. Now we're excited about it, we're not that excited about it, Helane.\nHelane Becker: Well, that's right. That's why I wanted to clarify that number. And then my other question is on cargo. Brent, you are in charge of cargo. Are you seeing -- is cargo revenues meeting your expectations on the new aircraft? And how is that going?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. So cargo had a -- this is an interesting year for cargo. We got off to a great start in 1Q. Like I said, really strong demand, particularly international point of origin and especially out of Japan, so kind of exceeding our initial expectations there. Well, it's an interesting transition year. We'll bring on the cargo freighters later this year and we're excited about that business as well as done a lot of planning for the transition of the 767s out of the fleet and how do we make best use of the limited belly space for cargo on the A321 fleet. So an exciting year for transition and opportunity for the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie, Buckingham Research Group.\nDaniel McKenzie: And Brent, don't go anywhere. Leave it to me to pick on the new guy, so apologies here, your first time up to bat with the questions. But thanks for the detailed breakout of the revenue performance. I'm wondering if you can recast it slightly differently and just more simply. I'm wondering, just ballpark here, what percent of the volume was RASM positive versus the percent that was RASM negative in the first quarter. And I guess, what I'm trying to understand, is the breakout sort of 25 RASM negative, 75 RASM positive or is it perhaps more balanced?\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. I don't have it at my fingertips, Dan. But I would say, it was probably 50-50. Yes. Probably a little better, I would say. Yes, actually probably in the 60-40 range was positive. Yes, 60-65.\nDaniel McKenzie: Okay. And then just given the fleet changes, how did the growth in premium seats pace throughout the year? So growth in premium seats versus this summer versus last summer and how does that growth compare versus the first quarter?\nBrent Overbeek: It'll generally be in line with our overall capacity growth throughout the year. It might be slightly higher as we take on the 321s, they have a slightly higher proportion of premium seats. And so we've guided the capacity growth for the year in the 5% to 8% range. I would say, our front cabin is going to be slightly higher than that in terms of capacity growth.\nPeter Ingram: And Brent cast that in terms of the front cabin. I would also say that in terms of our Extra Comfort seating with the 321s rolling on, we'll have a greater proportion of those. The 767s that are retiring don't have the Extra Comfort products. So that'll -- we'll be dialing up our seating in that part of the airplane as well.\nDaniel McKenzie: Yes, that's actually where I was trying to get at. Is Extra Comfort and then the lie-flat together, does that change the growth trajectory?\nBrent Overbeek: It does. I mean, yes. I mean, Extra Comfort really accelerates as we continue to work our way through the year. Having 44 Extra Comfort seats on the 321 will accelerate a fair amount into 2Q and then we'll really see the growth rates for that in 3Q and 4Q be even greater.\nDaniel McKenzie: Okay, good. That was what I was trying to clarify. And then I guess, Brent, one last one here if I could squeeze it in. Just with respect to the JALPAK, what kind of revenue benefit have you embedded into the second quarter outlook? And on the one hand, the fact that it's is being called out suggests that it could be material. And on the other hand, it seems though it's just hard to know if you're factoring in anything at all at this point. I'm just wondering what kind of perspective you can share here.\nBrent Overbeek: Yes. We haven't been explicit in including any specified amount. We are encouraged with the volumes that we've got going, given that the product is really in their -- is in its infancy, and it's the first time that JALPAK has gone out and done this with a partner. So we've included in our base forecast in terms of how we look at 2Q and our optimism around the international side of the business continuing into 2Q, but we haven't called out a specific number.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve O'Hara, Sidoti.\nStephen O'Hara: Just if you could kind of talk about what relative to your expectations maybe at the beginning of the quarter, what came in kind of in line and maybe what was better, what was worse? And then I was just curious about the JAL agreement, where that stands. I mean, I don't think there is a real firm time line but has there been any changes in the time line that maybe was articulated or wasn't.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. So on performance during the quarter, I would say, international stood out as performing ahead of the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. Cargo was also strong relative to the beginning of the year. I would say, nothing really performed worse. So there weren't really in offsets and those were probably the two biggest pieces on the upside. And then we did have, as Brent mentioned in the prepared remarks, the unforecasted benefit of a payment for profit sharing from our co-brand card program that was another boost to revenue as the quarter came to a close. In terms of the timing of the JAL deal, we're right on track where we intended to be. I'm really impressed candidly that we got the codeshare up and running and that we have completed and signed a joint venture agreement that is subject to all the regulatory approvals. It took an incredible effort from a lot of people on our team and a lot of people on JAL's team. And we really thought that, that was a very ambitious goal to get that done on the timeline that we set out. And we hit absolutely every deadline along the way, so real credit all around for that. We intend to pursue the next step which is filing for antitrust immunity in the second quarter and I expect that to -- I expect that when we're talking to you at the end of the quarter, we'll tell you that that's already done and we'll be waiting to hear some feedback from regulators on both sides of the Pacific.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay. And then just to follow up the guidance. Just on the ex-fuel unit cost for 2Q. Could you just -- what's the actual metric that we should be comping to for 2Q? And I assume total RASM's the same just because there's kind of movement within the revenue categories but not revenue overall, does that make sense?\nShannon Okinaka: Let me take you to RASM first. As I flip through my binder to find the 2Q '17 comp. RASM -- first of all, Steve, are you referring to all of the restatements because of the accounting for rev rec?\nStephen O'Hara: Yes. \nShannon Okinaka: Okay. So RASM does have a change because, yes, there are some reclassification and that's just movement on the income statement. But the revenue recognition changed the way we account for the frequent flyer earned miles and that did take revenue out.\nPeter Ingram: Shifted to different time periods.\nShannon Okinaka: Yes. And shifted it to different time periods and that's why you saw a big change in equity as well as of 1-1 '18. And I'm waiting for Daniel to put something in front of me with the restated numbers. Okay. So the first quarter of 2017 restated, the CASM, excluding aircraft fuel and special items was $0.0933.\nStephen O'Hara: Okay, 1Q?\nShannon Okinaka: Yes that's -- oh I'm sorry, yes, that was 1Q. Second CASM ex-fuel and special items was $0.0899 for 2017. And second quarter 2017 RASM was $0.1415 for the second quarter restated.\nPeter Ingram: And we recognize all of you guys are having to swing around your models in conjunction with the changes in GAAP that Hawaiian and other carriers have implemented this year. We've tried to provide a lot of detail on how those restatements flow out through the year and they're in some filings that we've made in terms of 8Ks and we've put it in our press release. But certainly, don't hesitate to reach out to the team offline if there's some confusion about any of the numbers we've got out there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi, Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Peter, just on the new card agreement. I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more specificity in terms of what that's contributing. Can you just give us what the incremental revenue you're expecting in '18 is, or 15% on top of what? Just so we have a better sense of kind of what that's meaning for you guys this year. And then just on top of that, what gave you guys confidence that you could get optimal economics without going through the RFP that -- just doing an extension was the right way to do it?\nPeter Ingram: Yes. Let me start with the second part and then maybe come back to the first part. We went through a very rigorous RFP process that led to our agreement with Barclaycard and MasterCard and Bank of Hawaii in 2014. And I think that gave us some confidence that while the market has continued to move since then, we didn't feel that we were way off market. We worked closely in areas like this with people who are in the industry and in and around the deals in the industry all the time, and made sure we got as much insight as we could from them as we did this. One of the things that shaped that decision is on the one hand, you may be able to squeeze a little bit more in terms of economics by going to market. On the other hand, as we learned in the transition from 2013 to 2014, you have to weigh that against the cost of shifting to a different partnership which we did at that period of time. And that was -- that led a 2013 that candidly saw us not aggressively marketing the card us much as we would have liked. Our relationship with the team at Barclaycard has been great. We've seen good growth and we have a lot of confidence that this is the right team to go forward with. And I think we have confidence that we have achieved appropriate economics for what is available in the marketplace on this deal overall. In terms of how that revenue translates, sort of what a number is, I think, Joe, I'll give you a bit of a range, but I would say something in the $30 million to $40 million of revenue in terms of cash to us is what you would get. I would point out that Frequent Flyer accounting remains even with the new rules, one of the most complicated parts of revenue recognition. And so $30 million to $40 million of cash flow does not equate to $30 million to $40 million necessarily flowing through the income statement in this particular year.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up for Brent. I realize maybe you're kind of shooting off the hip a little bit in response to Dan's question about how much of your RASM is positive versus negative. But 40% being negative sounds like much, much higher than I would have thought it was. Is that a good number or was that kind of your best guess at this point?\nBrent Overbeek: That was a bit from the hip. And I would say of the stuff that was negative, I would say we had a bit of it that was kind of slightly negative. And so I'm concluding stuff that's capacity, stuff that was down 1% included in that. So I think overall, yes, probably 2/3, 1/3 is probably the more appropriate.\nPeter Ingram: The way I think about it, Joe, is you've got Neighbor Island and international that's about half our revenue, which were sort of broadly positive. Doesn't mean every single route in there was positive, but you're broadly positive on half. And then you have North America, which Brent said was slightly negative, which slightly means just a little bit below flat. So I think that's where you get into those 1% that Brent is referring to.\nOperator: Over next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani, Morgan Stanley.\nRajeev Lalwani: Shannon, actually, just a couple of quick questions for you. First, there's obviously been a lot going on with fleet. Can you provide us maybe an updated view on capital expenditures for the next few years and how that's looking versus the prior target?\nShannon Okinaka: Great. So over the next few years, let me think. The only changes, I think from -- I don't think we've guided out very far but the changes that we've had are going to be the 787 PDPs. But other than that, I'm kind of looking around the room, I don't think we had any other really big CapEx -- or changes in our CapEx plan.\nBrent Overbeek: We have the 787 PDPs but we also would have the A330-800s that were in our commitment schedule disclosures previously.\nShannon Okinaka: Right, so that would come out. Other than that, we -- for the most part, I think now we've finalized all of our plans for the 767 exits and the transactions you would see is a lease return, I think a retirement and then we have the forward sale of three 767s later in the year. But those are all -- the plans are all baked and contracted and executed. But yes, looking at our CapEx plans, I think the only change is related to 787s and we'll continue all of our IT investments at probably about the same rate that we've been doing for the past couple of years. That's been pretty steady.\nRajeev Lalwani: Maybe the other way to approach is that $400 million or so that you're spending this year, does that hold steady going forward or are we sort of peaking this year and that's coming down as we move ahead, net of everything that you just described?\nShannon Okinaka: It does fluctuate because if you think about just our deliveries, we have 6 321neos planned for 2019 and 1 for 2020. And we haven't finalized a 787 delivery schedule but that's most likely starting around '21. So just from an aircraft delivery perspective, we've got some differences in the next few years.\nRajeev Lalwani: Got it. And then can you just remind me on the CASM side, what the impact is associated with just pushing out some of the A320neos, and then having to have the 767s, et cetera, this year?\nShannon Okinaka: So on the 767 piece, the additional costs that we're incurring because of the NEO delay is an extra heavy check on the 767. We were planning to retire one of our 767s and brought it back to life through a heavy check that we weren't planning. But that's offset by some, I guess, penalty compensation for the spare engine, the unavailability of the spare engine. So that is somewhat offsetting but we also have a bunch of costs and I want to say it's about a 0.5-ish of pilot-related cost. We brought in a lot of pilots. We're in the process of training them and now, they're unable to fly because we don't have the A321neos that we thought we'd have. And the wait part of that was some of the benefits burden related to that. So that's, for the most part, the 321neo and the big cost drivers in the 321neo delays is a lot of it's just people and then that maintenance, that heavy check on the 767s.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Crissey, Citigroup.\nKevin Crissey: When I think about the West Coast to Hawaii as it relates to your competitors, can you talk about the percentage of your Frequent Flyer redemption maybe on board and whether you have any sense that their incremental capacity would have the same or different percentage of frequent flyer redemption?\nPeter Ingram: So I'll start and then see if Brent wants to chime in with anything else. We have -- we're obviously not precisely able to see exactly what the frequent flyer redemption percentage is on our competitors. But we can glean some insights from looking into the DOT data and seeing what proportion of tickets on a lag basis have a $0 associated with them. And the last time I reviewed those numbers, it was something in the low- to mid-teens, was about the area where frequent flyer redemptions were for competitors, and there's some variation across them. In terms of whether their incremental capacity is driving that percentage higher or lower, I don't have a firm view. And I think we will see that over time as we look in the data in the DOT. But it's going to be about 1 year before we are able to get enough information to really draw any conclusions on that.\nKevin Crissey: Okay. I'm just trying to assess to the extent to which they're entering the markets is entirely profit-motivated due to those specific routes or they're trying to create a network effect to maybe offset some West Coast competition. If you have any thoughts on that, I'd appreciate it.\nPeter Ingram: Yes. That may be a better questions for one of their earnings calls than ours.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back to Peter Ingram for closing remarks.\nPeter Ingram: Mahalo for joining us today. We're off to a great start in 2018 and have great optimism about the remainder of the year. We look forward to speaking to you again on our second quarter call. Aloha.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."}]
