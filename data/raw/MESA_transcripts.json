[{"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 3, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-08-12 12:19:10", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Mesa Airlines Q3 Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.  I would now like to turn the call over to [Shawn Lang]. Mr. Lang, you now may begin. \nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Mesa's earnings conference call for its fiscal third quarter 2023 ended June 30.  On the call with me today are Jonathan Ornstein, Mesa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Lotz, President; and Torque Zubeck, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for the sell-side analysts.  We also want to remind everyone on the call that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements.  In comparing today's results, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our fiscal third quarter earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.  With that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan for his opening remarks. Jonathan? \nJonathan Ornstein : Thank you, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. As we have stated, fiscal 2023 remains a transition year for Mesa. We continue to focus on maximizing block hours and reducing surplus CRJ-900 assets and infrastructure. Although the adjusted pretax loss for the quarter was $29.1 million, this included approximately $15 million of surplus CRJ-900 related costs and additional $5 million related to the transition. Our third quarter block hour performance roughly tracked with our forecast of approximately 46,000 block hours.  Regarding our CRJ-900 transition, the work is largely complete, and we currently have a total of 24 CRJs flying in addition to 56 E-Jets.  The transition from American to United was not always easy, but our people did an amazing job. During the quarter, we carried an additional 0.5 million passengers for United on its incremental flying. While regional air service continues to see strong demand, the industry at large has faced significant challenge in recent months with widespread operational disruptions driven by inclement weather and exacerbated by air traffic control staffing shortages. While we understand United's mandate to minimize cancellations for our passengers, we believe there is significant opportunity to further optimize scheduling, allowing us to increase our block-hour capacity overall.  Our top priority at Mesa continues to increase pilot production to ensure our planes operate at maximum utilization. The aviation industry continues to see significant labor constraints, with an overall shortage of pilots exacerbated by an increasingly pervasive imbalance of captains and first officers driven by hyper attrition and impacting all carriers from majors to regionals.  Mesa is addressing our captain and first officer imbalance with our direct-entry captain program in cooperation with United. This effort has been supported by a new requirement in United's Aviate program that pilots must have 2 years of captain experiences before transitioning to United. In addition, unlike some carriers, Mesa has the ability to require qualified first officers to upgrade to captain.  We also continue to develop our in-house recruiting and training initiatives. In particular, the Mesa Pilot Development Program has worked very well. We now have 10 aircraft at our first location in Inverness, Florida. Currently, we have approximately 2,000 applicants with commercial pilot license who need to build additional hours to reach their 1,500-hour requirement. We have already graduated an initial cadre who have performed very well in training at Mesa.  Given the benefits of Aviate and MPD, in combination with our industry-leading pay scale at the top of the regional industry, we now have approximately 1,900 new hire applicants. While our pilot attrition over the last 6 months has been at pre-pandemic levels, the pacing item has now become the availability of upgradable first officers. A stable pilot base and a healthy pipeline remain essential to the turnaround of our business.  The pilot shortage created by counterproductive regulation continues to cripple the industry, and Mesa is not immune. To give you an idea of the impact, here are a few important facts. In spite of consistently adding pilots from January to present, we're still only flying at approximately 70% of our full utilization capacity, which we believe is consistent with other regional carriers in the United portfolio. To meet United's target utilization, we will need approximately 150 more pilots, primarily captains. Once we reach United's target utilization, which we consistently achieved prior to the pilot shortage, we will generate pretax margins between 7% and 10% in our base business.  Given our current pilot outlook, as well as cooperation and support from United Airlines, we believe we will reach United's target utilization by the end of fiscal year 2024.  While Mesa's ongoing transformation has not been easy, we believe United will continue to work closely with Mesa to ensure our future success. United has assured us that they understand the strategic importance of our relationship, and we are incredibly thankful for their ongoing support.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. \nMichael Lotz : Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone. First off, I'd like to note that we recently added 2 key operational leaders at Mesa. Lori DiMarco, our new Vice President of Maintenance and Engineering, brings over 33 years of aviation experience and maintenance oversight expertise to Mesa. We also hired Andrew Lotter as our new Vice President of Flight Operations. Andrew has over 25 years' experience in the airline industry and has significant background in pilot training. Andrew and Lori's talents will be key to ensuring Mesa can maximize our peak capacity and utilization going forward and continue to improve our operational performance.  Operationally, we now fly the CRJ-900, primarily out of Houston and Denver, which was newly opened this spring. Initially, this had an impact on the CRJ-900 reliability, which has historically been supported by our Dallas and Phoenix maintenance bases. This realignment of resources has been completed, and we ran 99% completion factor for July and currently 100% in August.  Next, I'd like to review our block-hour capabilities. In the June quarter, we flew 45,301 block hours, roughly in line with our estimate of approximately 46,000 that we had provided. Looking forward, we expect that our September quarter block hours is to be roughly the same or slightly higher than the June quarter. Our initial projections for fiscal 2024 are an increase of roughly 4% to 6% per quarter. Our block-hour production is highly dependent on our ability to upgrade first officers, attract direct-entry captain, and is based on our most recent attrition rates.  With regards to our regional fleet, the United CPA provides for 80 large regional jets. For the third quarter, the fleet mix consisted of 56 E-Jets and 24 CRJ-900s. However, we continue to focus on increasing the utilization of our Embraer-175 fleet. For our cargo operations, we continue to operate 4 737s at DHL, 3 737-400s and 1 737-800.  With that, I'd like to now turn it over to Torque to walk through some of the financial data. \nTorque Zubeck : Thank you, Mike. I'll take this opportunity now to review our financial performance and our balance sheet.  For the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, revenue was $114.7 million, 14.7% lower compared to $134.4 million in Q3 2022. While contract revenue fell by $24.1 million year-over-year. These decreases were driven by lower CRJ-900 block hours and fewer aircraft under contract, partially offset by higher United block-hour rates for new pilot pay scale.  The decrease in contract revenue was partially offset by an increase in pass-through revenue of $4.8 million driven by pass-through maintenance expense with a net 0 P&L impact. Mesa's Q3 2023 results include, per GAAP, the recognition of $2 million of previously deferred revenue versus the recognition of $6.8 million of previously deferred revenue in Q3 2022. The remaining deferred revenue balance of $22.7 million will be recognized as flights are completed over the remaining term of the United contract.  On the expense side, Mesa's overall GAAP operating expenses for Q3 2023 were $154.9 million, up $20.7 million versus Q3 2022. This increase was primarily due to a $30.5 million impairment of assets held for sale. However, adjusted operating expenses were $131.2 million or 2.3% lower versus Q3 2022. This decrease was driven by an $8.4 million year-over-year decrease in aircraft rent attributable to the reclassification from operating lease to finance lease for certain CRJ-900s as well as depreciation and amortization expense falling by $4.8 million, primarily driven by lower depreciable base from the CRJ-900 asset impairment charge in Q4 2022. The decrease was also partially offset by higher flight operations expense to $51.6 million, $8.3 million higher year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher pilot pay scales.  Additionally, maintenance expense in this quarter was $51.1 million, $1.4 million higher versus Q3 2022. This is due to an increase in pass-through maintenance, partially offset by lower C check and engine expense. We expect maintenance and C check expense to be roughly consistent at this level for the next quarter. On the bottom line, we reported a net loss of $47.6 million or a loss of $1.17 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $10 million or a loss of $0.28 per diluted share for Q3 2022. On an adjusted basis, Mesa's reported a loss of $27.2 million or a loss of $0.67 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $7.1 million or a loss of $0.20 per diluted share a year ago.  The adjusted loss for Q3 2023 excludes a $30.5 million asset impairment loss, a $6.7 million gain-on-asset sales and a $2.9 million gain on investments in equity and a $300,000 loss on deferred financing costs related to debt retirement. Adjusted results from Q3 2022 primarily excluded a $3.9 million loss on investments in equity securities. So looking at Q3 financial performance, there are several key items impacting the bottom line. The company's fleet still has 60 CRJ-900s, of which 24 are in the United CPA, leaving 36 as surplus. The CRJ-900 aircraft and an additional 20 CRJ spare engines continue to be a drag on earnings, estimated at roughly $15 million for the quarter.  This cost primarily includes the expenses for depreciation, interest through wages and excess infrastructure. As we transition from the CRJ-900 to the E-Jets, one of our key focus areas going forward will be to continue to sell surplus CRJ-900 aircraft engines and inventory and shed infrastructure.  Now let me walk you through some of these items. Of the 36 surplus CRJ-900 aircraft, we have purchased agreements on 14, the disposal of which will result in cost savings of approximately $3 million per quarter. We are also in negotiations to dispose of an additional 15 CRJs, which will deliver cost savings of approximately $2 million per quarter. The remaining 7 surplus CRJ-900s have not been disposed of and hold carrying costs of approximately $2 million per quarter. We also have 12 [olefin] engines that we are marketing.  The sale of which will result in cost savings of approximately $2 million per quarter. Meanwhile, the disposition of 14 engines to United this past quarter will result in cost savings of approximately $1 million moving forward.  It's important to note that all these aircraft and engines have sold above their existing debt balances. We are also in discussions with United regarding their support in eliminating the cost of our surplus CRJ-900s as we transition the fleet.  Now let me turn to the balance sheet for the June quarter. As of the quarter end, cash, excluding restricted cash, decreased by $3.1 million from the March quarter to $48.3 million. Total debt was $566.3 million, down from $608.7 million at the end of the prior quarter. During the quarter, Mesa made debt payments of $40.6 million and the finance lease payment of $4.2 million.  During the quarter, we also closed on the sale of the remaining 20 out of the 30 spare engines that we agreed to sell to United in Q1 2023. This transaction generated net cash of $26.9 million, while paying down approximately $19.1 million in debt during the quarter. In addition, we returned approximately $8 million of the $10 million under the bridge loan provided by United. We have $26.3 million of scheduled principal and finance lease payments remaining in 2023. And after the repayment of debt associated with asset sales, we expect fiscal year 2023 year-end debt of approximately $490 million.  Notably, we expect our current transactions, involving our 14 surplus CRJs that we currently have agreements on, will reduce our debt levels by $74.3 million and provide another approximately $18 million in cash. Given ongoing uncertainties in the business, we will not provide any more specific fiscal year guidance at this time.  With that, I'd like to now turn it back over to Jonathan for closing remarks. \nJonathan Ornstein : Thank you, Torque. In sum, we knew this process would not be easy when we took dramatic steps at the beginning of the year to improve our operational and financial performance. We have rolled up our sleeves and made significant progress with our CRJ-900 transition and balance sheet actions. That being said, this is not the financial outcome that either Mesa or United anticipated. And as such, we've agreed to take actions together to correct that.  With that, I'd like to thank you again for taking your time to hear us today, and we look forward to answering any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. \nSavanthi Syth : I was just curious, the fourth quarter block hours are a little bit lighter than you had thought before. And just curious where your utilization is today and what pilot trends are kind of giving you confidence on the kind of the current outlook of as you get into the fourth -- into fiscal 2024 of seeing that level of quarter-over-quarter improvement in block hours. \nJonathan Ornstein : This is Jonathan, Savi, thank you, and I'll let Mike chime in also at the end if he wants to. The quarter versus our projection was a little bit light. We did get impacted somewhat by some of the operational issues that everybody was impacted by. We did lose a few more people to Aviate than we had anticipated. We obviously are facing the same captain crunch, pardon that.  But that we're all sort of short a little bit in terms of upgrading people. We do have the ability to upgrade people, and we have. But I think that those are probably most of the issue.  The other point of it is, we mentioned that we thought that there was maybe some more efficient scheduling. I think we have more block hours available to us in the CRJ flying. United took a particularly conservative approach in the transition. We think that as we've now gotten people and equipment and spare parts where they need to be, I think there's some more confidence in terms of that. That was not an insignificant reduction over what our crew max said we could fly.  So I think that those -- one of the areas that we've talked about is we probably can fly more CRJ hours. And what's interesting is that when you do look at us compared to the other regional carriers, from at least what we can tell from the data we see, our actual utilization across the fleet, in other words total number of hours divided by the total number of aircraft in the CPA, is almost identical to the other operators. So it's not as if we're doing -- flying less and not holding our own. We're actually doing a pretty good job on pilots vis-a-vis the other carriers. But it was just a question of the transition in building up those hours.  And now we have to continue to focus primarily on pushing up hours in the E-Jets, which, as you can imagine, is sort of the aircraft of choice going forward, to a large degree.  Do you want to add anything, Mike, on that? \nMichael Lotz : No, I think we just had -- we did have fewer upgrades than we had planned. We are scheduling our FOs to upgrade as they qualify with hours, but we had fewer than we anticipated. But our projections going forward, that number starts to increase as we do more and more of these upgrade classes of our first officers. We also are going to have a pretty major emphasis on this direct-entry captain program in cooperation with United. That's been extended a couple of times, and we're going to come out with some -- at least try to capitalize on that program as well. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Helane Becker with TD Cowen. \nHelane Becker : Question about the current portion of debt. I think -- and I have a clarification question. Torque, I think you said you had $26 million in debt repayment scheduled, I wasn't sure, is that calendar '23 remaining? Or is that just the fourth quarter? And then how are you thinking about refinancing that debt that's due over the next year? Or are you intending to pay it as it's due? \nTorque Zubeck : Thanks, Helane. That's a great question. So debt remaining in 2023 is in the fiscal year, not the calendar year. So that's a comment on there, if that makes sense. And obviously, we're looking to -- we're working on selling assets and retiring debt that way. But if we do need to look at refinancing something, that's certainly something we would consider. \nHelane Becker : Okay. That's helpful. And then the other question I have, just on clarification on the purchase agreement and the potential for 15 more, the $3 million, the $2 million per quarter and the $1 million, that's not all per aircraft? That's just in the aggregate, the total amount, right? I know that's probably a dumb question, but I just want to make sure I get that right. \nTorque Zubeck : Yes. \nHelane Becker : It's in the aggregate? \nTorque Zubeck : Yes, it's the aggregate. \nHelane Becker : Yes. Okay. That's perfect. And then, Jonathan, so in the current FAA bill, it's clear that the FAA is going to let pilots fly a couple of -- or I guess, the negotiation still lets them fly two more years but not change the 1,500-hour rule. So it looks like that's going to be with us and continue to be with us for a while.  Do you guys think about hiring retired captains from the other airlines that might still want to fly but that were kind of forced out during the pandemic and are maybe only 58 or 60 or 61 and nabbing them for another few years? Or does that not make financial sense? \nJonathan Ornstein : No, I think, look, we're looking at all the different possibilities. I mean, if people are direct-entry captains, people are qualified, I mean I think we're paying a $100,000-plus bonus to people who are bringing that. And we are going to announce shortly some new programs to further enhance that in order to get the direct-entry captain or what they call high time first officers.  Right now, we have almost, I think, 2,000 applicants who have qualifications to be pilots. The problem with that, of course, is that everybody is basically struggling to find captains. And the reason why the captains are gone is because the more qualified FOs through this hyper attrition that we're facing, due to the shortage, have all moved up.  I think that what we've done is to say, \"Look, let's just create a pipeline,\" which we do through MPD. We have the Aviate program, which then guarantees the jobs to the United. Aviate, thankfully, was restructured. That now requires those folks to become captain. They can no longer sit in the right seat and wait to become hired by United. They have to have what basically equates out to at least two years of time as a captain.  Once that kicks in -- and they did give -- and they grandfathered some of the existing people, but once that kicks in, I think the industry will start to right itself because folks will be out there saying, \"If we hire you, you're going to have to accept an upgrade when you're capable of doing it.\" And particularly at Mesa, as a result of our participation in Aviate, and I think 85% of our pilots are signed up for Aviate, will, in fact, get upgraded rather than being lifetime first officers.  Back in the old days, that expression was well known as up or out, you didn't have a choice. I think that you're going to see that more and more frequently in these programs where the pilots will, in fact, be put in a position to upgrade. And I think that will ultimately solve this issue regarding upgradable first officers. But it will take time to wash through the system.  And clearly, that's the thing that we're preparing by having this stream of pilots coming in, all of whom never reached upgrade and are in the Aviate program. So it will take time. And that's why in Mike's projections, we think that we can get there by the end of '24, fiscal '24, we can be at our targeted block hours, which will generate the kind of margins that we need because, clearly, the situation has to change. There's no doubt about that. And thankfully, we have United that agrees with us and knows that things need to be done right now to see us through to that point.  And I feel very confident that they'll do that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. \nAndrew Didora : Torque, just a question on the cost savings from the sale of all these incremental CRJs and engines, just trying to understand what the cash flow impact of that would be. So from a cost savings perspective, is that mostly D&A? Or is that a combination of D&A, is it interest expense? Are there some other cash operating costs that you have on these aircraft right now? Just trying to get a sense of the cash flow benefit. \nTorque Zubeck : Yes. We're primarily looking at elimination of the interest and depreciation. That's the biggest piece. But also when you have aircraft, unless they're in storage, you have to maintain them. And there's a certain amount of expenses associated with keeping them active.  And so the sooner we can get these sold, the biggest piece is certainly the interest and depreciation, but there's also some other cost savings that we probably see on the maintenance side just because we have few aircraft to work on and maintain. \nJonathan Ornstein : And I also think, too, Andrew, one of the things that Torque mentioned and I think it really is important to restate again, is that we have not sold anything that we haven't generated cash from the sale. And so I think that it took a little while of us to convince United and convince other parties. But all of our sales, even the aircraft that we sold that had 100% run-out engines, were sold at above our debt balance. And so when you look at all these sales, not only do they take expense off of our income statement and improve our cash flow, but they also will generate cash. And Torque can walk through that, but it's not an insignificant amount of cash.  We've actually built up a fair amount of equity in all these aircraft and, in particular, in the engines. \nAndrew Didora : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, Jonathan, you mentioned about 150 more pilots you need to reach kind of the United's targeted utilization rate next year. I guess, like what are the milestones needed? Or like what are some of the things we should be on the lookout for or goals that you have from a pilot perspective, just to give us more confidence as we move through fiscal '24 that you're on track for meeting this goal? \nJonathan Ornstein : Yes, Andrew, look, I can't even begin to tell you how frustrating the fact that Mesa's numbers are where they are. And we are, in fact, flying utilization at the same levels as other carriers, the other operators of large regional jets. So that, in itself, is frustrating. But we need 150 pilots, which again, just seems that 150 pilots is 150 people that we need to find. Now obviously, we have the issue of retention, and we do lose captains, obviously, as we go.  We actually lost a little bit more than we had anticipated earlier. But that was just due to an issue with Aviate, which has since been resolved. And I think that we're going to have to rely on bringing in some of the direct-entry captains, although you can count the number on one hand how many we need per month to make these numbers.  And then we absolutely need to ensure that our first officers who are coming up for upgrade are capable and able to upgrade, which we're putting a lot of energy into that as well, so that we have qualified people. Because the fact of the matter is, we're not going to upgrade anyone who's not capable. So I think that that's probably the biggest area is just, once we get the Aviate program kicking in where pilots will be required to upgrade, I think all that helps, which is why we feel confident that we can get to that number once we have the benefit of that as well.  So between those three, just the natural upgrade of people who would be coming along, the Aviate program kicking in requiring people to upgrade and the direct-entry captain positions should give us enough oomph, assuming attrition levels stay where they are, that we should be okay. As I mentioned, we've actually reduced the number of FOs that we hire pretty significantly as everyone else has. And now we're focusing strictly on direct-entry captains or high time FOs in terms of our new hires.  Anything else, Mike? \nMichael Lotz : No, I think, Andrew, just as far as gauging where we are, we'll know each quarter based on how many block hours we're flying because our partners aren't holding us back on pilot block hours. \nJonathan Ornstein : Yes. I mean, initially, we would have probably hoped to have been a little more aggressive on the CRJ. But obviously, with everything going on in the industry, the majors are a little reticent. The delays and cancellations get a lot of attention from the government and from the press. So I think they were a little conservative, which is understandable.  But I think now that we've proven that these aircraft can fly reliably, I think there's more room in the CRJ schedule, for example, which would help significantly.  The one thing that I will tell you that both United and Mesa underestimated was the sensitivity to our numbers based on just a few aircraft flying. So I think that as we get that resolved and future schedule changes are already addressing that, I think we'll be in far better shape just with the existing crew staff that we have, and that's without increasing any numbers. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. \nMichael Linenberg : Jonathan, just getting back to that target block-hour number for United by the end of next year, I think you or Torque mentioned 4% to 6% per quarter. Now is that a year-over-year number? Or is that sequential from where we are today on a block-hour production basis? \nJonathan Ornstein : Sequential. \nMichael Linenberg : Okay. And then with respect to with your first officers, and I want to go back and just kind of touch on the point that you made that you have the ability to upgrade pilots to captains, I think, unlike your competitors. And you talked about they get to -- or they're scheduled for an upgrade. I think at a lot of carriers, it's on a voluntary basis. Do you see a falloff or high attrition in first officers when they get to that point where they're supposed to upgrade to captain, where they elect to not become a junior captain, and decide at that point in time to break from the company and maybe go elsewhere? Is that a potential breakpoint? Or is that an issue that you've been seeing? \nJonathan Ornstein : No, we haven't really seen it. The numbers are not that big, so it would be hard to really put a finger on it. But I don't think we have people saying, \"Oh, gee, I'm going to be forced to upgrade. I need to go somewhere else.\" Because most of those folks -- remember, 85% of our pilots are in Aviate. They do not want to leave Aviate just because they may have to upgrade.  And we work with people, but I think the fact of the matter is, no, it hasn't been a problem. And again, once the Aviate requirement kicks in entirely, we clearly -- I firmly believe this issue will go away.  The problem also, to be frank, we created ourselves, because the first officer pay went up so much, I have FOs coming up to the airport saying, \"Gee whiz, I've never even dreamed of making this much money.\" And the fact of the matter is being an FO is, in itself, not a bad job. I mean our pay for starting FOs is $100 an hour. So I think we created a little bit ourselves, maybe the differential should have been greater between FO and captains. But it is what it is, and we'll deal with it.  I do think that United making the change in Aviate will be what will really make things work as well as the fact that all the new people coming in are well aware of what's going on, and I think that will help us down the road as these folks are put in a position to upgrade. \nMichael Linenberg : Okay. And then just the last one, just on completion factor. Clearly, you look at the difference between your controllable completion factor and your total completion factor. And I just -- you look at the daily data. And the fact is you can see that your partners, in this case, your partner, in many cases, are telling you that you have to cancel, right, that they're going to dispatch, I don't know, the flight to London rather than a flight to Presque Isle, Maine.  What sort of financial impact, though, is that having on you? You're doing well on a completion basis, at least on a controllable completion basis, but it's got to put airplanes and crews out of sync, and it's got to have some sort of cost. Is that a margin point or 2 where you're getting hit every quarter because you're being told to stand down and not cancel the flight by your partner? \nJonathan Ornstein : Yes, I think the bigger issue is not the day-to-day cancels that we have. And look, I mean, we all had operational issues. The transition could have gone a little bit smoother. There was a little bit -- there was a point in time when I think some aircraft will probably move too quickly out of Dallas to Houston. I think those kinds of things probably were more of it.  The bigger issue that we have is just being able to fly to crew max. We're doing -- we're flying to crew max on the E-Jets right now, but I think we could fly to crew max on the CRJs. And I think if we have scheduled this E-Jets more efficiently, we could create spare aircraft just by putting more hours per shell on each aircraft, and that would ultimately then create more spares.  So I think that there are solutions to this that, working with United, we're able to do. I don't think the problem is the day-to-day cancellations. It's just the planned block hours. Those numbers have to go up. And as you can imagine, United has been fairly conservative given all the attention that completion rate and on-time performance has been given by the government officials as well as the press right now. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. \nSavanthi Syth : Just two quick ones based on the questions so far. Just do you have kind of a target you can give us for cash or something like that, maybe cash and debt, when all of this is done? I appreciate the kind of the fiscal year-end debt level that you gave. But given that a lot of the sales are happening by kind of calendar year, I was wondering if you can give a little bit of color of where this all ends as you get through some of those sales. And if I might, just also, what was the revenue mix of kind of cargo and lease in this quarter now that most of it is focused on United flying? \nMichael Lotz : Well, on the revenue piece, I think the United portion is going to be like 97%, and the cargo will be 2% or 3% on debt distribution. As far as cash, we don't have any -- we're not putting out any projections. It's really going to be highly dependent on not only the sales of most of these surplus assets, but the timing of them. Obviously, the quicker we can get rid of some of these 900 assets, the more benefit will be to us. So we're just not putting any long-term projections on cash right now.  And it will be highly dependent on when we sell these surplus 900 assets that we have, aircraft engines, parts, whatnot. \nJonathan Ornstein : Yes. And even when we close on the aircraft that we're already contracted for, I mean, that is not an insignificant number in itself. \nSavanthi Syth : Is there a certain target you want to kind of keep cash at that you don't want to kind of go below? \nJonathan Ornstein : I'd say our target is as much as possible, but I'm trying to think what -- Mike, do you have any idea where are we -- I think -- let me answer that. Obviously, we're in constant discussions with United. United is well aware of the situation. We had Board participation for the first time with United at its last Board meeting, which I thought was incredibly productive. I think that we all understand that the problem needs to get solved, and that it's going to take cooperation from United to do that, which they have made it incredibly clear that they intend to do, that Mesa is an important part of the family. We are certainly part of the balancing of all the equipment.  I mean, if you look at it, the two other operators of large regional jets operate about the same number of aircraft that we do. We actually operate a little more than one of them. So I think that United understands that and knows what needs to be done to help get this fixed, and we'll do what it takes to ensure that our cash balances are at an adequate level that we can operate the business without being what I would call cash strapped. We do operate a little bit differently than the other operators in terms of cash. We've historically done that.  But nonetheless, I think we all feel that we need a healthy balance in order to operate the business on a day-to-day basis at the level that United requires us to do. \nOperator: I'm showing no other questions at this time. \nJonathan Ornstein : Okay. Well, let me just wrap up in conclusion. Again, we're not particularly pleased with these numbers. We know that things have to change. I mean the good news is that we feel we have a very strong partner to help make that happen with us.  They've been very supportive, will continue to be supportive. We didn't mention much about the cargo business, but the cargo business has actually been consistent, steady this quarter. I think there could be opportunities down the road in terms of cargo. But nonetheless, our focus has been primarily just on -- continues to be on the whole pilot situation.  And I think it goes without saying that if things were different in terms of regulation, none of this would be happening right now. And I think at this point, all we're doing is focusing on getting through this bubble to the point where we can get back up to the target utilization which -- by the way, I think it's fair to add that target utilization is actually below where we had been operating in the past and that our financial results will reflect numbers that, in the past, we were able to achieve even at lower utilization rates than we were.  So I think that the targets are doable. I think we have the means in place. And most importantly, I think we have the support that we need from United to make all this happen.  So thank you very much. We will talk to you next quarter. We appreciate your time. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time, and thank you for joining."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-05-09 22:17:08", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Mesa Airlines' Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Doug Cooper, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Cooper, you may now begin.\nDoug Cooper: Thank you, Brad, and welcome everyone to Mesa's earnings conference call for its fiscal second quarter 2023 ended March 31. On the call with me today are Jonathan Ornstein, Mesa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Lotz, President; and Torque Zubeck, Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the management team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for the sell-side analysts. We also want to remind everyone on the call that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the Company's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our fiscal second quarter earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. With that, I will turn it over to Jonathan for his opening remarks. Jonathan?\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Doug, and thanks everyone for joining us today. As we mentioned before, fiscal year 2023 is a transition year and our numbers reflect that. With that said, our results were largely in line with our internal expectations as we execute the transition of our CRJ-900 flying to United Airlines. In addition to the transition, we are still continuing to ramp up our more profitable E-Jet flying. While we are experiencing significant improvement of pilot retention and output, this quarter, our E-Jet utilization was still under six hours. Turning to the transition. We currently have 24 of the 28 plan CRJ-900s in service, albeit at lower block hours than initially anticipated due to a more conservative approach taken by United. I'd like to thank all of the hardworking people at Mesa who have helped make this transition happen and United for their support. While we continue to see strong demand for regional flying and our pilot pipeline has recovered significantly, our focus over the past several months has been on ensuring the United transition and the numerous actions we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet are executed successfully.  I want to take a moment to highlight the cornerstones of our plan moving forward. First and foremost, we have a strong relationship with United Airlines, which is as we work through the transition has been supported both operationally and financially. We are now flying 20 of the CRJ-900 with United. As we return to normalize operations and flying higher block hours, there maybe an opportunity to restore some regional jet service in neglected smaller and rural markets nationwide. Three quarters of these markets have seen service reductions in recent years with the average reduction eliminating 30% of flights in a given market. This deficit is magnified by the fact that regional flight service accounts for 50% or more of the total air service in 29 U.S. states and accounts for over 75% of service in 11. That's per the Regional Airline Association. Our new CPA with United contemplates addition of over a 100 daily regional jet flights across the country, representing a solid step for the regional airline industry. Unfortunately, without legislative action to counter the significant negative impact of the 1,500 hour rule, we are still concerned about the long-term future of regional aviation service to rural America. Further to our mission to improve mobility, reduce congestion and decarbonize travel, we remain excited about the potential of our previously announced co-investments with United on new technology and electric aircraft, including Archer and Heart Aerospace. We believe eVTOL and short distance electric aviation will be integral to addressing transit needs in smaller and congested communities moving forward. While the current pilot shortage continues and needs to be addressed industry-wide through legislative action, the current industry bottleneck is now ensuring in adequate number of qualified First Officers to upgrade to Captain. As a result of United's new AVA program requiring that candidates have flown as Captains for two years as well as our pilot labor agreement, we believe we have a sufficient number of First Officers to fill our Captain requirements going forward. Without Captain upgrades, most airlines find themselves with an imbalance of First Officer and captains, and as a result have paused hiring First Officers. This is just another downside created by the 1,500 hour rule. With that said, we have positioned ourselves to rebuild our pilot pipeline and now have three significant pilot initiatives in place. Again, with the support of United, Mesa offers an industry-leading pilot pay scale. This has been a major benefit for retention as fewer pilots are leaving to go to other carriers, most notably national and low-cost carriers, which in the past may have offered higher wages. Our participation in United's AVA program, which is one of the most rapid paths for pilots to join the regional industry and transition to a major airline has proven successful in attracting and retaining pilots. Mesa pilots are afforded an opportunity to transition to United within four years. Lastly, the Mesa Pilot Development program, which was launched in September in Inverness, Florida, is one of the fastest and most cost creative paths for pilots short of the 1,500 hour threshold to accumulate hours. This program has already graduated a cadre of 11 pilots to Mesa training and has had so many enrollers that we are now preparing to launch a second location in Arizona. To support this expansion, we have taken delivery of four more Pipistrel Alpha Trainer 2 aircraft with 21 more on the way. Finally, as you may know, Mike Lotz, who has previously served as Chief Operating Officer at Mesa and Virgin Express is stepping in and taking on expanded responsibilities. Mike continues his role as President and will be overseeing all of Mesa's operating groups following the retirement of Brad Rich. With that, I'll turn the call over to him. Mike?\nMichael Lotz: Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying how excited I am with my expanded role overseeing the day-to-day operations of the company. In my 25 years as President at Mesa, I've also previously served in the COO and CFO roles and have been involved in all aspects of our business and particularly our relationship with United. Working through this transition, optimizing pilot output, providing exceptional operational performance for United and DHL, all while operating at the highest level of safety will be my primary focus. Transitioning to CRJ-900s from American to United has been a major project for the company. Although we are keeping both Phoenix and Dallas's crew and maintenance bases, our entire network has been transformed. Our Houston hub has increased from 55 to 95 flights per day. As you may or may not know, United has never operated the CRJ-900 in their regional fleet. So everything from seat maps to jetway staging, ground handling procedures and fueling are all new to the United operation. Given these aircraft, they are flying to 30 cities in the network. This transition entailed a lot of preparation and work. We painted 28 aircraft and repositioned our maintenance parts and ground equipment. This was not just a simple swap of aircraft from one operator to another. We appreciate the support we received from United during the transition. Ultimately, the real benefit of the transition is that Mesa is able to provide United with 100 additional large, 76 regional jet flights every day. Upon our completion of the transition to United, our contracted regional fleet will consist of 80 large regional jets, comprising a mix of E-175s and CRJ-900s. Our plan is to add back the underutilized E-Jets as fast as possible. Additionally, we will continue to operate four 737, 400s and 800s at DHL. While our fleet utilization in the past two years has been impacted by the industry-wide pilot shortage, as Jonathan mentioned, we are now seeing attrition below pre-pandemic level, and thanks to the number of initiatives we have implemented. Mesa continues to be a top destination for pilots. It's especially worth noting that recent pilot turnover is larger result of pilot retirement or transfers to United as part of the AVA program. Nonetheless, we are maintaining our focus on attraction and retention in our pilot pipeline. We currently have almost 1,600 new hire applicants and combined with the Mesa Pilot Development program, we have confidence in our ongoing ability to keep our classes filled with a combination of new hires and Captain upgrades. We are continuing to focus on optimizing pilot training throughput, and also have access to an additional sim if needed. With that said, in the March quarter, we flew 48,186 block hours, a 5% decrease from the December quarter. I would like to point out that our billed block hours for the March quarter were actually 51,660. We expect our June quarter block hours will be approximately 46,000, a 4 percentage reduction from the hours in our March quarter. The reductions for both periods are primarily attributable to the CRJ-900s being transitioned out of America \u2013 out of America and as well as the First Officer Captain imbalance. Looking forward to the September quarter block hour should be closer to 55,000 as a result of the transition being completed and the benefits of our Captain upgrade actions. We expect subsequent quarters to continue to improve, but will not be providing projections for the next fiscal year at this time. As a final point, I'd like to reiterate that during the quarter, Mesa incorporated a new 737-800 freighter to our DHL operation. This brings our total cargo fleet to three 737-400s and one next-gen 737-800. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Torque to walk through our financial performance.\nTorque Zubeck: Thank you, Mike. Now I'll take this opportunity to review our financial performance and our balance sheet. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 revenue was $121.8 million, 1.1% lower compared to $123.2 million in Q2 2022, while contract revenue fell by $8.2 million year-over-year. These decreases were driven by recognition of deferred revenue and lower block hours, partially offset by higher United block hour rates for new pay scales. The decrease in contract revenue is partially offset by an increase in pass-through revenue of $6.8 million, driven by pass-through maintenance revenue and pass-through property taxes. Mesa's Q2 2023 results include per GAAP, the deferral of $5.7 million of revenue versus the recognition of $0.8 million of previously deferred revenue of Q2 2022. The remaining deferred revenue balance of $24.5 million will be recognized as flights are completed over the remaining term of the United contract. On the expense side, Mesa's overall GAAP operating expenses for Q2 2023 were $148.7 million, down $19.3 million versus Q2 2022. This decrease was primarily due to $22.7 million lower non-cash impairment of assets held for sale versus Q2 2022. Aircraft rent also fell by $8.6 million attributable to the reclassification from operating lease to finance lease for certain CRJ-900s, and depreciation and amortization expense fell by $4.2 million, primarily driven by the lower depreciable base from the CRJ-900 asset impairment charge in Q4 2022. Maintenance expense fell $1.4 million this quarter versus Q2 2022, driven by lower expenses for seat checks and parts partially offset by an increase in pass-through maintenance. We expect maintenance expenses to be roughly consistent at this level for the next three to four quarters. The decrease in GAAP operating expenses was partially offset by higher flight operations expense of $54.8 million, $12.4 million higher year-over-year, reflecting higher pilot pay scales and increased training costs as we continue to drive pilot throughput. General and administrative expenses were also $5.7 million higher versus Q2 2022, driven primarily by higher pass-through property tax costs and we expect G&A will be consistent for this level for the next three to four quarters ahead. Total adjusted operating expenses excluding one-time items were $132 million, an increase of $2.7 million compared to the prior year. On the bottom line, we reported a net loss of $35.1 million or a loss of 88% per diluted share compared to a net loss of $42.8 million or a net loss of $1.19 per diluted share for Q2 2022. Now, on an adjusted basis, Mesa reported a loss of $21.3 million or a loss of $0.53 per share compared to a net loss of $10.3 million or a loss of $0.29 per share a year-ago. The adjusted loss for Q2 2023 excludes a $2.1 million gain on investments and $0.5 million gain on a disposable of fixed assets. It also excludes $16.7 million of asset impairments and another $0.7 million from a deferred financing write-off for the sale of assets. Adjusted results from Q2 2022 excluded $39.8 million of asset impairment charges and a $2.3 million loss on investments. Next, let me turn to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we closed on the sale of four of the 11 CRJ-900s agreed to be sold to a third-party. Mesa also sold to United the remaining eight CRJ-550s and 10 out of 30 engines previously agreed upon. Importantly, these transactions generated $35 million in cash and we paid down approximately $52 million in debt during the quarter. For the June quarter, we expect to close on the seven remaining CRJ-900s and 20 engines agreed to be sold, which together will generate approximately $33 million in cash and pay down $42 million in debt. Going forward, we still have excess CRJ-900s and are working to sell these aircraft. We recently entered into a letter of intent to sell an additional seven aircraft, which upon completion of the sale will pay off approximately $68 million of debt associated with these aircraft. Cash for the March quarter excluding restricted cash decreased by $4.6 million from the prior quarter ended December 31, 2022 to $51.4 million. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $608.7 million, down $77.9 million from the prior quarter. This included scheduled debt payments made during the quarter of $28 million and finance lease payments of $4.6 million. We have $44.7 million of scheduled principle payments remaining in 2023 and after the repayment of debt associated with asset sales, we expect the fiscal 2023 year-end debt of approximately $470 million. We expect to maintain cash at its current level or better through the end of the fiscal year. Given the transition at Mesa, we will not be providing more specific financial guidance at this time with block hours impacted by the transition as Mike indicated, we expect earnings for the June quarter to be similar to the March quarter. With that, I'd like to now turn it back over to Jonathan for closing remarks.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Torque. In summary, we've undertaken an important transition for Mesa. 2023 continues to be a year of transformation, and 2024 we will build on the foundation we are establishing in 2023, focusing on returning to normalized block hour utilization. We look forward to speaking with you over the coming quarters. At this point, operator, please open up the call as I'd be happy to field any questions that the analysts may have. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Before taking our first question, I would like to turn the call back over to Jonathan for brief remarks.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thanks, Brad. Before we take the first question, I just want to thank everyone for their patience as we experienced some technical difficulties with the publication of our earnings press release, forcing the delay of the call. We look forward to taking your questions now. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today will come from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate the color on the kind of the block hour progression here. I was curious along those lines. On the deferred revenue, do you kind of expect to book more deferred revenue here in the next kind of couple of quarters of the year or do we start to see that starting to reverse now?\nTorque Zubeck: Yes. Hey, Savi. This is Torque. The deferred revenue is associated with the recognition of revenue as we are flying more. So we'll see a little bit of that. But I don't have specific guidance for you right now.\nSavanthi Syth: Okay. But it shouldn't be deferred revenue. It should be, if anything, recognizing a little bit?\nTorque Zubeck: Right. A little bit just as the contract moves forward.\nSavanthi Syth: Makes sense. And then just a little bit on the \u2013 as we can address the pilot issue, looks like your block hours are stepping up. And I can appreciate not wanting to give a lot more color than the end of this fiscal year. But generally, what does that fourth quarter look like in terms of utilization? I'm just trying to appreciate how much more that kind of Torque, no pun intended there, but the model has in terms of being able to improve kind of pilot, captain levels and really start operating the fleet better?\nMichael Lotz: Yes. Savi, it's Mike. So in terms of utilization, I think, we gave guidance for 55,000 for the September quarter. I mean, with 80 aircraft, 72 lines. Even at 10.5 hours of utilization, we targeted to get that number up into the 65,000, 66,000 range. And that will probably take us a couple quarters to get there.\nSavanthi Syth: Okay. That's super helpful. All right. I'll get back on the queue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nShannon Doherty: Hi. This is actually Shannon Doherty on from Mike. Thanks for taking my question. I think in your opening remarks, you mentioned that the E-Jet utilization was still under the six hours, despite being below pre-pandemic levels of attrition. Can you just give us more color on what's happening here on keeping the utilization so low?\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. This is Jonathan. We had to spool up pilot training, which something that really \u2013 we moved as quickly as possible even just getting people through training takes three or four months. We got a second sim. We added instructors, ground instructors last month to give you an idea our attrition was around 15 pilots. That's the lowest it's been that, frankly, since any of us can remember. And we put out of IOE something over 50. Those are good numbers. I mean, when we go long close to 40 pilots a month, that's the equivalent of five aircraft. Now, there is the challenge about First Officers, most of the other regionals and in fact a lot of the national carriers are having trouble because they just don't have people who have enough time in a 121 aircraft to upgrade to Captain because of the acceleration and attrition that occurred earlier in the year. At Mesa, we're fortunate that as a result of the AVA program, as well as our labor agreement, which allows us to, we're able to move First Officers up to Captain and we don't think that will slow us down. And in fact, I think in this month, our Captain class is about 30 individuals. So it's just a matter of how fast we can spool up. There's really no mystery in terms of what it does to our numbers. I mean, clearly at six hours, we're not going to make money. We've got a bunch of aircraft parked. We are also continuing to hire and train CRJ pilots. We think we have an adequate number for the most part with what we have, but again, we're just going to continue to hire people and put as many people on and keep pushing up the utilization on the existing CRJ fleet. But clearly, the focus is going to be on the E-Jet. And again, between all these various programs, I do think barring some big spike in attrition, which seems to be coming less likely as things have slowed down a little bit. I think we're moving forward pretty well in terms of adding net pilots to our roster.\nShannon Doherty: Thanks, Jonathan. And just a quick follow-up on the profitability rate. So do you think that Mesa can once again return to mid-teen operating margins in the years to come? Or has the profitability bar been permanently lowered given the post-COVID issues that have disproportionately impacted both you guys and other regional airlines? What would it take for you guys to get back to pre-pandemic profitability levels after transformation? Like, do you need to engage with or re-engage with your airline partners or?\nJonathan Ornstein: No. I have to tell you, Mike and I, and Torque discussed this very subject to this morning because I really was \u2013 wonder what I would say in regard to that. It's something I wanted to address. I think our belief is that flying our aircraft, the existing aircraft without additional aircraft, but flying our aircraft, we believe that once we are at basically full steam, in other words, flying the aircraft north of 10, 10.5 hours a day, that we could achieve margins between 5% and 8%, consistently. Because there's so much leverage in that last hour, it's really pretty astounding and probably something maybe even we didn't understand going into this. But I think that we feel that it may take us \u2013 it could easily take us another year, but to get to that full run rate. But I think that at that point, looking at margins, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% is doable. And the question becomes, can we achieve that any sooner, just based on what happens in attrition and our ability to upgrade folks and bring people on Board. I will say that we now have, as we mentioned, I believe almost 1,700 applicants. We've got almost that equivalent amount lined up in the Mesa Pilot Development program. The real question is just the upgradeability of First Officers. United has helped tremendously in the AVA program by requiring Captains for the AVA program to graduate into the AVA program they had to have served as a Captain for two years and as well as our labor agreement and the support of our pilots that allows us to upgrade people. So I think that, we're going to work very hard to get to those numbers. I think also that there maybe some opportunities on the cost side once we get to sort of a steady state. I mean, to be frank, given everything that's happened, I think it's fair to say, and I think Mike would and Torque would agree that we have thrown a lot of money out there to sort of make this happen more rapidly. And I think once we get back to normal, I think we could take a closer look at how we might be able to fine tune the operation as well.\nShannon Doherty: Thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question will be from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavanthi Syth: Thank you. Maybe just quickly follow-up on \u2013 clarify on the first one, six to eight, you were talking about pre-tax margin, right, Jonathan?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes.\nSavanthi Syth: Yes. Makes sense. And just on the fleet side, you've done a lot of kind of monetizing the fleet, which is great and so I realize there's about 80 aircraft on the United fleet and then you have 20, maybe 20, 24 kind of CRJ-900s that you'll kind of keep open to fill in there until you can fully fly there. But with the sales, like how many CRJ-900s do you have then X whatever you're dedicating to United that you can maybe continue to monetize or place in your JV in Europe. What's the \u2013 once what you have kind of done is complete, like what's left over?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, I'll start and I'll let Mike and Torque. But I think our view now is that we're going to sell as many 900s as we can. We have the seven that we think we have a contract for. I think we're looking to packaging some of the additional 900s with parts which we have plentiful and engines, which are very valuable. There's a certain number that we need to operate the existing United agreement until such time as we can operate E-Jets. And I think, we're also obviously going to be looking at other opportunities for the aircraft. But I don't think at this point that we would slow down in terms of selling aircraft and starting to continue to pay down the government debt, which most of the aircraft are offsetting the government debt. And then we have RASPRO all of which, we are looking to wind down as quickly as possible. Do you want to add anything to that, Mike or Torque?\nMichael Lotz: No. I just think Savi that, look the capacity we have with the United is for 80 large regional jets. So right now the mix is maybe 30%, 970%, 175s. And look, our goal is to try to get as many E-Jets flying as quickly as possible that they're certainly more profitable for us. They're obviously newer aircraft compared to our very old 900 fleet. So it's just going to be, as that movement comes where the E-Jet start coming in and the 900s come out, that's where we'll look at opportunities to dispose of those assets and monetize any equity we have in them.\nSavanthi Syth: And just in terms of kind of trying to gauge kind of the revenue per block hour, I guess the kind of the best way for us to think about is kind of work backwards. Is that right? Like a mid to high single-digit margin and that's what you kind of get too. What I'm trying to understand is that, there's a fixed and a variable component, and I'm trying to understand how much of that current revenue for block hour is probably overstated because it's over or kind of lower block hour production?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. And look, it's difficult to forecast that because of the mix of the fleet between aircraft that we may own and aircraft that United owns, or in certain cases DHL. So that's a difficult number to nail when you have that kind of a mix. Yes. I think what Mike is saying is just not linear because on some aircraft, we're making either the lease payment or the ownership payment and others are partners are, so it's just not linear.\nSavanthi Syth: Makes sense. And maybe if I can just ask just one last, kind of taking a step back on this kind of the regional front, just any kind of thoughts now that you're seeing a little bit of settling on the pilot side and maybe light at the end of the tunnel through this kind of period. Just your view on the regional airline market here in the next kind of three years or so?\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. I mean, look a lot of folks were concerned about the differential that existed between the majors and the regionals in terms of cost benefits. When we've looked at it, even with the new wages that cost benefit, there's still a significant delta between the costs. So I think from a macro perspective, the regional business, it still has good legs and I think still makes sense. And there are just cities out there that are just going to be too small or are just served better with multiple departures into hubs that I think will require regional jet service. Am I concerned that over time, if cost levels continue to escalate, is there a point where the aircraft doesn't work? I'm sure that point does exist. But between fair levels increasing, demand being strong and the importance to the network for United in particular, the feed traffic has lots of value. So I don't see a situation where the regional industry just sort of goes away at this point. Because I think all three of those things are to our benefit. I think that it's still going to take innovation. There's going to \u2013 and there is innovation out there and I think that that will continue. But I think for the basic fleet of aircraft that we operate, they're going to be in service for quite some time. And I think we're pretty safe on that. As the costs may have gone up, but they've also gone up at the major level and their cities that are just going to stay on the map regardless.\nSavanthi Syth: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: And at this time, we have no further questions, gentlemen.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Well, thank you very much everyone. I know that this is obviously a tough quarter. We have ways to go. United has been extremely supportive in terms of helping us through this. As you know, we have begun a good process to liquidate assets that we have are surplus to our requirements. And we have been getting surprisingly in good prices doing that and allowing us to pay down a significant number of debt. Again, on the pilot side, we've made what I consider to be remarkable progress. Certainly surprised me that the attrition levels are down to this and this has been sort of the second or third month where we've seen attrition levels much, much lower and our output on training, while it took us a while to get there, there's no doubt longer than we had hoped or anticipated. But we're now at levels where we're beginning to put out real numbers. And when you combine that with the lower people leaving, I think, we could see some things really starting to turn. But I don't want to underestimate that it's going to take time. But clearly, we have modeled this enough to know that if we can fly the aircraft between that magic 10 and 11 hours, this operation will be profitable going forward. I think that United is also very much determined to see that happen. They would like us to be healthy, they rely on us, and I think that they put a lot of energy into helping us get to that point. So we'll continue to plug along and hopefully next quarter, we'll talk to you again, and we continue to appreciate your support. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 1, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-02-09 21:56:08", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Mesa Airlines' Q1 Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Doug Cooper, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Cooper, you may now begin.\nDoug Cooper: Thank you, Christina and welcome everyone to Mesa's earnings conference call for its fiscal first quarter 2023 ended December 31st, 2022. On the call with me today are Jonathan Ornstein, Mesa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Rich, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Lotz, President; Torque Zubeck, Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the management team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for the sell-side analysts. We also want to remind everyone on the call today that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our fiscal first quarter earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-Admeasures. With that, I will turn the call over to Jonathan for his opening remarks. Jonathan?\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Doug, and thank you everyone for being on with us today. We're pleased to be speaking to you again after introducing several major developments at Mesa on our fourth quarter call six weeks ago. As you may know, we had a busy December quarter, negotiating and finalizing significant agreements with our airline partners and other key financial parties. We expect these new agreements will substantially enhance our operational performance and both our income statement and balance sheet. Since our last call, we have been working diligently as we prepare to wind down our loss-making operation with American Airlines and transition our CRJ-900 flying to United Airlines next month. For the quarter, we had an adjusted net loss of $4.3 million on revenue of $147.2 million. While traffic remained strong and our pilot pipeline has improved significantly, capacity remains constrained as we catchup with unprecedented attrition experienced as a result of the industry-wide pilot shortage. Here's a quick overview of what we have recently accomplished. First and foremost, we eliminated our loss-making operation at American Airlines effective April 3rd, 2023. Pursuant to that wind down, United agreed to add up to 40 CRJ-900s previously operated for American. To improve our balance sheet, we sold our remaining 8 CRJ-550s and agreed to sell down 11 CRJ-900s and 30 GE engines, reducing approximately $90 million of debt and generating approximately $70 million of cash. Additionally, United replaced our $16 million balance on our revolving credit line and provide an additional $25 million loan. We also restructured our RASPRO leases and EDC debt. Finally, we implemented new pay scales with our pilots and a new agreement with our flight attendants. Looking forward, the current quarter is all about a successful transition. Working closely with United, we intend to keep all the related crew domiciles and maintenance bases open. With our significant focus on operations, we believe the new United 900 flying will perform at levels similar to our existing E-Jet flying at United. In some good news on the pilot front, we continue to see strong levels of applications and reduced attrition. Currently, our monthly pilot attrition declined and has now stabilized approximately near pre-COVID levels. This week, we announced a direct entry captain position for qualified candidates. Highlights of the program include a 24-month flow to United Airlines and an industry-leading $110,000 sign-on bonus. Combined with our industry-leading pay rates, we believe this may be the best opportunity in the history of regional aviation for pilots to advance their careers. We are continuing to focus on pilot training, throughput, and have increased our resources around it. Brad will get into more detail on this later on. Last fall, we officially launched our Mesa Pilot Development or MPD program and recently welcomed our first graduates to the Mesa regional pilot ranks. As our -- with our significantly increased pay scale and participation in United Aviate program as well as our expanding training pipeline provided by MPD program and our new direct entry captain program, we believe Mesa provides a reliable and rapid path for pilots to join the regional industry and transition to United Airlines. We are pleased to be within the United ecosystem and are committed to training, retaining, and promoting pilots through to United. I'm also pleased to announce that we are adding a 737-800 freighter to our DHL operation. We have taken delivery of the aircraft and expect it to enter service in March. This brings our total cargo fleet to three 737-400s and one next-gen 737-800. At this point, I'd like to turn to highlights from the past few months that speak to the leadership position that Mesa is building in the future of regional aviation and the greater sustainability that we hope to help enable the industry in years ahead. The two electric flight partnerships we invested in with United, Archer and Heart recently achieved significant milestones. Archer unveiled its new five-seat eVTOL titled Midnight in November. Midnight is set to provide a sustainable form of aviation that can service short distance trips between regional airports and city centers. Heart Aerospace also continued to make progress, meaning a number of milestones and garnering additional commercial aircraft orders. We believe Mesa is the vanguard of innovation in eco-friendly electric aviation and will continue to assess opportunities going forward. Meanwhile, our European joint venture, FLYHT [ph], is on track to complete its operating certificate this spring, while initially operate regional jets, we believe FLYHT could also be a platform for us to expand new technology and eco-friendly flying in environmentally sensitive European markets. With that, I will hand it over to Brad Rich to go over more of the details of our operational performance this quarter.\nBrad Rich: Thank you, Jonathan and good afternoon to everyone. I'd like to start by reviewing our quarterly operating results. In the December quarter, we flew 50,940 block hours, 9.6% below last quarter, roughly in line with our previous forecast. Our March quarter block hours are projected to be roughly flat versus the December quarter. Mesa, like many regional airlines, continues to contend with the challenges of the industry-wide pilot shortage on our block hour production. However, we finally have a line of sight to relief. As Jonathan mentioned, attrition has come down materially over the past few months, and our classes are filled with a combination of new hires and captain upgrades. Pilot production remains our highest priority. We continue to increase our in-house training capacity from the additional CRJ and E-Jet instructors that we have hired. We have also contracted with CAE to provide both instructors and more sim capacity this year. We remain focused on our transition to United and are continuing to work closely with their teams to prepare facilities, crews and maintenance efforts for CRJ-900 flying. The rollout that we outlined on last quarter's call remains unchanged. We expect to operate our current 24 lines of flying with American through February 28th before reducing flights throughout March and ceasing American operations on April 3rd. We will begin operating CRJ-900s for United on March 3rd and will transition all the flying by May. As previously mentioned, United is covering the expenses to reconfigure and rebrand the CRJ-900 aircraft. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Torque to walk through our financial performance.\nTorque Zubeck: Thank you, Brad. I'll take this opportunity now to review our financial performance and our balance sheet. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, revenue was $147.2 million, relatively flat compared to $147.8 million in Q1 2022. Contract revenues fell by $8.4 million year-over-year, driven primarily by lower block hours, partially offset by increased block hour revenue for our new pilot pay scale. Pass-through and other revenue increased by $7.9 million, primarily due to E-Jet maintenance, faster revenue and deferred revenue. Mesa's Q1 2023 results include, per GAAP, the recognition of $5.3 million of previously deferred revenue versus the recognition of $4.2 million in Q1 2022. The remaining deferred revenue balance of $18.8 million will be recognized as flights are completed over the remaining terms of the contract. On the expense side, Mesa's overall operating expenses for Q1 2023 were $144.7 million, down $7 million versus Q1 2022. This decrease was driven by lower maintenance expense, which fell $10.7 million or 18.1%versus Q1 2022 to $48.3 million. It's primarily due to fewer seat checks than in the first quarter last year as well as lower aircraft rent, which fell by $5.5 million and depreciation and amortization expense, which fell by $5.8 million. The decline in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to reduced asset values as a result of assets held for sale and year-end impairments. These factors were partially offset by higher flat operational expense of $10.7 million due to increased training costs and the implementation of higher pilot pay scale as well as $3.7 million in intangible asset impairment. On the bottom-line, we reported a net loss of $9.1 million or $0.25 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $14.3 million or $0.40 per diluted share for Q1 2022. On an adjusted basis, Mesa reported a loss of $4.3 million or $0.12 per share compared to a net loss of $9.3 million or $0.26 per share a year ago. The adjusted loss of Q1 2023 excludes a $3.7 million impairment loss and another $1.7 million mark-to-market non-cash loss on our investments in equity securities. Adjusted results from Q1 2022 excludes a $6.5 million mark-to-market non-cash loss on our investments in equity securities. Next, let me turn to cash and liquidity. Cash for the quarter, excluding restricted cash, decreased by $1.6 million from the prior quarter ending September 30th, 2022, at $56.1 million, in line with the projection on our fourth quarter call. This amount excludes net proceeds from the sales that were not closed as of December period end, including our eight CRJ-550s, 11 900s, and the spared engines that Jonathan reviewed at the top of the call. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $701.3 million, up $86 million from the prior quarter. This amount includes $64.2 million corresponding to the GAAP reclassification from our operating lease to finance lease on 15 CRJ-900s. Additionally, we borrowed $25.5 million in the form of term loan from United, of which $15 million is forgivable upon the meeting of certain performance criteria. During the quarter, we also made scheduled debt payments of $17.5 million and finance lease payments of $3.5 million. As a reminder, we have $74 million of scheduled principal payments remaining in 2023 and after the repayment of debt associated with asset sales, we expect fiscal year 2023 year-end debt of approximately $535 million. This updated total from $435 million that we were expecting as of last quarter's call, primarily reflects the net impact of the reclassification of the RASPRO operating lease to a finance lease. With regard to fiscal full year 2023, given the ongoing major developments at Mesa that we will not be providing specific financial guidance at this time other than the block hours for the March quarter that was discussed by Brad earlier, and the total debt figure that I just mentioned. We would like to point out that this quarter had favorable adjustments of $7 million. Based on our transition with American, we expect our deferred revenue to decrease by $11 million next quarter. Additionally, given the United's equity stake in Mesa is 10%, our current share count is approximately 40 million. With that, I'd like to now turn it back over to Jonathan for closing remarks.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Torque. In summary, our first fiscal quarter of 2023 was a critically important one for Mesa and one in which we believe we achieved a lot and made significant progress. That said, we have a lot of work ahead of us. We continue to focus on pilot development in order to increase our block hour production first and foremost. At this point, please open up for additional questions that the analysts may have.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Go ahead please, your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Just as wondering, with this December quarter, you talked about losing about $5 million a month on the American contract. And in light of that, it seems like the earnings result is pretty good. Is that a function of some of that deferred revenues showing up? Or if this trend holds, why shouldn't we expect kind of profitability by kind of the June quarter?\nTorque Zubeck: Yes, hey Savi, this is Torque. Yes, we recognized a fair amount of deferred revenue just given the change in the contract term with American Airlines. That's the biggest change in the quarter.\nSavi Syth: Okay. So, kind of going forward, I should kind of consider the underlying ex that as the base going forward?\nTorque Zubeck: Not quite clear, Savi. Could you repeat?\nSavi Syth: Yes. So, just for the -- I guess, as we think about the core United earnings power here, should we think about it as take out the revenue recognition and maybe take out the $15 million in losses that will go away, and that's your core until you start building up your block hours? Is that how we should think about it?\nTorque Zubeck: Yes, we have some tail with American Airlines, expenses that are covered for the next upcoming quarter. But yes, if you defer the -- or eliminate the deferred revenue, then yes, that would be close to what we would expect moving forward.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And then if I might, on the pilot side, which is kind of good news. If kind of the attrition levels here hold at close to pre-pandemic levels, how long -- given your kind of increased trading throughput, how long do you think it will take to then be able to fly the full complement that you want to fly?\nJonathan Ornstein: Savi, this is Jonathan. It's really depend on, to some degree, the mix of aircraft. We are moving CRJs over. But I mean, I think our preference and United's preference should be to fly as many of the 175s as we can. And so we've got sort of two training pipelines going. I would suggest, depending on what you call maximum utilization, for example, if we could fly 11.5 hours, we'd probably be at the outside, call it, it could be as long as 18 months, and that would be conservative. However, in spite of the fact that we'd like to fly as much as possible, sometimes network is just not capable of getting that much time on every airplane. So, if we are around 10 hours, it could be probably 12 months, maybe a little better than that based on the current trends. But I do have to warrant everyone. I mean, these trends are very volatile. And we got a good jump with what we did in terms of the pay rates and some of the programs we put in place. We've got a really strong development program now with Mesa pilot development. But as you know, one of the problems that has been created by this legislation has been the fact that we've had this big attrition throughout the regional industry. And we're just running out of people to upgrade to captain and that is becoming an overwhelming issue where you're going to end up with trying to get people to 1,000 hours and get them to upgrade and not immediately get hired away by another carrier. Now, with the aviate program in place and with our pay structure, we think we will have addressed that to some degree. But there is definitely still a big log jam on the FOs that has been, again, another unforeseen consequence of this ill-conceived and ill-advised legislation.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Go ahead please, your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very operator and thanks for the time everybody this afternoon. So, just a couple of questions, and these are just kind of clarifying questions, Torque. On the investment loss in the quarter, can you just mention what that's related to? I mean there was a big improvement from September to December. And I'm just wondering how I should think about that from December to March?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. So Helane, this is one that I have been involved in, so I can answer quickly. If you want to be able to judge whether we're going to have investment gain or loss, you're just going to look at the price of Archer because that's really all it amounts to is just the price of Archer. We are currently long as part of our deal, about 2.2 million shares of Archer. We have more coming down the road. But that really -- and Torque, correct me, but I think that really is the entire mark-to-market is on Archer's stock.\nTorque Zubeck: Yes. That is correct.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then my other question is just, again, a clarification question as I -- and it's kind of what Savi asked, I think, just differently. As we think about the wind down of American, how am I thinking about the block hour, the revenue components? Is the increase that we saw from $10 million to $18 million because that's where the United reimbursements are showing up related to the pilots and the decrease from $137 million to $128 million is related to the block hour decline? I mean I know it means to be stupid, but obviously, I'm not getting it.\nJonathan Ornstein: So Helane, yeah, our block hours were down about 41% from the year-over-year piece. And so -- but our revenue was roughly flat. That's because we did get increase in -- for pilot pay from United as well as we had the deferred revenue that we recognized in the quarter. Those are the two big pieces that made the overall revenue about flat with last year. Does that help? So moving forward, we're obviously there's not a lot of deferred revenue to recognize that there'll be some that we'll recognize in other quarters. But moving forward, it will be -- we'll have compensation for the new pilot rates. But in this next quarter, we also -- we still have the American wind down that we aren't getting fully compensated for pilots in that just so you're aware.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks very much.\nJonathan Ornstein: You bet, Helane.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Go ahead, please, your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: Hey, everyone, good afternoon. Similar line of questioning to the revenues, but on the cost line, when we take a look at kind of cost per block hour in the quarter, it seems like kind of reset around $1,100 per block hour getting 20% step-up from where you were kind of trending in the back half of last year. Is this a good sort of run rate going forward, any one-timers in that number? I'm just trying to think of a baseline here given the new pilot pay and I know a lot more training costs?\nMichael Lotz: Hey, this is Mike Lotz. Hi, Andrew. I think the $1,100 is the only thing that would change down the road from that is that we are on the maintenance side, probably a little lower than we would be on a normal run rate just because of the timing, we hit a peak last year and then we're on the lower side of that. And then offsetting that, I think, is the pilot cost because we have so many pilots in training, and we're hoping that, that -- the attrition kind of levels out and we catch up, then the pilot per block hour would start to come down, certainly not to where it used to because of the pay scale difference. But those are, I think, the two items that we need to continue to look at.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. Got it. And then maybe Jonathan, what is the risk that the CRJ flying for United just gets pushed out a little bit just in terms of like who's doing the retrofits for the planes? Is the space already locked in for this type of work? Just curious what you think the risk is there?\nJonathan Ornstein: I think it's a fair question. I mean, it took a little time for us to come up with a LOPA that would work for everyone. We went back and forth a few times, just to try to keep it as simple as possible. But I think we're able to do that. Now my understanding is the conversion -- well, now the -- excuse me, I take that back, that there had been some discussion about changing the seats. But now we position that we always recommended was that we just have them remain at 76 seats. And so there won't be a change there. We're sprucing up the cabins, we're taking out a bunch of it. Brad, why don't you go, because you -- \nBrad Rich: Yeah. I mean, look, we don't expect any real delays or issues with the fleet itself. We've got a good transition plan. The plan is being executed. It involves, as Jonathan said, some refreshing of the cabin in some cases, not extensive, but I'd just call them more refreshes and then exterior paint. We've got all that lined out and scheduled, and I don't expect any delays relative to the fleet.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yeah, I think it's fair to say, and I think understandably that obviously, both American -- excuse me, United and Mesa, we're taking a reasonably cautious approach. We're not going to just throw 38 airplanes into service. I think we're going to just schedule them in overtime and just make sure that everything goes smoothly. And so far, the schedules that we've been receiving have been excellent, have been very productive. I think it's going to keep all of our pilots in place. We do plan on opening up a new base in Denver, which is going to be very popular with our crews. And so we think the transition will go well. And again, the biggest variable, and I hate to keep saying this, but it's just -- it's not going to be equipment, it's not going to be our maintenance capability. It really boils down to pilots and attrition and our ability to continue to put out a good number of pilots through our training program, which we have worked really hard on expanding. And I think we've done a decent job, and we're starting to see some of those results.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please, your mind is open.\nMichael Linenberg: Oh, yeah. Hey, a good afternoon, everyone. Jonathan, just the 38 CRJ-900s, how do we think about them sort of longer term? Are they more of a stop gap measure once you start to staff up the Embraers that are currently parked? Like if we were to fast forward two or three years from now, is it 38 CRJ-900s or is it maybe a dozen? Is it 20 or is it going to be a core fleet? I'm just sort of thinking about it within the context of some of the restrictions out there within your partners' contracts, et cetera?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yeah. No. Obviously, what will come into play here is the scope restrictions. And just to be clear, I mean, we are well within the scope. We're not going to -- that's not going to be an issue, obviously. But with that, I think the ultimate goal would be to us to operate all 80 of our E-Jets. So from that standpoint, there may not be room for 900s. Now that being said, there are a lot of other operators that may or may not be able to operate the 7060 aircraft that they have. There may be a way to consolidate a lot of the flying on to fewer shelves. So I think that the 900s may go to 70 seats and fill in. So I think the idea, and I feel pretty confident and I would agree on this is we have training capability, and we've got almost 300 pilots flying the 900s. We're not going to just turn around and tell them we don't need them anymore. I'm pretty sure we're on our way to keep everybody fully utilized. It's going to take a while for the industry to recover from this. And so I think there'll be room for those airplanes for a while. And I think for a while, I'm not saying for 10 years, but I would think that we'd be operating the airplanes in two years down the road. I don't think everyone will recover by then, and we'll still have room for those aircraft within the existing scope.\nMichael Linenberg: Jonathan, on that, on that mark, is it is it still true that the CRJ-900s are potentially the lowest cost 76 or 76 cedars in the market today, that those costs, as I recall, you really had a pretty meaningful advantage there historically, with the new pay rates is that still the case? And what is the differential in cost between maybe the E-175 with 76 seats and the CRJ-900 with 76 seats with the new LOPA? Is it a 10% better advantage on a block hour basis, 20%? Any color on that? Because as I recall, that was one of the unique competitive advantages of that shelf.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yeah. Well, look, the benefit on the 900s is clearly on fuel burn. It's about 8% more fuel effective, right? However, when you look at regional aircraft, and it's just so outsized that you have to take it into account, it really depends on where you are on your engines and what aircraft? I mean, you can normalize your engines, but the fact of the matter is there's probably aircraft out there that will come to an LLP event, which is up to almost $5 million event, and it just will never be done. And so if you take that expense out over the lifetime of the aircraft, that makes whatever aircraft it is going to be very inexpensive. So everything really revolves around engine management and how you look at owning engines or leasing engines. We had been five years ago, when I look back and clearly, given where we are, I don't think anyone would argue that we haven't made mistakes. But the one thing that we did do was make a lot investment in engines. And we just realized that these engines would be strong assets. And we went out and literally started buying every engine, we could get a hold of, use knew it didn't matter. I mean, we had 51 extra engines, and we just sold 30 to United, and we'll net somewhere between $50 million and $60 million net of the debt. And we still have another 21 engines that we own. So, I mean, I think that it really revolves around where you are in the engine cycle. But pound-for-pound, the 900 is definitely a more fuel efficient, faster, lower cost alternatives than Embraer 175. Now, that being said, on a shorter haul flight, it doesn't make as much of a difference. And there's no doubt that the get benefits of the cabin, on the 175 is, obviously is very attractive. And the major carriers have no problems putting 175 into very highly traveled business routes, shuttle markets, for example, that I don't think they would put a CRJ into. So, there is offsetting benefits that newer to the 175 in terms of passenger comfort, acceptance and the satisfaction.\nMichael Linenberg: And on that just last point, if I could just sneak in one more about capability, as I recall, that at least the CRJ-700, the capability that they had to go into some of the ski destinations, which is obviously a very important market for United. Can the CRJ-900 go into those same ski, you know, the mountain destinations in whether it's Aspen, for example, the ones where I don't think you can fly an E175, and an Aspen fully loaded. I could be wrong on that, too. But the CRJ-900 have that same capability or they just too heavy versus the 700?\nJonathan Ornstein : Well, you're right about the 175. There have been ongoing discussions regarding the 900s in terms of their capability, depending on who you ask, but I think our view here is that in all probability, the 900 would not work in places like Aspen or Telluride.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay.\nJonathan Ornstein : Just probably would not work.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for the time.\nJonathan Ornstein : Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James again. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth : Hey, thanks for the follow-up. I just wanted to kind of come back to that cargo announcement that you made that you have one more aircraft that you'll be flying there. I think the previously was that -- you had three aircraft, but maybe the third was a kind of a backup aircraft. And just if you can just provide an update on, what you think cargo blockers are going to be doing and how that program is progressing?\nJonathan Ornstein : Yes. So on the third aircraft is a 737-400. We haven't been particularly pleased with the aircraft and ongoing conversations with DHL to potentially replace that aircraft, maybe with a newer 800, and we're adding this 800, which I personally feel that it really puts us in a sweet spot with DHL. I was just on the phone with them today, they've been very complimentary about our operation. They actually made a comment about how our people have really worked well with their people. And it's just good to hear that there'll be opportunity. That being said, it's obviously taken a long time, and we've been patient. And given the downturn recently in cargo activity, it's probably going to be a little bit slower than we'd hoped for. But we are going to add the fourth airplane, we'll look to figure out what we're going to do with 708, which is the third 737, which came into service, but that aircraft was in fact flying a full line. So we will now move from three line full lines of flying to four full lines of flying. And Brad correct me if I'm wrong, but they do between like 100 and 120 hours a month, about 100, 120 hours a month in utilization. So you can work the math from that.\nSavi Syth : That's super helpful. And is that so -- is it still kind of a mildly profitable business would you say or is it kind of still you need more scale to really drive profits there?\nJonathan Ornstein : No, we were fortunate that like the other major carriers DHL appreciate the fact that things have been difficult and so we've made the transaction structured so that our feeling is on a run rate basis going forward. We've been at break, no worse than breakeven. And again, we put a lot of money into the operation to start. So, obviously, we have a way to go to recoup our investment. But we now in the 737 business, we have a nice cargo business. And I think that over time, particularly now that we have 800s on certificate, it could be an opportunity for us going forward to grow that business, as cargo recovers, because there's no doubt that things have slowed down right now.\nSavi Syth : It makes sense. And if I might on the European JV, any updates on that? I know, it's been six weeks probably not a lot new there, but just curious on how that's progressing.\nJonathan Ornstein : We're still working on getting the certificate finalized. And I think Mike you feel what we\u2019ve done in March?\nMichael Lotz: March or April.\nJonathan Ornstein : March or April. And then we looked at place a couple of regional jets out there, and we're talking to a number of carriers about operating those aircraft. I think the feeling that we have is, I mean, it's a very long-term project in that. We think that this could be a platform, for example, for us operate electric aircraft, which we think will be really in high demand in Europe, just given the direction things are going towards sort of environmentally friendly alternatives. And I think that we can continue to find a home for some of the regional jets out there that have been made excess sort of post COVID. And, particularly in the CRJ-900, or in Europe CRJ-1000, it's just a matter of finding the right customer to make that happen. So we continue to plug along, I think that we feel that it's just going to be good to have an operating certificate. And to be frank, I mean, the backstop always was just the fact that we have a certificate is valuable for what we have invested in it, we think we can easily get, frankly, a multiple of that back, if we wanted, if we just were going to sell the certificate. So we've always used -- utilize that method as a backstop. But we have wonderful partners over there, guys who have a tremendous amount of experience in Europe, who really is why we made the investment, because we had so much confidence in them. And I think, over time, we'll be as well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that will develop in Europe, in particularly, given the gaps that have now occurred as a result of so many bankruptcies in the regional business over there. And how it's -- the regional business is much different there than it is here in terms of a lot of small carriers flying multiple pieces of equipment, different types of equipment. I think that our approach will find some opportunity with some of the flag carriers to provide capacity purchase services over the long-term.\nSavi Syth : Sounds appreciate the insights.\nOperator: Speakers, I'm showing no further questions at this time. You may proceed.\nJonathan Ornstein : Okay, well, thank you, everybody. I think, it's fair to say that, we clearly had gone through a rough patch. We had a lot of work to do in terms of putting together multiple agreements all at the same time. We barely mentioned some of the things like the RASPRO agreement, the EDC agreement, obviously -- the Treasury, we made a significant modifications with Treasury, who by the way was very helpful. And now we just have to put it together operationally, we are very focused on pilot production since clearly, that makes a big, big difference. For the last couple of months, we've been on the plus side. In other words, we're putting out more pilots than we're losing. We want to see that number continue to increase. We've added, sims, we've added instructors, we've employed CAE. So I'm hoping, and I think we believe that over time, we'll start to see the benefit of all this, and it will all come together in terms of a much more stable operating platform, and renewed profitability. And also, it would be remiss not to mention the fact that through the wind down, we've been working very closely with American and maintain really good relationship with them. And I think that since we began to wind down, I think we've canceled two flights. We really want to do a good job right to the last day with American. We appreciate their understanding of our situation. And certainly, United is really stepped up and helped us and it's a good thing to know so many people that we have over there, the support that we've gotten from United has been fantastic. And we're on the phone with them literally on the phone every day. And I have to tell you, we've been really appreciative of what they were able to do to help us work through this difficult period. So with that, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us. We continue to work hard, get the company turned around, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: That will conclude today\u2019s conference. And we thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.  I would now like to turn the call over to Doug Cooper, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Cooper, you may now begin.\nDoug Cooper: Thank you, Ted, and welcome everyone to Mesa's Earnings Conference Call for its Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2022. On the call with me today are Jonathan Ornstein, Mesa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Rich, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Lotz, President; and Torque Zubeck, Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the management team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for the sell-side analysts. We also want to remind everyone on the call today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our fiscal fourth quarter earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures.  With that, I will turn it over to Jonathan for his opening remarks. Jonathan?\nJonathan Ornstein : Thank you, Doug, and thank you, everyone, for being with us today. Since we spoke on last quarter's results, several significant transactions have occurred at Mesa. Collectively, these new agreements transitioned our business from American Airlines to United, addressed the industry-wide pilot charge and its financial and operational impacts and created a much stronger liquidity position and balance sheet. Combined, these initiatives have transformed our business. Let's walk through what has been accomplished. As we announced on December 19, as a result of ongoing unprofitable operations due in part to utilization penalties and uncovered increases in our pilot wage structure, we initiated and finalized an agreement to wind down our contract with American Airlines by April 30, 2023. Unfortunately, while American initiated dramatic wage increases at their own subsidiaries, they were unwilling to reimburse Mesa for similar pay increases at our American Eagle operation, leaving us vulnerable to unprecedented pilot attrition. This led to an untenable situation and required us to take action. Fortunately, based on our strong relationship with United Airlines, combined with our consistent operational performance over many years, United took a different view and quickly stepped in to take over the American CRJ-900 flying. Given the industry-wide shortfall in regional jet block hours, United supported higher wages in both our E175 and CRJ-900 operations and intends to increase service to many of the smaller and rural cities that have lost flying due to the pilot shortage. As a result, on December 27, we finalized a new 5-year capacity purchase agreement with United that covers up to 38 of our CRJ-900s depending on the number of E175s we are operating. While there is a very clear business case for United's decision, this view was made possible because of a strong relationship that has developed between United and Mesa over the past 30 years. To ensure a smooth transition, our CRJ-900 crew and maintenance bases in Phoenix, Dallas, El Paso and Louisville will remain in place with an additional CRJ-900 crew base we had in Houston, along with a new pilot base in Denver to expand services to Western states. Other incremental crew bases will be potentially added. Mesa will continue to utilize all of its pilots and crews in the existing locations through the transition and beyond. In addition to these actions, our new pilot pay scale has had an immediate and significant impact on attrition as well as our ability to attract qualified candidates. We currently have approximately 400 pilots in our training pipeline. Concurrently, United is providing financial support to Mesa under two additional agreements that we also finalized on December 27. One to provide Mesa a new $41.2 million liquidity facility, of which $25.5 million will be additional liquidity and another to purchase 30 spare engines from Mesa for $80 million, generating over $50 million of net cash proceeds. As part of the transaction, United will also receive a 10% equity position in Mesa and a seat on the Mesa Board. We thank United for their support, and we look forward to capitalizing on the substantial demand for regional jet flying together. This is an important reversal of momentum for the regional airline industry as [Mesa and I] will work to restore service to neglected smaller and rural markets, 3/4 of which have seen service reductions in the past 3 years by adding over 100 daily regional jet flights to the United network. We look forward to leveraging our previously announced co-investments with United on new technology and electric aircraft to further address the needs in smaller and congested communities. Moreover, after the transition, Mesa will be the only exclusive regional carrier for United operating large regional jets. We believe our strong relationship with United will provide significant opportunities in the future as a preferred carrier. In particular, we believe Mesa's participation in the Aviate program, combined with United's industry-leading growth plan will provide the most reliable, fastest path for aviators to transition to a major commercial care. Once our operations are fully integrated with United, Mesa will be the most attractive career path in regional aviation for pilots as well as all of our other employee groups. In the quarter, we also signed a new 2-year agreement with our flight attendants. I would also like to note that our operation with DHL was unaffected by the American and United agreements, and we continue to maintain a strong relationship with DHL. Additionally, we have completed a number of transactions to strengthen our capital structure. In mid-December, we renegotiated improved terms and conditions with EDC, Export Development Bank Canada on debt associated with 7 next-gen CRJ-900 aircraft, reducing debt service by approximately $14 million from January 2023 to December 2024. The junior noteholder, Mitsubishi, has also agreed to forgive 50% of the outstanding note balance or approximately $4.2 million if the notes are fully repaid prior to December 31, 2023. Additionally, we negotiated an agreement with RASPRO, a Canadian special-purpose finance company on our leases of 15 CRJ-900 aircraft, which reduces the effect of purchase price at or prior to March 2024 lease termination by approximately $25 million. Concurrently, Mesa plans on closing on the sales of the remaining 8 CRJ-550s to United in January 2023; and 11 surplus CRJ-900s to a third party, resulting in net cash proceeds of $16.2 million. These sales are expected to reduce Mesa's U.S. treasury debt by approximately $65 million and reduce annual interest expense by approximately $4.5 million at current rates. With that, I will hand over to Brad Rich to go over more of the details of an update on our operational performance this quarter.\nBrad Rich : Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone. I'd like to start by reviewing our quarterly operating results. In the September quarter, we flew 56,533 block hours, 11% below the June 2022 quarter in line with our forecast on last quarter's call. Our December quarter block hours are projected to be 52,000, roughly 9% below the September quarter. For the March quarter, we are currently forecasting 53,000 block hours, a slight increase over the December quarter. Consistent with the challenges throughout the regional industry, our block hour production has been limited due to the pilot shortage. As mentioned previously, attrition has come down materially, and we are filling our classes into the future. Our pilot training production is a major focus, and we continue to expand our capabilities with an additional E-Jet simulator coming in the spring of 2023 and additional instructors in both the E-Jet and CRJ fleet. In addition to our own hiring, we have contracted with CAE to provide additional support for our training efforts. We are focusing on our transition out of American and working cooperatively with United in making preparations for facilities, crews and maintenance. We expect to operate our current American schedule through February 28 for approximately 24 lines of flying. From March 1 through April 3, we will reduce the schedule by 50%, and our operations with American will cease on April 3. Beginning March 1, we will begin operating 9 lines for United and expect to have 24 lines operating by May of 2023. As part of the transition agreement with United -- as part of the transition agreement, United will pay the expenses to reconfigure and rebrand the CRJ-900 aircraft. As we transition our CRJ-900 flying to United, we look forward to maintaining the same level of schedule integrity associated with our ERJ fleet.  With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Torque to walk through our financial performance.\nTorque Zubeck : Great. Thank you, Brad, and thank you to everyone on the call today for your patience as we work to release our quarterly and fiscal year results. As you can see, the delay was due to a number of transactions that were being finalized that meaningfully restructure our flying agreements as well as our debt and lease obligations. As Jonathan has already covered most of the transactions, I'd like to just touch on a few items and summarize our expectations. First, our performance in the fourth quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 was $125.6 million, a decrease of $5.1 million or a negative 3.9% from $130.8 million for Q4 2021. Our contract revenue fell by $5.3 million year-over-year. Pass-through and other revenue remained relatively flat to last year, rising 1% primarily due to pass-through maintenance expense. And as a reminder, the pass-through maintenance expense has no P&L impact. Mesa's Q4 '22 results include per GAAP, the deferral of $1.3 million versus the recognition of $1.3 million of previously deferred revenue in Q4 2021. The remaining deferred revenue balance of $24.1 million will be recognized as flights are completed over the remaining terms of the contract. On the expense side, means overall operating expenses for Q4 2022 were $266.8 million, up $141.1 million versus Q4 2021. This increase was driven by $132.3 million expense for impaired assets related to the American Asset Group, the relatively short duration of the remaining contract with American Airlines and the relative uncertainty around longer-term utilization of CRJ-900 fleet and supporting assets. General and administrative expenses of $12.4 million, primarily driven by a onetime tax adjustment of $7.1 million. Maintenance expenses continued at below normal levels as we passed the high number of engine overhauls and heavy C-checks that were deferred at the beginning of COVID. Maintenance costs was $45.9 million in Q4 2022, down $15.1 million or $24.8 million versus Q4 2021. On an adjusted basis, Mesa reported a pretax loss of $16.4 million for Q4 '22 compared to a pretax loss of $3.1 million for Q4 '21. The year-over-year decrease of $13.3 million was primarily due to lower block hour production and the net impact of the PSP program. It's important to note that the adjusted pretax loss for Q4 excludes $132.3 million impairment loss primarily related to the group of assets that are supporting the American CPA. Excluding this item, adjusted net loss is $13.5 million or $0.37 per share compared to a net loss of $2.1 million or $0.06 per share a year ago. And for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we reported a net loss of $115.6 million or $3.18 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $7.5 million or $0.21 per diluted share for Q4 2021. So let me turn to cash and liquidity. Cash for the quarter, excluding restricted cash, increased by $3.3 million from the prior quarter, June 30, 2022, to $57.7 million. Based on United funding the $25.5 million loan this week, our projected December 31 cash balance is $55 million. This includes any other proceeds from the sales that are not expected to close until the new calendar year. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $599.7 million, down $36.3 million from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we made scheduled debt payments of $42.9 million. Most importantly, combined, our sales transactions will reduce debt by $84 million by as early as March 2023. We also have $80 million of scheduled principal payments in 2023 resulting in projected end of fiscal year '23 debt of approximately $435 million. So looking to full year 2023, given the major developments at Mesa that we discussed today, we will not be providing specific financial guidance at this time other than the block hours that Brad discussed earlier. With that, I'd like to now turn it back over to Jonathan for closing remarks.\nJonathan Ornstein : Thank you, Torque. In summary, 2022 was a challenging year for the regional industry and for Mesa in particular. But we made many important strides in the past few months towards turning our business around. To recap, we reached major operational and financial agreements with United, we shed our loss-making business with American, we implemented a new pay scale for our employees and seized opportunity to shore up our balance sheet through significant reduction in debt and increases in cash. To end this call, I'd like to again thank United for its continued support over the past 3 decades as well as our other shareholders -- stakeholders, such as the U.S. Treasury Department, Export Development Canada, RASPRO and Mitsubishi as well as the assistance of Sidley Austin representing United and FTI representing Mesa. We are especially thankful for the efforts of all our employees towards helping us rebuild and optimize our operations, setting Mesa up for future success. At this point, operator, please open up the call as I'd like to field any questions that analysts may have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question we have in the queue is from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nShannon Doherty : This is actually Shannon Doherty on for Mike. Just a couple of quick ones here. How quickly can you guys stabilize the operation and transition from American to United? And once finalized, how many airplanes will be expected to fly to United in total?\nJonathan Ornstein : This is Jonathan. Our plan is to begin the transition basically in March and be done by April -- mid of April. And we're going to be operating the CRJ-900s for as long as we still have CRJ -- excuse me, the E-175 in the training cycle with pilots. We don't know when that will be finalized, but we do have 80 aircraft that would be in the American operation, and that's just -- excuse me, in the United operation, pardon me. And that would just be our first -- step 1 of the -- going forward in the relationship with United.\nShannon Doherty : That's helpful. And maybe Jonathan can you explain any implications that may exist due to scope limitations? From my understanding, United doesn't have any more room for 76 seaters in its fleet. So how are you exactly moving the synergies over without violating scope restriction.\nJonathan Ornstein : There's a misunderstanding there. I mean no one's going to violate a scope restriction. It's just that there are aircraft parked throughout the United system. Our own, for example, where there are aircraft that have been pulled out of the CPA and are not counted towards that scope. And that's due to the lack of pilots as a result of the pilot shortage. And we're just basically filling the breach as ourselves and others spool up those aircraft. And it's obviously taking time. Training is not something that happens in the short term. And that's why having these aircraft move over are very valuable to fill that gap that exists today.\nOperator: Our next question in the queue is from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth : Syth Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division \u2013 Airlines Analyst I was curious, I know you're not kind of giving commentary on earnings kind of guidance. But I was curious, as I -- thinking about both kind of earnings and then kind of cash flow. With this transition, how should we think about like what changes in the cadence that you saw here in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year versus what you'll see going forward? It seems like you're just basically replacing some of the American flying with United flying. So all those equal, should we see kind of a similar trend until you can get the pilot -- the captain supply up to levels where you can start increasing utilization?\nJonathan Ornstein : No. And I'll tell you why. I mean, primarily, a couple of things that have changed the dynamics at first. The United flying, I mean, obviously, there'll be a transition period but the United flying on a run rate basis will not lose money. I mean we're losing roughly $5 million a month in the American operation, which based on the numbers that we have and where we're going to get -- how we view the United contract will not be loss-making, will be, in fact, profitable. In addition, we are shedding quite a bit of debt through this process and just the savings alone of U.S. Treasury debt, I believe, is $5 million -- $6 million a year. That also obviously will help add both benefit cash flow and earnings. But I think it's fair to say that there is a transition period that's going to require some time, and there are training expenses, which are still extremely high, and it's going to take some time to work through that. But again, shedding the loss-making operations, like I said, which was about $5 million a month, is actually pretty significant. And remember that as part of the transaction, which really was the heart and soul of the transaction is that United has agreed to pay the same wage rates that we offered the -- that were offered at United throughout the system as well as to the American -- the former American pilots that will now be flying on behalf of United. I mean that is singularly the biggest reason that this deal moved forward the way it did, and we're just very pleased and thankful that United has seen obviously some value for themselves as well to see this additional flying being done as we head into March and the summer of 2023. So we are focusing solely on operational performance in terms of a successful transition. And moving forward, I think it's fair to say that we believe the numbers will take care of themselves.\nSavi Syth : I appreciate that color. That makes sense, Jonathan. And if I might, on the attrition side, you said you just kind of slowed down. This is a bit of a question on what your views are. And obviously, it's not something you'll see yet is you saw the Spirit TA that put a fairly big increase and now that would move kind of the pay rates again away from regional airline pay. Is there a risk that you'll start to see attrition pick up again after more ULCC start to reflect that level of pay? Or just any views on how the kind of the pilot dynamic moves forward in the industry?\nJonathan Ornstein : I absolutely think that there could be an impact. I think pilots are really good with numbers. And I think most of them will realize that the proposition that Mesa offers coming here with rates maybe a little bit lower than those new rates but with the ability to move on to United in a very short period of time. That's not just a crapshoot but actually part of their agreement that we will be moving people to United on a specific schedule. I think anyone that looks at that over the long term, particularly over the term of a career, there's no doubt that they are going to be far further ahead by coming to Mesa and transitioning to United. And I also think it's fair to say that there are strategic reasons why United does not want us to lose pilots to the ULCCs and does not feel that this should be a farm team for the ULCC. And frankly, we'll take action if in fact that becomes the future reality, I don't think that we would be sitting idly by and allowing that to happen. So United has acted very decisively in this particular circumstance. And I see no reason why they won't continue to act decisively to ensure that there's a pilot flow that goes from Mesa and into United. I mean, United has now literally the greatest growth plans in the history of commercial aviation. I heard that in the past, Ryanair has been one of the fastest-growing airlines and having some familiarity, what they did was remarkable. They put 52 airplanes on in 1 year. United is looking at years in the future of double that. So there is a big demand for pilots. I think United views Mesa as their farm team, and we intend to do everything we can to see that happen. And I don't think anyone intends to let the low-cost carriers get in the way of that. So we'll do what it takes. And I think United would be supportive of that.\nOperator: The next question in the queue is from Helane Becker with Cowen.\nHelane Becker : Just a couple of questions. So Mr. Jonathan, I noticed in the 10-K the auditors do not give you a qualified opinion. Is that just because of all the liquidity that's coming in and they are comfortable that there are no issues going forward?\nJonathan Ornstein : Yes. I think that the auditors looked at the breadth of the agreements that were put in place, whether it was the new flying agreement with United eliminating the losses, the pay down of the debt with the U.S. Treasury. The enhanced agreement that we had with the other lessors and debt credit or the debtors. I think a big part of it was undoubtedly the sale of 30 of our 51 engines for proceeds that will net over -- well, $50 million, we think is a conservative estimate and the pay down between the engines and the aircraft that will now finalize the sale with United in the 11 additional aircraft. I mean we're talking about a lot of debt coming off our balance sheet. And I think that, that -- all those things combined is why the going concern issue would go by the wayside because I think from their perspective, seeing what restructuring was done, I think, is pretty significant. And again, I can't overemphasize, we went on a very, very distinct path 5 or so years ago, where we decided that we were going to go into effectively the engine business and started buying engines. We own a lot of engines. Some of those engines are now paid off or close to being paid off. And as I said, we did sell 30 engines to United out of the 51 engines. And on those 30 engines, you can see the proceeds. And I think that we probably will be looking at additional sales -- what's that? Yes, we have 20 more engines to sell. And I think that all the -- these are all access to our requirements now. So I think that we continue to see opportunities for enhanced liquidity.\nHelane Becker : That's very helpful. Is there -- just one question unrelated to everything we've been talking about. What about the European operation? Is that moving forward? Is that going on hold? How are you thinking about that?\nJonathan Ornstein : Well, the European operation is very interesting because initially, we thought that it was a way for us to do something with excess CRJs. We've now proven that we can actually sell the CRJs here and be able to not only pay off our debt, but maybe generate a little bit of cash. But now the opportunity there has been -- there is clearly demand for regional flying there. And I think that having that foothold there and being able to put CRJs into service there, I think, ultimately, will be very successful. I do not have the same pilot issues, which I think makes sense. And I also think it's fair to say that we take this green technology seriously. And it may be down the road, but it's still down the road. And I think given what's going on in Europe and to the extent that they move a little bit quicker in the environmental issue and the fact that just demographically that the geography would be easier to navigate with the early electric aircraft. We think this also could be a great platform to launch some of these electric and new technology aircraft as well. So I think it obviously plays a role. It may be small now, but the future comes. And I look back and you know, I mean, when I first joined Mesa, we were flying 15 passenger, unpressurized turbines on 130-mile stage length. We are now flying 1,000-mile stage length and 76 passenger jets. The future comes faster than you think. So I think it's all part of a big strategy, and I think that the European operation will continue to be important part of our moving forward.\nOperator: The next question in the queue is from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Thanks for the followup. Just on the unencumbered assets, there's a lot of moving parts here. Are there any other unencumbered assets other than the kind of the 20 engines that you have to sell? And just tied to that a little bit; on the CRJ-900 fleet, what's the white tail risk there? Because I'm guessing, again, United, the contract doesn't increase your overall flying. So the funds from there really cover your E-175 fleet. So I was kind of curious what the CRJ-900 tail risk is.\nJonathan Ornstein : Well, I mean, first off, I think we should clarify. Some of that assets are unencumbered or close to being unencumbered on the engines, but most of the engines do have debt. It's just that we basically pay down the debt, as a rule of thumb, twice as fast as they depreciate. So by the time we finish paying off the debt on those engines, which is 5 years, the engines are worth at least half of what we paid for them, and there's no debt and generally, a little bit more to the residual value in the course of the engine. On the other aircraft, I mean, obviously, it will be different tail-by-tail. But the 11 aircraft that we sold, I think it's kind of important to note that those aircraft were sold, had literally 0 engine time remaining on them. So potentially the worst of our aircraft, and we're still able to pay off the debt associated with those aircraft and actually generate a little bit of cash. So I think we feel pretty good about where we stand on the CRJ fleet, particularly given the environment being so bad right now. But again, all that debt is associated primarily with the government debt, which is interest only and gives us some time to work our way through those. And we did just negotiate these new transactions with RASPRO and with EDC. And again, that also gives us some time to sort of work our way through. And with the reduction, for example, in RASPRO, I think we feel pretty confident that when those leases terminate, we're not going to be looking at a significant amount of tail risk in terms of the value of those aircrafts at that time.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And just thinking longer term, captain supply issue or pilot supply issue is not going to last forever. So what level -- is there kind of a new normal of profitability if you kind of get back to the levels that you were kind of utilizing the fleet previously? Is there kind of any insights on that kind of the new normal?\nJonathan Ornstein : Well, I think that we basically have an agreement with United that if we were flying the number of hours that we generally projected, I think our level profitability will be roughly the same because they have, in fact, increased the payments to us by the amount of the new labor cost. To give you an idea, I was talking to Mike and just in a nutshell, we've made a lot of improvements. And yet again, we're still going to have to work hard to get the company back to profitability. When you look at the big picture, 2 years ago, we flew 38,000 block hours a month. And last month, we flew something under 16,000. So you can see there's a lot of room for us to go here, a lot of pilots to hire, a lot of pilots to train, a transition to go through for us to return to profitability. But clearly, there's a pathway. There's a liquidity to support that. And most importantly, I will say, we have United who clearly has made -- demonstrated that we're an important carrier to them going forward, and I think will be there to help us through this transition.\nOperator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time.\nJonathan Ornstein : Okay. Well, thanks, Albert. Let me just close in this, and I think it's really important that people appreciate. Look, we are now having the opportunity to really focus on these operations and focus on our partnership with United. United is committed to growing their company. It will help us grow our company. They're committed to regional aviation. They too have witnessed just dramatic cutbacks throughout regional aviation in terms of rural cities. And I know that the leadership at United really would like to see that improved and see things turn around. Mesa has always been a rural aviation carrier. We'd love to be a part of that. United's also committed to green technology and doing the right thing for the planet, and we've co-invested with them now on a number of deals. And I think that we would like to think that we could be at the forefront along with United in terms of the implementation of that technology. So we have a long road to hold for sure. But I can't tell you how strongly all of this feel that this is just a great step for Mesa. Hopefully, a great step for United as well and that we feel that our people will clearly be the beneficiaries of this with enhanced security, job security, enhanced opportunity. The Aviate program, I mean I don't think there's going to be a better place to go than Mesa Airlines for folks looking to get into the aviation industry. So overall, we're very enthusiastic about it. We are very thankful for all the parties that help make this happen, and we look forward to seeing some of that value reflected back to our shareholders as well. So thank you very much, and have a great Happy New Year.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

On the call with me today are Jonathan Ornstein, Mesa's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer; Brad Rich, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Lotz, President; and Torque Zubeck, Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the management team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for the sell-side analysts. We will also want to remind everyone on the call today that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our fiscal third quarter earnings press release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jonathan for his opening remarks. Jonathan?\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Doug, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let's get down to business. As anticipated, while traffic remains strong and our partners continue to request more hours, the industry-wide pilot shortage impeded our ability to meet that demand. We continue to do everything we can to mitigate the impact of the shortage. However, there's only so much we can do given our financial capabilities and the overwhelmingly negative fundamental issues created by the so-called 1,500-hour rule. With greater barriers to entry to become a commercial pilot in the form of increased time requirements and higher costs, we have seen pilot shortages and corresponding elevated wage levels, ultimately leading to higher fares for consumers and decreased levels of air service. With the greater diminished supply of entry-level pilots and the greater post-COVID demand for pilots at the major airlines, the regional industry is caught in an unprecedented squeeze and the highest levels of pilot attrition in history and a shrinking pool of qualified commercial pilots without the necessary amount of hours. Strangely enough, there is, in fact, actually a huge pool of pilots that have their commercial licenses, but are unable to fly commercially in scheduled service. Unfortunately, these pilots oftentimes need over 1,000 additional hours to fly commercially, which their license would imply they already have the ability to do. MESA is focusing on this group as a future resource. We are now looking at opportunities to accelerate their development and accumulation of hours within the constraints of the 1,500-hour rule. In addition, we are exploring options to enhance pilot retention. While it is important to note this problem is broader than just pilots, we are also making progress with other labor groups and to improve attraction and retention. One significant benefit we were able to implement this quarter was announcing that all Mesa pilots, including pilot flying in our American Eagle and DHL operation could participate in United Airlines career development program, Aviate, which provides a path to employment at United. We believe this will enhance recruiting and retention of pilots. This may well be the fastest way for a pilot entering commercial aviation to advance to a major airline while giving us the visibility into future transitions. Turning to our DHL cargo operation, our third Boeing 737-400 aircraft entered revenue service. While the growth of our cargo business has been somewhat slower than initially anticipated, going forward, we believe cargo has the potential to be an increasingly important part of our business. With that, I will hand it over to Brad Rich to go over more of the details and an update on our operational performance this quarter.\nBradford Rich: Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone. As Jonathan mentioned, we continue to face a well-documented industry-wide pilot shortage that has significantly impeded our ability to operate at the level of flying that both our partners and Mesa expect in order to adequately serve passenger demand levels. As we navigate through issues linked to the pandemic and its associated impacts on travel, we are turning our efforts more heavily toward addressing our current labor challenges, which I will discuss in more detail. Most importantly, we remain committed and focused on delivering strong operational performance as well as implementing effective initiatives to ensure that we are able to provide safe, reliable and high-quality service to our customers. In the June quarter, we flew 63,486 block hours, which is a 25.5% decrease from the same quarter last year and a 3.2% decrease below the March 2022 quarter. Our combined controllable completion factor was 96.7% compared to 99.9% a year ago. Both our production and our combined controllable completion factor are below the 2019 levels and have been significantly impacted by a reduction in capacity, which has increased loads, making it more difficult for our crews to commute as well as COVID-19, which is driving high absence rates. We are also facing elevated attrition as larger carriers add capacity and replace pilots due to attrition and early retirements. Both our on-time and completion performance remain at levels below expectation, and the primary driver has been the spike in sick calls related to the latest COVID resurgence. Based on current trends of attrition and training output, our block hours are expected to be down next quarter by roughly 12%. And due to the volatility of the factors involved, we are not able to provide further guidance at this time. During the quarter, our recent pilot agreement did not pass after initially receiving unanimous support from our pilot union leadership. Unfortunately, the timing of the vote was not ideal as it coincided with an offer announced by another large regional carrier, which increased compensation by approximately 100%. It is important to note that we have always maintained a constructive relationship with our pilot union, and we continue to discuss creative ways to reach an agreement with our pilots. We are also continuing our negotiations with flight attendants, where we believe we are making progress. We also recently instituted enhanced compensation at some of our maintenance basis. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal year 2022, we are focused on operating the airline as productively and reliably as possible. While demand remains very strong, we remain pilot constrained due to the 1,500 hour rule and accelerated attrition to the major airlines. Our primary challenge is elevated pilot attrition and our ability to mitigate it through effectively recruiting pilots and efficiently moving them through training. To bolster our management team, we have brought in several key leaders, such as our new Senior VP of Flight Operations, John Hornibrook, who comes to us from Boeing and has extensive knowledge of training and flight operations from his long career with Alaska and Horizon. We are also in the final stages of developing what we believe will be an industry altering solution to the current pilot shortage. As mentioned on previous calls, we have secured additional simulator time for both regional equipment types and recently had a second CRJ simulator come online in July. We also have a third E-Jet simulator to be delivered for the summer of 2023. We continue to implement programs to continue to attract new pilots to Mesa, particularly through the United Aviate program as Jonathan mentioned, as well as a new $50,000 bonus for new hire pilots starting August 1. We have recently invested in advanced software systems to enable us to effectively manage our training pipeline and critical resources needed to meet our training plans. Although the industry pilot situation is a major focus, I wanted to also provide some information regarding our tech ops division and areas of focus. We have recently made some changes and enhancements through consolidation of our maintenance footprint and improvement in performance through prioritizing key locations. Now we're focusing on enhanced automation through iPad technology and improved troubleshooting. We're updating software for parts sourcing. We have several additions in some key leadership roles. And as I mentioned, we have enhanced our mechanic pay. We believe our relationship with our partners remain very strong, and we continue to have productive conversations regarding future capacity as it relates to both short- and long-term strategies. We remain focused on operating our core regional business safety and reliably with the health and safety of our people and our customers being our top priority. Now with that, I'd now like to turn the time over to Torque, who will walk us through our financial performance.\nTorque Zubeck: Thank you, Brad. I'll take this opportunity now to review our financial performance, our capital outlook and our balance sheet. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we reported a net loss of $10 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared to a net income of $4.3 million or $0.11 per diluted share in Q3 2021. On an adjusted basis Mesa has reported a pretax loss of $8.7 million for Q3 2022 compared to a pretax income of $5.8 million for Q3 '21. It's important to note that the adjusted pretax loss for Q3 excludes $100,000 impairment adjustment related to the abandonment of one of our leased facilities as well as a mark-to-market noncash loss on our investments in equity securities and related impact upon our income tax expense. The year-over-year decrease of $14.5 million was primarily due to lower block hour production and the PSP program funding that has now ended. Compared to Q2 2022, we did see sequential improvement on our financial performance on essentially flat block hours. Revenue in Q3 2022 was $134.4 million, an increase of $9.2 million or 7.4% from $125.2 million for Q3 2021. This is ahead of our expectations. Our contract revenue increased by $9.2 million year-over-year as rates returned to normal levels after temporary reductions related to the PSP program. This was partially offset by a 25.5% reduction in block hours flown versus the same period last year for our major partners across all fleets. Pass-through and other revenue remained relatively flat to last year, primarily due to pass-through maintenance expense. And as a reminder, the pass-through expense has no P&L impact to Mesa's performance. Mesa's Q3 2022 results include per GAAP the recognition of $6.8 million of previously deferred revenue versus a deferral of $1.9 million of revenue in Q3 2021. The remaining deferred revenue balance will be recognized as flights are completed over the remaining terms of the contract. On the expense side, Mesa's overall operating expenses for Q3 2022 were $134.2 million, up $23.4 million versus Q3 2021. Similar to last quarter, the largest cost variance compared to Q3 2021 as the $26.1 million for the PSP-related grant that has now ended. Mesa's flight operations expense was up $1.9 million versus last year, primarily due to higher training. Maintenance expense continues to normalize as we are past the high number of engine overhauls and heavy C-checks that were deferred at the beginning of COVID. Maintenance costs was $49.7 million in Q3 2022, down $2.3 million versus Q3 2021. Next, let me review where we are on cash and liquidity. Cash for the quarter, excluding restricted cash, decreased by $21.4 million to $54.4 million. During the quarter, we made scheduled debt payments, including finance lease payments of $18.9 million and had operating lease payments of $4.5 million. Block hour production was down more this quarter than we had anticipated as we worked closely with our partners to fly as much as possible while still flying a reliable schedule. The new block hours had a direct impact on our cash coming in lower than we had anticipated. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $653.4 million, which is up $1.4 million from the prior quarter. We took delivery of a new engine in the quarter, which we had previously established financing, and this is the primary increase in debt of the quarter, offset by other debt repayments. We have planned to sell 18 of our CRJ-700 aircraft that we have currently leased to a third party. Well, I can't show the details at this time. We anticipate this to add liquidity over the next few quarters. This is in addition to other previously announced initiatives to strengthen our balance sheet. While we cannot provide specific financial guidance, we will provide some color in a few areas. As mentioned earlier, we expect there to see continued pressure on block hours through the rest of the fiscal year and anticipate block hours, as Brad mentioned, to be down about 12% for the next quarter. We plan to continue working closely with our partners to address the impact of the decrease in block hours and pilot attrition to our business. The reality is that our contracts contain utilization provisions that were never envisioned in this highly pilot constrained environment. And we feel it's unreasonable for us to continue to incur panel utilization penalties during an industry-wide pilot shortage and the constraints in imposed block hours. Our partners are well aware of this, and they know this is an industry-wide problem, and we've been working constructively to address these unprecedented and evolving issues. And we know that there is more work to be done. We'll be optimizing maintenance costs over the next few quarters as well and expect to be flat or down from the current quarter based upon reduced block hours. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Torque, and we appreciate the financial recap. In summary, we continue to see 2022 as a challenging year for Mesa. While we continue to face significant near-term issues, we believe that by working together with all our partners and our employees, we will successfully navigate through this period and position ourselves for the future. At this point, operator, please open up the call as I'd be happy to field any questions that the analysts may have. Thank you very much for listening, everyone.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Savi Syth.\nSavi Syth: I think Brad briefly mentioned this, but I was curious if you're seeing what you expect the impact of the new pay rates that one of your competitor -- in-house subsidiary, some of the big pay increases that we've seen there, are you seeing an impact on kind of retention or kind of recruiting aspects of your business as well as what does this mean in terms of kind of compensation for your pilots?\nJonathan Ornstein: This is Jonathan. And Brad, if you want to pipe in at any time, feel free. But I think at this point, I would say there's an impact. I'm not sure if we know what it is yet. Attrition levels have been pretty much flat throughout that. We had hoped that things would slow down a little bit, and they hadn't slowed down. That may be partly as a result of that. I do know we had some pilots go to that carrier, obviously, as a result of that. I think long term, what it's just concerning is just a question of what's the impact on the industry when there's, I think, a fairly reasonable chance that, that kind of pricing could make a chunk of the fleet economically obsolete over time. But that's sort of what we're going to have to see what happens. I think the real solution here and what you might have heard Brad and Torque and myself mentioned is we've got to figure out a way to open up the pipeline of pilots. There's plenty of pilots out there that have commercial licenses, which by definition, you would think they could fly commercially, but not under the new the new regs. So when you've got a huge number of people who are seeking those extra 1,000 hours, I think the real question is how do we get them into the commercial market as fast as possible, because that ultimately will be what solves this problem, is getting people through that pipeline quickly. It was a little bit surprising to us because we were in the middle of a boat. That boat, as Brad pointed out, we had received unanimous support from the MEC. We think it was a very amicable deal. We put it together quickly. Everybody was anxious to move forward. And unfortunately, that deal put it in a position where I think even our MEC leadership was disappointed that we were stymied as a result of that, not that such a significant increase occurring mid-contract.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. It seems like that is a general response for most of the industry trying to figure out what this all means. If you don't mind, can I ask you -- you talked about you have the second CRJ simulator, you have the E-175 simulator back in July. What does that do in terms of kind of your pilot training capacity? Does that kind of double it? Does it -- how much does that help in kind of getting through pilots from -- through training? And just you had a goal of kind of increasing the number of instructors as well. I mean, was there a certain target there? Has that been met? How is that kind of component of--\nBradford Rich: No, that's a great question. So when you look at the sims, you have to realize that there's a certain amount of sim time that's required every month just to do recurring training. So you would think like going from 2 to 3 means you have 33% more capacity. Well, actually, what that means is we sort of double the capacity in terms of new hires and our ability to upgrade people. In other words, to go just beyond the recurrent, which is sort of that baseline number and then go from there. In terms of instructors, we have been focusing on the Embraer 175, which is where we felt we had the biggest demand. And I'm very pleased to tell you that last I checked, we had more than doubled the number of instructors and I think that that is becoming less and less of an issue for us. We were certainly caught a little short a few months ago. Part of the problem was we had a, frankly, a slew of instructors that had traded out as the majors continued the hiring spree for the most part, just as a result of the early retirements from the year before. So when you lose 4 or 5 people in a small group of 20, it can have a big impact. But I think we've been creative in terms of getting some additional people from the pilot ranks who can get trained very quickly. And at the same time now on the longer-term basis, we're hiring a lot of those retired pilots to come and fly for us in the sim, who just take a little bit longer to train. They take about 3 months because they have to go through the entire training program as opposed to just a couple of weeks for the pilots who are already trained in the type. So we think we have a short-term solution, and we're also now working on a longer-term solution so that we could free up assets to continue to fly aircraft.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hillary Cacanando.\nHillary Cacanando: Calling in for Mike. So you mentioned the $55,000 signing bonus, I guess starting this month. Just wondering if you have received any feedback from potential candidates and recruiters, and if you think that will help a lot?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. I mean on the bonus, I think the bonus is an interim measure for us because we are looking to ways to improve retention and attraction through our pay scale. As we mentioned, we did have that deal voted down. But we have a good relationship with the ALPA leadership here. And I think we will have a solution for that in the not-too-distant future. In the meantime, we put that bonus in because clearly, it has become more competitive. And we're talking about a reservoir that is being trained where, I think, again, the long-term solution is to refill the reservoir, not for us all to just put bigger straws into that limited supply. So we've had a good response since we entered it. So I think we'll be okay. It's obviously an expensive proposition. And to be frank, I think like any CEO, I'd rather see that money go to our people than to go to new hires just to get them in the door. So I think there are other ways that we can solve this issue. It's just going to take a little bit more time. And so this is the interim solution so that we can be sure to keep our training classes built.\nHillary Cacanando: Got it. Got it. And then I think last quarter, you mentioned that Gramercy, your partnership with Gramercy Associates is on track and that you were expecting to get the European certification completed. I think in this quarter, third quarter of 2022, is that right? Wondering if you could kind of go over that a little bit more?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. We were looking -- this is Mike Lotz. We were looking to start it in the fourth fiscal quarter, and now we're looking -- we pushed it out to the second fiscal quarter of next year. It's just an issue of timing with the regulators in where the AOC is being registered in Malta.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker.\nHelane Becker: Jonathan, is there an argument to be made for consolidation at this level in an effort to solve the pilot issue? And is that something you would consider?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. No, Helane, that's a really good question. And you and I have been talking about consolidation since America West days. The fact of the matter is you've got basically half the number of people trying to fly all the aircraft. And so there is some sense to be made where there's no fundamental flaw to our business beyond this pilot shortage. I mean, to be frank, if we could fly all of our people that we have today in one of our operations, we'd be very profitable. The problem that we're facing is just the fact that our utilization is down across the board. And as everyone knows in the industry, you've got these high-cost fixed assets that you just have to fly. And if we're flying 6 to 8 hours a day, we're not going to make money. If we can fly 10 to 11, we do quite well. And so yes, I do think that there's an argument to be made. And the fact of the matter is the pilots are now obviously, very good assets. And I think that other companies -- and certainly, Mesa would be looking to see if there's ways for us to utilize these assets in a way that generates a profit rather than the losses that we have. And to be frank, no small part of these losses are due to penalties which is somewhat encouraging for us, but one that we have to deal with. And we're working with our partners on that particular issue because, again, this is either COVID-related from -- due to the early retirement or as a result of legislation that we've been working hard to try to modify without literally any success and to the large degree out of our control. But that being said, we have to be creative, and we have to look for ways to get the company return to profitability. Again, I said on the last call, just crazy when you think about it, who would have ever thought that it's easier to go into COVID than it was to go out of COVID. And that's really what's happened. We've just -- it's just been very difficult coming out with the demand for hours, particularly domestically. And we're working as hard as we can to get those numbers back up. But when you lose between 4% and 6% of your workforce a month as opposed to 12% a year, it just creates challenges that even with the train department up running and the correct number of simulators, I think every regional airline is going to face challenges to keep up that kind of output.\nHelane Becker: Right. So off topic, what would you -- or what do you wish we would ask you about instead of pipelines. Like what do you want to talk about with respect to the business that's like the major takeaway here?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, I mean, jokingly, I wish you would be asking me are you going to be as profitable next quarter as you were this quarter? But I mean, I think the biggest subject here is just the long-term future of the company -- of the industry if these wage levels that are introduced stick, and what that means for the regional jet. It wasn't that long ago that we were operating 19 and 30-seat airplanes and changes in legislation effectively wiped that business out. Now I'm not suggesting that's going to happen here because I think all the majors look at the regional jet as critical pieces of their network, that the rest of the hub doesn't work, the regional jet doesn't work. I just think it's going to have an impact on pricing and service levels throughout the country. We've already seen a reduction in service in 70% of all U.S. markets, which I believe is directly tied to the pilot shortage. It's a question of how much further it gets. For us, I think the key would be things that would help us a lot now. I do believe we're going to have a program in place that will accelerate pilot development. I can't go into a lot of detail. We're subject to a bunch of NDAs right now, but I think that we're going to be looking at a program that could, in fact, break this logjam and change the industry, and I believe this, I think we could change the industry as much or more as the first capacity purchase agreement. Because if we can get over the hump of the 1,500 hour rule and all the negative impact, I think that would really change our outlook significantly. It would change our ability to fly the hours that we need. I would put pressure on wages. It would just do a lot of things that could, I think, alter the current trajectory of the industry. And it won't take that long to implement. We're not talking about years, we're talking about months. And the question is, will the majors have the patience to deal with this for a couple of months? And I think the answer is a resounding yes because the regional jets are still really critical part of their network. I mean, you look at American, I think they have plans to operate close to 700 jet. United is close to 300, even at the core level of just 76 passenger jets, I think that we just have to make it over this hump and look out beyond this issue because, as I mentioned, there are plenty of pilots in the pipeline, but getting them from 250 hours, which is when they use to go fly for us and those same amount of hours they can fly all around the world with to that 1,500 is the key. And that's what we're focusing on solving that problem. I would also add to that just real quickly. I think that cargo continues to play a small role at Mesa, but we did add our third 737. We are looking to expand that. DHL has been absolutely a wonderful partner. I mean, I have to tell you, there was no doubt that we had -- it wasn't easy for us to put those aircraft on certificate. They were older aircraft. They had to be integrated into operation and DHL was thoughtful and helpful and supportive. And I think that we feel that there still remains a big future operating as a DHL carrier in the family there. So that, to me, hopefully, will be the next big move that we can see us continuing to add 737s and potentially larger aircraft down the road as we get to be more familiar with the cargo operations in the world of cargo, which is all very new to us.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Andrew Didora.\nAndrew Didora: So Jonathan, when I just take a look at your light operations cost per block hour came in at like $680 this quarter, up $200 from last fall. We've obviously talked over the -- on this call past quarters, just the drivers of that from -- with the pilot issue, the bonuses, the block hour pressure training costs and everything. Do you see any sort of stabilization coming in that number? Or is that -- or do you see a level that, that resets to higher just given what we're seeing in wage rates across the regional environment right now?\nMichael Lotz: Andrew, it's Mike. I mean, look, the cost per block hour now is extremely high just given the combination of local block hours and high training costs and the bonuses that we're paying. So going forward, that number will come down when the attrition starts to level off and we're able to just to increase the number of lockouts. We're just in a situation right now that hopefully it's temporary, but it will change as the attrition pavers down or we're able to get enough people through the training cycle to build our block hours up to 8%, 8.5%, 9%, and then we'll see it come down to some of the levels that's been out in the past.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And can you just give us a sense of kind of that bucket, what percentage of that is just pure pilot wages, pilots on the line flying?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. I don't have that off the top of my head, Andrew, but I can get it for you after the call.\nBradford Rich: And correct me if I'm wrong or Torque, I think that the bulk of it still remains the level of training that we're doing. I mean we are really -- of the increase. It's still around training. And to be frank, there's no choice. I mean we've got to be able to train as many people as we possibly can on attrition. In fact, last month, I think was one of the first ones where -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but that our output from training was not far off of our -- of what we lost through attrition. So we're making progress, but it's going to continue to take work. And talking around the industry, maybe misery loves company, but it sounds like everybody is sort of facing the same challenge right now.\nTorque Zubeck: Andrew, just to kind of ballpark it, roughly about 25% of our pilot wages in the quarter was related to training.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth.\nSavi Syth: I had a couple of just quick housekeeping questions. So the block hour down 12%. Is that year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter? Similarly, kind of with the maintenance expense commentary, was that a quarter or quarter comment or a year-over-year comment?\nTorque Zubeck: This is Torque. It was quarter-over-quarter.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Makes sense. Just a bigger question. Kind of what's your sense, I mean, given -- Jonathan, you mentioned how important this is to the majors and you've heard them kind of say that as well as long as it's economical. But like what's the ability to pass through some of these kind of pay increases, be it pilots or even some of the other groups in your contracts? Like how long do you think that would take?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, it's a good question. Obviously, we're having those discussions now. And based on our model, I mean, when we're making a 5% or 6% margin in good times, I think it would not be hard for all you guys who model certainly as well as we do, that this level of increasing compensation clearly will require support from our partners. That being said, I think that they are obviously understanding that and will be reasonable because I think they have a vested interest in seeing Mesa continue to provide the lift that we do provide, albeit at lower levels now. But I think that they also appreciate the fact that -- I mean look at it from like an American, for example, if they feel it makes sense for them to raise wage levels, they have to think that it would make sense for us as well. It can't be -- well, we can raise them over here, but you guys are okay because there's just -- we can't be competitive. So I think that they appreciate that. I know United appreciates it. And so I think that ultimately -- and remember, too, Mesa has always been a low-cost provider. Our revenue that we generate for ASM has always been significantly lower than other regional carriers. And in large part, I mean, we're sort of just asking to get paid like everybody else has been getting paid for the last decade. So -- and that's not an exact science, but that's not too far off based on the numbers that we seem to feel are ballpark.\nBradford Rich: Jonathan, I think you said it well. I mean, obviously, everyone is very sensitive to the issue. But we've had, what I would characterize as productive discussions to the partners to the point still some more work to do but we're encouraged by the direction that's had. Want to do it in the most cost-efficient way that generates the best results long term. Brad, do you want to add anything to that? I mean, you're in a lot of discussions. Is there anything to add there? No. I mean, Jonathan, I think you've said it well. I mean, obviously, everyone is very sensitive to the issue, but we've had a very -- what I would characterize as productive discussions with the partners at this point. Still some more work to do, but we're encouraged by the direction it's headed.\nSavi Syth: Yes. And just, Torque, can I quickly ask, I know you were -- you said you can't talk about some of the initiatives you're working on. But is there a cash level that you're managing to or that you feel comfortable from a balance sheet perspective?\nTorque Zubeck: It's a great question. I mean we're obviously managing cash carefully, and we like to be around $50 million. But depending on where things are in some of our deals, I think it could be down a little bit lower than that, and we can manage through, right? But generally try to manage close to $50 million.\nOperator: Because I'm showing no further questions at this time, you may proceed.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Well, thank you very much, everyone. I mean obviously, this is a difficult time. And as all of you know, Mike and I have been around working together for a long time. Torque has been in the business pretty much as long as everybody else just over at Alaska and Horizon. But I think it's fair to say that none of us have seen something so challenging that has lasted so long. I mean we all faced the horrific events of 9/11. We dealt with it. The industry came back. This is one that's just -- is clearly a longer-term issue. -- but one that I think we're going to have the wherewithal to address, one, because I do believe there are solutions. And two, I think our partners value what we do for them and are going to help us in terms of making our way through this over time. So I remain confident that Mesa will continue to operate in the regional airline space and to be able to do so profitably at some point. But it's just going to take a little bit of time to make that happen because when it comes to pilots and training, you just can't do things overnight, unfortunately. So I appreciate everyone's patience. I mean, believe me, we are disappointed to see our stock price where it is today as anyone else. But we have to just continue to operate the business and do the best we can moving forward given where we are and the macroeconomic aspects that we're dealing with within the industry. So again, appreciate everyone's time. Hopefully, we'll have a better report for you next quarter, and thank you again very much.\nOperator: That will conclude today' conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-05-09 21:26:10", "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Mesa Airlines Q2 Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Elan, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on mesa-air.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Susan Donofrio, Head of Investor Relations. Susan, you may begin.\nSusan Donofrio: Thank you, Elan, and welcome, everyone, to Mesa's earnings call for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31. On the call with me today are Jonathan Ornstein, Mesa's Chairman and CEO, Brad Rich, EVP and COO, Michael Lotz, President and Torque Zubeck, CFO and other members of the management team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for the sell-side analysts. We also wanted to remind everyone on the call that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our second fiscal quarter earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. With that, I will turn it over to Jonathan for his opening remarks. Jonathan?\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Susan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. While not entirely unexpected, this quarter was clearly very disappointing. Brad and Torque will walk through more of the details, but the overarching issue is our current level of pilot attrition, hiring and training brought about by an industry-wide pilot shortage that has led to our current inability to generate sufficient block hours to operate profitably under our existing agreements. We are addressing this through a number of initiatives, including, but not limited to, increased training capacity, pilot retention and cost efficiency. Beyond providing valuable regional feed for over two decades, Mesa's position as an independent regional low-cost carrier has provided additional strategic value to both United and American. We believe our partners recognize the value of our relationship and will work with us cooperatively through this challenging environment. Some of you may have heard me saying this before, but the founder of Mesa and my mentor Larry Risley, once told me that in this industry, something happens every year that happens every 10 years. The last couple of years, it was COVID. This year, it's the pilot shortage and the associated pilot attrition prevalent throughout the regional industry as pilots are recruited away primarily by major carriers and heavy equipment cargo operators. The sheer magnitude of attrition has created significant backlogs in training, further exacerbating an already difficult situation. While we believe our attrition is in line with the rest of the regional industry, we are taking important steps to further attract and retain qualified pilot candidates. We appreciate the support of our airline partners and pilot leadership are working with us cooperatively to help us as we attempt to successfully navigate through this period. What is most unfortunate is the fact that this shortage is a result of ill-conceived, ill-advised and politically motivated government regulation that by most independent accounts, has absolutely nothing to do with the enhancement of safety. The problem, which will cost consumers millions of dollars in higher fares, has cut off dozens of communities from the national air transportation system and has already reduced service in hundreds more as airlines are unable to fly their aircraft due to lack of pilots. All of this could be solved with the stroke of a pen. It's important to note that no other countries adopted these rules and everyday flights are flown by foreign carriers with pilots that the U.S. would deem to be unqualified. It is a stunning realization that our government has determined that foreign pilots are somehow more qualified than our own U.S. pilots with the same amount of experience and trained in the United States. What has now become apparent is an undue burden this places on minority and other disadvantaged communities, which has been effectively blocked from entering the pilot profession due to the prohibitive costs associated with these regulations. On a more positive note, while COVID driven absent rates impacted us in January, we ended the quarter with absence rates across the board that have returned to pre-pandemic levels. We appreciate the real bravery of our people over the past few years, and we're thankful we all can come to work in a safe and healthier environment. While both American and United have been supportive, we are disappointed in our inability to produce the block hours requested by our partners as demand has increased. The single issue continues to be -- this single issue continues to be the primary focus of our management team. Turning to our DHL cargo operation. In the quarter, we continued to perform well with our two dedicated Boeing 737-400 aircraft. We had a third 737-400 aircraft delivered in March and expected to be entering revenue service for DHL in May. These larger aircraft have the added benefit of attracting regional pilots who have an opportunity to fly larger jet aircraft at the highest rates in the regional industry. While the growth of our cargo business has initially been slower than we anticipated, going forward, we believe that cargo can be an increasingly important part of our business. Our partnership with Gramercy Associates Ltd. is on track, and we expect to have European certification completed in the third quarter of 2022. We own 49% of this multi-based regional jet operation, and we're looking forward to introducing the regional business model to Europe. One of our most exciting initiatives, we have been continuing to pursue selectively is finding new ways to participate, invest and partner in newer, environmentally friendly technology. These partnerships are designed to position Mesa as the first regional airline to fly electric aircraft and to be at the forefront of decarbonizing air travel and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. We also think it will likely be an answer to providing flight service to smaller communities and now facing a loss of flight services pilot challenges that resulted in the mainline carriers reducing or eliminating flight service. Another significant benefit is that it could provide Mesa with a future pilot pipeline who can build hours in smaller aircraft, not subject to the 1,500-hour rule. Our two electric aviation partnership with Archer and Heart that we entered into alongside United are reaching production development milestones, Regent, which is developing an all-electric seaglider, also continues to make progress towards commercialization. Going forward, our strategy is to selectively look at other opportunities in aviation-related green technologies to ensure our leadership role in this area. With that, I will hand it over to Brad to go over more of the details of an update on our operational performance this quarter.\nBradford Rich: Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone. As Jonathan has mentioned, there had been significant challenges due to COVID-19 as well as the transition out of the pandemic, which have been widely discussed and documented, of course, we have not been immune from these industry-wide issues, and we remain committed and focused on both our fundamental operating performance as well as implementing creative initiatives to ensure that we are providing safe, high-quality and reliable service for our partners and customers. In the March quarter, we flew 65,613 block hours, an 11.3% decrease from the same quarter last year and 23.7% below the December 2021 quarter. Our combined controllable completion factor was 96.7% compared to 99.9% a year ago. Both our production and our combined controllable completion factor are below the 2019 levels and have been negatively impacted by the impact of COVID-19, high absence rates and elevated attrition rates as larger carriers are adding capacity and replacing pilots due to attrition and early retirements. Also, the year-over-year reduction in block hours is partly due to our smaller fleet under contract with American. Based on current trends of attrition and training output, our block hours are expected to be relatively flat for the next two quarters. And due to the volatility of the factors involved, we are not able to give further guidance at this time. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal year 2022, we are focused on operating the airline as productively and reliably as possible in the post-pandemic environment. While demand for our flying remains very strong, it is an environment that will be constrained by the supply and training requirements of regional airline pilots. Although our COVID-related sick calls have returned to pre-pandemic levels, our primary challenge remains elevated attrition and the gap created in replacing the departing pilots with new pilots requiring training. The average pilot provides us a two-week notice prior to departure while the expected training footprint for a new pilot is approximately 90 days. We remain focused on our recruiting efforts, and we have added another full E-Jet simulator that came online in February. We've also secured an additional CRJ simulator that will become operational in July of this year. We strategically positioned these simulators in key locations to decrease our training time lines. As I previously mentioned, our pilot training pipeline is currently not an issue, and we have implemented programs to continue to attract new pilots to Mesa and increase our instructor ranks. Furthermore, we are well positioned to be an attractive option for pilots through opportunities such as flying all large regional jets and narrow-body 737 aircraft. The United Aviate program, where we're one of few independent regional airlines to be able to offer a direct pathway for our pilots to become a career pilot for United Airlines. The 737 aircraft, we are the only regional airline offering the opportunity to fly larger aircraft and earn the highest pay in the regional industry. We have attractive domiciles, which make it easy to commute. We're currently offering rapid captain upgrade opportunities. We have an active targeted recruiting effort including Connect program and on-site visits at aviation schools across the country. We have a competitive new hire pay structure and with enhanced bonus opportunities. And additionally, we are pursuing other initiatives to attract and retain new pilot candidates, such as discussions with 135 operators that can provide an inflow of pilots to Mesa. We have previously removed all of the CRJ-700s from our operation. We continue the transition process of leasing these 20 aircraft to GoJet Airlines in agreements that end in 2030, and we only have two remaining aircraft that will be delivered this month. Our United E-175 fleet remains at 80 aircraft. The DHL operation performed very well during the March quarter with a controllable completion factor of 99.1%. We took delivery of our third 737-400 cargo aircraft in March, and the aircraft has been in operations as a support aircraft. It will be doing scheduled operations in May. We believe our relationship with our partners remains strong as we continue to have productive conversations regarding future capacity and both short- and long-term strategies. We remain focused on operating our core regional business safely and reliably with the health and safety of our people and our customers always the top priority. With that, I will now turn the time over to Torque and he will walk through our financial performance.\nTorque Zubeck: Great. Thank you, Brad. I'll review our financial performance and capital outlook and balance sheet. For the second quarter of the fiscal year of 2022, we reported a net loss of $42.8 million or $1.19 per diluted share compared to a net income of $5.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share for Q2 '21. On an adjusted basis, Mesa reported a pretax loss of $13.1 million for Q2 2022 compared to a pretax income of $12.1 million for Q2 2021. It's important to note that the adjusted pretax loss for Q2 excludes a $39.5 million noncash impairment charge that is related to the 12 CRJ aircraft which are classified as held for sale as well as a $2.3 million mark-to-market noncash losses on our investments in equity securities and the related impact on our income tax expense. The year-over-year decrease of $25.2 million was primarily due to lower block hours and the PSP program funding that is now ended. Revenue in Q2 2022 was $123.2 million, an increase of $25.6 million, up 26.7% from $97.3 million for Q2 2021. Our contract revenue increased by $30.3 million year-over-year as rates returned to normal levels after temporary reductions related to the PSP program. This was partially offset by an 11.3% reduction in block hours flown versus the same period last year for our major partners across all fleets. There was also a decrease in pass-through and other revenue of $4.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in pass-through maintenance expense. And as a reminder, the pass-through expense has no P&L impact. Mesa's Q2 2022 results include per GAAP, the recognition of $0.7 million of previously deferred revenue versus the deferral of $4.9 million of revenue in Q2 2021. The remaining deferred revenue balance will be recognized as flights are completed over the remaining terms of the contract. On the expense side, Mesa's overall operating expenses for Q2 2022 were $168 million, up $87.5 million versus Q2 2021. And similar to last quarter, the largest cost variance compared to Q2 2021 is a $66 million in PSP-related grant funding that is now ended. There was also the previously mentioned $39.5 million impairment charge related to our held-for-sale aircraft this quarter. Mesa's flight operations expense was up $5 million versus last year due primarily to higher training expense. Maintenance expense is now becoming more normalized as we are past the high number of engine overhauls and heavy seat checks that were deferred at the beginning of COVID. Maintenance cost was $47.4 million in Q2 2022, down $4.4 million versus Q2 2021. Rotables and expendables and component contracts were up $2.8 million versus last year. Labor costs and others were up $3.5 million versus Q2 2021, mainly reflecting an increase in outside labor support. Compared to Q1 2022, labor costs and other expenses decreased by $2.3 million. Now next, let me review where we are in cash and liquidity. Cash for the quarter, excluding restricted cash, decreased by $26.4 million to $75.9 million, which is in line with where we were forecasting. During the quarter, we made scheduled debt payments of $28.6 million and had cash lease payments of $6.5 million in excess of books. Going forward, our scheduled aircraft lease payments are $12 million lower than this quarter. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $652 million, which is down $26.6 million from the prior quarter. Now while we cannot provide specific financial guidance, we will provide some color in a few areas. As Brad pointed out, we are going to see quite a bit of pressure in block hours through the rest of the fiscal year, and we expect them to be roughly flat over the next two quarters. As we look at the summer and fall, we will continue to work closely with our partners to maximize block hours with a goal to at least maintain current production, but also take on more of our pilot training throughput increases and pilot attrition stabilizes. Pilot training will remain at elevated levels as we continue to hire and train new pilots. We added sim capacity for the E-Jet in February, as Brad previously mentioned, and we are looking forward to having additional CRJ sim capacity coming on in July. Our maintenance costs are now at more normalized levels, which should continue at similar levels going forward over the next few quarters. I'd like to now turn it back over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Torque. And we appreciate the financial recap. In summary, we believe 2022 will be a transition year for Mesa, but we believe this presents an opportunity for us to make some significant and achievable changes in our business structure and fundamentals that will position us well for the future. While we face some significant near-term issues, we believe that by working together with our partners, employees, vendors and other key stakeholders, we expect to successfully navigate through this period as we've done during other challenging periods in the past. At this point, operator, please open up the call. I'd like to thank everyone in advance and we appreciate your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question in the queue today is from Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: I was just curious on the pilot front, if you could just provide a little bit more color on is the current situation kind of adverse than you kind of were thinking a couple of months ago? Is the kind of the recovery as to kind of when you might be able to bring up block hours taking longer, especially in the light of some of the comments that Scott Kirby had on their call about maybe hiring levels in the industry continuing into 2023 at similar levels that you're seeing this year?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, this is Jonathan, Savi, and thank you. The attrition piece obviously is the part that we have least control over. That being said, the majors had in fact given early retirement to I think the total was about 4,000 pilots, which I think clearly has impacted us. And I think we -- hopefully, our view is that we burn through most of that. And there are some things out there that could help, not the least of which is the extension age to 67. There's a lot of talk about pilots being able to be imported, qualified pilots from around the world. The attrition also has been impacted by sort of some of the growth plans and some of the low-cost carriers and whether those will slow down. So clearly, that's the first thing. Our attrition has been about where we planned. It had gone up a little bit, it came back down a little bit. This month, we think it will be down a little bit, but it's still at high levels much higher than we've seen in the past on a consistent basis. We just don't have the luxury of planning the way the majors do, who can basically sort of look at how many folks are going to retire, and that kind of becomes the number they need to look at. The part where we can have an impact, and we're working really hard to, is in terms of output. As we mentioned, we do have people in training in the pipeline. We just have to spool up as fast as we can in terms of additional simulators. We were very fortunate that I think from that standpoint, we now have doubled our capacity or actually more than doubled our capacity. And also, the -- we needed to train and qualify more instructors, which we have done through primarily recruiting internally as well as externally. And I think we ultimately will be successful there so that we can then get the training capacity to outstrip the attrition levels. Clearly, with the amount of sim time, we have the ability to do that. We just need to make sure that we execute on that front. Again, the attrition level is what is in question here. There are some things that are being talked about in Washington that hopefully will help. I have probably the strongest feelings in the industry about it. This is all being generated by a rule that is totally unnecessary that's actually creating more velocity, i.e., more turnover, which clearly that lack of stability in terms of the workforce has to have much, in my opinion, more serious effects than whether or not a person who spent 1,500 hours flying circles around the Pacific Ocean and assess the 172. So hopefully, they will act when they see the impact, which is very apparent in the reduction of capacity across the industry and the impact it will have on the smaller communities that already have been hurt by some of this regulatory burden that has made so much flying unprofitable. There is basically a fairly common feeling in the industry that the 50-seat aircraft will be also go away of the 19-seat and 30-seat aircraft as it just becomes less and less profitable and harder and harder to find pilots to fly those aircraft. So, it is clearly difficult. But again, I think we have a decent handle on it. And I think it's going to take some time to get through it. I think we're trying to be conservative in our estimates going forward, but we're going to continue everything we can to get stabilized situation. The other piece that I think is important to note is we've always been a low-cost regional airline, and we've had a fairly strategic value from that respect. We continue to believe we will remain the low cost carrier. However, I mean, there are some areas, for example, that we think we will solve in relatively short order. For example, we had a pilot contract that was under negotiation. We feel we're very close to getting that done. When I say very close, I'm talking about weeks, not months, and I think that will help because our rates clearly have become uncompetitive. And we've had, in spite of that, reasonably good support in terms of new hiring. We do that with a significant bonus structure. And we've had very, very good support from our pilot leadership who really sees that it's important for us all to work together right now. And I have to tell you, without that, I think this situation will be twice as difficult for us. So that's where we are today. Hopefully, that's a little bit of color that will help.\nSavi Syth: That was very thorough. I appreciate all that. And if I might ask a quick question on the cargo side. I was curious what the cargo block hours does this quarter in the past, I know with the monthly, you shared that you didn't have a breakout this time. Just curious what the cargo block hour was and the trend there. I know that's included in the overall color you provided.\nMichael Lotz: I mean this is Mike. The cargo block hours are somewhere between 120 to 140 block hours per month per aircraft. So, we've got our third aircraft now that goes online in May. So that's the rough order of magnitude of their block hour production.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is actually Shannon Doherty on for Mike. On the cargo piece, so are you guys still targeting 8 to 10 cargo airplanes over the next few years? And can you update us on the current dynamics that you're seeing with demand in the logistics market?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. We think that cargo over the longer haul is going to become more and more important to us. the cargo operators themselves are generally fairly conservative in their growth plans. That being said, I think it's fair to say that we did anticipate being larger than three aircraft by now. And I think our discussions with our partner is that for us to really be a viable entity, and I think they agree that over time, we do need to move that number up. And I think that those are the -- with the level of service that we provided last year, DHL told us that we were among their best, if not their best operator in terms of performance. So -- and on the cost side, I think, as always, Mesa has proven that we are attractive from a cost basis. Extremely valuable to us, not so much that it really puts a big dent in the numbers right now. But as it grows, it will become more important. But it also is a good recruiting tool because we are in a position where if that number of aircraft grows, it's not an insignificant number of pilots so we'll have the opportunity to make significantly higher wages that are available at any other regional carrier. So, we would like to continue to grow it. We think there is opportunity. We certainly have not seen any reduction in terms of hours as if things have slowed down. If any -- if nothing else, we think that the capacity requirements are going to continue to increase at this point.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's really helpful color. And then my last question is do you still anticipate to reduce your debt to roughly $490 million by year-end 2023? So just on your debt reduction, are you guys still anticipating to reduce your total debt level to about $490 million by year-end 2023 by next year?\nTorque Zubeck: Yes, we're still on track for that. This is Torque Zubeck, sorry.\nOperator: And our next question is from Helane Becker from Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Just a couple of questions. One on DHL, I don't know whether it was you Brad or Jonathan, you said that, I guess, that cargo growth was lower than expected. Is that because volumes are not growing as fast as you thought or because you don't have the aircraft you thought you would have by now?\nJonathan Ornstein: Sorry, Helane just -- I think the issue is just that when United or American orders aircraft, they order them 10, 20 at a time with a 12-year contract. The cargo operators are just -- they do not add aircraft like that. They add one's and two's plus I think they wanted to make sure that Mesa was a viable and a partner that they could rely on that could provide the level of service. And now, having just finished our first full complete year, I think we have shown that. And I do feel that we're in a position that if those opportunities come to fly narrow-bodies, I think we're very well positioned to take advantage of that. Where that -- what that means six months from now or a year, I don't know, but I feel that at this point, given the performance levels that we've provided and our cost structure, I think we are very well positioned to take on additional narrow-body flying when DHL is in a position to add. We are looking to get other options also in the cargo world. But I think having an exclusive arrangement with DHL, I think long term, could be a very -- it might be the best way for us to go. We have a very close tie with DHL. We really enjoy working with them. They have been terrific partners. And to be frank, putting our energy into building that relationship would be, I think, a very valuable use of our time.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then my other questions are related to the completion factor and on-time performance. So, I know in some cases, you have to pay penalties if you don't meet your negotiated agreements. Are they suspended since they're taking your pilots? Have you been able to work with them to get them to kind of rethink how they, I guess, I don't know, penalize you?\nJonathan Ornstein: It's a very good and very relevant question. Let me answer it like this, and I apologize for having to sort of be somewhat less than 100% transparent. We -- clearly the situation that exists today in the industry is something that is unprecedented. We are working closely with our partners to have an operation that is the most reliable, most on time, but takes into consideration both what's going on within the industry and the financial impact that it might have on Mesa, which, of course, they -- I believe that our partners would prefer to minimize then maximize.  I think that all those discussions are ongoing. It's very fortunate that we have good relationships with both of our partners that they view us as a strategic partner as much as a day-to-day partner. But I think at this point in time, it's hard to really say where all that shakes out other than, I think, in the long term, both of our partners would like us to be successful. And I think given the scenario, we're going to have to be very creative here in order to ensure that in terms of what is the right balance between performance and penalties and revenue and costs and everything else. And everything is open for discussion at this point.\nHelane Becker: Got you. Do you think -- just as a follow-up to that Jonathan, there was an article on TV I saw recently. I'm not sure where I saw it, but it was -- you had -- were quoted as talking about the comments you made earlier about the 1,500 hour rule and why it was so high. And one of the Colgan, I don't know, survivors, I guess, father of somebody really pushed back on that and talked about the fact that there haven?t been any accidents in the U.S. and felt it was -- he didn't understand why any aviation professional would want anything other than 1,500 hours. And I don't disagree with your comments, right? I mean, we have pilots who fly into the U.S. with 700 or 800 hours and they do it safely. Do you think that's a realistic goal to get that hour rule changed, A. And B, do you think the government would allow M&A activity in this sector of the industry in order to help solve that issue?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. I mean, first, let me comment about the 1,500 hour rule. Look, I think that there are other pathways that people can become proficient pilots, highly proficient pilots. Military pilots who fly off of aircraft carriers fully armed into the combat with less than 200 hours is an example of what that means. With all due respect to all the parties, the fact is there is zero evidence, zero evidence, that total time has any impact on safety whatsoever. There is, however, significant evidence that says that the amount of time and type does have an impact. So, by decreasing the amount of time and type that pilots have because of rapid turnover, I don't think makes a lot of sense, and I think it's empathetical to the interest of safety. Whether or not there'll be M&A, I don't think any M&A at the regional level, I don't think would be subject to any kind of antitrust issues because we're just too small to count. And so, I don't think that would be a big hurdle. The bigger hurdle is always our partners have -- generally have rights under change in control issues. But again, I think that given the difficulty in the situation, and I think it'd be fair to say that Mesa is not the only carrier that's having its difficulties right now in terms of really what's really boiled down to just this pilot issue. I don't think that that would be an issue either if there was some creative solutions available. That being said, our biggest issue right now on the pilot side is we can bring people in the door at this point. And I mean that is a concern, though. It's just the rapidity of attrition, which has been a result of the pilot shortage that there are fewer available options to JetBlue or Spirit or Atlas. So, they immediately have to come to us as a source as opposed to in a more plentiful situation, there are other ways to find pilots. So, I think that I don't -- I think that we just need to work together. And primarily, I think the big players here will be our partners in order to help see us through this. United has been extremely helpful in terms of allowing Mesa to participate in the Aviate program. I mean, that clearly has helped us in terms of attrition. I think that looking at our contracts ourselves, I think, will help us. But overall, I think that we're just going to have to be very creative, and it's something that we've done in the past. And I think something we continue to do because there are solutions, but I think long term, the solution is just going to have re-filling the reservoir pilots that has been drained as a result of the impact of the 1,500-hour rule.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Didora from Bank of America.\nAndrew Didora: So, Jonathan, based on kind of what's gone on with the operation, think about the March completion factor when you kind of layer in your -- the current training environment, you've got -- recently got a new sim, you?ll be getting another new sim. I know attrition is the big wildcard, but assuming it stays around where it has been recently, do you have like a general time frame of when you think you could be in a position to run at kind of the optimal utilization or kind of the block hour production that you were doing before these pilot issues popped up?\nBradford Rich: Andrew, this is Brad. Look, I just want to pay a little more attention to the fact that our performance in the quarter was really compromised by the extent of the sick calls when we were in the Omicron variant outbreak. That's really what affected it more than -- I mean, we had high attrition, that's been ongoing. We've been working with that and planning for it, but it was the sick calls that really got and hurt the performance. And as both myself and Jonathan said in the opening remarks, those sick calls and call out rates have come down to pre-pandemic levels at this point.\nJonathan Ornstein: And in terms of timing, I think it's fair to say that it's not -- we cannot snap our fingers and fix this problem just because of the footprint of training. We have added more instructors, which has helped so that we can fully utilize the sims, and we've added the additional sims. Clearly, I think that if we can expand the participation in the Aviate program that we're working on right now, I think there are some things that we can do internally to slow down attrition. But I think the biggest issue is just being able to attract and bring people through the system. Paying a captain $10 an hour more. And even when we talk to our union leaders about this, I don't think we have a big disagreement is not what's going to retain someone if they get a job offer from a major that has obviously a much higher projected income stream over the lifetime of a pilot's career. So, I mean, I think that the best thing we can do is just continue to focus on bringing people in the door and getting them trained as fast as we can, which I think is something that we could have done better. I mean right now, we probably have about 200 people in training 200 folks, believe me if we could snap our fingers and those were available tomorrow, we wouldn't have a shortage online. So that's really our focus right now is just as I said, continuing to bring people in and then getting them through training as fast as possible. And to give a little more color on that, we have had a little more success on the CRJ side in terms of getting people through. Our footprint is significantly less. So hopefully, we can see some improvement there. And that's why we put a lot of our focus now, the first focus on getting additional sim was on the E-Jet because we have -- that's been where we've been a little bit weaker on the E-Jet which frankly has also been a churn since COVID, because pre-COVID, we always seem to be a little bit better off in the E-Jet. But there has been a fair amount of attrition there. And we now are putting a significant amount of focus on the E-Jet side.\nAndrew Didora: Understood. And Brad, when you spoke about the block hours being flat the next two quarters, I'm assuming that's flat to the March quarter production? Or is that flat year-on-year?\nBradford Rich: Yes, flat from last quarter, the March quarter's production.\nAndrew Didora: Yes. Okay. Last one for me. I guess, Torque, the $76 million of cash at the end of the quarter, down from $180 million, I think, was the last June cash number. Kind of when do you expect to see some stabilization on kind of the burn rate here? And how should we think about CapEx and principal payments over the next, call it, 12 to 18 months?\nTorque Zubeck: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. When we look at cash, I mean, we had some large expenses in the quarter, cash expenses in the quarter that we talked about in the comments, that was the bigger driver of the decline in the quarter that we had. Right now, as we look ahead to the next quarter, we're expecting to be around 65%. So, the burn isn't going to be nearly as fast as it was in the prior quarter. And obviously, as we look at the forecast for block hour production, that's the wildcard for us right now. And so, giving direction further out than that, it's pretty difficult at this point because it is really dependent on our production. And obviously, as we work with our partners, what may happen with that. So that's sort of -- that's about what I can provide for you right now. I don't know if you had any other comments.\nMichael Lotz: Yes, the only thing I can add, this is Mike, is that this current quarter that we reported, we had -- and I think it's in the prepared remarks that we had an extraordinarily high lease payment, which is -- in subsequent quarters, will be reduced by about $10 million or $11 million per quarter going forward. So that is something that you would need to take into account. And then the scheduled principal payments, they were -- I think they were $29 million or $30 million this quarter. They go down to -- by another $10 million next quarter too. So those are the other two factors that might not come out as clearly in the 10-Q, as you would expect.\nTorque Zubeck: Yes. And as far as CapEx, this is Torque again. I mean one thing we have significant is we have five engines we're taking delivery of. Those are all -- we have the financing set up for those already. And so that -- there will be a little bit of CapEx on those on just the down payments for those, but the majority of that is all going to be financed.\nOperator: I have another question from Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Just a couple of questions. First one, just wondering on the -- moving the CRJ-900s, the 12s to being held for sale. What was kind of the driver behind that decision? And curious what interest levels you're seeing today for that fleet?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, I mean, the driver was that we did not need the aircraft, like moving them over, we were able to -- it obviously improves our P&L by holding them for sale. And we have had multiple parties make offers on the aircraft. They're getting better with time. I will say they're not going in the wrong direction. But we want to -- if we do sell them, and I'm hopeful that we will, that they'll be sold and be used -- the proceeds to be used to retire the government debt that's against those aircraft. And I think that, obviously, you can imagine these are not our high time, I mean, our low time engine aircraft, these are the aircraft that are -- I would think it's fair to say least valuable, but we're still very close to being able to do a transaction that will hopefully retire all the government debt associated with those aircraft and just sort of start to chip away on that. We do have a couple of other transactions in the works that are -- would be helpful on the liquidity side. And I think that we are also looking at other ways that we can save money in the company. We're not just going to sit back and do nothing. We obviously are being very proactive in terms of working on improving liquidity through other means, although suffice to say, adding block hours is the fastest and best way for us to do that at this point.\nSavi Syth: That makes sense. So, is it fair to assume the European JV still kind of going forward and this doesn't impact that?\nJonathan Ornstein: No. We're going to continue to go forward. We think that there's good demand over there. It would be a way -- and there is no pilot shortage. In fact, believe me, if we could -- if the government would take action and allow us to give visas like we can in Australia, a large part of this problem would go away. Which, again, is why I say this is politically motivated, not safety motivated. Why shouldn't we bring pilots in? I mean it's kind of ridiculous when you think about it, that if you're a model, you can get a visa to come work at the United States because there's effectively, a shortage, where we can't get pilots over where there's a shortage that has literally billions of dollars of impact on the industry, the communities we serve and the consumer. I mean, I think it's pretty clear people have seen prices going up, and there's a reason for that. Demand has increased and supply has decreased. So, I mean, I'm hopeful that the government will act quickly because that's one thing that could take a lot of pressure off the system if they would just let us tap into the pilots around the world who are all exceptionally well qualified. A lot of them fly in more difficult situations than the United States. Having been over in Europe, I mean, the flying in Europe is clearly more challenging given the weather. And I think that that's one way that we could help solve this problem more quickly. I am -- to that end, again, we're being proactive. I'm actually testifying a hearing next week being held by Senator Sinema regarding the pilot shortage. And I want to make all these points clear and hope that we can get some of these actions taken. The other thing, too, is that in Europe, there is no scope in Europe. There are pilots available. And I think that the American model of capacity purchase would do very well there. And we've seen in Europe, sort of a balkanization of the regional carriers as opposed to a focused effort that we would try to bring to that operation.\nSavi Syth: Appreciate that. Good luck next week with the testifying. Can I just quickly clarify with the lease payments, that's just the differential between your cash lease payments and your P&L lease payments are different, right? This does not have an impact on your P&L. Is that fair?\nTorque Zubeck: Yes, that's fair to say, yes.\nOperator: And I have another question from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Shannon. Were you guys involved in conversation with the FAA last week regarding ATC staffing issues? Maybe you were [indiscernible], maybe you weren't just curious your thoughts.\nJonathan Ornstein: No, we were not involved. It just -- it didn't impact us. So, we were not involved in that. What we were interested in with the FAA and something that we took note of is the fact that one of our fellow carriers at Republic just filed for an exemption to the 1,500-hour rule, and we're going to watch that very closely and we'll probably follow suit. And frankly, I applaud the folks at Republic for taking what I think was to be a very meaningful action and making it clear that this rule has really impacted everyone negatively but would be very clear, no upside from a safety perspective and potentially significant downside.\nOperator: And at this time, I am showing no further questions.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Well, thank you very much, everyone, for taking the time to hear our quarterly report. As I said at the opening, obviously, this is very disappointing. We knew where we stood. So again, it's not a surprise, but we clearly have a lot of work cut out for us in terms of getting the ship back in order. It's frustrating because there is really nothing else that's impacting us negatively. Our maintenance operation has been doing well. Our pilots and flight attendants have been incredibly supportive all through COVID. We see people picking up open time and doing all the things that we need in this tough period. Our people have been incredibly supportive. But it's just hard to compete when there's so many options for a pilot right now to earn significantly higher pay at the major carriers or the air cargo companies or some of the corporate jet opportunities just has become very difficult. We know that while we can't control attrition, we certainly can do a better job in terms of getting our people through training, which is something we're highly focused on doing. And I think lastly, and most importantly is I think the support that we're getting from our partners has been outstanding, and I want to tell you how much I appreciate that because I think in the long run, their support will be critical for us to get through this problem successfully. So, with that, we hope we'll have a better report for you next quarter. Obviously, this has been disappointing. We're all shareholders, and we know where the stock is and we know what our job is here. And I can assure you, we're all taking that very seriously. So, thank you very much, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 1, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-02-09 21:54:11", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Mesa Airlines Q1 Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Donofrio, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Donofrio, you may begin.\nSusan Donofrio: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Mesa's earnings call for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call can be found on our website. On the call with me today are Jonathan Ornstein, Masa's Chairman and CEO; Michael Lotz, President; Brad Rich, EVP and COO; and Torque Zubeck, CFO; as well as other members of the management team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for the sell-side analysts. We also wanted to remind everyone on the call today that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on file with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our first fiscal quarter earnings release, which is available on our website, for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. With that, I will turn it over to Jonathan for his opening remarks.\nJonathan Ornstein : Thank you, Susan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Obviously, this has been a very tough quarter for Mesa. And the one piece of good news I can report is that demand for our products has never been stronger. Our primary challenge will be meeting that demand. While COVID now appears to be received and in some quarters referred to as a controllable endemic, its impact to our operations and financials is still evident, however, and its effect on this quarter was significant and unlike anything we have seen in 20 years. While COVID had by far the greatest impact, we had other items that negatively impacted the quarter as well. We continue to have a catch-up in heavy maintenance expense that we deferred at the start of COVID, which was discussed last quarter. We experienced unprecedented volatility in sick calls, which we believe are COVID Omicron-related.  In November, December, we had days with sick rates as high as 23% compared to our historical average of 5%. This continued for the first three weeks in January. Fortunately, since January 23, we have seen a measurable reduction in sick call rates, which we're obviously monitoring closely. While COVID's effects are lessening, we are also contending with a significant increase in pilot attrition as mainline carriers begin hiring to refill the fleet of pilot ranks caused by early and statutory retirements. Additionally, the national and cargo carriers continue to have a strong demand for pilots.  That being said, by far, the biggest impact on the current pilot shortage is the ill-advised 1,500-hour requirement for commercial pilots, a rule adopted by no other country. Unfortunately, our financial performance this year will be highly correlated to our ability to deal with this pilot attrition successfully. On a personal note, I could not be more proud of our people who bravely continue to work through the pandemic, providing safe transportation to our passengers. Managing through the challenges of our four regional operation remains our team's top priority. Brad will go into more details with some of these initiatives. As far as some of the areas we have invested and partnered in outside of our four regional operations, they continue to make progress and reach company milestones. These partnerships will help make to diversify its revenue and add to our future growth opportunities. As an update, turning to our DHL cargo operation. This continues to perform well with our two dedicated 737-400F aircraft. We have consistently met or exceeded DHL's operational performance requirements. We\u2019ve recently leased a third 737-400F aircraft and expect to take delivery this month. Going forward, we think that cargo can be an increasingly important part of our business. Our partnership with Gramercy Associates Ltd. is on track to have certification completed in the first half of 2022. We own 49% of this multi-based regional jet operation, and we're looking forward to introducing the regional -- our regional business model to Europe. In spite of the difficult environment, we have selectively continue to invest and partner in newer environmentally friendly technologies. These partnerships are designed to position Mesa to be the first regional airline to fly electric aircraft and be in the forefront of decarbonizing air travel and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.  Our electric aviation partner\u2019s -- partnerships with Archer and Heart that we entered alongside United are reaching product development milestones. At Archer, the company has received a special airworthiness certificate from the FAA covering its maker demonstrated aircraft in early December. This was followed by completing its first successful test flight in December 2021. This moment is a significant step forward for Archer's overall certification time line and serves as the key enabler for the company's mission to launch its first commercial eVTOL flight in 2024. Heart Aerospace, our other electric aircraft partnership, is also reporting progress in development of its 19-passenger electric aircraft. For the first time, the scale model of the plane took flight at the Heart Aerospace headquarters out located in Sweden this past December. Going forward, our strategy is to selectively look at other opportunities in aviation-related green technologies to ensure a leadership role in this area. During the quarter, we signed a letter of intent and entered into a partnership agreement with Regent to support the development of their electric power transportation, utilizing wing and ground effect technology, which is designed to significantly expand the range of over other electric designs. With that, I will hand it over to Brad Rich to go over more of the details of an update -- and an update on our operational performance this quarter.\nBradford Rich: Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our main focus remains on operating our core regional business in the safest and most operationally reliable way with the health and safety of our people and our customers always the top priority. We are focused on remaining flexible in response to the flying needs of our partners, American and United and DHL. In the December quarter, we flew 86,079 block hours, which is a 24.3% increase from last year and 9.3% below last quarter. Our combined controllable completion factor was 97.8% compared to 99.9% a year ago. Our current production is below our 2019 levels, primarily driven by a reduction in flying for American as a result of our smaller fleet under contract as well as capacity reductions due to the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 and elevated attrition to mainline carriers. Looking ahead to 2022. We are focused on preparing to operate the airline productively and reliably in a post-pandemic environment. While United and American are requesting additional flying, it is in an industry environment of increased pilot attrition to the major airlines, compounded by COVID-related absence rates.  In previous calls, we discussed the increase in volume of additional heavy check requirements and the timing of such checks that compromised our aircraft availability. We feel like we are seeing some tailwinds on this issue. And after this quarter, we expect to be back to a more normal run rate of heavy maintenance. And our aircraft refurbishment program is also just about completed. Regarding our United operations, our controllable completion factor, or CCF, was 98.3% due to pilot staffing challenges caused by pilot attrition to the mainline carriers and elevated absences due to the spread of COVID-19. As far as our United fleet, we had previously removed all the CRJ-700s from our operations, and we continue the transition process of leasing these 20 CRJ-700 aircraft to GoJet Airlines as part of the previously announced agreement ending in 2030.  17 of the aircraft have been delivered as of December 31, 2021. The three remaining aircraft are planned to be delivered by the end of March 2022. Our United E-175 fleet remains at 80 aircraft. We feel like our relationship with United remains strong and productive, and we are working collaboratively with them as we navigate through the recovery. I'd like to now provide an update on our American operation. Our CCF for American was 97.2% for the quarter and driven primarily from the same issues that impacted our United performance, specifically COVID-related absence rates among our pilots compounded by pilot attrition. Working cooperatively through the pandemic, American recognized difficult operating environment impacted our performance and waived our performance-related requirements. As mentioned in previous quarters, the increased volume and timing of heavy maintenance impacted our ability to schedule aircraft and related spares. Maintenance and refurbishment costs should begin to return to more normalized levels after this quarter. I would like to provide a little more color to our operating performance. Unlike other regional carriers that were pulling down scheduled flying earlier due to elevated pilot attrition, the situation at Mesa was unique in that our attrition spike happened much later than others and occurred at the same time in which we experienced elevated absences due to the Omicron surge. This sequence of events is the driver for reduced performance in November, December and January. In cooperation with our partners, we have kept our forward scheduled block hours down to a more conservative level in order to account for COVID-related absences and pilot attrition. Given the fact that we have outlined the industry-wide challenges, the relevant question is, what are we doing about it? And how are we navigating through the recovery? Our focus is on staffing, specifically employee hiring, training and retention. This focus will be on pilots and all critical positions that support our daily operations.  Our pilot training pipeline is full, and we have implemented programs to not only continue to attract new pilots to Mesa, but also increase our instructor rates. We have secured additional simulator time and have this strategically positioned in key locations to decrease our training time lines.  Furthermore, we are well positioned to be an attractive option for pilots through opportunities such as: a fleet of entirely large regional jets and narrow-body 737 aircraft, United 88 program, where we're one of a few independent regional airlines to be able to offer a direct pathway for our pilots to become a career pilot for United Airlines. 737 aircraft, we are the only regional airline offering the opportunity to fly larger aircraft and earn the highest pay in the regional industry.  We have attractive domiciles, which make it easy to commute. We're currently offering rapid captain upgrade opportunities. We have an active targeted recruiting program, including a cadet program, and on-site visits at aviation schools across the country. We have competitive new higher pay with enhanced bonus opportunities. And additionally, we are pursuing other creative initiatives to attract and retain new pilot candidates. Turning to DHL. We continue to see strong performance numbers as we complete our first full year of operations. We had a controllable completion factor of 99.8% for the quarter, which exceeded DHL's performance goals. We are expecting delivery of our third 737-400F aircraft this month. This aircraft is expected to provide additional lift as well as provide additional operational support. With that, I'd now like to turn the time over to Torque to walk through our financial performance.\nTorque Zubeck: Thank you, Brad. Now I'll review our financial performance, capital outlook and balance sheet, and then I'll provide some more detail on our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we reported a net loss of $14.3 million or $0.40 per diluted share and an adjusted net loss of $9.3 million or $0.26 per diluted share. The adjusted net loss excludes the $6.5 million mark-to-market noncash losses on our investments in equity securities and related impact on our income tax expense.  Revenue in Q1 2022 was $147.8 million, a decrease of $2.6 million or 1.7% from $150.4 million for Q1 2021. While contract revenue increased $9.7 million due to more flying on all fleets relative to the prior period, this increase was offset by a decrease in the number of aircraft loan for American. There was also a decrease in pass-through and other revenue of $12.4 million, primarily due to a decrease in pass-through maintenance expense. And as a reminder, the pass-through expense has no P&L impact. Mesa's Q1 2022 results include, per GAAP, the recognition of $4.2 million of previously deferred revenue versus the deferral of $5.2 million of revenue in Q1 2021. The remaining deferred revenue balance will be recognized as flights are completed over the remaining terms of the contract. On the expense side, Mesa's overall operating expenses for Q1 2022 were $151.7 million, up $26 million over Q4 2021 and $28.3 million versus Q1 2021. The single biggest cost variance compared to Q1 2021 is $11.3 million PSP-related grant that did not exist in Q1 2022. Masa's operations -- flight operations expense was up $10.6 million versus last year. Over 60% of the increase is related to increased block hour flying for both pilots and flight attendants. Additionally, pilot training and recruiting bonuses accounted for $3.3 million.  Maintenance expense for Q1 2022 was $59 million, up $6.1 million versus 2021, but down $2.1 million versus Q4 2021. Labor costs were up $7.3 million versus Q1 2021, reflecting increased flying activity and pay scale increases for the maintenance technicians. Compared to Q4 2021, labor costs and other expenses were up only $1.1 million.  C-check expenses, excluding pass-through amounts, were $9.1 million in Q1 2022, up $6.1 million versus Q1 2021, but down $1.5 million compared to Q4 2021. Rotables and expendables and component contracts were up $3.4 million versus last year, but down $1.4 million from Q4 2021. Now let me review where we are on cash and liquidity. Cash for the quarter, excluding restricted cash, decreased by $18.2 million to $102.3 million. This amount is right where we expect it to be last quarter. The reduction from Q4 to Q1 was primarily due to planned scheduled debt payments and financing costs of $26.8 million, $19.8 million in spare engines and other equipment and $7 million in deposits paid toward the future spare engine purchases. These expenditures were partially offset by $30.8 million in gross debt proceeds.  Total debt at the end of the quarter was $678.6 million, which is up $8.3 million from the prior quarter. Assuming no additional debt, the balance will be reduced by roughly $93 million during the remainder of fiscal year 2022 and $95 million during fiscal year 2023. This brings the total debt balance down to roughly $490 million at fiscal year-end 2023. Now let me touch on guidance. Although there's still a lot of uncertainty, we did want to provide guidance in a few areas. As Brad pointed out, we are going to see quite a bit of pressure on block hours through the rest of the fiscal year. Based on prior COVID trends, we believe this quarter will be the most impacted at 15% to 20% below Q1 2022 as we have been conservative with our partners on block hour production. By calendar year-end, we anticipate that our block hour production levels will be 5% to 10% below Q1 2022.  The heavy maintenance that we deferred at the start of COVID will be winding down at the end of this quarter. Pilot training will remain at elevated levels as we continue to hire and train new pilots with added capacity for the E-Jet in February and additional CRJ SIM capacity coming up in the next quarter. We're also looking for cost-savings opportunities such as parking access aircraft, evaluating underused facilities, leases and equipment to eliminate unneeded costs in our business. Clearly, Q2 will be a challenge, but we are focused on our plan to get to breakeven by Q4, our September quarter. Getting our pilot attrition under control and increasing our pilot training output will be the most critical focus areas for increasing our block hour production. We will also be working with our partners to address the contractual performance requirements in an industry environment that has dramatically changed. I'd like to now turn it over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Torque. We appreciate the financial report. Given the operational initiatives outlined, we expect to see an improvement in block hour production by the end of the year. We are also aggressively focused on the cost-savings initiative that Torque outlined. In conclusion, while we faced some significant near-term issues, we believe that the fundamentals of the industry remain unchanged over the long term. This last quarter demonstrates the extreme volatility of the industry and has required us to redouble our efforts to operate at pre-COVID performance and utilization levels. It clearly will not be easy, but we will get there and be stronger as a result. At this point, operator, please open up the call. I'd be happy to field any questions that analysts may have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Savi Syth. Go ahead please, your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Good afternoon everyone. Just if I might, on the $22.5 million COVID-related impact that you called out for the December quarter, could you break out or at least provide a little bit of goalpost on how much of it was sick calls and how much heavy maintenance? And as you pointed out, in both of those should be less of an issue as you look into second half of the fiscal year. So I\u2019m just trying to understand maybe the items that linger on into the end of the year.\nTorque Zubeck: Savi, this is Torque. The heavy maintenance component of that, we will have most of that completed in this current quarter, and we'll really have that behind us. The other elements that we referred to is really related to the increased training costs that go along with will be -- have increased trading in the rest of the year as we try to go back to fill our pilots. So I don't know if that helps you, but we'll be doing a lot more training and recruiting part of the program, which includes bonuses that we'll be paying as well.\nSavi Syth: And maybe -- sorry, maybe if I could -- maybe if you can provide -- is there any color that you can provide just on a per block hour basis or on a kind of annual basis, just how much higher in terms of training costs you expect training and hiring costs you expect to see in this fiscal year?\nTorque Zubeck: Yes. Well, when I think about -- I think, in my prepared remarks, we talked about $3.3 million in the quarter for additional pilot training and recruiting costs. That's probably a reasonable estimate.\nSavi Syth: Sorry. Perfect. I missed that. Thank you. And then in the -- you mentioned that the attrition rates kind of increased year -- November, December, January. I know one of your competitors called out another thing is that they're seeing this a lot more on the captain side. Just trying to understand your comfort about kind of getting to that ever kind of decreasing level of declines in block hours. Just what are you seeing on the attrition front and your comfort to be able to reach those kind of the block hour rates by the September quarter?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. Savi, this is Jonathan. Clearly, the attrition issue has been significant. A big part of it is, in fact, the backfill and being able to get the training done. We're fortunate in that we actually have adequate SIM time. We secured a bunch of sim time, right, as this problem began to sort of erupt back in 2021. So we just put another E-Jet simulator online. A matter of fact, three days ago, we have another CRJ sim coming. And we actually have another sim coming in 10 months. So we think, from that standpoint, just the structural piece, we can do it. We have to continue to fill classes, which, given the 1,500-hour rule has made it obviously more difficult with what we feel to be actually less qualified people than the students that we were getting from the programs that we train people have in it. But clearly, the attrition piece is the wildcard. Mesa was fortunate and its part of the problem that we've had is our attrition was actually on the low side of the industry for the first three or four months of the year and didn't pick up until really November, December, where we had a significant spike. But believe it or not, our spike was actually in FOs, and it just caused us to, for example, in one of our operations, literally, all of our cancellations were due to a lack of FOs.  So obviously, the issue is going to be going forward what the majors do, I mean, it's fortunate that we've had very open conversations with United, American about this. United has been extremely helpful and understanding. We put together an AVA program with them. We're the only large jet independent regional carrier with a flow-through like we have with United. And at American, given that they operate their own regionals, they are very much aware of the problem and are sympathetic because they're dealing with the same thing. So I think that while this is an industry problem, I'd like to think that Mesa is reasonably well positioned given our relationships with American and United. I do think that there are some things that we are doing that are a little bit different that should help us. I think primarily the piece about the sim times, I don't think people should underestimate just ability to get enough sim training to qualify people is going to become challenging, and I think we're reasonably well positioned in that.  So I mean, if attrition stabilizes, I think we can pull our way through this. It's not going to be easy, but I think that it's really you need the outlook is going to be based on attrition. I think one more thing just to mention quickly is, while attrition impacted us this last quarter, please do not understand the impact of COVID. Because when you're dealing with 23%, 24%, 25% absence rates, I mean I don't care what the attrition is, if you have no attrition, you would not be able to cover that on a day-to-day basis, where we were canceling there were days we canceled more flights in a day than we had canceled in the previous 12 months and that really had to do with attrition. And the other thing I'd like to point out on that because I think it's important because people have that, what -- is there an issue with the pilots? Is there some kind of problem there? And I'm like, well, we've had coded COVID for the last almost two years, and we've had no problems with attendance. We really only had a problem when you had Omicron and Delta, which really had a big impact on the group. And to give you an idea how big the impact was, again, there were a period of time where our infection rate was actually up 30-fold over the previous months. So I mean, there was a confluence of issues here that clearly impacted us on the pilot side, which we're going to do everything we can to fix. The one piece of good news is that, for the last five days, we've had one infection, which is really a drop-off that we did not expect even -- we did not expect or even hope could happen so fast. So hopefully, at least that piece of it is behind us right now.\nSavi Syth: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker. Go ahead please, your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi everybody and thank you for the time. So Savi asked most of the questions I would have asked you. But just trying to think through the differences between the two subsidiaries, not so much American and United, but the passenger and the cargo. Did you have similar issues with cargo pilots? Or was it kind of more confined to the passenger side of the business, a? And b, do you have trouble finding pilots for the 737 and finding sim time for them?\nJonathan Ornstein: Interestingly, I will say, on the 737, we did not have the same impact, although I think it would be remiss for me not to mention that we did actually lose one of our 737 pilots who is a dear friend of mine, who actually passed away as a result of COVID. And other than that, we did not have the same impact. We did not -- I think the number of cancels during the quarter were like maybe one or two or -- actually Mike is shaking his head -- I think, maybe no cancels on the cargo side. But it was a small group of people, and they were able to cover for each other if there was an issue. So we just didn't have the same problem on the cargo side. On the passenger side, obviously, we just had much bigger groups. And unfortunately, what happened to it was that it was in waves. It wasn't even distributed. I mean we'd have one week it would be everybody in Dallas and one week could be everybody in Houston. And we just would literally find ourselves in a position where we'd come in and have a 20%, 25% call-out rate. And this was compared to a month earlier where we had a 5% call-out rate while there was still COVID going on. So I think that, that really just -- we -- I think it would be fair to say we've got, I would say, lucky on the cargo side with the exception of fatality. We don't have a problem recruiting the pilots on the cargo side because they come through the Mesa seniority list. And we have always lots of volunteers because, I mean, to be frank, the pay is very good. And we're very proud about that we have the highest pay in the regional industry. I mean we have some pilots making over $200 an hour. It's become a good tool for us in terms of recruiting as well. So the cargo side is probably right now, probably our -- the best news that we have for today, we are adding a third aircraft in the very near future. It's just coming on out of the C-check. It's on its way this month, and it will go into service. And we're looking to continue to expand the cargo business as best we can.\nHelane Becker: Thanks Jonathan, I'm sorry for your loss. The other question I have is on penalties. So normally, you would have to pay penalties to your partners if you couldn't meet the contract, the contractual obligations. But in this case, it's partly their fault you can't meet the obligation. So because they're hiring them away from you. So how are you dealing with that? Are they -- like are they cutting you some slack there? Is -- like what's going on with that? And I know you can't necessarily disclose the amount, but...\nJonathan Ornstein: No, we're happy to. I mean I think that when we're looking at -- for this quarter, we disclosed that we had booked $4 million of penalty. I think that is under the conversation with our partners. And we feel strongly that, for the reasons that you mentioned, that there is a very good argument. And it's not so much their fault. I mean as much as -- as I said, a big chunk of it is COVID.  The hiring is obviously part of the issue, no doubt. But I think that -- but I think our partners are also both of our partners, like I said, for different reasons, maybe, but understand the situation. And I feel pretty strongly that we will have productive conversations with them around this because I don't think anybody -- anyone wants to take advantage of another company as a result of COVID-related illnesses. And I think that, given the attrition situation, I think that everyone is just trying to come up with the best solution. And just to penalize us for a situation like this just don't be productive, but I think they'd much rather see us putting our money into additional recruiting and training and bringing on more pilots. Seems like a much better use of that money than to pay whether millions of dollars to them that may not be as helpful as what it would be to us in terms of bringing in more pilots. And again, they have the same issues. I mean, every airline in the country has talked about pilot shortages and training problems. And I said, particularly with American having their own regionals, we had a conversation just recently, and they fully understand the challenges. And I think that -- I'm hopeful that they will be -- and I feel confident, frankly, that they're going to -- these conversations will be productive. And some of the penalties that we've anticipated or even booked, I think there could be some discussions about those.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg. Go ahead please, your line is open.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon everyone. I have a few here, if I could just start off with Torque. You identified a whole bunch of areas for cost saves, various initiatives. Did you actually -- did you say what the target was maybe on an annual run rate what you hope to achieve and maybe the timing of achieving those cost savings?\nTorque Zubeck: We haven't -- we're not ready to share the exact details on that, Michael, right now. But what we are looking at is I think you're aware we're flying -- we were flying 54 aircraft for American and we're now down to 40. So what we're looking at is how do we look at our footprint with a maintenance basis that we have for American, how we can pull those together, eliminate lease costs and get better utilization out of our mechanic group. And so that that's one of the opportunities that we're considering. There's also -- we've already been going through opportunities for cost savings and finding all of our contractors go back and say, what are we doing? How much more can we clearly find more money in those areas? So I'm not ready to share the details yet because we haven't announced any specific plans, but I think it would be easy to say that we think we could pick up several hundred thousand a month potentially in there, but not ready to share the exact numbers.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then, Brad, on the operational side, in the Q, you guys provided a little bit more sort of detail around kind of the American situation. And the question, I guess, I have for you is, I guess, in return for the waivers that they granted you for the late -- sort of November, December and January, in return, did -- were any modifications to your American contract as a result of that? It just it wasn't clear.\nBradford Rich: Mike, that's a good question. I think the -- I mean the simple and quick answer to that is no. I do expect is what Jonathan alluded to earlier is we just expect to continue some -- what we think will be productive dialogues surrounding the economic penalties, but no, there are no other modifications of the agreement.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay, okay. That's super helpful. And then just lastly, Jonathan, maybe this is kind of a two-part question. One, where is your attrition now? And where has it been historically? Sort of part A. Part B is -- when I look at the number of cities that are losing service, that are losing all air service, they're in states with very powerful members of the House and the Senate.  And at the end of the day, when you think about where the rubber meets the road, in states like -- I saw United is pulling out of Lewisburg, West Virginia. West Virginia doesn't have a lot of airports, and there are people in that state who care about our service. And at some point, you got to get enough senators and members of the House to start looking at this 1,500-hour rule. Because rural America is going to lose all its service. I mean your comments about 50 -- all the CRJ-200s being nonexistent in a year or two, that's going to have a big impact for the America's national airway system. I mean we're going to get -- something is going to give here. So -- and you're probably the person here who can help cover that message.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes, Mike, let me tell you, I mean, as you know, way back in 1995 or so, they went to one level of safety. And I spoke out about the fact that it would destroy the 135 business and 2,500 135 aircraft that had flown into rural America are now parked. There is not a single 19- or 30-seat aircraft currently in operation flying into those cities. I said on the 1,500-hour rule that it will only be a matter of time before the demographics of the retirements at the majors would have this kind of impact. When you couple that with COVID, it is the perfect storm. There were some issues. We can all talk about the early retirements that probably were not the best idea, but at the time, no one quite knew where COVID was going to go.  Fact of the matter is now the industry needs to pull together. And for the first time, you are hearing other CEOs talk about the 1,500-hour rule and, hopefully, more people will. Because in the end, who is going to pay for it? All the small communities that will lose service entirely. But the other folks that will pay for it will be reduced service, reduce supply, and that will only do one thing is raise prices. And I think that everybody realizes, too. And I think it's very important to hit on this. This is not a safety issue. I mean there is not a shred of evidence that says that a 1,500-hour pilot is safer than a 300-hour pilot with intense training. Our failure rate is probably 10x higher with 1,500-hour pilots as it was for the 300-hour pilots coming out of our own programs that we headed in Farmington or at ASU. So this is not a safety issue. And I think it's important that some of the politicians start to act and take this up. Because if they don't, they're putting the industry in jeopardy. And it doesn't matter if you're Mesa or any other regional airline, everyone is going to face the same outcome. And it's just not sustainable if they don't do something to fix this. Mike wanted to make a point that this is a law that was adopted. And no other country in the world has adopted this one, not a single one, right? I mean -- and it seems crazy that a 300-hour FO can land a Lufthansa A350 into JFK flying over Queens, and a U.S. pilot can't do the same thing. So attrition levels. I will tell you that attrition has clearly been elevated. We have one month it's high, one month it's low. I mean, it's really been all over the board. I think it's fair to say that it's running anywhere from -- we look at like 3% to maybe 5% per month. And we are doing our best to keep up on the training side. The only problem that you have with training and which has caught us a little bit behind is that normally pilots give us two weeks' notice, maybe 30 days' notice. It takes 3 months to train a pilot. So we've got a pipeline, as Brad mentioned, that is full. We now have, in fact, additional sim time that will double our output, but we absolutely have some catching up to do right now. There is no doubt about it. And it's going to take some time. And one of the big question marks is right now we fill up our classes. I am concerned that, as we go down the road, depends upon how future attrition looks, does that reservoir, how dry does that reservoir get before Congress take some action and allows us to refill with high qualified really, really well-trained students who don't have 1,500 hours but have high-quality training in simulators and advanced aircraft types?\nMichael Linenberg: Great. Thanks for the time and thanks everyone else for the answers. Appreciated. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Didora. Go ahead please, your line is open.\nAndrew Didora: So Jonathan, actually, my question was on kind of your -- the last point that you made. I guess, at what point do you start worrying about filling up your classes, right? I know your training pipeline is full, but what does your pool of applications stand for, for pilot today? What was it pre pandemic? And kind of where do you see your pilot hiring needs over the course of 2022?\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. No, that's a good question. Again, dependent upon attrition, and I just hesitate to say which direction it's heading, I mean, we saw, for example, a significant drop in January, which we thought had been a trend, and then it went back up to previous level in February. We are currently, as I said, have multiple hundreds of people in training right now, and now and the biggest problem we had was just getting adequate sim time, which we've now secured.  Our pilot applicants, the numbers are probably a little bit less than they were pre pandemic in terms of applications, not drastically less, but a little bit less. And we still are finding that we can fill the class. But I mean, we've got an entire department that's out recruiting right now. I mean there was a time when, in fact, people used to pay us to apply for jobs. So I mean things have changed dramatically, and it's just a question of how we see things going forward and if we can get any relief whatsoever. I mean there have been some long-term fixes being put into place, things that, frankly, we have been advocating for a long time and had started to do and then the pandemic hit. But I think that some of these schools, fortunately, are out there. With United, for example, beginning Aviate, and there are other academies out there that will help. But the problem is you can get someone up to the point where they have their 300, 350 hours having gone through a couple of year program. And then they have to sort of scramble to get to the next 1,200. It's very expensive. It takes a long time. And you're also asking people to stay out of the workforce for two years.  And to be frank, in today's environment, I mean I feel even more passionate against it because, frankly, it basically discriminates against anyone who doesn't have a ton of money. I mean, unless you are a very wealthy person, you are not going to become a pilot without basically trying to hawk your entire future if you can make that happen. So I mean, it's clearly problematic. I think for Mesa, I mean, we're in a reasonably good position because we do fly large jets. We have very good -- very desirous domiciles in Dallas and Houston, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. And we have the AVA program with United, which has been obviously helpful in terms of attracting people. But on the other hand, with AVA, we also lose people to United. So it's a little bit of a double-edged sword. But net-net, I think it still is advantageous for us.\nAndrew Didora: And maybe I should know this, but just in a normal year pre COVID, how many pilots would you typically hire every year?\nTorque Zubeck: 250.\nJonathan Ornstein: Maybe -- I think when we look back, I mean, if there is ever considered to be a normal year in this industry, but I think our normal training classes, we'd probably run between 20 and 30 a month. I think is that a fair statement, Mike, just depending upon what our needs are?\nMichael Lotz: 250, 300 a year.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes, 250 to 300 a year. So that number obviously has gone up from there. I mean, in COVID, we are literally losing two people a month.\nAndrew Didora: Yes. Understood. Lastly, maybe Torque, the $4 million of penalties in the December quarter, where does that hit the P&L? Is that the flight ops cost? Or is that a country revenue? Just curious from a modeling perspective.\nTorque Zubeck: Yes. I'm not going to -- I really can't speak to that. Sorry, it's not something we share publicly previously or -- but it would be in contra-revenue.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. Thank you.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. I mean, to Savi's question, and I talked about the penalties. I don't know maybe I shouldn't have, but the fact is that we did have it out in earlier drafts, so I'm happy we did because I'd like to be transparent. We looked at the $4 million in penalties. And then we looked at what would have happened if we did not have COVID and heavy absence rates and just flown the same amount of flying as we did in October -- for October, November, December.  And without the absence rate, that probably was an additional $5 million. So it's very easy for us to say, without any of the other COVID-related problems, like the delay in our SIMs [ph] and all the other things that happened, we could easily identify $9 million of COVID-related expenses or -- excuse me, loss of revenue in this quarter that we feel pretty easily we can identify.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Savi Syth. Go ahead please, your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Just to follow up on Helane's question, with cargo not seeing as much pilot attrition, is there an opportunity to expand the cargo given how strong that market is, even if you're having pilot issues on the CPA side? Or because of that, is that -- does that kind of constrain any kind of cargo ambition?\nJonathan Ornstein: No. I think, Savi, that the cargo business is clearly, for us, a very important growth area because not only has the business continue to grow and be strong in terms of just the macro aspect, the more cargo aircraft we add, I think it becomes that much more attractive place and makes it easier to recruit pilots. Because clearly, as I said, it gives pilots that makes it the opportunity to make narrow-body rates without ever having to leave. So I think the opposite.  And I think even our partners realize, I mean, I actually had a conversation with one partner who said, why didn't you grow cargo? It's a great way to attract more pilots. And so this is even coming from our own major airline partners. So I think that we are focusing on that growth. We've done an excellent job operationally. I have to say hats off to our people there. Without a spare aircraft, we went months without a cancellation. And we are -- it's an area that we think there could be some real opportunity for us in the narrow-body area. So no, it's very important growth avenue for us going forward.\nMichael Lotz: And I can also add. Look, for our DHL, we've only done it just about a year. And we used that to prove ourselves, and now we got another aircraft, and that's just a good indication of our potential that we can grow that as well as any other cargo business.\nSavi Syth: So Mike, it's -- what's the gating factor in growing that? It sounded like you had this proving now that you proved it. Is it just maybe your aircraft a year, and you just kind of have to show, okay, you have another one, and give a year of good performance there? What's the gating factor there?\nJonathan Ornstein: Look, I think the gating factor really is just demand on the side of the cargo operators. I think that Mesa has proven itself to be maybe the most reliable of the 737 operators right now. And I think, as a result, I think if there's growth out there, I think we stand a really good chance of getting our fair share. But I think the real issue is just what do the cargo operators see as the demand for narrow-body aircraft in their system.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. And then if I might just quickly ask a question on the European JV. It seems like the timing is looking a bit -- I think 1Q was the expectation, 1Q -- calendar 1Q and maybe now it's first half. Could you remind us again what comes after the certification and when that can start contributing?\nMichael Lotz: Yes. So we're -- this is Mike. So there is no 1,500-hour rule in Europe. So that's -- I could start with that. But the private -- the pilot situation there is much different than what we would see here. But our plan is still to get the operating certificate by midyear. And then we've already talked to some customers and add customers throughout the year and kind of mimic the model in the U.S., which is much different than what they do in Europe right now where they have a couple of aircraft here and a couple of aircraft there and not a lot of structure to it. But we think the model in the U.S. will work well in Europe.\nSavi Syth: And is that something that's more seasonal to, Mike? Is it that the opportunity really in the summertime when the demand is strong and then maybe not as much in the winter?\nMichael Lotz: No. We're really not trying to do the traditional European ACMI will pick up the summer peaks. This is more of establishing partnerships with major carriers in Europe like we do in the U.S. for long-term relationships for larger fleets of aircraft.\nSavi Syth: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And speakers, I'm showing no additional questions at this time. You may proceed.\nJonathan Ornstein: All right. Well, look, folks, clearly, this has been a difficult quarter. The effects of COVID combined with the attrition have obviously been difficult. And to be frank, I think probably the single biggest issue was how rapidly things changed. We responded, we thought, as quickly as we could. We brought back and started classes back in April to try to get ahead of this. There were some constraints in regard to being able to put people through training and sim time, particularly in the E-Jet fleet, which we just solved this week.  It's going to take us some time to dig our way out, but I think it's fair to say that, besides the structural problem that exists within the industry in terms of pilots, that we are hopeful that Washington will address before it's too late, I mean I think there's -- I think it's very fair to say that in terms of what's happening at Mesa and our partners at United, American and DHL, there is no structural issue there that would cause, at least from my perspective, any concern. It's much more dealing with some of these industry issues. And then it's a question of how fast we can address them. And I can assure you that everyone here is working at full speed. We're all back in the office. I think that we're very much focused on getting this turned around. And the biggest aspect there is just getting our folks through training and getting people back out on the line flying airplanes. So I want to thank, in particular, again, all of our people, but I also think it's really important for us to thank our partners, all of whom which have been incredibly supportive throughout this whole period. And I think that that's probably one of my single biggest reasons for confidence is the fact that our partners have really stepped up and have been very helpful throughout this whole period. So with that, I want to thank everybody for taking the time, and we'll hopefully talk to you next quarter. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That will conclude today's conference, and we thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time. Have a wonderful day.

I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Donofrio, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Donofrio, you may begin.\nSusan Donofrio: Thank you, Operator. And welcome everyone to Mesa\u2019s earnings call for its fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30th. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call can be found on our website. On the call with me today are Jonathan Ornstein, Mesa\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Brad Rich, EVP and COO; Michael Lotz, President; and Torque Zubeck, CFO, as well as other members of the management team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for the sell-side analysts. Also wanted to remind everyone on the call that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company\u2019s current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports on filed with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our fourth fiscal quarter earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. With that, I will turn it over to Jonathan for his opening remarks.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Susan. Obviously, this was a difficult quarter for Mesa, who would have anticipated that coming out of COVID would be more difficult than going into it. As Brad and Torque will cover in more detail our significantly higher seat cost and span times for the primary driver. Larry Risley, founder of Mesa and my mentor, once told me, in the airline business something happens every year that happens every 10 years. And beginning in 2020, something happened, that happens once a century. The aviation operating environment has been dominated by the pandemic resulting in massive fluctuations in demand, higher attrition, inflationary pressures and supply chain disruption. This has presented a set of circumstances unlike what we have seen before that will remain -- require innovation and cooperation to address successfully. While we believe industry fundamentals remain intact for the long-term, our expectation is that 2022 is likely to be a pandemic transition year. I\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for their dedication throughout the pandemic as we work through this tough environment and the federal government for the PSP program that allowed us to keep all of our people fully employed. Since it is the end of the fiscal year, I would like to go over some of this year\u2019s highlights. First, we added 20 Embraer 175 aircraft to our United Express operation. We put in place a new contract for American to operate 40 of our CRJ-900s for the next five years. We leased 20 CRJ-700s to GoJet another United Express operator for a nine year term. We successfully launched our 737 cargo operation with DHL and in partnership with United, we entered into agreements with electric aircraft manufacturers Archer Aviation and Heart Aerospace. We believe this will lead to significant long-term growth opportunities and make us the industry leaders in green aviation technology. Archer\u2019s electric vertical takeoff aircraft is designed for convenient, economical and low carbon transportation to United hub of airports in congested urban environments like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. As part of the transaction, Mesa made equity invested in the company and receive warrants. As of the close on Tuesday, the value of our investments is approximately $15 million on a cost basis of $5 million. We also entered into a purchase agreement for another 40 aircraft and 20 options with deliveries expecting to begin in 2025. Another significant benefit we see is that these small aircraft provide a pathway for our new pilots entering the industry to fly our larger regional jets. And another green initiative we made an investment in Heart Aerospace alongside United Airlines and Breakthrough Energy Ventures led by Bill Gates. In addition to our investment we receive warrants and entered into a purchase agreement for 100 aircraft and 50 on option, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2026. Heart Aerospace is located in Gothenburg, Sweden, plans to be the first provider of all electric 19 seat commercial regional aircraft. Mesa has been -- had previously been the largest operator of 19 seat aircraft and is our hope that these highly efficient environmentally friendly aircraft will allow us to reintroduce service to dozens of cities that lost commercial service over the last 20 years. For example, Farmington, New Mexico, our former headquarters at one time at over 40 flights a day to five destinations and currently has no commercial air service. As a result, the 45,000 people of Farmington have been effectively cut off from the national air transportation system. Heart ES-19 aircraft will reintroduce rural aviation to cities like this clean, efficient, safe and reliable transportation. Our investments in these two companies are designed to position Mesa to be the first regional airline to fly electric aircraft and be in the forefront of decarbonizing air travel and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. This will allow Mesa to have significant growth opportunities and continue to be a leader in introducing new technology to regional aviation. To put this in perspective, Morgan Stanley has estimated that the eVTOL market could grow to $9 trillion when it is fully developed and we intend on being at the forefront of this development. We\u2019ve also entered into an agreement with SkyDrop formerly known as Flirtey to operate for drones and -- with an option to acquire up to 500 in total. We believe SkyDrop is one of the most technically advanced precision drone delivery systems in the world, with its initial focus on food delivery. We are excited about introducing drone delivery and think about -- think there is a huge potential market, while definitely limiting our risk. We believe we are pioneering an exciting and potentially high growth industry of the future. Subsequent to year end, we finalized our agreement with Gramercy Associates Limited based in London to develop a European based joint venture regional airline. Mesa owns 49% of the new venture. The joint venture will be based in Malta and the certification is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022. We are excited at the potential to bring our regional business model overseas. I\u2019d like to touch on the overall labor situation and the impact of potential shortages going forward. Brad and Torque will be explaining in more detail, but while we are navigating through an uncertain demand environment caused by COVID in 2020, 2021. The shortages of pilots driven by the federally mandated 1,500 hour rule and now exacerbated by early retirements as the major carriers will require our focus -- largest focus over the near-term. This is an industry wide problem that needs to be addressed cooperatively with our partners, the FAA and the federal government, as well as our employees. In response, we increased our recruiting and training efforts back in April, and are looking at other strategic initiatives to respond to this potential pilot labor shortage. We believe we are laying the foundation for a strong future by strengthening our airline partnerships and position ourselves at the forefront of environmentally friendly electric aviation. Throughout our history have always worked together to come up with creative solutions when we\u2019re faced with near-term hurdles and believe this time will be no exception. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Brad to provide an update on our operational performance this quarter.\nBrad Rich: Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We remain focused on the health and safety of our people and our customers, and as you would expect, we continue to follow the CDC latest guidance and are working cooperatively with our major partners to ensure consistency across our network. Our partnerships with United and American remain the cornerstone of our business, and we are committed to not only meeting their performance and capacity objectives, but remain flexible and responsive to often rapidly changing industry conditions. We are pleased to see demand for air travel recovering. In the September quarter we flew 94,868 block hours, which is a 64.6% increase from last year and an 11.4% above last quarter. Our combined controllable completion factor was 99.7%, compared to 100% a year ago. Our current production is below our 2019 levels, primarily driven by our reduction in flying for Americans as a result of our smaller fleet under contract. Looking ahead to 2022, while demand has been recovering, there continues to be uncertainty as new variants of COVID-19 arise, our ability to meet our airline partners demand will likely be dependent upon the severity of the pandemic. Additionally, our industry continues to face significant obstacles, often magnified by the impact of COVID. This includes the rapid changes in demand, employee retention as hiring, increases in the cost of heavy maintenance, often due to supply chain issues and increasing labor costs, and a more expensive overall operating environment due to inflationary pressures. That being said, while we remain focused on solving these difficulties, we are not immune to these industry wide issues. Let me discuss a few of the issues. In spite of issues obtaining parts and materials, the primary factor driving increased scheduled heavy maintenance expenses is the volume of scheduled C-checks, which are at historical highs and aircraft interior refurbishment upgrades. This also lengthened the time span of our heavy checks, thus impeding our ability to return our aircraft into service and do add additional aircraft into heavy maintenance. The result has been reduction in the number of spare aircraft to support daily operations. We anticipate elevated costs and C-check times will remain in place into the next fiscal year as the supply chain recovers. It\u2019s important to note that these issues are primarily impacting our CRJ-900 fleet. Regarding our United operation, our E-175 fleet remains at 80 aircraft. Our controllable completion factor remains strong throughout the quarter at 99.8%. Our United performance has consistently placed us in the top tier rankings versus our peers and this quarter was no exception. We have removed all of the CRJ-700s from our operations and we continue the transition process of leasing these 20 CRJ-700 aircraft to GoJet Airlines as part of the previously announced agreement ending in 2030. 14 of the aircraft have been delivered as of September 30, 2021, with four additional aircraft transitioning into December quarter and the two remaining aircraft will be delivered by the end of March of 2022. I\u2019d like to provide a quick update on our American operation, which consists entirely of CRJ-900s. Last quarter, we mentioned the issues we faced with our CRJ-900 fleet. These aircrafts were particularly impacted by parts shortages and the timing of heavy maintenance events. Additionally, at the request of Americans, we added an additional five lines of flying through the summer schedule. This increase capacity extended through mid-August and combined with the additional C-checks reduced the number of spare aircraft available to the company. As previously mentioned, our C-check volume is at a historical high and more than double the company\u2019s normalized scheduled C-check rates. Our DHL operation continues to perform very well operationally. We\u2019ve completed our first full year of operations. We -- for DHL our controllable completion factor was 99.26% for the year and our on time performance rate was 97.65. Both have exceeded DHL\u2019s performance goals and our performance. The third 730 -- the 7 -- the third 737 aircraft delivery has been postponed by the lessor due to deliveries in conversion, maintenance and certification. I\u2019d now like to make some additional comments about our outlook on labor. We remain focused on hiring and training to meet increasing staffing requirements in all of our operational divisions. For pilots, this was exacerbated by an increase in early retirements at the majors, as has resulted in higher attrition. While we put our training back into full capacity in May, we have seen further elevated attrition levels over the past 60 days. While we have been able to successfully recruit a sufficient number of new hire pilots and currently have over 200 pilots in training, there is a gap between the resignations and when the new hire training is completed. In addition, we\u2019ve removed five aircraft that has been added for the summer peak from our off American operations, and as a result for the December quarter, we are currently anticipating a block hour reduction in flying of 8% from the September 2021 quarter. Furthermore, we feel like we are very well positioned to be an attractive option for regional pilots through opportunities such as our fleet consists entirely of 76 passenger or narrow-body 737 aircraft and does not have turboprop or 50 passenger aircraft. We offer The United Aviate program, we\u2019re one of few regional airlines able to offer a direct pathway for our pilots to become a career pilot for United Airlines. Our 737 aircraft, we are the only regional airline offering the opportunity to fly larger aircraft and earn the highest pay in the regional industry. We are well positioned -- we have well positioned crew domiciles across the country that allow our pilots the opportunity to live where they desire and commute easily to work. We\u2019re currently offering captain upgrade opportunities. We\u2019re actively recruiting from hundreds of aviation schools across the country. We have competitive new higher pay with enhanced bonus opportunities. And we are pursuing other creative initiatives to attract and retain new pilot candidates. With respect to mechanics, while we are continuing to deal with attrition, we have been able to hire a sufficient number to keep pace with attrition thus far. That being said, we continue to remain highly focused in this critical area. As an example, we implemented a new pay scale effective in October of 2021 and implemented other incentives and retention programs. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the time over Torque to walk through our financial performance.\nTorque Zubeck: Great. Thank you, Brad. Let me do a review of our financial performance and then provide some more detail on our business outlook. After that, I\u2019ll discuss our capital outlook and balance sheet. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we reported a net loss of $7.5 million or $0.21 per diluted share and an adjusted net loss of $2.1 million or $0.06 per diluted share, excluding the $6.8 million mark-to-market non-cash losses on our investments in equity securities and related impact on our income tax expense. For the full year 2021, we reported net income of $16.6 million or $0.43 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $24.6 million or $0.64 per diluted share. These adjustments include the aforementioned mark-to-market non-cash losses on investments in equity securities, as well as a loss on a lease termination and a gain on extinguishment of debt. As Brad mentioned, we\u2019ve been investing in our fleet getting them through heavy maintenance that has been deferred during COVID-19. Overall, maintenance expense was up $14 million versus prior year. Fleet check volumes were double the normal run rate in the quarter. The associated cost was roughly $9 million higher than Q4 2020. Similarly, our rotable and expendable expenses were elevated due to a catch up on parts removed in fiscal year 2020 that were not needed at lower flying levels but are now being repaired and put back into service to support the higher flying activity. These add another $3 million of expense net of one-time through outs with one of our maintenance vendors. Let me review where we are on cash and liquidity, cash for the quarter excluding restricted cash decreased by $59.9 million to $120.5 million. This amount is slightly above where we forecast it to be last quarter. The reduction from Q3 to Q4 was primarily due to its planned scheduled debt payments of $45 million, which included a one-time deferred debt payment of $19 million, partner true-ups of roughly $23 million, a $5 million investment in Archer Aviation, a $5 million investment in Heart Aerospace during the quarter and the purchase of a new spare engine. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $670.3 million, which is down $43.4 million from the prior quarter. Assuming no additional debt, the balance will be reduced by roughly $100 million on average in each fiscal year 2022 and 2023. This brings the total debt balance down to roughly $470 million at fiscal year-end 2023. There was $9 million of CapEx in the quarter, which primarily consisted of the purchase of a new spare engine and rotable spare parts. For fiscal year 2022, we still have four additional new spare engine deliveries and no other major planned capital expenditures. Effective October 2021, all temporary partner rate reductions related to PSP are no longer in effect as the PSP program ended at the end of September. Let me now touch on guidance. Although, the environment is still recovering, we did want to provide guidance in a few areas. As Brad outlined, our Q1 2022 block hours are anticipated to be 8% lower than the previous quarter. We also anticipate increased pilot training costs as we have our training center at full capacity for new hire training and captain upgrades. And like most regionals, we have enhanced new hire pilot compensation to attract a sufficient number of qualified trainees. Our heavy maintenance expense levels will continue to be elevated for the first two quarters of the fiscal year 2022. This includes both an interior refresh program at American, as well as our regularly scheduled heavy maintenance visits. For our pass-through maintenance expense, as you know, this is has zero P&L impact and it\u2019s not related to our level of operations. This is more related to the timing events, so we provided our best estimates in our press release. We see 2022 as a transitional year, primarily in the first two quarters. We are coming to the end of the elevated C-check activity we\u2019ve seen in the past year. We see travel demand increasing, given that pilot hiring at major carriers is expected to be at elevated levels, we are focused on making sure we keep our pilot hiring and recruiting activity at full throttle. Our success in this area will have a direct impact upon our financial performance. Now I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you very much Torque. We appreciate the financial recap. To sum up, we strengthened our partnership with United for the addition of 20 aircraft and our partnership in electric aviation. We were also able to successfully enter into a new contract with American in the midst of the pandemic. We believe we have a plan to attract and retain qualified employees. We also feel like DHL cargo flying and our European growth plans are just start as we continue to look for and pursue new growth opportunities. Finally, we remain the low cost regional airline and intend on being the regional airline leader in decarbonisation and electric aircraft. While we certainly face some significant near-term issues, we believe that the fundamentals of our industry remain unchanged over the long-term. At this point, Operator, please open up the call as I\u2019d be happy to answer any questions that the analysts may have.\nOperator: Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Savi Syth. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. I am just a bit confused, if I look at your results delivered relative to your guidance, your -- for this quarter, your block hour production came in higher, your kind of recognition of deferred revenue was higher and some of the non-pass-through engine and C-check maintenance cost estimates were actually lower. What seems to be different maybe is the five American aircraft leaving a little sooner and maybe slower aircraft with GoJet. So I\u2019m just kind of curious, were you expecting a loss -- a non-GAAP loss in the September quarter previously or something else happened during the quarter that that drove that? And also along those lines is, you expect some of these costs to continue for another couple of quarters? Do you -- should we be expecting non-GAAP losses for a couple more quarters as well?\nJonathan Ornstein: Savi, this is Johnson. I\u2019m going to just give you a high level view from my perspective in terms of what drove this quarter and I\u2019ll let Torque and Mike maybe at chime in. But clearly what drove things here was just the elevated level of heavy maintenance primarily in C-check, the cost, the duration, the number. I think it\u2019s important to point out that, we have 64 aircraft on property, we\u2019re only flying 42, we had five additional aircraft. But in the meantime, we were actually maintaining all of them and I don\u2019t imagine that just -- that will not continue. We had a lot of aircraft that were in also, as part of our new agreement with American, we put them through various types of mods, whether it be electric seat mods, interior mods, paint mods, so we were funding an additional, I believe was five lines of aircraft that otherwise would either been available for spares are been parked and the expense of maintaining those aircraft would not be there. So a lot of this is related to that transition into the new American contract, and again, in the higher costs associated with primarily heavy check that came through. And again, on those C-checks, they were more, they took longer due to supply chain issues and they were more expensive as a result.\nBrad Rich: And Jonathan, maybe I can just add, it\u2019s not only the C-checks, but the -- there was a -- an increase in the quarter related to parts support, which is some of its tied to the C-check, when the C-checks are in for that expanded period of time, there are significant parts expenses that we had related to the C-checks and the parts related to the interiors, like Jonathan alluded to, we\u2019re flying more aircraft than in the CPA, some of them to support for spares, some of them to support for programs that we\u2019re doing with the American fleet. So those are the two major items, the heavy maintenance and the part support related to them.\nSavi Syth: That makes sense. And just on that, the non-GAAP, should we be expecting the losses for another couple of quarters here? Is there something that changes here in the next couple of quarters?\nBrad Rich: Well, we\u2019re not giving any guidance on earnings. But we -- as Torque alluded to and I think Jonathan did is the heavy maintenance, a lot of it was for work that took longer than expected and that is going to be tailing off in, it\u2019ll go through Q1, part of Q2, but then certainly by Q3 and Q4 we will be through that whole cycle and we\u2019ll probably be under run rate at that point, right, we\u2019re kind of flipped to a lower point.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And if I might just ask, on the pilot front as, could you talk about, like, any color on levels and if this is what you\u2019re seeing a little bit of a transitionary issue, as you mentioned, where takes time for the pilots that are in training to catch up or do you see this kind of a treadmill that you\u2019re on lasting quite a bit longer?\nJonathan Ornstein: I\u2019m going to -- I\u2019ll make my comment, again I want Brad to give you more color. During COVID, there was trend -- the attrition literally went to zero. I mean, when I\u2019m talking zero, six, eight, 10, 12 pilots a month, which for us, obviously, and given the fact that we were flying so much reduced. The fact is, we also felt that this was not a long-term -- this was not going to be long-term that there was, when it turned it would turn. And as we mentioned in the call, we really began back in April, while we said, how an air -- we still had pilots on voluntary leave, we fired up the training center and started to move forward. The attrition levels increased and then increased again. And I guess, at this point, we\u2019re not counting on them coming down. I do think that they could moderate somewhat, but to moderate to what would still be considered elevated level. We\u2019re also talking to our partners about it and how we might work together, as I mentioned to, that we have to work this problem together and just coming up with a solution on how to best handle this, due to the fact that we -- there is, in fact, that lag that Brad talked about and we need to be able to operate within this new paradigm, where the demand for pilots is it appears to be just very powerful. And again, it was absolutely exacerbated by the early retirements that were offered during the pandemic, which effectively accelerated the impact of the pilot shortage, which, I think, we all know has been artificially created by government regulation regarding the 1,500 hour rule. But Brad, do you want to add something on that?\nBrad Rich: Yeah. Jonathan, I think, you\u2019ve covered it. I mean, I don\u2019t have really anything meaningful to add. That\u2019s the issue.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Helane Becker. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Oh! Thanks very much, Operator. All right. That\u2019s the second mile clock goes off. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. Just a couple of questions here on the five -- to clarify on the five aircraft that were spares that aren\u2019t being flown now, just that -- did that free up pilots or did they immediately go into or did they immediately leave and go to other airlines?\nJonathan Ornstein: Oh! No. We -- the five aircraft, we\u2019re just transitioned out of service. We have had attrition levels that, from best we can tell, and again, this is anecdotal at best. But talking to our partners and talking to other people around the industry, this is not something you need to make by any stretch. At American, for example, our utilization levels, because we did pull the aircraft out, we\u2019re higher than other carriers. But again, is the question of how fast can we train versus how many people we lose, it took us a little bit of time to spool up training, because it\u2019s -- it just leaves us roughly 90 days footprint at best and so it just takes time to catch up with that lag. But as Brad mentioned, we have over 200 pilots in training and we think that we\u2019re going to be able to continue to fulfill our pilot requirements going forward, as best we can tell. I mean, the environment is very volatile and that\u2019s for sure.\nHelane Becker: Got you. And then are there issues with people other than pilots that exists and I know you outsourced most of your maintenance and you already talked about that. But are there other issues\u2026\nJonathan Ornstein: I will let Brad talk about maintenance, but let me just give you an example, where when we say that there\u2019s just labor shortage coming out of, we just are -- it\u2019s amazing. I mean, we have generally fairly high level of attrition within flight attendants. But to give you an example, I mean, this is not even remotely close to the kind of numbers that we\u2019ve seen a trip out and flight attendants, which, thankfully, we can train quickly and we have thousands of applicants. But just to give you an example, one of our partners hired 22 of our flight attendants in eight days. I mean, so their demand levels have exploded. So it\u2019s just like I said, it\u2019s a new regime and we just have to come to grips with it and we are, in fact, acting as fast as we can. But you would never think for a second that you\u2019d be dealing with flight attendant attrition the way it is and effectively a shortage in flight. So, yes, it affects everybody, and I\u2019ll let Brad to talk about the next, obviously, critical is highly trained mechanics. Brad, you want to make a comment.\nBrad Rich: Yeah. I mean, look, Helane, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise, there\u2019s pressure on all labor groups. The thing and mechanics are no exception. The actual numbers, though, we\u2019ve been able to hire a sufficient number of mechanics to keep pace with attrition. And with mechanics, although, you\u2019re getting an inexperienced mechanic, the training footprint is not nearly as long as it is with a pilot.\nHelane Becker: Right.\nBrad Rich: So, although, this pressure, we\u2019ve been keeping up on hiring with the other groups. The pilots have, obviously, get more focus and attention, because of the demand issues or the supply issues and the length of the training footprint.\nHelane Becker: Got you. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Brad. And just if I can follow up, does the management change, American change anything for you with the American contract?\nJonathan Ornstein: No. Nothing, certainly, nothing contractually. But -- I mean, but, Doug and I have been friends since the American went bankruptcy. And certainly, we\u2019re starting to see him go to retire, because he\u2019s always been, we\u2019ve viewed him as a friend and an ally. But we\u2019ve also known Robert Isom for a long time. Brad has worked very closely with their operational people, Devon May. So for the folks that we deal with, I don\u2019t see any significant change. So we like Doug a lot, both professionally and personally and wish him the best. I mean, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be hurt by it. I think that the impact would be -- it\u2019ll be the same thing and contractually, there\u2019s no change. Do you have anything, Brad, something to add?\nHelane Becker: Got you. Thank you. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Oh! Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Hey, Jonathan. The European operation, the 49%, so I guess you\u2019re going to account for that under the equity method. And when does that start showing up in the P&L? Like, what\u2019s the ramp up there, I guess, their startup costs maybe and I don\u2019t know, if there\u2019s some initial CapEx? Can you just -- can you talk about that, because that\u2019s still like that that was going to be a fiscal year 2022 development?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, I\u2019m going to ask Mike to answer that, because he\u2019s been responsible and taking the lead on the European operation. So I\u2019m going to ask Mike to answer those questions.\nMike Linenberg: Great.\nMichael Lotz: Hi, Mike. So, yeah\u2026\nMike Linenberg: Hey.\nMichael Lotz: \u2026 this is Michael Lotz. We were expected. We were working with the multi-regulatory authorities where we\u2019re going to have the certificate and be incorporated. We\u2019re going through the process of getting a certificate. We expect to get that certificate, certainly, in Q2, in the first half of calendar 2022. The startup costs will be minimum. We\u2019re talking not millions of dollars, probably more like hundreds of thousands of dollars to start up. And we\u2019ll be looking for customers in the coming months and go from there.\nMike Linenberg: Is -- are you -- like with respect to staffing and bringing in pilots and the like? Is it -- are you going to run into some of the same, is this operation going to run into some of the same issues that we\u2019re seeing in the U.S.? I noticed pilot and mechanic shortage seems to be global. Like anything on that front that that you\u2019re seeing or that you can highlight for us? Thanks.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yeah. First of all, I want to mention that when Mike said, we\u2019re looking for customers, I think that\u2019s important, because we intend our thought there and our partners thoughts is that we\u2019re going to bring over to Europe much more of a kind of U.S. model capacity purchase agreement. We\u2019ve already begun conversations with large carriers to provide that level of service. As you know, the regional business has been truly decimated in Europe. In terms of personnel, I mean, so I know I\u2019m probably one of the few people in here to keep harping on the 1,500 hour rule, because someone else feels it\u2019s a lost cause, but don\u2019t see the same issues internationally, that you do in the United States, because no other country in the world has adopted these rules. We\u2019ve looked at some situations in other parts of the world as well and when we talk about pilot shortage, they look at us, and say, you know what shortage. So I think that we feel comfortable that with the type of aircraft that we operate there and it likely be a regional jet, we don\u2019t think that that will be a problem. And we feel that we can hire people and retain and attract people without anywhere near the level of difficulty that we have here. And it\u2019s kind of crazy to think of Europe being less regulated in some respects than the United States, but at least when it comes to pilots that\u2019s the case.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. And then, Jonathan or Mike or Brad, can I just sneak in one last one. You talked about the attrition rate being high, did you throw out a number, what percent, what you\u2019re seeing right now, whether it\u2019s pilots or flight attendants, anything on that front would be great? Thanks and thanks for taking my questions.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yeah. I mean, the pilot numbers are short all over the Board. Although, I will tell you they have been increasing since we -- I can\u2019t say, look, the -- unfair to say exit COVID. But as COVID had begun to sort of wind down, the numbers went up and it\u2019s all been driven by hiring at the major level and I think that that\u2019s really what\u2019s driven it. But we have in the past under high levels of attrition. We\u2019re -- we\u2019ve seen numbers in the 25 to 30 range, and occasionally, it\u2019s popped up a little bit higher than that in terms of total pilots. Again, it\u2019s just a question of where things level off and what happens? But -- and it\u2019s run higher in a couple months, it\u2019s run lower, but it\u2019s really hard to say right now, because it\u2019s going to be dependent upon where things shake out. And the other thing, too, is, I do believe that our partners realize that this is a problem for all of us. There\u2019s attrition going on throughout the industry, no one is immune, I mean, no one is immune. A lot of regionals like ourselves have had to fly lower ours. I actually am not aware of any regionals that flying at the levels that we were back in 2019 according to our partners. We may be the closest at American. But I think the fact that matter and that\u2019s -- and to be fair, that\u2019s only because we pulled those aircraft out. So, I mean, we\u2019re not, there\u2019s nothing magical there. I think it\u2019s really a question of how effective we are at not just retaining pilots, but also attracting people. And as one of the drums that we have been beating with our partners is, we really need to focus on ways not just to keep people within the United ecosystem or the American ecosystem, but actually to bring people and sort of refill the reservoir of pilots that in, in fact, is being drained with expansion of flying, as well as the -- all the retirements that are occurring.\nMike Linenberg: Thanks. Thanks, Jonathan. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: And we have another question from Savi Syth. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey. Thanks. I was just kind of curious on the cargo fronts. It sounds like you\u2019re executing well there, getting another eight looks on the fleet land, you\u2019re getting that third aircraft as well. Just any update on how you can expand that or what we can expect in the next year or two?\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. Clearly we did not enter the cargo business for three aircraft. I mean, it\u2019s just not an efficient operation. It\u2019s -- just there\u2019s lots of reasons why it needs to be bigger. In fact, one of the reasons why we got the third aircraft was just because we were nervous about only having two aircraft and not having a spare. Operationally, we found that we were -- we did operate with only two airplanes and we exceeded -- I can tell you, without a doubt that we exceeded DHL expectations over the year. So I think that we are very well positioned for growth. The DHL\u2019s of the world. Amazon, they don\u2019t add growth nilly -- willy-nilly, they\u2019re very thoughtful. But I think in our conversations with DHL, they are well aware that and are supportive of the fact that for us to be successful long-term and they\u2019ve clearly indicated that they want us in the portfolio and that they\u2019ve made clear without a doubt, that we have to be larger. And can we go to six airplanes, eight airplanes, 10 airplanes, I would say that, it\u2019s probably a fair statement that we\u2019re below eight airplanes, it\u2019s hard for us to really spread our costs around. And I think that the target for us to be to -- to be at least at that number over the next few years. It won\u2019t happen fast. We\u2019ve made a big investment so far, which clearly has impacted our numbers as well. But they have made it very clear that they would like to see us remain in the portfolio and they\u2019re going to help us do that.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Speakers I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time.\nJonathan Ornstein: All right. In conclusion, I just want to say finally, it has been a tough quarter for us. My first segment about who would have thought it would be harder to exit COVID than to enter COVID. The rapidity at which demand levels at least domestically increased and the fact that majors were anxious to put so much additional capacity. It\u2019s not as if it caught us by surprise. It\u2019s just that even starting training back in April, while we still had pilots on VLAA [ph]. It\u2019s just taking time, as you know, to get back up to the speed that we want to we would like to be at. The situation has been difficult. We were, as you know, we\u2019ve frankly said that, attrition levels have still not come down, they are still high and we are going to continue to work as best we can to make sure that we can provide as many block hours as possible. I think that we feel that we\u2019ve got these issues to deal with over the near-term. But as I mentioned also, we do feel that not all the fundamentals of the industry are intact long-term, but we think we\u2019ve laid a good base here at Mesa and we\u2019ll see that benefit over the long-term as well. So, with that, we appreciate your time. We will continue to work hard to do the best we can and if you have any additional questions, as always feel free to call any of us after the call or this week, whenever you need to have any additional information. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That will conclude today\u2019s conference and we thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 3, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-08-10 03:09:07", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to Mesa Airlines Q3 Investor Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Donofrio, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Donofrio, you may begin.\nSusan Donofrio: Thank you, operator and welcome everyone to Mesa\u2019s earnings call for its third fiscal quarter ended June 30. This call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast. A replay of this call can be found on our website. On the call with me today are Jonathan Ornstein, Mesa\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Brad Rich, EVP and COO; Michael Lotz, President and CFO; and Torque Zubeck, Senior VP, Finance, as well as other members of the management team. Following our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for the sell-side analysts. We also wanted to remind everyone on the call today that today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the company\u2019s current expectations and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected by the forward-looking statements, including the risk factors discussed in our reports and filed with the SEC. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In comparing our results today, we will be adjusting all periods to exclude special items. Please refer to our third fiscal quarter earnings release, which is available on our website for the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures. With that, I will turn it over to Jonathan for his opening remarks. Jonathan?\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you very much, Susan. I\u2019d like to start of course by thanking our dedicated people here at Mesa for their continued focus and support throughout this truly unprecedented time. The team\u2019s ability to adapt in a difficult environment while responding to rapid changes in demand is truly a testament to their capabilities and dedication. While Brad and Torque will go through the details, I would like to jump into some of the highlights from this quarter. On the financial side, we reported a pre-tax profit of $5.8 million and net income of $4.3 million or $0.11 per diluted share. We did take delivery of the last 4 Embraer 175 LLs to bring our total flying for the United up to 80 aircraft. We reported a sizable increase in our year-over-year block hours and subsequent to quarter end, we invested in a second electric aircraft company. On the operational side, we have seen a significant increase in activity with our partners. We believe this is mostly due to the volume of vaccination and easing of COVID restrictions. Not only did we increase the number of flights, utilization of our current fleet, but we also took on additional flying at the request of our partners. As domestic traffic continues to improve, this increase in flight demand has created some challenges, primarily around supply chain and MRO production capabilities. As a result, we have seen a significant increase in the time of our contracted heavy maintenance providers having to perform C-checks on our CRJ-900 fleet. Costs have also increased in part due to interior refurbishments on the 900 fleet and Brad will give you some more details on this later. Besides the continual improvements, upgrades and expansions in our fleet in response to our flying partners\u2019 needs, we are also investing in the next generation of aircraft technology. We believe that more sustainable aviation operations will be essential part of air travel in the future. Remaining at the forefront of that movement, we believe will help ensure the longevity and strength of our company for years to come. We also think that by entering into these new ventures with our major airline partners, we continue to strengthen our long-term relationships. Our investment in Heart Aerospace, which plans to produce the world\u2019s first electric 19-seat aircraft the ES19, is a large part of that investment in a greener fleet. We have ordered and plan to add 100 ES19 aircraft to our regional fleet once they become available, which is targeted for 2026. This would make us one of the first network of carriers to help decarbonize air travel through the use of electric aircraft. We will also be able to fly once again to the dozens of cities that have previously \u2013 we have previously flown to that currently have little or no service. As an example, Farmington, New Mexico, where our corporate company was founded and our former headquarters existed, previously had 40 flights per day serving 5 destinations. While there is no commercial service today, we believe that these highly efficient aircraft would allow us to reconnect communities like Farmington to the national transportation system. This goes hand-in-hand with our investment in Archer Aviation with its eVTOL aircraft, which was announced in February of 2021. I would also like to add that beyond the 100 aircraft that we ordered, our partners at United also ordered 100 aircraft. We think that investing in clean aircraft technology is the right decision. Investing with our partners is a better decision and creating a better environment for our children and our children\u2019s children is the best decision both as a responsible company and as responsible individuals. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Brad to provide an update on our operational performance this quarter. Brad?\nBrad Rich: Thank you, Jonathan and good afternoon to everyone. Again, thank you for joining us today. First of all, the health and safety of our employees and our passengers remains one of our top priorities. We continue to work cooperatively with our partners and we are following the CDC\u2019s latest guidance. Additionally, the flying with our mainline partners remains a cornerstone of our strategy and we remain committed to meeting their performance and capacity objectives. By way of review of the June quarter, we flew 85,162 block hours, which is 169.3% increase from last year and a 15.2% increase above last quarter. We are pleased to see demand for air travel recovering and returning closer to pre-pandemic levels. Based on current guidance from our partners, we expect the September quarter\u2019s daily aircraft utilization in our United operations to be at about 88% of pre-COVID levels and slightly over 100% in our American operation. We currently believe that demand levels will remain strong throughout the balance of the year. That being said, we remain flexible to changes in the demand environment and in our partners\u2019 requirements. During the June quarter, our combined controllable completion factor was 99.7% compared to 100% a year ago. Our controllable on-time departure rate was 88% versus 94.1% a year ago. Overall, our main objective continues to be providing high quality, reliable service for our partners and customers as we have done for almost 4 years. We recognize however that the entire aviation industry continues to face historical challenges, including the rapid increase in demand, employee turnover and hiring, MRO production issues and an overall shortage of parts and materials. Despite our focus on solving these challenges, we are not immune to these factors impacting our operation. To further review the parts and materials industry challenge, we continue to see interruptions in parts availability, which is driving costs higher associated with scheduled heavy maintenance and interior refurbishment upgrades. This also lengthened the time span of our heavy checks, thus impeding our ability to return our aircraft into service and to add additional aircraft into heavy maintenance. The result has been a reduction in the number of spare aircraft to support our daily operations. We anticipate elevated costs of C-check times \u2013 and C-check times will remain a challenge into the next fiscal year as the supply chain recovers. It\u2019s important to note that these issues are primarily impacting our CRJ-900 fleet. With regard to our United operation, we took delivery of the last 4 E-175 LLs in the quarter, bringing our total E-175 fleet to 80 aircraft. Our controllable completion factor was 100% and our controllable on-time departure rate was 94.8% for the quarter. We are very pleased with our United performance, which places us in the top tier ranking versus our peers during the quarter. In addition to adding all of the new E-175 LL aircraft, we also completed our transition training for our CRJ-700 pilots to the Embraer aircraft. Additionally, we are hiring and upgrading at an elevated pace to make sure we stay ahead of attrition and are positioned to meet the increasing demand in the United network. We have removed all of the CRJ-700s from our operations and we continue the transition process of leasing these 20 CRJ-700 aircraft to GoJet Airlines as part of the previously announced agreement, which ends in 2030. 13 of these aircrafts have been transitioned, with the remaining 7 scheduled by the end of the calendar year. Now, I would like to provide a quick update on our American operation. As I previously mentioned, our CRJ-900s have been particularly impacted by part shortages and 900s makeup our entire American fleet. In the June quarter, we met performance expectations in April and May, but we have had more challenges in June and July with the increased capacity. The aforementioned concerns with parts were a key driver of this and led to a lack of spare aircraft to support the operation. For August, we remain to have a very high level of focus on our American operation. As a reminder, we agreed to fly 5 additional lines of flying over the summer that expire in mid-August. These aircraft will become available as spare aircraft to support the American system, which we believe will contribute to enhanced operational performance and reliability. With our continued focus on performance, we are making significant investments in the CRJ-900 fleet in heavy checks and cabin interior improvements. It\u2019s important to note our current C-check volume is at a historical high and more than double the normal planned run-rate. Our DHL operation continues to perform well and we are making progress in bringing on a third 737 that we expect to provide operational support and additional flying opportunities. I would like to make some additional comments about our outlook on labor. We remain very focused on hiring and training to meet increasing staffing requirements in nearly all of our operational divisions. Our applicant pools remain strong and we believe in our ability to hire across the airline. We remain active in the hiring of pilots and have hired 250 pilots since April with training in full capacity. Furthermore, we feel like we are well positioned to be an attractive option for regional pilots through opportunities such as The United Aviate program, where we are one of few regional airlines able to offer a direct pathway for our pilots to become a career pilot for United Airlines. The 737 aircraft, we are the only regional airline offering the opportunity to fly larger aircraft and earn the highest pay in the regional industry. We are well positioned with crew domiciles across the country that allow our pilots the opportunity to live where they desire and commute easily to work. We are also offering upgrade opportunities and actively recruiting from hundreds of aviation schools across the country. With that, I would now like to turn the time over to Torque to walk through our financial performance.\nTorque Zubeck: Great. Thank you, Brad. Let me do a quick review of our financial performance and then provide some color on our business outlook. I will wrap up with a discussion of our capital outlook and balance sheet. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we reported net income of $4.3 million or $0.11 per diluted share. This compares favorably to net income of $3.4 million for the same quarter last year or $0.10 per diluted share. Let me review where we are in cash and liquidity, cash for the quarter, excluding restricted cash, increased by $32.5 million to $180.4 million. As we have previously reported, we expect our fiscal year ending cash balance will be approximately $100 million to $110 million. The reduction from Q3 to Q4 is primarily due to higher-than-normal scheduled debt payments of $27 million, one-time deferred debt payments of $19 million, and partner true-ups of roughly $25 million. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $713.7 million, which is down $11 million from the prior quarter. Assuming no additional debt, the balance will be reduced by $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and by roughly $100 million in each of the fiscal years 2022 and 2023. This brings the total debt balance down to roughly $465 million at fiscal year end 2023. There was $5.4 million of CapEx in the quarter, of which $2.8 million was inventory and $2.4 million was capitalized C-checks. Going forward, CapEx for Q4 is forecast at $10 million. For fiscal year 2022, we still have 4 additional engine deliveries and no other major capital expenditures. Lastly, on liquidity, the company received $52.2 million in PSP3 funds in Q3, covering the period April through September 2021. Consistent with PSP1 and PSP2, we are providing our partners with temporary rate reductions over the covered period. Rates will return to prior levels after September. Turning now to provide you with a brief update on our European joint venture investment with Gramercy Associates Limited, we continue to make progress on the project and we are expecting to start operations in calendar year 2022. Due to EU regulations, Mesa will be a minority partner in the JV, but Mesa will be providing technical support and expertise to help with the startup. Let me now touch on guidance. Although the environment is still volatile, we did want to provide guidance in a few areas. So, block hours are straightforward and we expect similar levels for the September 2021 through March 2022 quarters. For our pass-through maintenance expense, and as you know, this has a zero P&L impact and it\u2019s not related to our level of ops and more related to timing of events. So, we have provided to you our best estimates in our press release. For heavy maintenance, which is engine and C-checks, we have provided our estimates in our press release. These amounts are higher than what we would consider normal run-rates. Much of this work is a result of deferred C-checks, which as Brad touched on are taking longer and costing more than anticipated for the CRJ-900 fleet. This is expected to spill into next fiscal year. For Q4, we anticipate maintenance expense, including C-check maintenance, to be roughly $6 million higher than Q3. Also in Q4 and leading into fiscal year 2022, we will see an increase in flight ops costs relative to block hours as we spool up the pilot training program to meet anticipated demand going forward. I would now like to turn it over to Jonathan. Jonathan?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes, hi. Sorry about that. I muted myself for Torque. Thank you, Torque. We appreciate the financial recap. While we remain focused on our core business, we are also strengthening our partner relationships through investments in cutting-edge technology companies. We intend to be the regional leader in decarbonization and electric aircraft with the goal of reintroducing commercial air service to rural America and decongesting our cities. Finally, we believe our DHL cargo flying and our European growth plans are just a start as we continue to look for and pursue new growth opportunities. At this point, operator, please open up the call. And we would all be happy to answer any questions that the analysts may have.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon. Just following up on the June operational performance, I am guessing that the controllable operation performance at American is related to the maintenance side. You do have 19 CR-J900s that are kind of spares or kind of not doing anything. Are those just not available, because the required maintenance hasn\u2019t been caught up or kind of curious why that was \u2013 why those can\u2019t be used, sorry?\nJonathan Ornstein: Brad or Mike, do you guys want to take that? I think we all are pretty familiar with that subject.\nBrad Rich: Sure Jonathan. I will be happy to address it. Savi, it\u2019s a very good question. Obviously, as we were all going through the pandemic and looking for ways to conserve cash, certainly, some of the heavy checks and things were deferred in anticipation of going to agreement that was around 40 or so aircraft. And when we signed the extension and then agreed to do additional flying, we knew that we had to get additional C-checks in motion. We signed up additional vendors, put a lot more airplanes in C-check, and as we described, the very quick answer is due to the reasons that we have talked about, the airplanes just have not come out of C-check on the time spans that we expected. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s created the lack of support airplane to fly the system.\nSavi Syth: That makes sense. Just regarding both kind of flight operations and kind of the maintenance on a kind of per block hour basis, I know your maintenance you said will remain elevated into kind of next fiscal year. What do you kind of expect the new normal for these two kind of line items to be and when do you think is likely that we get there?\nMichael Lotz: Hey, Savi, it\u2019s Mike. I will take that. I think on the pilot cost per block hour. It\u2019s actually on a per block hour basis. It\u2019s been relatively high due to the \u2013 we have kept most of the employees on the payroll and had obviously depressed number of block hours. And we are just spooling up the training again now. So we would like to get back to kind of run-rate kind of pilot block hour \u2013 cost per block hour, probably by the second or third quarter of 2022.\nSavi Syth: And what was that roughly, Mike, because I know previously, it was a bit elevated because you were catching up on training and we were going to get to a new level, but I was kind of curious what that new normal is?\nMichael Lotz: Yes, it was around $450 million prior to COVID.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And then on the maintenance side?\nMichael Lotz: Maintenance is \u2013 on the block hour side, again, probably in the second or third quarter, but the bigger piece of the maintenance is the C-checks and the engines and the C-checks, again, not till the third quarter of 2022, we see it start going back down to where kind of a more normal run-rate would be.\nSavi Syth: Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. And if I could just add something, Savi, when we talk about an increased span on the C-checks, I mean, we had planned in very close cooperation with our vendors, for C-checks to last 30 to 35 days. And unfortunately and this is really focusing on the 900 fleet, because of delays in parts from the manufacturer, we saw that timeframe extend out past 60, 65 days on average and in some cases even further. That\u2019s just something that the supply chain has to work out. But it did cause the delay. And not only did it delay the aircraft in C-check, it then delayed those who were lining up to get into C-check. And so that\u2019s how we end up with while we have extensively 19 spare aircraft, a much fewer number as those aircraft just take much longer to get through than what had been projected by us and by the vendors.\nSavi Syth: That makes sense. And clearly, not something just you are seeing, you are seeing that across the industry. Appreciate the responses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for your time this afternoon. So, one question with respect to operational issues in America and I know there were some issues in Dallas with weather. Are you seeing those kind of issues too, like weather-related issues that are causing flight cancellations or are they operational because crews are at a place? Is it a combination of both? Maybe some color on that?\nBrad Rich: Jonathan, do you want me to take that one?\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. Go right ahead.\nBrad Rich: Yes, sure. I\u2019ll give it the first shot. And Helane, obviously, you are paying very close attention to the industry and your observation is obviously very accurate. And yes, the weather certainly has impacted the operation. But look, the main focus \u2013 I mean, we are not having crew shortages. I mean our flight attendant numbers have been really good. Our pilot situation, especially on the American side is healthy. So the weather impact to us, yes, it causes all those related issues on crews timing out and all of that issue. But look, our primary issue has been that when we have the weather-related operational interruption. The inability to reset the system with adequate spare ratio has really been the core of our problem.\nHelane Becker: Okay, alright. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks Brad. And then the other question I had was on \u2013 and you answered one of them, which is any issues with flight attendants showing up to work. But the other one is on attrition. You mentioned that you want to stay ahead of attrition on the pilot hiring and you hired 250 since April. Can you say actually what your attrition rate is?\nBrad Rich: Well, I\u2019ll answer it this way. With 250 pilots in the pipeline right now, that is \u2013 that should be, we certainly believe, that\u2019s going to be adequate to stay ahead of the attrition. And Jonathan, I don\u2019t know if you want to give more specific guidance than that.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. I mean, Helane, just a couple of things. On the pilot side, during the pandemic, our pilot attrition was literally in single digit. We saw a spike as things started to pick up to a somewhat higher number, but still below where we were pre-pandemic. 250 would be more than adequate, assuming those numbers stay about at those levels. I think that what instructions that we\u2019ve basically told the training department is we\u2019re long on the American side. We know we\u2019re going to take on more flying, we know that we\u2019ve got more flying at United. There is things that we can do. Just go out there, and we\u2019re not hiring for attrition right now. We\u2019re hiring to build up a additional cushion so that we can continue to take on more flying. Interestingly, in spite of the fact that we\u2019re flying fewer airplanes for American, we are flying higher utilization rates than we did pre-pandemic in terms of per day flying. So I think we just want to be on the safe side and just get ahead of the game and stay ahead of the game. On the question you had about the aircraft, I just want to mention again, when you have 19 spare aircraft, 19 additional aircraft, you don\u2019t think of not having enough aircraft is an issue. But the C-check problem, which \u2013 it did affect other parties in the industry, not everybody, but it did affect quite a few of the other CRJ operators, is not insignificant. We are starting to see some improvement right now, but it was very quickly sucked up a lot of those spares that we had counted on in particular, after we had taken on the five additional flying \u2013 five additional aircraft flying that American asked us to, which we were delighted to be able to accommodate. But clearly, we had anticipated these aircraft coming through C-check in 30 days, not 65 to 70 days.\nHelane Becker: Right. Got it. That\u2019s helpful, Jonathan. And then the other question I had was on your EV investments because I know you\u2019re really passionate about that. And so now you have this investment with Heart and you have an investment with Archer.\nJonathan Ornstein: Archer.\nHelane Becker: Yes, with Archer right. Sorry, that\u2019s my clock. Should we think about others? I mean, are you like a full service \u2013 are you going to be a full service operator of all of these or are you limiting yourself? How should we think about your passion for this business?\nJonathan Ornstein: I appreciate that. And I think \u2013 as you know, we\u2019ve been \u2013 we had partnered with United on these first two, and we would frankly love to expand our partnerships with our other partner, American Airlines, if possible. I think the best way to look at it is when Scott, Kirby and I discussed it was we\u2019re making investments in technology. Some of the technology will work, some may not. But that \u2013 we\u2019re basically going to be out there as a leader so that we can determine first what we think is going to be successful. So along with the new United ventures head up by Mike Leskinen. I think that we will continue to look and to take \u2013 make opportunities occur where we see long-term growth and a marketplace for them and the technology as it develops. There is a lot of interesting technology out there today. I\u2019ve continued to visit companies. I actually visited the company today that was very exciting. And these are cutting-edge companies. And I think to ignore what\u2019s going on, electric is inevitable. And for any company to ignore that, I mean, they are going to be dinosaurs. And I think that United has taken a lead on this. American just did something on eVTOL. Now we\u2019ve done it. I think it\u2019s really important that we continue to move forward and continue to look at opportunities as they develop.\nHelane Becker: Thank you. Thanks, Jonathan and Mike. \nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bert Subin from Stifel. Your line is open.\nBert Subin: Hey, good afternoon Thanks for the time. Jonathan, I asked you this question, I think, two quarters ago when the passenger recovery story was maybe a little less understood. Today, the Delta variant\u2019s sort of creating some additional concerns \u2013 potentially temporary concerns around travel. But cargo side, things remain really strong, and the supply story is certainly more constrained. Where we stand today, are you seeing the best organic growth opportunities still on the regional passenger side or is it \u2013 do you think it\u2019s starting to tilt toward cargo?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, it\u2019s interesting that you say that. Prior to the Delta variant impacting as widely as it has, I think we all began to believe that the passenger side really had the sort of most upside from \u2013 on a relative basis. I\u2019m a little concerned. I think most people are about what that impact is going to be going into the fall. On the cargo side, we continue to see very good strength. We\u2019re adding this third aircraft. The question is where do we go from here? I think if we\u2019re going to continue to add aircraft, we may have to look at the 737-400 is sort of limited. I think that the 737-800 may be the next aircraft we look at. But the strength within the cargo market is there. It\u2019s just that I think it\u2019s also fairly well known that you\u2019re not going to get an order for 25 aircrafts. The cargo operators go much more incrementally. And thankfully, we\u2019ve always taken a long-term view. So I think our position is we will just keep plugging along. We\u2019re doing an excellent job for DHL, that I\u2019m very confident of. And then as we continue to develop that kind of relationship with DHL, I\u2019m confident that will continue to grow. But I still feel that on the passenger side and with our partners, there still continues to be a significant amount of opportunity as the domestic traffic at least continues to be strong.\nBert Subin: Just as a clarification maybe on the cargo side, going from two. I guess you\u2019re going from two to three. The third one, though, is not under contract. You\u2019re just sparing it. What\u2019s the gap in going from two to four to six? Is that just having a track record in the space? And then ultimately, over time, you build the operations?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. I think the track record is clearly important. But I have to say, I mean, I think our people have done an excellent job developing that track record. I talk to the folks there at DHL pretty frequently. One of our former Board members worked with them as well. I think that we added the third just because at the time when we started that process, we were concerned about reliability with only two aircraft. The reliability actually has been excellent. We continue to move forward with it because DHL had said that they have plenty of work to do with the aircraft just on an ad hoc basis. So I think it\u2019s just a matter of time, and we just continue down the path and say, we\u2019re in this for the long haul, and we\u2019re proving ourselves operationally every day. And then our commitment, I think, is important to DHL also. And by taking on the third aircraft, I think we\u2019re showing really extraordinary commitment that we want this to work. So all in all, I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s the right thing to do by taking on that third airplane. And I think ultimately, they will find a home for that aircraft pretty quickly.\nBert Subin: Got it. Thanks for that. Just one last question for me, probably for Mike, just, I would say, probably more theoretical in nature. But how should we think about the long-term sustainability of your cost advantage? Pilots sort of interestingly went from a shortage to a surplus now back to a shortage. Can you just walk us through maybe what gives you conviction that you can continue to run a leaner operation than peers when we get on the other side of COVID? Thanks for the time.\nMichael Lotz: Sure. I mean, look, I think the best way to answer it is that I\u2019ve been getting this question for 20 years is can you continue to maintain a cost advantage over your peers? And we\u2019ve been able to do it over time. And there is nothing that I see going forward that would prevent us to continue to have that advantage over our peers. It\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s the kind of way we run the company. We\u2019re very conscientious of where we\u2019re spending our money. We try to get as much efficiencies from our crews that we can, which we\u2019ve been very successful at.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. And I would say, too, that we have some structural benefits right now that I think make it hard for anyone to catch it, not the least of which is because we\u2019ve expanded so much over the last 5 years, we have a relatively junior workforce. There was a point in time a year ago where half of our employees had less than 3 years seniority. I think that we \u2013 that\u2019s an advantage on the cost side that\u2019s going to be hard to overcome. And any growth that we have on top of that will just further enhance that advantage.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is open. Savi, please check your mute button, your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Thank you. Sorry about that. Thanks for the follow-up. And just on the European JV side. I know last time you had maybe a couple of aircraft as placeholders there, not in your kind of outlook now. How are you thinking about the timing of when \u2013 and the opportunity there?\nMichael Lotz: Yes. So we\u2019re looking at starting up in the first quarter \u2013 first calendar quarter of 2022. And look, we are just really looking closely at the cost benefit analysis of taking an FAA Mesa aircraft, reconfiguring it to all coach, getting it [indiscernible] certified versus just potentially leasing an aircraft that may already be over in Europe in that configuration from an experience standpoint of start-up. So we\u2019re still in the evaluation phases. So we\u2019re not sure which way we\u2019re going to go, but we\u2019re still evaluating both options.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. And I think it\u2019s fair to say, Savi, that our view on that has changed somewhat because there are aircraft now available, which were not necessarily available pre-COVID now available at very reasonable rates that, as Mike mentioned, before getting around to the whole conversion, they are just a very attractively priced aircraft right now in the marketplace. And we do think that the gaps in Europe continue to get bigger and the opportunities exist. And I think that \u2013 we think there is some real advantages for us going in sort of fresh versus where a lot of the carriers are today. It was crazy. I was at Gutenberg to visit Heart, and it\u2019s a big airport. And I\u2019m there in the middle of the day on a Wednesday. And I counted no kidding, two aircraft on the ramp. And you just know that in some of these cities, the service has been decimated by COVID, and I really do believe that there is an opportunity for us long-term and also an opportunity whereby we could form sort of American-style partnerships, capacity purchase agreements with some of the larger carriers.\nSavi Syth: And Jonathan remind me again, because in the U.S., you have this kind of pilot arbitrage opportunity and kind of training and pipeline. What\u2019s the advantage that you have in Europe?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, I think, one, if I had to rank them, this is just one, a U.S. operating mentality, I think, is no small part of it. A large part too is the fact that a lot of the regional carriers there are effectively vulcanized on the UC carriers there with two of these airplanes, three of those, two of those. We looked at one company that we were potentially going to acquire, and they had purchased, I think, 6 Embraer 175s for $32 million a piece. I mean that\u2019s $8 million more than what we would have paid. I also think that by setting the operation up properly and in particular in a location like Malta, which not surprisingly, a company like Ryanair is a big base. There are advantages to how you set the operation up and where you set it up, something Mike and I became very familiar with when we were over there, operating in Brussels. So I think our expertise, the fact that we have a lot of the operating capability already, I think that \u2013 and the relationships that we have, I think all those things would give us an advantage over the existing carriers.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. And if I can quickly follow-up on the \u2013 your comments on the cargo, if you do end up buying kind of -800 freighters instead of the -400s, Is there a difference in training or cost or anything like that or is that a pretty seamless fleet to introduce?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, I mean, if we put larger aircraft 737-800s and some folks have talked about ATRs and some \u2013 there is all kinds of aircraft that people \u2013 that have been thrown at us as opportunities. Yes, there is always cost in the start-up. But again, looking at it long-term, I just think that we have to be prepared to respond to things that our partners or other partners may \u2013 would like to see us operate. So yes, there\u2019d be some expense, but I would say also that the bulk of the expenses are already sunk given the \u2013 having put the 737-400s on certificate.\nMichael Lotz: We would \u2013 this is Mike. We would have to put it on certificate, but Brad can correct me, but the crews can be cross utilized between 400 and an 800. So we would benefit from that efficiency.\nSavi Syth: Perfect. Thanks, helpful. Alright, thank you.\nOperator: We have no additional questions in the queue at this time.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Well, in conclusion, again, thank you, everybody, for taking the time out. We feel that we\u2019re very pleased to have been profitable and profitable through COVID. I think our people have done a terrific job and really brave out there. I mean I have to say, I can\u2019t think of a better word to describe than brave in this environment through a pandemic. We\u2019ve seen just tremendous dedication across all of the folks, whether it\u2019s pilots, the flight attendants, mechanics, people in our dispatch the people that are coming into the office every day, I just can\u2019t tell you how much \u2013 I know all of us on the phone appreciate the work that they have done. We are also \u2013 want to thank our partners who have been incredibly supportive having to go through their own challenges right now, both of which have been understanding and helpful. We continue to work very cooperatively with them. We were not entirely pleased with what happened to us in June as a result of the aircraft shortage. But again, that will be worked through the \u2013 that issue actually resolves itself when we take back the five airplanes. And as these suppliers start getting \u2013 the vendors start getting the aircraft out of C-check, which is now happening. And so I think from our standpoint, the best thing we can do is just keep our nose to the grindstone operationally and continue to do a good job. And lastly, we were pleased to close the Heart deal. We do think that there is a big future in electric and other forms of decarbonization. We\u2019re going to continue to pursue that. We really are pleased to have United as a partner on those two deals and we\u2019d like to expand those partnerships. And we think that longer term, it could be very exciting for the company. So we appreciate all of your support, and we look forward to talking to you at our next call. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

All participants are on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to, CEO and Chairman, Jonathan Ornstein. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, operator, good afternoon and thank you for standing-by everyone on the call. I'd like to welcome you to the second quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to me. This is Jonathan Ornstein. I'm the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mesa Airlines. On the call with me today is, Mike Lotz, our President and Chief Financial Officer; Brian Gillman, our Executive VP and General Counsel; and Brad Rich, our Chief Operating Officer; and Torque Zubeck, our new Senior Vice President of Finance. You may have seen the announcement. But to reiterate, Torque brings 20 years of industry experience from Alaska Airlines, and will be a terrific asset on both the operational and financial side of our business.

In addition, please refer to our press release in the Investors section of the Mesa Airlines' website to find additional disclosure and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that will be used on today's call. Okay. I'd like to begin with my usual way by thanking all of our people in the field for their dedication and hard work throughout what is clearly one of the most, if not the most challenging period for our industry. Thank you, everybody. In spite of this tough environment, I'd like to cover a number of highlights from the quarter. On the financial side, we reported the pretax profit of $7.6 million, which included a $4.5 million non-cash adjustment for the purchase of a previously leased CRJ-900, resulting in an adjusted pretax profit of $12.1 million or $0.23 per share. At American, after reaching an agreement to extend our capacity purchase agreement in November 2020, for five years for 40 aircraft, American increased that number about five additional aircrafts starting in January and extending through the summer months. At United, we added two more of the 20 new Embraer 175 LL aircraft roughly, with the last two deliveries expected next month, bringing the total Embraer 175 fleet to 80. In our cargo operation, we are adding third 737-400, which we expect to be in service in July to support the existing operation. As a reminder, we are the first and only regional airlines to operate narrow body cargo aircraft and will continue to pursue additional cargo opportunities. We announced our LOI with Gramercy Associates to begin regional jet operations in Europe, with some of our surplus CRJ-900s. Gramercy is a private company, founded by Tony Davis. Tony is the former CEO of Tiger Airlines in Singapore and Australia and bmibaby. He is also the former COO of Irelandia Aviation. Importantly, we are making significant strides in our adoption of new technology and decarbonization of air travel. This quarter we announced our investment in Archer Aviation's eVTOL aircraft alongside United Airlines. In the transaction, Mesa United receive equity in Archer Aviation in the form of warrants and will purchase up to 200, that\u2019s 160 for United and 40 for Mesa subject to certain conditions. During the quarter, Mesa recorded initial 40% vesting awards at $16.3 million. So, it may seem cutting edge, we are essentially going back to our roots, operating smaller, efficient aircraft. We are excited to be at the forefront of this eVTOL technology, continue to pursue other opportunities in the area of sustainability and eco-friendly flying. We are also proud to be named to the Forbes List of America's Best Mid-Sized Employees for 2021. Our relationship with our employees is of critical importance to us and we're pleased to see our efforts recognized. Once again, I'd like to thank all of our people for making this possible. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brad Rich, our Chief Operating Officer to give you an update on our level of operations as well as our American United and DHL operational performance. Brad, thank you.\nBrad Rich: All right. Thank you, Jonathan and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to begin with highlighting some of our main priorities. First, the health and safety of our employees and passengers remain at the top of our priority list. As you would expect, we're in constant contact with our partners and the CDC on the latest guidance and protocols. We're also committed to improving our operational performance as a high priority. Our collective work with our partners continues to strengthen these relationships and we're committed to continuous improvement of our performance. Now, while all of the new things going on and the new ventures at the company are exciting, I would like to reemphasize that the key to maintaining these long-term relationships is delivering consistently strong operational performance and producing industry-leading economics. By way of review of the March quarter, we generated 73,942 block hours, which was down 32% from last year, but 6.8% from the December quarter and that's despite flying fewer aircraft in the American operation. Based on current guidance from our partners, we expect the June quarter utilization in United operation to be at about 75% to 80% of pre-COVID levels and in the American operation at approximately 100% of pre-COVID. The September quarter is projected to be 85% to 90% at United and a little over 100% in our American operation. If recent demand trends continue, we anticipate a steady increase in block hours as we progress towards a strong recovery in capacity. As far as operational performance, we continue to see improvements in our key operational performance metrics. During the March quarter, our controllable completion factor was 99.9%, which is consistent with 99.9% a year ago, but we've seen very good improvement in our controllable on-time departures, which was 91.1% versus 81.3% a year ago. As I said, focus on continual improvement in operational performance will remain one of our highest priorities. I'd now like to provide an update on our American operation. As Jonathan stated, we previously announced both a five-year extension that was finalized in the December quarter, as well as an agreement with American to add five additional CRJ aircraft above those CPA levels. Subsequent to quarter end, we formalize the agreement to operate those five additional aircraft through mid August of 2021, and we believe there maybe additional future opportunities. As a reminder, our current fleet consists of 64 CRJ-900s. Of these 64 aircraft, we own 49 and 41 of those are financed under our previously announced US treasury loans. And seven are financed with EDC, Export Development Bank Canada. We also have 15 aircraft leased through 2024. We will be using the majority of these aircraft to support the American operation. However, we are still reviewing several new opportunities that would productively utilize some of these aircraft. Given the attractive financing and low debt balance on the majority of the fleet, we believe these aircraft are valuable assets and will remain productive. We are making a number of investments in our CRJ fleet, designed to improve the overall fleet help, enhance long-term value and strengthen operational reliability. These investments include cabin interior refurbishment and a significant increase in the volume of aircraft heavy checks. We have a historically high level of heavy check lines due to bringing aircraft online as demand continues to strengthen and to create additional operational spare support to enhance performance. Access to and productivity of the heavy check providers has been challenging, but we're working very aggressively to add additional providers to bring aircraft back into operation as quickly as possible. Due to all the investments in the fleet and our focus on performance, we do remain confident in our ability to meet the operational requirements of the new agreement with American. Now moving to an update of our United operation. Our relationship with United remains strong and productive. We continue to work collectively on many strategic and operational initiatives that we feel will create additional value in our relationship. We are proud to be one of few airlines taking delivery of new aircraft in today's difficult environment. And by way about date, we currently have 18 new E-175 LR aircraft that have been placed into service between November of 2020 and May of 2021. The last two will be delivered by the end of June 21. We have removed all of the CRJ-700 from our fleet. And we continue to the transition process of leasing these 20 CRJ- 700 aircraft to GoJet airlines as part of the previously announced agreement, which ends in 2030. We are in the final month of retraining the current CRJ-700 pilots in Washington Dulles on the Embraer 175s and most of that training expense will be covered by the training credits that are part of the Embraer 175 purchase agreement. Now that we are upgrading a single fleet of Embraer E-175 for United, we are seeing not only an improvement in cost reductions, but anticipate consistent strong performance and enhance network efficiencies through aircraft flow and increase utilization. In regards to our DHL operation, we have two 737-400 cargo aircraft in service with DHL. We have secured the third 737 that we anticipate to be available in July of \u201921 that will provide additional support for this operation. So far, we have been pleased with the operation and believe we are well positioned to grow this line of business. I'd now like to make some comments on a topic that is getting a lot of attention recently, which is the anticipated hiring requirements for airline industry labor. First of all, I too would like to express my appreciation to all of the aviation professionals that Mesa that have demonstrated their commitment and dedication to this difficult time. And we do greatly appreciate each one of them. We remain focused on hiring and training to meet increasing staffing requirements in nearly all of our operational divisions. Our applicant pools are strong, and in the case of pilots, stronger than we have seen in recent history, and we believe in our ability to hire across the airline. We remain active in the hiring of mechanics, flight attendants, and other operational support positions. And we are bringing back the pilots that were in training at the beginning of the pandemic. Furthermore, we feel like we are very well positioned to be an industry leading option for regional airline pilots through opportunities such as the United Aviate program. We are one of few airlines able to offer a direct pathway for our pilots to become a career pilot for United Airlines. We also have the 7 -- 737 aircraft on certificate, we are the only regional airline offering the ability to fly larger aircraft and earn the highest pay in the regional industry. We're also well positioned with crew domiciles across the country that allow our pilots the opportunity to live where they desire and commute easily to work. We are also currently offering upgrade opportunities and we are actively recruiting from hundreds of aviation schools across the country. With that, I'd now like to turn the time over to Torque to walk through our financial performance.\nTorque Zubeck: Great, thanks, Brad. Appreciate that. Let me do a quick recap on earnings. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we reported net income of $5.7 million or $0.14 per share. This compares favorably to net income of $1.9 million for the same quarter last year, or $0.05 per diluted share. As noted in our press release, the primary reason for the increase in earnings from Q2, 2020, to Q2, 2021 is due to the combination of a $56 million pretax benefit received through PSP2 under the Cares Act, largely offset by temporarily reduced rates offered to our partners related to the PSP program, and the deferral of $4.9 million of revenue, all of which was built and paid by American and United during the quarter and will be recognized over the remaining terms of the contracts. We reported $1.9 million of income tax expense for the quarter. However, we do not pay any cash taxes, as we have over $500 million of valuable NOL carry forward. So let me review where we are in cash and liquidity. We ended Q2 at $148 million compared to $181 million in Q1. As we have pointed out last quarter, $181 million for Q1 included $48 million of United CPA prepayments for future months, which was reduced to zero in Q2. During the quarter, we also made $21 million in scheduled principal payments and so the PSP program we received $48.7 million for PSP2 and $7.3 million top offer PSP2 in Q3. For PSP3 we have allocated $52.2 million, half of which was received in April with the balance expected in Q3. So there was no CapEx in the quarter, although, we did make a $7 million deposit to GE on five engines to be delivered in calendar year 2021. CapEx for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 is one GE engine, with remaining nine in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. Going forward on cash, although, we booked reduced rates to our partners for PSP2 in Q2, the actual cash credit to roughly $30 million will be given in Q3. And as we look to the end of fiscal year 2021, we expect cash to be in the $100 million $110 million range. As for our debt total debt of $725 million, down from $746 million at the end of Q1 2021. We have debt payments of $14 million in Q3, and 45 million in Q4, of which $18 million was previously deferred. Assuming no new debt, fiscal year end debt will be $666 million, down from almost $900 million just two years ago. Now let me turn to guidance. We are still operating in an uncertain environment, but we are getting better visibility, as we have hopefully moved past the worst of the pandemic. We are expecting a gradual improvement of block hours throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. For fiscal year 2021, we expect 85,000 block hours in Q3, and 89,000 in Q4. We are approaching pre-COVID levels and expect further progress as the vaccine rollout continues. On heavy maintenance which is engine and C-checks, we provided our estimates. These amounts are higher than we would consider normal run rate. Much of this work, as Brad pointed out is related to C-checks, which were previously deferred, and we are catching up on them through the end of the calendar year, as well as enhancing our aircraft interiors. And now, I'd like to turn it back over to Jonathan for closing remarks.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you very much Torque. The last year is obviously been very difficult for the entire industry, for the entire countries, entire world. However, we are pleased that Mesa has been able to remain profitable, perform well for our partners, and importantly, protect our people fully employed. This is due to our operational performance, our industry leading economics and the tremendous reports we've received from our people in the field and here in the office. These factors divisions well for growth, and we will continue to look at new opportunities as the industry evolves. I'd like to now open this up for other questions that we might be able to help you with.\nOperator: Yes, sir. It is now time for the question-and-answer session of today's call. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Thank you. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a quick question on the block hours, it looks like maybe block hours down slightly versus the guidance provided last quarter, even though you're kind of extending the aircraft with the Americans. Just curious if you can provide any color around that?\nJonathan Ornstein: Brad or Mike?\nMike Lotz: This is my guess. So I think -- is it fairly close to where we were? I think we're probably just being a little bit more conservative as you know, these schedules -- they're changing week-to-week. So I think we're just being a little bit more conservative with our estimate.\nSavi Syth: That make sense.\nBrad Rich: Yeah. Hey Mike, Brad here. Second that completely. It's just -- we're just trying to be a little cautious in the projections.\nSavi Syth: Okay. And just around the CRJ purchase off lease, I was curious, the thinking around that, if you can provide any color on how attractive that deal was, and any update on the European JV. The conversations you're having there and the timing of when we might hear more on that front?\nMike Lotz: Yeah, so I'll take this one Jon. So on the lease purchase, look, we have made it clear, we're trying to buyout all of our leases and take them on as owned aircraft. We had 18 leases, we're down now to 17. This particular aircraft was just one of the unusual ones in our fleet, as we -- it\u2019s the only aircraft we were paying, like supplemental maintenance, rent for. So net-net, we ended up having to return, forego getting the maintenance reserves on it. So we picked up from a cash standpoint, we picked up the aircraft for very little cash and avoided return conditions. But the way the accounting works based on fair market value, we ended up being a non-cat write off. As far as the European JV, we're still moving along with it. We had the LOI, we intend to probably give a better update next quarter. I don't know if Jonathan you want to add anything to that?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, yeah, I mean, I think that as some of you know, Mike and I have some experience over in Europe. We had known Tony for awhile, he'd actually advise us on a couple of other deals that we've looked at. He -- I think he's probably the most knowledgeable guy in Europe when it comes to regional operations. He has had tremendous experience in Europe, and with real serious players in the industry who respect him. And so the fact that they were willing to invest alongside of us was very attractive. And I think this could be a good opportunity for Mesa to put to use a few aircrafts that are tailing the water. There has been a significant restructuring in regional operations in Europe as a result of COVID. And I think this could be a really good example of being in the right place at the right time.\nSavi Syth: Appreciate the comments. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Thanks for the time, guys. So on CapEx, I missed the number. I think you said, Torque, one GE engine, and then nine in fiscal 2022 and 2023, or do I think of that as calendar year. So do you have just a single point number four, I guess fiscal 2021 and fiscal 22?\nMike Lotz: Yeah, this is Mike, I\u2019ll jump in for Torque here. For fiscal 2021, it's just one aircraft for fiscal 2021, one engine for fiscal 2021. And then it would be four in fiscal 2022.\nMike Lotz: Yes. And the remaining five.\nJonathan Ornstein: And the remaining five in 2022.\nMike Lotz: Yeah, 2033\u2026\nJonathan Ornstein: In 2023.\nHelane Becker: It's correct. Okay, that's perfect. And then, do you have an estimate for how the storm and power outages in Texas? And how they impacted your operations?\nJonathan Ornstein: You want to?\nTorque Zubeck: Yeah. Yeah. Helane, we estimated it was roughly a factor of about $3 million net-net at the end of the day.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Do you have to cover that or do your partners?\nMike Lotz: Well. We -- this is Mike -- we cover the crew after that right, because it means now our crews have a guarantee flying and the extent that flying is cancelled and then we still have to pay the crews. The maintenance costs we're not burning engines. We're not burning expense.\nHelane Becker: All right.\nMike Lotz: So it's kind of a mix. But we still got the crew cost.\nHelane Becker: Got you. And then my final question,\u2026\nJonathan Ornstein: I think, what we're saying is that the net impact after what our partners pay us and what we pay in fact for that $3 million.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Got you.\nJonathan Ornstein: \u2026of net income.\nHelane Becker: \u2026Net. Okay, that's perfectly understandable. Thanks, Jonathan. And then my last question,\u2026\nJonathan Ornstein: Yeah.\nHelane Becker: \u2026 how long will you give your partner's lower contract rates? Is it just when you're receiving PSP, or just that continue after PSP?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, I'll answer it, then Mike if you want to give some more technical views. But the lower contract rates clearly were around what was going on with COVID and PSP. So I don't think that anyone would expect us to continue to have lower rates in the absence of PSP. You want to add anything to that Mike?\nMike Lotz: No, I think that's fairly accurate. I mean, we got to offer the rates through PSP three, which is through September of this year. And if there's a PSP four we'll address that and probably do something along those as well. But right now, it's just through September.\nHelane Becker: Got you. Okay, thanks, everybody. That's all very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Hilary on from life. Thanks for taking my question. I guess in terms of the JV of renewal Gramsci, how would that be recorded? Would that be recorded as earnings from an affiliate given that you will be, owning, less than 50%? And if that's the case, I guess, we probably won't see an expense coming out of the operating P&L, right, or will it be?\nMike Lotz: Yeah. This is Mike. Depending upon the final structure, we're not sure what the accounting will look like. But there is -- not expected to be anything in this fiscal year that would be significant.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got you. Thank you. And then, I just, I guess, a longer term question, you've been doing a great job of paying down debt, and just wanting to get your thoughts on what your longer term capital structure will look like? And I guess, over the next year or so, will we be focused more on paying down debt or maintaining liquidity? If you have a target debt to cap number and target liquidity, I guess over the next year or so?\nMike Lotz: Well, I'll say so that if anybody wants to add in, I mean, the government loan has helped us significantly in terms of liquidity. And, you know, while there is obviously, we repaid United some of the money that they had given us, in terms of an advance. The benefit of that loan will become apparent as we continue to receive payments, and we are not making principal payments. So, in my view that would, that will more than suffice for the liquidity that we will require or at least the next few years. I think that we will continue to pay down all the other debt that we have. And we'll focus on continuing to purchase aircraft off of lease, which we find, obviously, we find attractive. The likelihood of us taking on any additional debt, which, of course, we have a somewhat different view sometimes in the street and that when we take on debt, it means we're getting new orders for aircraft and that debt is effectively a pass-through to the partner that takes on that aircraft. So, if we were to take on additional debt, in all probability that would be associated with the addition of aircraft or potentially down the road, you know, some of the engines that we have to purchase. Mike, Torque, you want to add anything to that?\nMike Lotz: No, I think that's \u2013 that's my writing. You know, we, like Jonathan said, taking on debt to buy aircraft to expand our operation, but our partners is good debt for us. There is no better debt for us. And, you know, after that we're still on \u2013 we're still like Torque alluded to, I think we end the year at 650 rough million, and with \u2013 we are not having new debt. I think we're scheduled next year to pay off, the next fiscal year over 100 million and close to 100 million in 2023. So we're starting to pay down the principal payments pretty significantly.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, thanks for the follow up. Just a couple of questions for me. One, a bit of a longer term question. What do you think Jonathan is kind of the normalized margins of this business coming out at COVID? And when do you think you'd get there?\nJonathan Ornstein: Normalize margin? That's the interesting question for sure. You know, there's always been so much that impacted our margins and earnings. That it's just as hard to say, as we, I think. I mean, you know, because for us, obviously, the timing of maintenance events always plays a big a big role in that, as well as what our partners. I think as we get through this next period, where we do have, as we mentioned, there are a fair amount of heavy checking work that we have to do. Moving forward to that, Mike or Torque, do you want to comment where we think margins will be 2022, 2023, 2024, given the existing fleet.\nTorque Zubeck: I mean, look, we generally don't project our margins, but look, they should return to the levels they were at pre-COVID by fiscal 2022. This year is still a transition year. Some of that our heavy maintenance will roll out maybe into the first quarter of 2022 for us and beyond that it should be back to traditional levels.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And if I may, just a clarification on the PSP, is it kind of roughly half and half over the next couple of quarters, or is it \u2013 how should we think about how that PSP3 shows up in from a timing perspective? Since it goes out through September?\nJonathan Ornstein: Sorry. So yes, so it goes from April through September, so six months for this last round. So if you think about, we got 52 million in change for this one, that's going to be spread over six months versus that PSP2 was over four months. So we're going to be getting net less every quarter compared to where we were in PSP2. That makes sense?\nTorque Zubeck: And it'll be split about 50-50.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. Yes.\nSavi Syth: Okay. I think that's helpful. And actually, if I may -- just some of the commentary on the maintenance. Is that kind of tied to -- are you seeing that both on the ERJ side and the CRJ side, or is that kind of tied to more on the Bombardier side with that not being an aircraft that's manufactured much and people's willingness to support that that aircraft such.\nJonathan Ornstein: You thrown that on this, the speed check issue?\nTorque Zubeck: Yes. It's definitely more so on the almost exclusively on the CRJ side. Remember, the E-Jet, United owns 42 of them. So that expense really a pass through, doesn't really impact our bottom line. We own 18 of them. And then the new 20 we got aren't scheduled for a few years before they're in E-Jet. It's really CRJ-900 cost item.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes.\nSavi Syth: Yes. Are you expecting that to be issue going forward, Mike or is this more of a COVID-related recovery pains?\nJonathan Ornstein: If I can just think that I think that there's two issues. There is some amount of COVID-related, but there is also the impact of Bombardier. They acquired by MHI. And, obviously, in any transition there, it's not always as smooth as one would like. I do having -- had extensive conversations with the MHI Bombardier team that they're working very hard to correct any deficiencies that we've had over the last few months in terms of parts availability or timing. So, I think that has probably played as much role as anything else. And knowing Mitsubishi, I think that there is a high probability there's all that will be behind us as we go out six months. Mike, do you want -- or Torque or Brad, want to add anything to that.\nBrad Rich: Jonathan, this is Brad. I think you've covered it pretty well. I mean the issue primarily 900, the issues of there are some COVID related, labour issues at the respective heavy check providers. Their ability to support parts is becoming an issue. But look, we're -- we've got very high levels of leadership attention on this issue. We're bringing on new providers. We're opening new lines. I mean, we've got a lot of just attention and focus on this issue. And we got to a kind of a bubble here to get through as we're bringing these additional aircraft back up that have been down during COVID. And once we get that behind us, I expect this to be in relatively good shape. So\u2026\nJonathan Ornstein: Yeah. And if I could add something, which -- I mean, American has been very good in terms of understanding is, there was a -- as you can tell by our numbers that American have rapid screw up of the American hours, I mean, they are now at 100% and going over 100%. They came to us asking for us five additional aircraft that we had not planned on flying. That's -- we accommodated that request, obviously because a, we want to be good partners, b, we think we can make more money flying more aircraft. But that certainly impacted some of these items, because we had to keep five additional airplanes flying and again, move around our C-checks schedule. So, there's a lot of good news to this is the fact that our partners want more flying, and we've been able to provide it. And as a result, we've had to make some accommodations in terms of C-checks. So I don't want to give the impression that this was something that was unplanned, it's something that happened in large part due to the fact that we took on additional flying.\nSavi Syth: Make sense. All right. Appreciate the answers. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay, operator. I'd like to just make a couple comments that I think I'm a little bit surprised that no one asked us more about what we're doing in terms of decarburization, and electric, because I want to make sure that people appreciate that this is going to be a very significant emphasis for the company going forward. We fully intend to be the leader in decarburization and ecofriendly flying. We see how important this has become around the world lead of course in Europe. It's one of the reasons why we're beginning a European certificate. We are already now invested with United with Archer, which we think is the leading developer of urban mobility vehicles, which technology changed so rapidly, even since, I began in the industry, which it didn't seem like that long ago, but I tell the story that the first aircraft that I loaded back at AirLA was a chartered DC-3 built in the 1940s. Now we're flying regional jets to Havana. The idea that electric aircraft are not going to be a big deal, I think is wrong. I think there's a huge opportunity in front of us. I am really delighted that United has chosen us to be their partner. And we had worked very closely with them on this deal. I think there are more deals down the road that we are working on today that we feel have a high probability of coming to fruition. And that -- we call it\u2019s just the beginning, as we\u2019ve seen this technology really emerge into what I think is going to be the wave of the future. And we are really dedicated to make that happen.  In addition, one of the areas that we think provides us still to be a big opportunity is our cargo. We\u2019re taking on this third 737 to support the operation. We think it will find a lot of business to that aircraft. We are looking at putting on additional fleet types. And I think we're -- in that discussions with our partner in that will provide some additional opportunities as we move going forward. But to do that, the area that has our biggest focus is in operation performance, which to-date, given the fact that we're operating over two aircraft with no spares. I think they've been excellent and has been beyond our expectations. When you think about the fact we're offering a new fleet type remotely with no spares. I think it really does bode well for the future for us.  So those are two big areas of opportunity that I think the company is going to excel at. And I think it's something that people will begin to focus on when they realize exactly how big the opportunities are which I think they are expensive. \nBrad Rich: So, with that, if no other questions, I'm happy to conclude. I want to thank everybody at the company again for a great job in spite of the difficulty out there. It's nice to see things beginning to look like they're getting better.  And I would like to thank everybody for their support out on the street and an investment community -- the industry is a tough industry. We appreciate you hanging in with us. And again, if you have any additional questions, please feel free to call any of us privately and we'll be glad to answer them as best we can.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time and thank you for joining. Have a great rest of your day. \nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-02-09 21:10:05", "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Mesa Airlines 1Q Investor Conference Call. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host Chairman and CEO, Jonathan Ornstein. Thank you, Chairman. You may begin.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, operator, and thank you everybody for joining us this afternoon. This is Jonathan Ornstein. I'm the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mesa Airlines. On the call with me today is, Mike Lotz, our President and Chief Financial Officer; Brian Gillman, our Executive VP and General Counsel; and Brad Rich, our Chief Operating Officer. I'd like to open up with our forward-looking statements, before the presentation and comments begin, Mesa would like to remind you that our press release comments made on the conference call and responses to your questions during this call may include forward-looking statements, as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

In addition please refer to our press release in the Investors section of the Mesa Airlines' website find additional disclosure and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that will be used on today's call. Okay. Now that, we have that out of the way, I'd like to start the call as usual way with a big thanks to all of our people in the field. And despite the obvious risk continue to exhibit incredible bravery and dedication and the service to our passengers. That dedication is in the face of a deadly pandemic, I believe is nothing short of outstanding. I'd like to thank each of our pilots flight attendants, mechanics operations, control personnel and all the other frontline employees. While we remain cautious our view is tempered with some optimism as we are starting to see some glimmers of improvement, primarily tied to vaccine distribution which we believe is key to the recovery of the industry. I'd also like to take a moment just to -- while we're all concerned about our daily lives and being at home and some of the things that have changed just to take a moment to think about the many people -- thousands of people who've lost their lives in this terrible pandemic. We have a number of highlights this quarter as mentioned in our press release. We are delighted to report a net profit and positive cash flow. For our partner flying, we signed a five-year extension with American Airlines for 40 aircraft. We launched cargo operations for DHL with two 737-400 freighter aircraft and we placed 12 new Embraer 175 aircraft into service with the United Airlines. We also received $195 million loan under the CARES Act program, and we chose not to furlough any employees despite the expiration of the Payroll Support Program. Our operational performance shows a significant improvement even with the additional fly this quarter. Despite the challenges in the industry, we continue to move forward and look for new areas of growth. One area which I already highlighted is our recently launched cargo partnership with DHL. Mesa is the first and only regional airline to begin cargo operations with narrow-body aircraft and we will continue to pursue dedicated cargo opportunities. I'd like to take a second to talk about something special that occurred in the quarter. I believe this is a real example of what Mesa Airlines is all about. Following the expiration of the CARES Act, we approached our pilots about a temporary pay cut to avoid furloughs. Within literally only a few weeks we came to an agreement and avoided furloughs when the PSP ended on September 30. Two months into the quarter it became apparent to us that the company would operate profitably. And as a result we informed ALPA that we intended to repay the pilots for the wages they had voluntarily given up. In addition, other work groups have taken pay reductions or in voluntarily time off all of which were restored back to previous levels. I'd like to thank all of our employees for their cooperation offers of assistance in these difficult times and are thankful that our financial performance enabled us to do what we were able to do. We believe that the support we received from our employees has been a critical aspect of our success and will remain so going forward. Our primary focus however remains with our existing partners and opportunities to expand and grow our overall business with them. We believe that our industry-leading cost structure and operational excellence positioned us well in this environment, especially as the industry continues to consolidate. I'd like to turn things over to Brad Rich, our Chief Operating Officer to give you an update on the level of our operations as well as American United and DHL. Brad?\nBrad Rich: Thank you, Jonathan. First off, I'd like to mention some of our top operational priorities. It probably goes without saying that our highest priority at this time are the health and wellness of our people and our passengers. We continue to be in very close contact with our major partners following their guidance and their protocols as well as the information received regularly from the CDC. Next, we remain very focused on continuing to improve our operational performance and finally strengthening our relationships and working collaboratively with our partners. We do believe that consistent operational performance and industry-leading economics are the most effective way to develop and maintain long-term relationships with our partners. By way of review for the December quarter, we generated 69,247 block hours which was down 40% from last year. Based on current guidance for our partners, we expect the March quarter production to be at about 70% of pre-COVID levels and roughly 75% to 80% for the June quarter. We do anticipate a gradual increase in block hours throughout the year as outlined in our press release. As far as operational performance, we continue to see improvements in our key operational performance metrics. During the December quarter, our controllable completion factor was 99.9% compared to 99.8% a year ago and our controllable on-time departures was 91.1% compared to 81.3% a year ago. Focus on continual improvement in operational performance will remain one of our highest priorities. I'd now like to provide an update on our American operation. First of all, we're very pleased with our improving and strengthening relationship with American Airlines as evidenced by the previously announced 5-year extension that was finalized in the December quarter. Additionally, we formalized an agreement with American to add five additional CRJ aircraft above our CPA levels in late December and we believe there may be additional opportunities. Our current fleet as many of you know consists of 64 CRJ-900s. We own 48 and 41 of those are financed under our previously announced US treasury loans. The remaining seven aircraft are financed with Export Development Canada or EDC. We also have 15 aircraft leased through 2024. We will be using the majority of these aircraft to support the American operation. However, we are reviewing several new opportunities that would productively utilize some of these aircraft. Given the attractive financings and the low debt balance on the majority of the fleet, we believe these aircraft are valuable assets and will remain productive. We have completed our first month of operation under the new American CPA and we are seeing some of the best performance since the beginning of the American relationship. We remain confident in our ability to meet the operational requirements of the new agreement. Now moving to an update of our United operation. Our relationship with United remains strong and productive. We are working together on many strategic and operational initiatives that we feel will create additional value in our relationship. We're proud to be one of very few airlines taking delivery of new aircraft in today's difficult environment. As mentioned previously, we now have 16 new E-175 LR aircraft that were all placed into service between November of 2020 and February of 2021. The last four aircraft will be delivered by the end of June of 2021. As we add these aircraft to the United fleet, we are removing our CRJ-700s on a one-for-one basis. These aircraft will be leased to GoJet airlines for a nine-year term that was previously announced as a seven-year term. We are retraining most of the current CRJ-700 pilots in Washington Dulles on the E-175. And most of that training expense will be covered by the training credits that are part of the E-175 purchase agreement. Within the next six months, we will be operating a single fleet of 80 E-175s with United, which we believe will enhance operational performance and improve our cost efficiencies. In fact, we are already seeing significantly improved operational results. Finally, in regards to our cargo operations, as previously mentioned, we have two 737-400 cargo aircraft in service with DHL. Both aircraft are based in Cincinnati, where we have a pilot domicile and a maintenance base. So far we have been pleased with the operation and believe we are well positioned to grow this line of business. With that, I'd now like to turn it over to Mike Lotz to walk through our financial performance.\nMike Lotz: Okay. Thanks a lot, Brad. Let me do a quick recap on the earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We reported net income of $14.1 million or $0.39 per share. This compares favorable to the net income of $10.8 million for the same quarter last year or $0.31 per diluted share. As noted in our press release, the primary reason for the increase in earnings from 2021 -- from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021 is due to a combination of $11.3 million pre-tax benefit received through PSP under the CARES Act, offset by the 26% reduction in contract revenue related to reduced flying as a result of COVID and by $5.2 million of deferred revenue. As a reminder, the $5.2 million of deferred revenue is revenue which was billed to and paid by American and United during the quarter and will be recognized over the remaining terms of the respective contracts. We did report $4.8 million of income tax expense for the quarter. However, we do not pay any cash taxes, as we have over $500 million of valuable NOL carry forward. Let me move to cash and liquidity. Cash for the quarter excluding restricted cash increased by $82 million to $181 million. Of the $181 million cash at quarter end, $48 million is the balance of the United CPA prepayment, which was made in November. This was subsequently reduced to zero at the end of January 2021. As previously reported, we did draw on and receive $195 million this quarter as a secured loan under the CARES Act, as a five-year term interest only at LIBOR plus 350 with no prepayment penalty. During the quarter, we also extinguished $164 million of debt related to 44 CRJ aircraft, three 700s and 41, 900s. This debt was amortizing that that were due to mature between January of 2021 and June of 2024. In addition to the $164 million extinguishment, we also paid $25 million in scheduled principal payments. Total debt is $746 million, up slightly from Q4 of 2020. And assuming no new debt, the balance will be reduced by approximately $96 million over the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2021 resulting in fiscal year 2021 total debt -- ending debt with a total amount of $650 million. Principal payments currently scheduled for fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2023 are $200 million in total, bringing total debt down to approximately $450 million by fiscal year end 2023. To put this into perspective, $450 million is not too far up from the purchase price of just 20 new regional jets. Also total debt continues to decline from previous levels. A year ago, our debt was $822 million in December of 2019. And in December of 2018, two years ago, it was $892 million. There was $2 million of CapEx in the quarter and our only current plan capital is the acquisition of new engines from GE. We originally ordered 20 engines that are in discussions with them on the timing of deliveries and the total number of engines required, given the new COVID environment, which obviously had changed -- has changed the dynamics with an increase in used engines available in the marketplace. We expect to finance most of the purchase price of any engines delivered. As for daily cash burn, as we have said since the start of COVID back in March, we have been and expect to continue to remain cash neutral or better going forward.  Lastly, on liquidity, we did receive $24 million from the US Treasury in February for PSP2 which covers the four-month period December 1st to March 31st. We expect to receive the balance of $25 million by March 31st. Consistent with PSP1, we will have discussions with all of our partners on temporarily reducing rates through that same period December 1st to March 31st.  Let me touch on guidance. Although the environment is still volatile, we did want to provide guidance in a few areas. Block hours which are fairly straightforward. Obviously, we have much more confidence in the March quarter than we do looking out at June and September. And as Brad mentioned, the March quarter is roughly 70% of pre-COVID levels with June at almost 80%.  For heavy maintenance, which is primarily engine and airframe C-checks. We provided estimates. These amounts are higher than what we would consider normal run rates. Much of this work is a result of deferred C-checks, which we'll be catching up on through the end of the fiscal year.  We have also provided our current estimate for deferred revenue for the remainder of the fiscal year. As you can see the deferred revenue we're projecting to be down to only $200,000 in Q4. In total, we are projecting total deferred revenue of $33 million combined for fiscal '20 and 2021. In fiscal '22 and beyond we should begin to see the reversal of the deferred revenue.  I'd like to now turn it back over to Jonathan. \nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Mike and thank you, Brad. Just a quick word. I'd like to thank both of you guys doing a wonderful job. Brad on the American side and Mike, helping -- the job you did putting these financial transactions together has been fabulous. And I want you to know how much it's appreciated.  Let's face it. It's been a tough year for the industry. We are more than pleased that Mesa has weathered the storm as well as it has. I think this has been a large part of the result of the operational performance we are achieving our industry-leading economics. And again, I can't say enough about the support that we received from our people in the field.  I believe that with this strong foundation in place as being well capitalized as we are now. Our costs remaining low, we will continue to seek and achieve new opportunities as the industry continues to evolve.  With that I would like to open up for any questions any of you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just on the PSP, I was kind of curious with the -- it seems like the benefit was recorded in the December quarter and I'm guessing the remaining $38 million will be reflected in the March quarter. Should we expect some of the December quarter rate reductions to show up in the March quarter? And how should we kind of think about from that perspective just kind of the puts and takes as we think about the quarter this year for fiscal year 2021? \nMike Lotz: Yes. So for -- Savi, this is Mike. For PSP2, the roughly $49 million we haven't booked any of rate reductions related to December. So any rate reductions we do relative to PSP2 will all be recorded in the March quarter as will the -- obviously the full cash impact as we're receiving that in Q2 as well. \nSavi Syth: Got it. And then just on the American contract, I think when you updated in December about kind of the five additional aircraft flying, I think it was considered short-term possibly going longer. Has there been any kind of solidifying of how long those extra five aircraft will be flying? So like how long it will stay at 45? I know you have in the guidance it's kind of going out through the current fiscal year, but I'm just wondering just how flexible it is for American to adjust that number? \nJonathan Ornstein : Brad, go ahead. \nBrad Rich: Okay. I'll be happy to take that one. First of all, Savi, our guidance in the projected block hour production includes those aircraft in the estimates through May. And at this point, that's where we -- that's what we have discussed with American. And look then we just assumed and count on the quality of the operation, doing a really good job, certainly where our costs are for that operation. Look our focus is just on doing a good job with what they've asked us to do so far, which is through May and hopes that it will lead to more opportunities.\nSavi Syth: Helpful. Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Good afternoon. Jonathan, you mentioned that the market is consolidating. I'm wondering if you could just talk about that a little more. What, sort of, opportunities does that create for you? Maybe what did you mean by that? Does it create opportunities? What's the timing on realizing some of them? And are the conversations still preliminary at this point or more substantive? Thank you.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. No problem. I really was talking about a trend that we've seen, and I think to some degree sped up as a result of the pandemic. We've seen three, four, five carriers that have been ultimately liquidated. There's been some consolidation. I think the major airlines have moved in the direction of a few strong partners rather than eight, nine, 10. And I think Mesa is positioned now to be one of those potentially three or four that will survive that shakeout. And I think that we're also positioned if there are opportunities whether it'd be through a merger or an acquisition or increasing the fleet, we now have the financial wherewithal to do that. And so I think we're talking more about a basic trend. When we joined RAA back in 1989, my first RAA meeting there were 113 airlines, regional airline members. I think we're now down to 13. So the trend has been pretty strong and I just sense that it will continue and that Mesa is positioned well to take advantage of that future consolidation.\nJoseph DeNardi: In a scenario where it consolidates down to that level, how many aircraft would Mesa be in a position to operate roughly relative to what you fly now?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. Well, in the past the constraint that slowed everyone down frankly was pilots and pilot shortage that had been induced by the 1,500-hour rule. That has not been an issue. I recently saw some numbers where there's a number of carriers that have over 1,000 pilots in their queue to be hired and I know we have in the hundreds at this point. So I think that our ability to grow right now whether it's organically or through potential acquisition, I think is -- I'm not going to say unlimited but I think it would be easy to see that we could add one, 1.5 aircraft a month without any problem over the next few years just by organically growing and then potentially more so if we were to do some type of acquisition. And again I think that it's also being driven by our partners who have said do we really want to manage 10 different partners? And you've seen for example United some consolidation there and the number of parties that they're doing business with.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Hey, Mike I just -- I want to go over the cash numbers with you. You ended the quarter on a very high note $181 million. And then you indicated that you did pay off the United -- the rest of the United that prepayment with the $48 million. And then, obviously, you're getting some money that you got, I guess, in February and you're getting something in March as it relates to the PSP2, so another $49 million there. And then I think you mentioned something about $25 million of principal payments. So the pluses and minuses, it does feel like that you're going to end the March quarter with still a pretty good cash position. I don't know if it's $140 million, $150 million, $160 million getting a feel that you've been breakeven from a cash burn basis. Is that -- am I in the ballpark there? Or am I too aggressive on your March Q cash position?\nMike Lotz: Yes. So look we ended at $180 million. And of that, roughly $50 million of it was United. So that would bring us down to $130 million. And then, from there this PSP2 money that received, that all doesn't just drop down to the bottom line. We do talk to all of our partners about temporary rate reductions during the same period. And when you're applying half of the schedule then there's a different level of concession as opposed to when you're flying it at 70%, 80%. Well, so I'd just leave you with that.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. No that's helpful. That actually that is helpful. My second question, just to Brad the CRJ-900s that have come out of American, I think you talked about several new opportunities. I was someone intrigued by that. I mean that's a very unique airplane and I don't think there's anybody out there who can fly it at a lower cost than you guys. It's a lot of seats. And so, I wasn't sure, would this be Mesa operating on behalf of another carrier? Or would this be like a sublease opportunity maybe where you're leasing the airplanes offshore to another carrier just -- and collecting rental income? Any color on that would be great. Thanks Brad.\nBrad Rich: I'll give just a couple of quick thoughts. First of all, I think you hit on what I think is the most important point, which is our ability to operate good quality, high quality, high reliability operations at a really attractive total economics is the key to this -- to keeping these airplanes flying. And so, look, there are some very specific opportunities, that we are pursuing and reviewing at this time. And then -- and then in the meantime, we'll use the additional airplanes to support the American operation and the reliability there is really critically important to us as well. So, in any event, these airplanes we think will be put to good use.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thanks Brad. Thanks everyone.\nBrad Rich: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much operator. Hi everybody. Thank you very much for the time. I just have a couple of questions. So the first question I have is that, you had mentioned there was incremental flying for American in the first half of this year, is that playing out the way you hoped it would be? Just following up on the AA question.\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, I'll take -- I'd like to say one thing real quickly about that is, I would say that the incremental flying as well as the baseline has worked out far better than we anticipated. In the middle of the pandemic, with traffic down literally 90%, the fact that we were able to renew 42 aircraft and then for American to come back to us and add five more and we're in discussions with them on additional opportunities, I think it's truly -- is amazing and beyond our expectations on it. Again, I want to thank Brad for his role in putting that together. Brad, do you want to add anything for that?\nBrad Rich: Jonathan, I think you said it very well. I don't really have much more to add.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay.\nHelane Becker: Great. Thanks, Jonathan. Thanks Brad. My other question is on cargo contracts. So, you're doing -- what did you say Brad two 400s I think. Do you -- I assume since Jonathan said, you could add one to 1.5 aircraft a month. I'm hoping that that includes cargo. What does that runway look like right now? For obvious reasons, there's so much e-commerce, blah, blah, blah. How is that shaping out?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes, this is Jonathan. We think that the cargo opportunity is significant for us going forward. They don't order 40 airplanes at a clip like the way the majors used to. So, I think we'd be looking at that. In cargo, if we could add an aircraft every other month, we'd probably be very happy. I don't think it's going to happen overnight. We have to prove ourselves, so far so good. The good news is too is that DHL we have a lot of contacts and with their senior management through our new Board member, Dan McHugh, who is the former CEO of Southern. So, I think that there's a big opportunity for us there and it's just a question of us being able to manage all the different pieces of those businesses successfully. And as Brad said, clearly our operational performance is critical. And on the other side of it, which is sort of Mike's job has been keeping the cost where they need to be. And I forgot to mention -- I mentioned Brian Gillman, who is our lawyer who is stuck always having to deal with putting all this together and may be the hardest part of all these transactions. And I think between us we've developed a good team that we can pursue these opportunities equally and aggressively.\nHelane Becker: Thanks Jonathan. That\u2019s very helpful.\nMike Lotz: Let me just add one thing too, Jonathan. On the cargo opportunities, they're beyond just DHL too, right? There may be other cargo opportunities that present themselves to us. And importantly, it's a lot easier to present yourself as a cargo operator as opposed to wanting to become a cargo operator. I mean we are a cargo operator now. So, I think that helps us position ourselves in the market much better as well. Go ahead Helane.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s great. Okay. Thanks guys. Have a nice afternoon.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Just a quick follow-up. Jonathan you mentioned earlier M&A a few times. I'm wondering if you could just maybe talk about it. I would take from your comments that maybe you have the blessing of your partners to consolidate. I'm wondering how you frame kind of where you're willing to take leverage or how you would finance that. And maybe how seriously you're evaluating that opportunity? Thank you.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. The partners always have the ability in these contracts effectively to veto a deal by not passing along the codeshare agreement. So, anything you do you have to do it in cooperation with your partner. Again, my remarks were more general than specific. I mean clearly we've looked at opportunities from time-to-time. We continue to look at opportunities. But one of the areas that is potentially interesting to us outside of sort of our traditional business is potentially to acquire -- to grow our cargo business through acquisition. The other thing that we've looked at is then just staying at the forefront of technology I think is important too going forward. So, there are a number of areas that we think there may be merger and acquisition investment just things that -- to help diversify our business on one hand and at the same time, potentially strengthen our business with our partners through this consolidation process. So, again, I think it's more general in a sense of direction than specific at this time, but Mesa has always been pretty opportunistic. Some folks who go back with us Helane and Mike Linenberg know that we used to be called the deal a year company. We haven't done a deal in a long time but I think that it is these kinds of situations where opportunities do exist.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSavi Syth: Just a couple of quick ones. Just on the December quarter I was just kind of curious versus plan how did the quarter turn out? Was just PSP, the only kind of variable versus kind of the budget or the way you were thinking about the quarter or how did the quarter progress? I'm curious.\nMike Lotz: Yes, there was no surprises for the quarter. It was pretty much as we had projected.\nSavi Syth: Okay. And actually along those lines Mike, so just trying to follow-up on the cash question that Mike had earlier. Should we think about kind of ex-PSP still cash flow positive for the year based on kind of current levels of flying?\nMike Lotz: Well, when we talk about cash flow neutral or better, it includes any PSP money that we would receive.\nSavi Syth: Yes. But like going forward is that like even without the PSP in the past and I know not all of that falls through are you in kind of cash generation territory?\nMike Lotz: Yes. Yes we are.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. And then like--\nJonathan Ornstein: And if I could Savi I'll just add. I mean this has been a source of what seems to be some level of confusion with all of us including myself. But you have to remember on the PSP, I mean the alternative which if we had to and obviously we've been delighted to avoid it, we can furlough people and downsize the operation to fit the number of aircraft we're flying. Thankfully the government has chosen to give us the opportunity to avoid that by making those payments. But I think it should be clear that there would be -- if there was no PSP and we were flying it 50% of our flying, we would go back to our pilots, go back to our mechanics, go back to our fly attendants and sort of structure the same deal that we did when we didn't think there was a PSP and able to structure some of that work. And just to mention, I mean, there was a period of time when we did not have the PSP for a couple of months and we did structure those deals and the company was cash flow positive.\nSavi Syth: That's good color. I appreciate that. And then just one last question on the cargo. Is it -- the thinking still that's close to breakeven here with two aircrafts and really to, kind of, get the earnings higher there you just need more scale?\nJonathan Ornstein: Mike, do you want to answer that?\nMike Lotz: Yes. No that's a fair assessment Savi. We've said that our goal was not to have a two aircraft operation, obviously, spreading the cost over just two aircraft is not nearly as economically feasible as 10, 12 aircrafts. So, yes, as we grow they will certainly become more profitable. And they are -- like we said, they're contributing some but not much given the start-up.\nSavi Syth: Make sense, all right. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question will be from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, Jonathan, if you could just kind of indulge me in a plain spotter question here. I just -- I wanted to know if there was any accuracy to the fact that you did take delivery of the 737-800 freighter? I'm just -- I saw it was in the blogs a few weeks back and I just wasn't sure if there was any sort of accuracy around that but -- \nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. No, Mike it's really funny that you mentioned it because my DHL contact, our DHL contact sent that to me too. And he said is this true or is this a mistake? And at first I wasn't sure if that -- because they had the LR serial, which is why we name our planes after Larry. But I can tell you that after doing a little checking it was not our aircraft. And we don't have any intentions on 800s at least not in the near-term. Although I will say, I think that's the direction things are going in terms of the freighter business is that I wouldn't be surprised if the next aircraft that we did put on certificate would be a 737-800.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Very good, Jonathan. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: And I'm currently showing that that was our last question.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Well, operator, thank you very much and thank you all for your continued interest and support of Mesa. We're working hard through, obviously, this tough time to provide as much opportunity for the company as possible. We're all significant shareholders. We'd love to see our share price improve. We think that the company has lots of opportunity. We've strengthened the management team in a number of areas to help take advantage of that. I think again the support that we receive from our partners has been nothing short of outstanding given the environment that they deal with every day. Both American and United have been incredibly supportive. And lastly I think again I can't tell you enough how strongly I feel about the relationship that we've developed with our people in the field. I also want to thank all of our shareholders and everyone else that's been patient with us. I mean there's nothing we'd rather do than see them also benefit from all this work. And we hope that as we go forward in 2021 and things begin to improve that we can see some improvement there as well. So again as always thank you. And if you have any additional questions feel free to call myself, Mike or Brad directly. Have a great day, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. All participants may disconnect at this time. Thank you for your participation on today's call."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 4, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-12-09 23:12:03", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you please disconnect at this time. Your lines are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Jonathan Ornstein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you very much, Operator. Sorry for the delay guys. We are all working remotely as you can imagine, so technically, trying to get everyone on the same page. But we appreciate your patience. This is Jonathan Ornstein. I am the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mesa Airlines. On the call with me today is Mike Lotz, our President and Chief Financial Officer; Brian Gillman, our Executive VP and General Counsel; Brad Rich, our Chief Operating Officer. I\u2019d like to open up with our forward-looking statement. Before the presentation and comments begin, Mesa would like to remind you that some of the statements in response to your questions in this conference call may include forward-looking statements. As such, they are subject to future events and uncertainties that could also affect our results to differ materially from those statements. Also, please note, the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary sentiments in our press release and the risk factors including the rooted in our filings with the SEC, which Mesa encourages you to read. In addition, please refer to our press release in the Investors section of Mesa\u2019s website to find additional disclosure and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that will be used on today\u2019s call. Okay, I really want to start the call with a big thanks to all of our people in the field, who despite the obvious risk and continue to exhibit incredible bravery and dedication in their service to our passengers. That dedication is in the face of the pandemic, I believe is nothing short of outstanding. I like to thank each of our pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, operations, control personnel and all the other frontline employees. While this may well be an example of the darkest hour before dawn, we remain optimistic that our country and our industry will recover in 2021. Thank you everybody. Despite the challenges in the industry, Mesa is focused on our core business and has secured some important opportunities going forward. I\u2019d like to walk you through some of our key accomplishments for the year. We started off 2020 expanding our United CPA, which we signed in November 2019, for 20 incremental Embraer 175 aircraft, as well extending our 42 existing Embraer 175 for five years and at least 20 of our older CRJ-700s to another United Express operated for seven years. 10 of those Embraer 175 are already flying for United, with six additional aircraft scheduled for delivery this month and the remaining four in the first half of calendar year 2021. In April 2020, we applied for the PSP program and received $95.2 million, allowing us to retain all of our employees who would likely have been furloughed otherwise due to the significant reduction in our level of operations. These expenses are normally paid by our partners through the CPA. In our June quarter, we are the only publicly traded U.S. carrier to report a profit and this achieved positive cash flow to-date. In July, we announced a five-year contract with DHL to operate two 737-400 cargo aircraft. I am very pleased to tell you that both of those aircraft are currently in service today. In October, we announced that although the PSP program had ended, we would not furlough any employees to the end of the calendar year. We accomplish this through a combination of a pilot agreement for reduced hours, a significant number of voluntary crew leaves and a reduction of hours for administrative personnel. Again, I\u2019d like to thank all of our people for supporting each other and the company in this endeavor. In November, we entered into an agreement with United to prepay us $85 million to be used to pay down debt on existing aircraft, which enabled us to maximize our Treasury loan. Also in November, we finalized and closed $195 million loan under the CARES Act with the U.S. Treasury Department. And lastly, in November, we amended our American Capacity Purchase Agreement to extend 40 CRJ-9 aircraft for five years, truly in my mind a remarkable accomplishment given the environment. We remain focused on our primary business with our existing partners and opportunities to grow our business with them. We are also pursuing a number of new opportunities that we believe could provide the company additional long-term growth, diversification and enhanced earnings. I\u2019d like to turn it over to Brad Rich to give you an update on our level of operations, as well as on our American United and DHL operations.\nBrad Rich: Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. I will begin with an update of our block hour production. For the September quarter, we generated 57,622 block hours, which is about 50% of the pre-COVID level. Based on current guidance with our partners, we expect the December quarter to be at about 60% of pre-COVID levels and roughly 70% for the March quarter. Based on high level projections from one of our partners, we believe block hour utilization will continue to increase and reach pre-COVID levels by the end of the calendar year. I might not like to provide an update on our American operation relationship. We recently amended our CPA to operate 40 of our CRJ-900 aircraft for a term of five years. Our current fleet, as many of you know, is 64 CRJ-900 and that will reduce to 63 in June of 2021. Of these 63 aircraft, we own 48 and 41 of those are financed under our recently announced U.S. Treasury loan. We also have 15 aircraft leased through 2024. We will be using the majority of these aircraft to support the American operation. However, we are reviewing several new opportunities that would productively utilize some of these aircraft. Given the attractive financing and low debt balance on a majority of the fleet, we believe these aircraft are valuable assets and will remain productive. Additionally, American has requested that we pick up additional flying over the first half of calendar year 2021 over and above the new CPA levels. Although, we have not formalized an agreement, we believe this could result in three to five additional lines of flying. Obviously, this new agreement with American was extremely important to Mesa. Getting it done in this difficult and challenging environment was not easy and we are excited and pleased to continue our relationship with American that began over 30 years ago. And I would like to thank American Eagle leadership, including Devon May, Mark Moessner and George Stahle for their hard work and support. We did offer rates that we believe are competitive and appropriate considering the reduced aircraft ownership previously discussed. This agreement also demonstrates our ability to provide rates that we believe are industry leading. And now moving to an update of our United operation. As Jon -- as Jonathan pointed out, we have already added 10 new Embraer E175 LL aircraft that are scheduled and are scheduled to add six more this month. The last four will be delivered in the first half of calendar year 2021. As we add these aircraft to the United fleet, we are removing our CRJ-700s on a one for one basis. These aircraft will be leased to another United operator on a seven-year term. We are retraining most of the current CRJ-700 pilots and dowless on the Embraer 175 and most of that training expense will be covered by the training credits that are part of the purchase agreement. Within the next six months we will be operating a single fleet of 80 Embraer 175s with United, which will enhance operational performance and improve cost efficiencies. In regards to our cargo operations, we have two 737-400 cargo aircraft in service with DHL. Both aircraft are based in Cincinnati where we have a pilot domiciled and a maintenance base. So far we have been pleased with the operation and believe we are well-positioned to grow this line of business. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Mike Lotz to walk through our financial performance.\nMike Lotz: Great. Thanks, Brad. Let me give a quick recap on the earnings for the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2020, we recorded net income of $11.4 million or $0.32 per share. This compares a net income of $12.2 million for the same quarter last year or $0.35 per diluted share. As noted in our press release, the Q4 2020 results include for GAAP the deferral of $7.8 million of CPA revenue, all of which was billed and paid by American and United during the quarter and will be recognized over the remaining term of the CPAs. During the quarter we also recognize $48 point -- $40.8 million as an offset to wages relating to the previous announced PSP program. We did record $3.2 million of income tax expense for the quarter. However, we did not pay any cash taxes as we have over $500 million valuable NOL carry forward. For the full year 2020, we reported net income of $27.5 million or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to $47.6 million or $1.36 per diluted share last year. As noted in our press release also 2020 results include again for GAAP the deferral of $43.8 million of CPA revenue, which was deferred and will be recognized over the remaining term of the CPA. During the quarter we also recognize $83.8 million as an offset to wages related to the PSP program. Of note, the total PSP grant of $95.2 million, which initially was $92.5 million and then reallocated up to the $95.2, we recognized $83.8 million in fiscal 2020 and expect to recognize remaining balance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. For the year we reported $9.5 million of income tax expense, and as we noted, we have not paid any cash taxes. Quarter-over-quarter revenues down $79.8 million or 42% and $178.7 million or $108 million and for the year, revenue was down $178 million or 25% and $723.4 million and 545.1 million. Cash for the quarter increased by $34.5 million to $99.4 million. During the quarter we had CapEx expense of $1.5 million. We also paid $34.6 million in scheduled principal payments and we had deferred principal payments of $14 million in the quarter. In total we have deferred $28.1 million in principal payments since March. I\u2019d also like to now walk you through the very important U.S. Treasury loan which we recently closed on which I can tell you with a lot of effort, a lot of people within the company. At a high level, our total loan is $195 million. The first tranche funding was $43 million and was collateralized with existing unencumbered assets. Prior to the second tranche we extinguished $164 million of debt to unencumbered 44 aircraft using the combination of $83 million cash on hand and $81 million of prepaid CPA revenue from United. The second tranche funding was $152 million collateralized with the 44 aircraft for total $195 million. Net cash generated was $31 million, which is $195 million plus $164 million in debt was -- that was -- in debt that was extinguished. The U.S. Treasury debt, we said at LIBOR plus 3.50%. It is interest-only, while the debt that we extinguished was fully amortizing debt. As a result, scheduled principal payments going forward are significantly lower, if we choose not to repay the Treasury loan, which we have an option to do. To put this into context, prior to the Treasury loan, for example, fiscal year 2021 had $189 million of scheduled principal payments, which will be reduced to $96 million, a reduction of $93 million and for fiscal 2022, scheduled principal payments are reduced from $152 million to $91 million, a reduction of $62 million. In the next two fiscal years, scheduled principal payments are being reduced by $154 million. Also as part of a loan agreement, we did issue $4.9 million warrants for the U.S. Treasury that was struck at $3.98. I\u2019d like to touch on a few other items, included in the $164 million of debt that we extinguished was $21 million of the $28 million of total principal deferrals that we have through the end of the fiscal year. The remaining $7 million of deferrals, plus an additional $12 million, which we are differing between October and July, will all be repaid in August. We also negotiated total prepayment discounts of roughly $3.5 million. At fiscal year end, we had $22.9 million outstanding under our CIT revolver, which we are considering repaying now that we have closed on our Treasury loan. The $81 million United prepaid revenue received in November is expected to be reduced to zero by approximately February. CapEx for 2021 will primarily be our purchase of 20 engines from GE for roughly $110 million. Currently, 10 of those engines are scheduled for delivery in 2021 and 10 for 2022. We are currently in discussions with various parties on financing and lease options, as well as discussions with GE to modify the delivery schedule. Other cash items related to fiscal 2021, scheduled aircraft lease cash payments will exceed book expense by roughly $9 million. We continue to manage our vendor payments and have moved a significant number of our vendors to net 60, up from net 15 and net 30. For fiscal year 2021, we will be performing heavy maintenance that was previously deferred due to lower aircraft utilization levels in fiscal 2020. Lastly, as we look at the new American CPA terms for the 40 aircraft and the new E175 terms for the 20 new aircraft, we expect our pre-tax margins to be consistent with the past few years. Obviously, in this environment, there are a lot of areas that could impact these numbers both positively or negatively and due to this uncertainty, we are not offering any guidance at this time. I\u2019d like to now turn it back over to Jon.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Mike, and we appreciate the financial recap. At this point, Operator, I\u2019d be happy to field any questions that come from any of the listeners.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Savi Syth from Raymond James. You may go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. If I could help us with some of those deferred costs showing up and some of the deferred revenue happening, could you give us an idea of, maybe the progression I know -- the timing of everything is not exact, but any color on the progression of kind of the revenue build and the cost build in fiscal year \u201821?\nJonathan Ornstein: Mike, do you want to do that? Hello.\nMike Lotz: Yes. I got it. Thank you.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yeah.\nMike Lotz: Hey, Savi. This is Mike. So most of our revenue growth is going to be based on our block hour production. We did give guidance for the first two quarters. Third quarter and fourth quarter is a little hard for us to predict. We have gotten some indication from our partners that it\u2019s going to be increased. But we are just not in a position right now to give those from block hour projections for Q3 and Q4. But from a revenue build, that will primarily just be driven by our block hours. And on the cost side, our costs are going to be fairly consistent and we did have this deferral of some of our heavy maintenance on the airplanes that we are deferring from 2020 and we are seeing a lot of that in 2021.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Did those deferrals show up in the off -- should we assume kind of off-peak quarters, Mike, and so they are kind of heavy on those time periods or -- and then also do you have an update on any kind of those pass-through costs or are they part of going to be some of the other agreements?\nMike Lotz: No. Some of them are pass-through, but most of them are for the Mesa responsibility. And as far as timing, I think, it would be more likely in the front half of the year than the tail half.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. And then just one last clarification, the request from American that you are still working on for additional block hours line, that -- is that in the guidance or that would be above and beyond what\u2019s in the guidance?\nMike Lotz: I believe that\u2019s in the guidance.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bert Subin with Stifel. You may go ahead, sir.\nBert Subin: Hey. This is a Bert Subin with Stifel. Thanks for the time and good afternoon. Over the last couple of quarters, you have highlighted very strong controllable completion factors, almost pretty much as close as you can get to a 100%. What gives you confidence you can run this strong in operation and block hours start to come back and maybe you don\u2019t have the same degree of sparing that you have now?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, I will take a shot and Brad I am happy to have you add into that. First on the American side, we will have significantly more spares than we have ever had. So I think we would probably be okay there. This is really depends on what ultimately happens with those aircraft. We certainly will make sure that we have the adequate spares to operate at the levels that are above and beyond and I think that having those spare aircraft allows us to do that. On the United side, we have continued to operate. We have always operated for United above any contractual requirements. We have done a really good job. We have a lot of new aircraft there and we have adequate sparing plus. I think a big part of what goes on with United is we have two big maintenance bases that allow us to see a lot of aircraft and we don\u2019t see any real changes there. So I think we feel very confident, particularly with the age of the fleet at United. Brad, do you want to add anything to that?\nBrad Rich: I think, no, Jonathan. I think the two main things are, look, we are excited to move to one consistent fleet of Embraer 175s on the United side, which will really enhance operational reliability we believe. And then, as Jonathan already said, on the American side, we will be adequately spared.\nBert Subin: Yeah. No. I appreciate that. I guess, I am just wondering if some of the spares come down, you said there is potentially some productive use for some of those aircraft, if you expect that to have an impact or not really?\nJonathan Ornstein: I don\u2019t think we wouldn\u2019t jeopardize anything at American by pulling more aircraft out than we feel comfortable with. As a result of the financing that made available to us under the Treasury loan. These aircraft become financially much less of a burden and having the additional spare aircraft is something we want to do to continue to build -- even after 30 years, we continue to build the confidence of our partners. So I just don\u2019t think we\u2019d let it get to that point where we felt that we are not adequately spared.\nBert Subin: Okay. Great. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful color. Just one more as a follow-up, Jonathan, last quarter, you said you think there is greater opportunity on the regional side than the cargo side. I assume you still think that\u2019s the case, but just wondering if you had any commentary around that?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, no, I think, that my view on that is the regional business is clearly our core business and we do think that there continues to be some very good opportunities in the regional side. In terms of the cargo business, I mean, I think, that no one imagined the strength that we have seen in the cargo side and the opportunities that exist. The difference there is our partners at American, United and other mainline carriers, we will do deals 10, 20 aircraft at a time, whereas on the cargo side, they have a tenancy just to be a lot more incremental. And so, I think, for that reason, the cargo business will build, but potentially not at the same rate as we could potentially move the regional business. But that being said, I do think that the cargo business does provide us with some pretty significant opportunity, but it\u2019s just maybe taking a little -- it takes a little bit longer to develop. At United, we went from literally 20 airplanes to 80 airplanes in a matter of a few years, I just think it\u2019s going to, to do that kind of growth in the cargo business will take some time.\nBert Subin: Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Sir, you may go ahead.\nMike Linenberg: Oh! Hey. Hey, everyone. Hey, Jonathan. Just two on the cargo piece to kind of follow up on that, like when we think about how big that could be in two or three years? Are we talking what six, eight, 10 airplanes, do you get to a dozen airplanes? Just if you can sort of frame the expectations for us? And then I have a second one.\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. Well, we think the 737-400 continues to have a long-term attraction to the different cargo operations because of very good niche. We are looking at other aircraft types as well and I think they will probably move to 737-800s at some point. We are also looking at smaller aircraft. There seems to be a great need to get more products out to more places faster with the advent of overnight delivery literally to everywhere in the country, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go away anytime soon. And I think that as a result, we are going to continue to pursue what we think our number of attractive cargo opportunities. How fast they develop and how quick? I think is speculation. But I would be very surprised if we weren\u2019t significantly larger than we are today with only two aircraft and in a year or two. And again, that\u2019s just based on our existing business with -- our business with DHL. So I think that, like I said, the cargo operators take things a little bit more incrementally. But that being said, I think over time, we continue to build that operation nicely over the next couple of years. And I would like to think that we could add -- it would be nice if we could add an airplane every other month there somewhere in that kind of range. I think if we were at 10 and 12 airplanes in two years, I think, we\u2019d be pretty happy.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Great. And then just a question on, Mike, you gave us a lot of numbers on where you were a year -- fiscal year end from a liquidity perspective and now you have closed the other part of the loan. You talked about maybe paying down the CIT line of credit. How much -- can you just tell us how much capacity you have available on that CIT line and maybe give us a ballpark a calendar year end liquidity level, like, what we should be kind of honing in on? Thanks.\nMike Lotz: Yeah. So the CIT that we have out, I think, it\u2019s roughly $23 million, $24 million. I think that\u2019s about the amount that we have collateral to support under that facility. I think the actual facility may be for $35 million. But it\u2019s based on the collateral, I think, we are probably cap it like $25 million, of which we have the most of it drawn down.\nMike Linenberg: Okay.\nMike Lotz: And based on the Treasury loan and where we see liquidity, we are evaluating just paying that down keeping it in place, of course, just paying it down. And year-end liquidity is a little tricky right now. But we are not sure how much of the United prepayment will be burned off. So I prefer to hold off on kind of predicting cash for the year end right now.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Very good. Thanks. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Jonathan.\nMike Lotz: Yeah.\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. You may go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, Operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the time. So one kind of a net question, your liabilities on the current liability line and the non-current liability line don\u2019t add up on the balance sheet you provided today. It\u2019s -- those lines are off by a little bit of money, so you might want to look at that or trying to figure out why they are not adding? And then, my second question is with respect to the operation. The fact that you guys are running a really good on-time performance and a good operation right now, just that -- are you getting more inbounds for people wanting -- from other airlines wanting to sign you up since you have the capacity and you are one of the few airlines that\u2019s profitable?\nJonathan Ornstein: First -- let me address the first question, Helane, since you and I have known each other a long time. It\u2019s not the first time that you have pointed out an error and have been correct. So we would certainly take a good look at that and make sure that we have the numbers right. So, thank you.\nHelane Becker: Oh! My god. I am so sorry and I feel really bad.\nJonathan Ornstein: All right. Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s fine. I mean, I was just commenting today that when you run a big operation of any kind occasionally something slips through the cracks. So let us take a look at it and make sure that we have it right. On the second question, yeah, I think that we have really established ourselves as one of the leading regional carriers, and hopefully, one of the leading cargo carriers. There is certainly opportunity within the regional business as other CPAs have aircraft that are expiring. And our cost structure we feel is significantly below our major competitors. We think that in all probability the likelihood to be able to catch our cost structure is very low because so much of our cost structure is based on the fact that I think the last time I looked half of our employees have less than two years\u2019 seniority. So we have a young junior workforce that gives us some benefits there. So, yeah, and I think that both in the regional side and in the cargo side when there are RFPs out there, I think, Mesa will in fact be included going forward. So I do feel that we can win business both on our costs and also on the level of service that we can provide. Believe me, we know that we are being tested right now by DHL and we are doing everything we can to provide the highest quality business because we believe that there could be some growth coming in that regard, but we know that performance is critical. So\u2026\nHelane Becker: Okay.\nJonathan Ornstein: \u2026 I do think that it\u2019s been helpful to us and obviously, we have to build on this coming out of the pandemic to demonstrate that what we have done here is building the base for us to continue to grow the business.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s -- Jonathan, that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you so much. Sorry about that my addition there. But the other\u2026\nJonathan Ornstein: Don\u2019t worry about it.\nHelane Becker: The other thing I wanted to ask is, one of the things I am starting to see a lot of in the trade press is biometrics and on the use of that at airports and with the airlines and stuff. And I am wondering if either of your two partners have talked to you about making sure all of your gates and your boarding processes that are consistent with theirs as they move to that over the next few years?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, Brad, do you want to answer that? You were at United. You probably have a better feel for that than I do, any thoughts?\nBrad Rich: I apologize, Helane. Can you restate the question? I am sorry.\nHelane Becker: Oh! Yeah. No worries. It\u2019s just -- I am seeing a lot of stuff on biometrics and the use of biometrics\u2026\nBrad Rich: Yeah.\nHelane Becker: \u2026 to board people, and I guess, we are going to that because you don\u2019t -- we are going to -- it looks to me like we are going to a touchless environment at airports and so on from a health perspective, even after the pandemic goes away. And I am just kind of wondering if you are partners have approached you about making sure all of your airports are consistent with that?\nBrad Rich: So, the part of that obviously that we control is, I mean, we obviously stay in very close contact and follow the guidance of our partners as you well know. And your question is, have they approached us? Not with anything to the level that you have described. Are we making advances and progressions more toward the type of environment you have kind of described? Certainly. But how quickly things continue to develop at least to the extent you have described? I am obviously not very well qualified to address other than we just keep in touch with them closely, follow what the guidance they ask. And then as it relates to our own operation, our own people, of course, we are doing everything I think humanly possible to keep people safe in this environment, but those are my only thoughts, Helane.\nHelane Becker: Got you. That\u2019s really helpful. Okay. Thanks, gentlemen. Thanks for the -- thanks for now.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from George Stien with Corre Partners. Sir, you may go ahead.\nGeorge Stien: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. And Mike, this question is on the -- I wanted to restate maybe something that Mike was asking is, maybe if you could just give us a lens into the cash balance as of today are roughly around today where the UAL prepayment stands in gross debt?\nMike Lotz: I mean, yeah, look, we are fairly closer to the end of the calendar year. So we look at year end cash at probably somewhere around $170 million, of which probably at least half, $40 million to $50 million of that is still United prepaid cash that they have to burn off.\nGeorge Stien: Got you. Can you remind me of the -- so the CARES Act loan where the LTV stands on that one for the covenant or where you guys\u2026\nMike Lotz: I\u2019d say\u2026\nGeorge Stien: \u2026 landed on a LTV basis for the collateral?\nMike Lotz: Of the -- yeah. So the loan was based on an LTV, it was different for different types of equipment, but it was 50% on an aircraft with the majority of our loan was based on and the test going forward is 66.2% LTV. So there is some amount of cushion there as we test the collateral, I think, twice a year.\nGeorge Stien: But I guess as kind of round numbers today are getting close to year end, somewhere around $130 million to $120 million of cash net of the UAL plus, I guess, conceivably doubly collateralized CARES Act loan of $195 million and I guess, of course, net that against the market cap of $150 million, is that kind of -- those rough numbers add up?\nMike Lotz: Okay. Yeah. That\u2019s correct.\nGeorge Stien: Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.\nMike Lotz: You bet.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey guys. Thanks for the follow-up. Could you talk a little bit about with the American contract, what\u2019s the threshold that American needs to come down on their mainline fleet for them to be able to take aircraft out in the first half of the year? And also just could you provide an update on the white tail risk, especially if American kind of pulls out aircraft from that contract as they are able to?\nJonathan Ornstein: Brad, do you want to do that?\nBrad Rich: Well, sure. Look, we -- I want to be a little careful here becoming a spokesman for American. And all of the discussions we have had and Savi, I think, your question is, is in the -- it\u2019s related to the first half of 2021, is that correct?\nSavi Syth: Okay. That\u2019s correct.\nBrad Rich: Okay. Yeah. So, look, we -- in all the discussions we have had with American, the -- we think there is a threshold here of about another 40 aircraft of reduction that would then trigger some type of an issue with their scope. But look I want to be careful of that because it\u2019s Americans to describe, not us, but that\u2019s what we believe. And so -- and if you think of 40 additional narrow-body reductions in excess of the current reduction, that\u2019s quite a few airplanes, which we think would be pretty minimal risk for us, especially in environment where, as we mentioned, we are having more discussion about potentially additional flying above and beyond the 40 aircraft. So we -- having said all of that, we really -- we don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to happen, of course, but we think there is relative -- relatively small risk in those first six months.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. And just kind of curious\u2026\nBrad Rich: Okay.\nSavi Syth: \u2026 what the white -- updated white tail risk and maybe more so because it\u2019s not the CRJ-900s I think have been pledged as well, just kind of curious what the kind of updated white tail risk is?\nBrad Rich: Mike, I am happy to make some comments, but do you want to take the tail risk part?\nMike Lotz: Yeah. So what -- you talked about lease exposure?\nSavi Syth: Exactly. Lease and debt payments that might go beyond.\nMike Lotz: Yeah. Yeah, I mean our tail risk has always -- it\u2019s really related to the lease aircraft and there is 15 of them. And I think we have always said it\u2019s somewhere around $25 million to $30 million and it\u2019s a tail that occurs not until I think that the first or second calendar quarter of 2024. So that number really hasn\u2019t changed, and of course, the aircraft are fungible, but those 15 aircraft are in the fleet.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And at this time, I am showing no further questions. Sir, I will turn the call back over to you for any closing comments.\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. Thank you very much. Thank you everyone for your support in Mesa over the years and certainly through the pandemic. It\u2019s been obviously challenging. But on the same -- at the same time, we have worked very hard, keep all of our people moving in the same direction. They have been incredibly supportive. I have to tell you, I am every day amazed that the work effort that people are putting in, whether it\u2019s out online in the maintenance hangers and dispatch or the people who are working from home diligently to keep the company moving forward. We think that the accomplishments this quarter certainly will bode well for the future. I think when we look at our two main partnerships with United and their support, your willingness to loan -- to prepay us $80-plus million to help us financially strengthen our balance sheet. I think is something and particularly given the environment remarkable in itself. And we are really pleased with American and their support, and the work that Brad did putting that deal together that allowed us to continue to operate those 40 aircraft within the American system. Those two things, I think, will hopefully be indicative of what we are capable of doing going forward with those partners. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury Department loan has been giving us incredible flexibility with the aircraft. Our cash cost on the aircraft that were financed by the Treasury loan is about $11,000 a month and I think that it\u2019s important that. While we have depreciation expense and obviously, engine expense, that flexibility is what allowed us to put the American deal together. I am hopeful on the cargo side that we can continue to see opportunities there. I can tell you that we have had numerous inbound calls regarding our cargo capability over the last few months. We -- and we are looking forward to acting on those calls also going forward. All in all, we feel much better with what\u2019s happening now on the world scene at the beginning of the distribution of the vaccine, which in itself may be a business opportunity for us and I think that our partners are continuing to show their confidence. In fact, one of our partners has indicated to us at the high level that they expect us to be running at almost 100% utilization by the end of the calendar year. So hopefully, as they say in every -- all the indications are in the green and we are continuing to make progress going forward. So thank you again. Always feel free to give us a call if you have any additional questions. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: And thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 3, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-08-10 22:41:12", "content": "Operator: Welcome, and thank you for standing by. I would like to inform all participants that today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. Participants will be in listen-only mode for the duration of the conference. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jonathan Ornstein.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you very much, operator, and thank you, everyone for taking a moment out of your day to listen to our quarterly results. As the operator indicated this is Jonathan Ornstein, I'm the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. On the call with me today are Mike Lotz, our President and Chief Financial Officer; Brad Rich, our Chief Operating Officer; Darren Zapfe, our Vice President of Finance. Unfortunately, Brian Gillman, our General Counsel got caught on a delayed flight; I'm only thankful it is not one of ours. I'd like everyone to be aware we are doing this remotely, so it has some challenges but I think we'll be okay. I'd like to start off by reading the Safe Harbor statement. Before the presentation and comments begin, Mesa would like to remind you that some of the statements in response to your questions in this conference call may include forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements by their nature involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts and assumptions, and are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Also, please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. And any forward-looking statements could be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our press release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, which Mesa encourages you to read. These risks and uncertainties include those associated with COVID-19 virus and it's related impact on our business. In addition, please refer to the press release in the Investor section of our website to find additional disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that will be used on today's call. Okay, so let's get to our release. We had a pretty good quarter. We do, however, continue to see significant COVID-19 impact on utilization. Block [ph] hours are down 70% this quarter versus the same quarter last year. On a positive note, based on July actuals and our partners' current schedules for August and September, we expect the current quarter, which clearly are subject to change; but we expect the current quarter to be an 87% increase from this last quarter, which should put us at about 54% of pre-COVID-19 levels. If utilization remains in place by continuing working with our employee groups, we believe it is possible for us to avoid an employee furlough. Some of those initiatives include reduced work week, reduction in crew minimums, and continued use of voluntary leaves of absence. Of course, if the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act is extended, these initiatives would be unnecessary. We believe that Mesa's cost structure and the lower trip cost for small regional aircraft is advantageous in the current environment. Furthermore, we believe as the low cost provider of regional jet service, Mesa is exceptionally well positioned as costs have become a far more critical element in our partner's analysis. I think it's important and worth emphasizing that Mesa's low costs are not by accident; we do believe Mesa has the lowest overhead for aircraft in the industry, and our corporate culture has always been built around productivity, efficiency and lean organizational structure ever since it was founded by Larry and Risley. Additionally, if we are successful in accessing a reasonable portion of our $277 million allocation under the CARES Act loan program, given the increased liquidity as a result of the loan, combined with our current cash flow estimates, we believe Mesa's financial profile will be significantly improved. It is important to note that we operate 100% of our business under CPAs. These CPAs provide for significant amount of our cost to be covered with fixed monthly amounts. Although we build our partners and received payments for those fixed costs, under GAAP, we were required to defer $16 million of fixed revenue in the quarter for future periods. I'd like to take a moment and welcome David Butler, who is returning to head up our HR department. I would also like to send my heartfelt best wishes for a speedy recovery to Capt. Andy Hughes, our ALPA MEC Chairman, who has been with Mesa for 37 years, and has become a very close friend and a great addition to our company. As you know Brad Rich is focused on our American contract and operations, so I'd like to turn it over to him now to talk to you about American Eagle [ph].\nBrad Rich: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you, Jonathan. We've been working collaboratively with American and have agreed to a temporary reduction in rates and other cash flow benefits around the timing of weekly payments through the end of September, corresponding with the end of the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act. In addition, we agreed to remove two aircraft in June that were scheduled to be removed in January of 2021 given that the aircraft aren't required for operation in this reduced utilization time period, and the fact that American has agreed to pay for all of the costs associated with the two aircraft. More importantly, we continue to have productive discussions with American with respect to an extension of our existing CPA. Once the CPA terms have been agreed to, we've been told American will determine what the fleet size and term will be. Obviously, in the current environment, an extension we recognize is more difficult. But as I said on our last call, while we don't know the size, scope or duration of the extension, we do remain convinced that American believes we are a valued part of the portfolio. In the event, we don't get an extension at all; our exposure is fairly limited on the CRJ-900 fleet. Without an extension, 49 aircraft will be expiring over a 23-month period starting in February of 2021. Of the 49 aircraft, 33 will have no debt at the end of the 23-month period, one lease expires and 15 leases will have monthly payments of $69,000 per aircraft per month. Keep in mind, that's relative to a current fleet average of $180,000 and that will go through March of 2024, which -- those rates, we believe, are competitive of subleases or/and better than post COVID-19 market lease rates. The 33-owned aircraft, which will have no debt have -- which will have no debt have recently been valued at approximately $212 million in post COVID-19 appraisals. The remaining seven aircraft do not expire until 2025. While the return-to-normal demand levels would offer the highest likelihood of a contract extension at American, we believe that if there is a silver lining, it is a renewed focus on cost, which has always been one of Mesa's strengths. We believe that our CRJ-900s offer the lowest available seat mile costs in the regional industry, and I would also just echo what Jonathan already stated that the Mesa corporate culture has always been built around discipline in productivity and efficiency. Given our growth over the last several years and our productive workforce, we believe our low cost structure is sustainable for the future. And I would maybe just add some emphasis here; I've been doing this a long time, both in all the years that I was a competitor to Mesa, and in my years at United Airlines. I would often hear people that were skeptical about Mesa's ability to maintain and sustain this low cost structure. Now that I'm here and I've seen it and experienced it, I would just say I do believe that it is sustainable. Continuing on the cost side for a minute, we've implemented a number of initiatives to take advantage of the reduced utilization. We've also had several significant -- however, had significant positive responses to voluntary leaves of absences from our employees. For July, we had almost 500 requests for voluntary leaves that were granted. We obviously have in place a hiring freeze. On the pilot training front, we reduced our simulator and other crew training costs by approximately $4 million in the quarter. On another positive note, while we are not currently dealing with the pilot shortage, we do have approximately 425 pilot applications on file, which is the most that I've ever seen at one-time since I've been at Mesa. Focusing now on operations for a minute, we did not have any controllable canceled flights that either American or United for the entire quarter. We also achieved all of our on-time performance targets for both, American and United, for each month of the quarter. Lastly, I would just say that we are working very specifically with our major partners and following the guidance of the CDC to create a safe environment for our customers as well as for our employees. Now, I'll turn it back over to Jonathan for an update on United, and on our cargo business.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Brad. At United, we have 20 new Embraer 175 scheduled for delivery from September 2020 through June of 2021. We are currently working on the financing for the first 10 aircraft. Obviously, given the current market conditions, this is no small task, and we are looking at a multiple of creative options. Unfortunately, more conventional standard bank lending would be significantly more expensive than we previously obtained. Thankfully, the 175 is viewed by the market as strong collateral, and we hope to have something finalized soon. Under the term of the existing CPA as each new Embraer 175 is put into service, an existing CRJ-700 would be removed from our CPA and leased to another United operator for seven years. The other United Express carrier would be responsible for all obligations under the leases. However, subject to certain limits and requirements, United will be responsible for certain unmet rent obligations under the leases. Given the uncertainties arising from COVID-19, Mesa has prepared to continue to operate the aircraft for United. We have worked collaboratively with United and have agreed to waive minimums and given temporary reduced rates and other cash flow benefits around the timing of weekly payments through the end of September 2020, corresponding with the end of the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act. In spite of a difficult operating environment, we will continue to do everything we can to assist our partners. On the cargo front, as you know, we announced a five-year deal to operate Boeing 737-400 freighters for DHL. The aircraft are anticipated to start service in October and November; this is the start of what we hope will be a longstanding successful relationship with DHL. We are still looking -- working through the process of getting the aircraft type on our certificate, the initial cadre of pilots has been trained, the aircraft are going into heavy maintenance, and we are positioning our support staff in Cincinnati. The structure of our contract with DHL is similar to our existing contract business, makes it little bit [indiscernible] crews and maintenance, DHL will be widening the aircraft and fuel and is responsible for generating cargo revenue. With two start-up -- the start-up of two aircraft, we expect it to be slightly better than breakeven and should become profitable over time as we add additional aircraft. The total amount of the start-up cost is approximately $5 million. For this quarter, we spent $600,000 and forecast to spend another $2.1 million in the next quarter as the operation spools up. I'd like to turn it over to Mike Lotz for a financial overview.\nMike Lotz: Thanks, Jonathan. On a liquidity side for the quarter, we ended at $65 million in cash, which is a $13 million increase over last quarter's $52 million. During the quarter, we had $12 million in capital expenditures related to engines, it was also offset by engine deposits that we had. We had $24 million in scheduled principal payments on aircraft and engines, and we had $16 million of principal and lease deferrals that we were able to negotiate. Looking out to the end of the calendar year, CapEx is expected to be minimal, except for the 20 new 175 that is scheduled delivery and the 20 engines that we currently have order -- on order from GE Aviation. As we've pointed out on our last call, when we were at $52 million in cash at March 31, we were targeting to breakeven or better cash flow through the end of the calendar year. We believe we are still on target for that and continue -- and should continue to operate at breakeven or better cash flow. This does not take into account any potential proceeds from the US Treasury loan program. Under the US Treasury loan program, we've been allocated $277 million. We are working with the Treasury Department and their advisors on terms and final amounts of the loans. Given the equity in our aircraft and other assets, we believe we can access most, if not all of our allocation. We have been and will continue to work with lessors. Our lessors, debt holders and suppliers on deferrals, reduced rates and relaxed payment terms. Now, let me just walk through some of the financial data provided in the press release. We reported adjusted pre-tax income of $4.9 million; this compares to pre-tax income of $13.4 million for the same quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter variance was primarily due to deferred revenue of $16 million. Again, as we outlined in our press release and Jonathan pointed out, this is a GAAP adjustment related to the fixed portion of our CPA revenue and not related to any changes in our CPA. We continue to bill and are getting paid for fixed revenue by our partners as we always have. Additionally, for the quarter, we reported $1.5 million of income tax expense for net income of $3.4 million or $0.10 per share. Just a quick note on our income taxes, although we're reflecting tax as an expense, we will not pay cash taxes as we still have roughly $478 million of NOLs. Total debt on the balance sheet at quarter-end was $764 million, down $24 million from the prior quarter. We still have our $23 million line of credit run; and just to recap, we were granted the $92.5 million in connection with the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act covering the period April through September. Through June, we had received $46.3 million and have subsequently received $15.4 million in July, and $15.4 million in August, with the remaining $15.4 million due September 1. As discussed in our press release, we are not providing any further guidance at this point. I'd like to turn it back over to Jonathan now.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Mike. Obviously, this environment has pushed everyone to their limit. I really am thankful that the company has pulled together the way it has. Our whole country has helped restraining [ph] the COVID-19 virus. That being said, we believe we are well positioned with our core company values and assets, take advantage of opportunities that may present themselves. We believe that those opportunities exist and that we will continue to pursue them prudently with the idea to maximize shareholder value. I'd like to thank everyone for taking the time out of their day to join us, and open up for any questions that we may be able to help you with.\nOperator: We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And, just on the -- you mentioned $60 million [ph] in lease and principal deferrals; wondering if you can talk about what you're expecting over the next 18 months? And maybe tied to that, what concessions have you granted your partners and how long those continue for?\nJonathan Ornstein: Mike, do you want to do that?\nMike Lotz: Sure. So the principal payments going forward, the deferrals that we were able to accomplish so far, we have not projected any further deferrals in any of our projections on cash flow; so they're the existing debt schedules that exist. And as far as with our partners, the agreements we have with both, United and American are similar. They're related to credits, primarily as a result of us being able to operate at slightly better operating cost as a result of the Payroll Support Program. And additionally, we did some reductions in minimums and adjusted some of the timing of our true-ups, but that's the extent of what we did with the partners.\nSavi Syth: And is the reduction in the minimums; Mike, does that go through September 30 or does that go beyond as well?\nMike Lotz: Just through September 30.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And then, just for a second question, regarding the CRJ-700s, the comment about possibly being operated by Mesa I think is new, is kind of GoJet can't take delivery as it seems to be the case based on kind of SkyWest comments. Have you negotiated the economics around operating these as we seated -- the seats [ph] or is there more to go before that can happen?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, Mike, correct me if I'm wrong. Brad, you can jump in. But we have had discussions with United. I don't think we've finalized things. I will mention that we had made a proposal to them a while back, but I don't think that if in fact they came to us and asked us to operate the aircraft, I don't think it would be a high hurdle for us to come to an agreement.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead. Helane Becker, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Are you there?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes.\nHelane Becker: Yes. Good. Thanks. I don't know what's wrong with my phone. So just on the cargo business and the breakeven number, is that after the startup costs?\nJonathan Ornstein: No, that's on a run rate basis.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's helpful. And then the other question, part of the question is, is there potential to grow that business with DHL?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. I'll be frank; I don't think we would have taken on the business if we thought that two aircraft were going to be the limit. I think that we feel very strongly that if we can operate these aircraft properly that there is significant growth opportunity. As the package program becomes more important to America and timeline becomes more important, I think all the cargo operators are looking at how they can most efficiently serve. And one of the ways to do that is by the ability to fly smaller aircraft, they can bring packages closer and later -- leave later in the day with efficient operators like Mesa flying smaller jets like 737s as opposed to the larger gauge aircraft. So, we think there is a secular trend towards the smaller aircraft. And we would like to be right in the middle of that operating the 737 variant.\nHelane Becker: All right. Got you. And they're wanting the 400 versus the 800?\nJonathan Ornstein: I think that -- you know, I'm not really having privy to what DHL is thinking. These are aircraft that had been in their fleet. And so, they moved those from another operator to us, but I do think that the long-term plan would be to probably just given the fact that the age of the aircraft is to probably focus on 737-800s going out into the future.\nHelane Becker: Yes, that one makes sense. Okay. Well, thank you, Jonathan. Thanks everybody else for your time.\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: We now have a question from Michael Lindenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMichael Lindenberg: Hey, good afternoon guys. Just a couple here. On the $277 million CARES Act loan, do you have a sense of the potential cost of that to the terms? I know some carriers have indicated the size and they've thrown out numbers anywhere from LIBOR plus 300 to LIBOR plus, I want to say, 400, 450. Are you in that range or anything that you can tell us on the path to that amount [ph]?\nJonathan Ornstein: Mike, do you want to respond? I mean, I don't think we've gotten that far along. We have a rough idea. We think that's probably the range. The range would actually start out a little bit lower, but I think when we've had our discussions, that's been the range. Mike, do you want to add anything on that?\nMike Lotz: Yes, that's the range we're expecting, but we haven't had any discussion or negotiating points with the Treasury on the rate of the loan at this point.\nMichael Lindenberg: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then, the -- let's say that you do operate the CRJ-700s in tandem with the 175s, are -- you're going to fly them as 50-seaters, right as CRJ-550s or you're actually going to opt them as larger regional jets? I wasn't -- it wasn't clear.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. No, if -- assuming that we take delivery of the 175, which we fully intend on doing at this point; to operate those aircraft, they would have to be operated as 50-seat aircraft under United's current scope agreement with their pilots.\nMichael Lindenberg: Okay. Okay, that's great. And then just lastly, when we think about how you're going to account for the DHL business, I think Jonathan, did you say -- wait you cover crews and did you say maintenance? Did I hear that right; maintenance on 737s, and then DHL picks up the aircraft fuel and the cargo revenues?\nJonathan Ornstein: That's correct. It's just a crew and maintenance, CMI, crew, maintenance and insurance contract.\nMichael Lindenberg: I see. So, then does that -- like how do you -- okay, so you have some sort of revenue that offsets that. I don't know if it's going to be -- it's going to be -- I don't know, maybe you're going to call it CPA revenue, but it will be tied to DHL. Maybe, it's all in a single line item.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. I mean, just to give you an idea, order of magnitude, we're estimating the revenue on two aircraft. It's very small; I mean, we're talking about $8 million to $10 million. Obviously, we have to grow the business pretty significantly but the longest journey begins with the first step. And we just believe that given the environment, which did not exist at the time we went into it, but we clearly now feel that being in the cargo business is probably we think a pretty good bet long-term.\nMichael Lindenberg: Yes. No, I agree. And then just like on that maintenance though with the 737, do you -- I mean, are you going to have to have your mechanics proficient on 737 maintenance? Do you have to get spare parts and the like -- like how should we think about that?\nJonathan Ornstein: Mike, Brad, do you want to take a shot at that in terms of how we're going to do the maintenance?\nMike Lotz: I mean, Brad, go ahead.\nBrad Rich: Well, yes, Mike, we're setting up part agreements, maintenance agreements very similar to how we do on the existing passenger flying. So it's not going to be much different.\nMichael Lindenberg: Okay. All right. Very good. Thanks.\nJonathan Ornstein: I can add to that, Mike. We're not going to be responsible for the heavy maintenance, the engines on the 737 and the C-checks like our contract with American where they own the aircraft; those become pass-through, so there is little -- a lot less exposure on that. And part of our $5 million startup is some inventory and startup costs. We're trying to do a lot of power by the hour to minimize our investments. But, yes, our mechanics will be doing the work and setting up in Cincinnati.\nMichael Lindenberg: Okay. Okay. No, it sounds like basic line maintenance. That makes sense. Okay, that's helpful.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes.\nMichael Lindenberg: Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Bert Subin with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBert Subin: Yes, thanks for the time. Jonathan, following up on Helane's question, do you view the opportunity on the cargo side or on the air travel side is greater for Mesa longer term at least in terms of your growth?\nJonathan Ornstein: That's a good question. I think the cargo business will take some time to develop. DHL is a conservative company; we have to develop a reputation with them. Could we be at 10 aircraft in 18 months? Yes. When I look at big opportunities, I still strongly believe that our biggest opportunities are within the regional business as there continues to be consolidation, clearly, the COVID-19 impact has been negative on some carriers and Mesa's position, particularly in light of liquidity that could be granted to us through the Treasury loan and our cost structure could make some of those opportunities become very real. And I think some of them are in fact, you know, not insignificant. So, I think our focus has been on the regional jet side. We love the cargo business; as you know, we recently added Dan McHugh, the former CEO of Southern to our Board. We have some very good people working on the cargo side but in terms of size, the opportunity on the regional jet side is still a very big opportunity given the dislocation that's occurred due to the pandemic. Mike, Bryan [ph], do you guys -- I mean, Brad, do you want to add anything to that?\nBrad Rich: Not [indiscernible].\nMike Lotz: This is Mike. It was -- we started this as the way to diversify our business and not just be regional jet; so part of it is diversification of our business. And also part of it was as part of the pilot situation, being able to offer our existing pilots upgrades into a narrow body [ph] who pays more is something that we think will attract and retain people. Going forward, at some point, there will be the pilot -- return to a pilot situation that we've seen in the past, and we'll have to deal with that at that point.\nBert Subin: Okay, thanks. That's helpful a lot. Just one follow-up. I guess, probably for Mike. How variable is Mesa's cost structure, at least in percentage terms? And do you think there is any structural benefit that you will carry through the pandemic, at least on the other side, that you could expect potentially your cost structure to get a little better?\nMike Lotz: Yes. I mean, part of our -- one of our challenges in our cost structure was the cost to train pilots.\nJonathan Ornstein: And to attract pilots, and the bonus that we give pilots [ph].\nMike Lotz: And that's going to certainly change going forward for some period of time. We were paying significant bonuses to attract pilots. We had higher-than-normal attrition. So just those factors alone, I think, will have a favorable impact on our cost structure going forward.\nBert Subin: And then, on the variable fixed split?\nMike Lotz: What was that?\nBert Subin: I'm just wondering on the variable fixed, the split for Mesa, I know it's a little different in your business. But I'm just wondering what percentage of your cost structure is variable?\nMike Lotz: Yes, it has always been roughly 50/50.\nBert Subin: Okay. Thanks.\nMike Lotz: And we don't see that dynamic changing significantly.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We now have Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Hey, thanks. Just on the cargo side, kind of curious how large that business has to be to kind of get to profitability levels? I'm guessing as you grow that, the overhead is going to over more operations and is that what takes it -- gets it to be profitable?\nJonathan Ornstein: Mike, do you want to answer that? Mike, you want to respond to that?\nMike Lotz: Sure. I mean we're at two aircraft, we're slightly better than breakeven and I think we're spreading all of the costs over just two aircraft. But I think to the point where we get 8 or 10 aircraft, it would be profitable like most of our other CPA business -- comparable to other CPA business that will probably take to get the 6, 8, 10 aircraft.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. Thank you. And if I might ask just a quick question on the United; it sounded like over the weekend, United might have to downgrade some of their 76-seat aircraft to 70 seats if they have to furlough pilots. Does that have any impact on your agreements with United if some of those have to be Mesa aircraft?\nJonathan Ornstein: I think that there is -- yes, it doesn't have any impact. We would just have to re-seat the aircraft and push some of the Embraer 175s from 76 seats down to 70 seats.\nSavi Syth: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: We have no more questions in queue.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Well, everybody again, thank you very much. The company has -- as I mentioned, our employees have just done a fabulous job, very brave in the field. We've done some really good work corporately in terms of maintaining our low cost structure. We feel that the opportunities in front of us are significant. We feel that given the cost structure, given our liquidity and what very well be significantly enhanced liquidity generated by the Treasury loan, it really puts us in a position where we can take -- I hate to use the word advantage, but we can see some opportunities that may develop as this rather significant dislocation in the industry continues to unwind. We feel strongly that this plan will -- these things can all happen in the near term. And again, we are doing everything we can to position the company to be best -- the choice of our partners when they decide how to do this that we're the company that they choose to do it with. So, again, thank you very much. We have a way to go, no doubt about it. You can imagine we have a lot of work on our price of our equity, which has been impacted like everyone else in the industry. But hopefully, as we can continue to put more quarters like this together, people will see Mesa for what I think it's true value is, and realize that we have good income potential, as well as good assets behind the value of our stock. So, thank you all very much. We're always free to speak to people, if you'd like to call in afterwards. And again, we appreciate your time today. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you for year participation."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 2, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-05-11 23:01:10", "content": "Operator: Welcome, and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference [Operator Instructions] I would like to inform all parties that today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Jonathan Ornstein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone for joining us on our call today. As the operator indicated this is Jonathan Ornstein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. On the call with me today are Mike Lotz, our President and Chief Financial Officer; Brian Gillman, Executive VP and General Counsel; Brad Rich, our Chief Operating Officer; and Darren Zapfe, our Vice President of Finance. I'd like everyone to be aware we are doing this remotely. So it has its challenges but I think we'll be okay. I'd like to ask Brian to read the safe harbor statement. Thank you.\nBrian Gillman: Thanks, Jonathan. Before the presentation and the comments begin, Mesa would like to remind you that some of the statements in response to your questions in this conference call may include forward-looking statements. As such, they are subject to future events and uncertainties that could also affect our actual results to differ materially from those statements. Also please note the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our press release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC, which Mesa encourages you to read. These risks and uncertainties include those associated with the COVID-19 virus and its impact on our business. In addition, please refer to the press release in the Investors section of our website to find additional disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that will be used on today's call.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Thank you very much, Brian. The founder of our company, Larry Risley who's also my mentor had an expression to describe the uncertainty in the airline industry. Larry used to say something happens every year that happens every 10 years. Well, I think even Larry would be surprised by the depth of the impact of the coronavirus and what it's had on our employees, our company, our industry, our country and even the world. We'd like to start by thanking all of our people who are out on the frontline facing this challenge every day when they come to work, along with our partners American United we are working diligently to provide the highest level of safety for our passengers and our employees. I'd like to give you a brief update on the level of operations. We know that things can change rapidly in this environment. Pre-COVID-19, we operated approximately 650 flights per day. In April, we saw that number drop to 194 flights per day or about 30% of pre-COVID-19 levels. For May, we are currently operating at approximately 240 flights per day. We've been able to respond very quickly and effectively to this new level of operations. I'd also like to give an update on the CARES Act. As previously disclosed, Mesa expects to receive a total of $92.5 million in connection with the payroll support program under the CARES Act, covering the period April through September 2020. In April, Mesa received $30.8 million under the program and expects to receive $15.4 million each month June through September. Since we were under the $100 million threshold, none of the $92 million is a loan and we're not required to issue any warrants. The proceeds under the grant can only be used to pay for employee wages and related costs. We have also applied for a loan under the CARES Act. We are working with the treasury department and their advisers and have a call scheduled this week to discuss our loan application. We believe Mesa is well-positioned given the equity we believe we have in our assets, primarily aircraft and engines. That being said, we have very little insight into loan amounts and approval criteria and we'll know more later this week. Let's turn now to our partner update. For United there has been a delay of the 20 new Embraer 175s. These aircraft were originally scheduled for May through December of this year and have been delayed to late 2020 and 2021. We plan to finance the aircraft under the same type of structure we had with the previous 18 Embraer 175 that we own today. With the support from both Embraer and United, we continue to pursue various financing options. In conjunction with the delay we will continue to operate our CRJ-700 fleet of 20 aircraft until the new 175s are delivered at which point they are scheduled to be leased to another United Express operator configured with 50 seats of the new CRJ-550. We are working very collaboratively with United and have agreed to waive minimums and have given temporary reduced rates through the end of September and other cash flow benefits around the timing of weekly payments. Of course, we will only do what we are comfortable with in this high-risk environment, but we'd like to do everything we can to assist our partners in seeing through this difficult time. A quick look at the United fleet. We have 60 Embraer 175. 42 are owned by United. It's leased to us in 18 Mesa and had United participation. We also have 20 CRJ-700, 18 are owned by Mesa and two are leased. So for United we have very -- we have relatively little exposure or tail risk. As you know Brad Rich has been focused on American. So I'll -- I would like to ask him to give you an update on American.\nBrad Rich: Thank you, Jonathan. In an effort to reduce system capacity, American elected to remove three aircraft from the CPA, which had previously been deferred, two of those aircraft come out in May and one in June. We are also working collaboratively with American and have proposed a temporary reduction in rates through the end of September and similar to United other cash flow benefit around the timing of weekly payments. I do want to make an important point as I have been tasked with negotiating an extension with American. Although we have not accomplished that yet in large part due to the current environment, we have been told that we are -- will continue to be part of the American portfolio of carriers going forward. While, we don't know the size, scope or duration of an extension, we remain convinced that American believes we are a valued part of the portfolio. As I just mentioned, I have had ongoing discussions regarding contract extensions, but given the current environment, I think it would be worthwhile to provide some details on the impact of a worst case, no extension scenario. Assuming no extension, 49 of the 56 aircraft expire over 23 months, beginning in January of 2021. The remaining seven aircraft do not expire until 2025. The debt on those expiring aircraft that are being removed is very low at under $1.5 million per aircraft. 33 of the aircraft have no debt at the end of the 23 months. At the time of expiry our 15 lease aircraft will be rough -- the aircraft expense will be at roughly $69,000 per month per aircraft, certainly at/or below post-COVID-19 market rates. While a return to normal demand levels would offer the highest likelihood of a contract extension at American, we believe that if there is a silver lining, it is a renewed focus on cost which has always been one of Mase's strengths. Another strength of Mesa is proposing creative solutions that create value for Mesa and our partners. For example, Mesa's 76 CRJ-900 aircraft could be converted to 65 seats and operate at what we believe would be rate competitive to 50-seat aircraft, while offering both more seats and dual-class service. As you know American can operate 65-seat aircraft within their small regional depth scope limitations as compared to 50 seats for both United and Delta. I think it is also important and worth emphasizing that Mesa's low costs are not by accident. We believe Mesa has the lowest overhead for aircraft in the industry and our corporate culture has always been built around productivity, efficiency, and a lean organizational structure. We don't have an infrastructure for pro rate or at risk line. We build our entire business around supporting our partner capacity purchase agreement. In other words, we don't have the traditional overhead that goes with that we're at risk blind such as ticketing, scheduling, filings, credit card processing, and other such overhead costs. We have eliminated all those costs and operate 100% CPA. As another clear example Mesa structured its last pilot agreement and did not and we have not incorporated the sign-on retention bonuses into the pay scales as most other carriers did. We believe this will give us a significant cost advantage in this environment going forward. As a result of our focus on low operating costs, we believe we offer the lowest rates in the industry creating significant savings to our partners each year. Coupled with our ability to offer modest short-term cash flow relief, we believe we are the most attractive long-term alternative in the industry. Now, let me touch on what we are doing operationally to preserve cash. Deferring heavy maintenance, of course, as we utilize a much smaller portion of our fleet. We've also had significant positive response to voluntary leaves of absences from our employees. And in fact, in May, we have had over 600 requests for voluntary leads. We obviously have in place a hiring freeze. We're also reducing pilot training costs as those costs have been reduced to costs associated with required recurrent training no new hire training. As you know from previous calls, the new hire pilot training expenses were extraordinarily high due to the pilot shortage. That was a priority previously and it still is. Now, if it becomes necessary to downsize in October given the loss of Payroll Protection Programs and the continuation of a downturn in traffic, although very difficult and as a last resort, the direct labor reductions for pilot flight attendants mechanics and dispatch is straightforward and directly related to the level of operations. Given our current low overhead, the administrative staff reduction, we believe would likely be less than 100 people. Lastly, we still plan to enter the cargo business prior to calendar year end. You may have seen that we recently added Dan McHugh to our Board of Directors. Dan has an extensive cargo background serving as CEO of Southern Air Cargo prior to its acquisition by Atlas. And now, I will turn the time over to Mike, where he'll provide some financial details of where this all puts us.\nMike Lotz: Thanks Brad. So, in addition to the operational areas to preserve cash, we're working with all of our major vendors on deferrals, reduced rates, and relaxed payment terms. We're also working constructively with our aircraft financing parties to achieve potential deferrals or reductions. Given our reasonable expectation regarding deferrals the significant cost savings we have implemented or plan to implement as well as a traffic projection with only modest increases toward the end of the year it is our goal to achieve a breakeven cash flow where we ended March through the end of the calendar year. While this may appear to be a lofty goal, we believe it is achievable. This goal assumes we not take any loans under the CARES Act and that we were able to successfully finance the E175 deliveries and new CRJ-700 900 engines which we have on order in the same structure we have in the past. I'd like to just walk through some of the basic Q2 P&L and cash items most of which are outlined in the earnings release. For the second quarter, we reported pretax income of $3.2 million this compares to pretax income of $17 million for the same quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter variance was primarily due to the timing of scheduled heavy engine and airframe maintenance of $10.7 million which was anticipated and outlined in our last quarter guidance. Quarter-over-quarter we were also impacted by the severe drop-off in flight activity in March due to the impact of COVID-19; we estimate the impact of the $3 million as we had little to no time to mitigate the impact. Additionally, for the quarter, we reported $1.3 million of income tax expense for net income of $1.9 million or $0.05 per share. Just a quick note on income taxes, although, we reflect income tax as an expense we will not pay any cash taxes as we still have in excess of $478 million in NOLs. On cash and liquidity, we ended the quarter with $52.4 million in cash. During the quarter, we drew down $23 million on our line of credit. We estimate we still have approximately $5 million under the line. We also have five unencumbered CRJ-700 aircraft. During the quarter, we paid $11 million in deposits on previously ordered engines. The engine deliveries have been pushed to 2021. Two engines were delivered in April and we applied our deposits to pay for those engines.  Lastly, on cash during the quarter we had $6 million in lease expense in excess of booked lease expense and $8 million in aircraft property taxes related to prior periods which are paid by our partners through the CCA and trued up. Total debt on the balance sheet at quarter end was $788 million, down $20 million compared to the loss of last quarter. During the quarter, we paid $43 million in scheduled principal payments and added $23 million from our line. CapEx was $3 million for the quarter. Going forward, CapEx will be minimal if any and dependent on the timing of the E175 and the engine deliveries. As disclosed in our press release, we're not providing any further guidance at this time. I'd like to turn it back to Jonathan now.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Mike. Obviously this has pushed everyone to our limit. I think the whole country has felt the strain of the COVID-19 virus. That being said, we believe we are well positioned with our core company values and assets. As the low cost operator, we believe this environment will ultimately create more opportunities for us. I'd like to thank everyone for taking the time out of their day to join us and I'd like to open up for questions-and-answers.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Just a little color on the cash burn. I was just wondering where the cash kind of burn level is today and what it might take to reach that to level for the nine calendar months that are left here? And also does that include what you're doing on the cargo side?\nJonathan Ornstein: I can take a quick shot and then I'd like Mike to maybe follow up if he has some detail. We have been very diligent at Mesa regarding our cost structure. We continue to work very cooperatively with our labor groups and our partners. As such, at this point, we don't believe that we are suffering from negative cash burn currently. Mike if you want to update that and give any more detail I'm happy to have you do so.\nMike Lotz: Yes. No. I mean we have made some assumptions on traffic. They're coming back. I mean between now and August, we don't expect any improvement from September through the end of the year, we expect some small improvement 3%, 4%, 5% a month. We end the year at only 50% level. So it's not I don't think very aggressive assumptions on that side. On the cost side, our assumptions are pretty fair. Nothing that's going to be too big of a challenge. As Brad alluded to, the challenge will be in October without the relief going to a major reduction in staff will be painful but we believe very achievable. On the point of target, we do have included in this forecast continuing our start-up for the cargo operation.\nSavi Syth: Got it. That's helpful. And just if I might follow-up on the debt side. Is there any \u2013 it's helpful if we can understand the CapEx. What \u2013 are there any kind of debt payments left in the year? Or are you able to kind of defer any debt payment?\nMike Lotz: We have some very nominal reductions in debt payments but the rest of the debt payments are as scheduled.\nSavi Syth: All right. Great. And how much is that \u2013 how much is left?\nJonathan Ornstein: What was that?\nSavi Syth: How much is left for the year?\nJonathan Ornstein: In debt payments or in...\nSavi Syth: In debt payments.\nJonathan Ornstein: The debt payments are roughly $12 million per quarter \u2013 or per month rather.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Perfect. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator, hi, gentlemen and than you very much for the time here. On the CARES Act, mainly the $92.5 million, the first loan for the first amount grant. Are your partners pushing you to give them some of that money?\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. All the money that we receive under the CARES Act is required to be paid to our employees. We have in fact \u2013 or begun \u2013 well with United we've completed with American we're negotiating for some level of credit to their cost based on the fact that they do pay part of our labor costs when they fly the aircraft. That's embedded into the cost of flying the aircraft. So our view is to the extent that United or American paid our labor costs, they should be entitled to a cost reduction, given the fact that we are receiving those funds from the government under the CARES Act. We feel that as a good partner it would be unfair for us to keep that money without giving them some type of cost reduction, if they are in fact paying for that labor cost when they fly the aircraft. So if they're flying the aircraft 30% of the time and we're in a situation where we're paying $76 minimums to our pilots and flight attendants you can see there's a big deficit there. So that's one of the things that we've been discussing and we feel that it's very cooperative and constructive and don't feel like it's going to cause any issues between us and it's certainly fair.\nHelane Becker: Okay. So that's part of the \u2013 what you and Mike and Brad were talking about in terms of the cash flow negotiations and just the negotiations on reductions in rate? Or is that above and beyond? Or is it...\nJonathan Ornstein: No that's primarily what we're talking about. The other issue is just that our partners have asked us for some relief regarding the timing of true up. So that's a weekly item. It's really just a matter of timing as opposed to \u2013 because of the amount that they're flying is reduced so much. So that just us is just a matter of timing and something that also is a reasonable request that we can \u2013 we're willing to do.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then my other question is on the second loan that you're negotiating for later this week what would make you say no to that money?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, I think that we have to get the terms in regard to what the equity asset is going to be and also what the rate will be. From what we've heard, it appears that the rate is actually fairly attractive. And again on the finance piece in terms of equity or equity give up or warrants we just have to take a close look at that. I think that we feel that there's enough opportunity out there that \u2013 and we have real uses for those funds. And why we feel Mesa is so well positioned is, these loans were supposed to be made if you were an asset, you had financing in place prior to COVID and as a result of COVID you no longer can get that financing. That is precisely what we're looking to do with this money. So again, I think it's just a question of how expensive it is but this is money that we had intended to raise prior to the COVID crisis.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Thank you very much. Those are mostly my question. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMike Linenberg: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. A couple here. Jonathan or Mike or even Brad, on the potential loan size, I think most carriers have said it's basically it's a function of your ASMs relative to system ASMs, so sort of back of the envelope, what would you guys be looking at? I mean I know you didn't put anything in the release, but is it $100 million $150 million? Where would you think that secured loan would size out at? Any rough numbers?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. I mean, I'll give you some thoughts. And then, again, trying to get information has been difficult in terms of what the thought process is. But when we look at what has been granted so far, the loans have amounted to as little as 80% of the money that was done under the CARES Act, one under the employee protection, as much as 220%.\nMike Linenberg: Yes.\nJonathan Ornstein: So, we'll just have to sort of see where our comes out. We had made requests pointing out specific requirement on specific issues, specific aircraft, our engines, things like that. Really just won't be able to have a better feel until we have our call, because we just don't really fully understand what the criteria is and what the loan is going to be designed to do. I mean, Mike, Brad, does anybody want to add to that?\nMike Lotz: No. This is Mike. That pretty much sums it up. We don't know if it's going to be this percent of ASMs. We've seen that, but there's applications that are inconsistent with that. So rather than speculate, we're going to wait to see what the guidance we get specifically from treasury and their advisers.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. And then, Mike, just you talked about, I think, you said cash breakeven by the end of this calendar year, I think, is what you said, nine months from March 31. Where do you think your cash is? Because there's a lot of moving pieces here. You talked about some temporary relief to your partners. Where do you think your cash position is, maybe at the end of September, or even at December 31, 2020? Do you have kind of a rough kind of giving us a guide on where you think your cash position will be?\nJonathan Ornstein: So, what I say that, we expect by the end of the calendar year to be at about where we were in March, which was around $53 million. And month-over-month, between now and December, it deviates not very much higher or lower than that.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. And, again, that's not including the secured loans. So that would be over and above?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes, that's assuming no secured loan.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just lastly, I know, Brad, you did say that the cargo operation is still full force. But with everything on your plate right now, I guess, it's still going to happen, but it feels like it's probably been pushed back. It's maybe the real CapEx spend that is associated with it, probably doesn't happen in current calendar year and probably gets pushed into 2021. Is that a fair statement?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, if I can answer, this is Jonathan. Most of the money that we had to spend to put the aircraft on certificate was spent pre-COVID, manuals and all that sort of stuff. There is a little bit left, but it's not significant. The operation has been pushed and we are not expecting to begin until September. But we are going full speed ahead. And Dan joining the Board is indicative that we do have a commitment to try to grow cargo. Dan had a long career with DHL. He then ran Southern and was very successful there. As you guys may know, I was on the Board and that's how I got to know him. And we think that there is a real upside for Mesa. The other piece of it is we have a lot of people now that are available to do work and want to do work and are anxious to be productive. I mean, when you think of all the professionals that we have, for example, in our training department. These are all people that we feel we can utilize to help us move this cargo program forward. And, to be frank, we have the luxury of the federal government paying them right now. And we felt it's something to be productive and continue to move the company forward. I want to also emphasize one thing, because there may have been a misunderstanding. We don't expect to achieve cash flow breakeven by the end of the year. We believe we're at cash flow breakeven today. Okay? And it is a goal in terms of continuing that, because, obviously, we don't know where traffic is going to go. We don't know if our partners can continue to fly 240, 250 flights a day. We don't know how sticky things will become in September after the CARES loan, the CARES grant runs out. But as of today we are cash flow breakeven and feel stronger that we will put programs in place to maintain that throughout the rest of the year. And that is also exclusive of any monies that we receive under the act, the loan Act. So it's not going to be easy but we think, given Mesa's history as a low-cost carrier and what is really embedded in our culture, it is something that we can achieve.\nMike Linenberg: Jonathan, just back to your point about how you have a lot of people and you want to put them to work and you have the cargo operation on the horizon, so that seems like that's a good platform to put people rather than laying them off. Is there any possibility that the CRJ-700s that could be going to another partner, that you end up keeping them in-house and running a 550 operation, as well as also complementing that with the new Embraer 175s that will be flown for United? Or is that just too much on your plate? Is that -- would you not be able to accommodate that and to provide that to United, if they ask you to do that?\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. I can tell you strategically and I'll let Brad talk about operationally. But, strategically, as I think was mentioned on another call, regional airline call, the current operator of the CRJ-550, it's well known, have been having a difficult time with COVID. We will clearly stand ready to continue to operate those aircraft in any configuration United wants. And given the fact that we operate a large CRJ fleet it is -- I don't believe it will be challenging. But, Brad, if you want to add to that and having been at United, you have a pretty good feel for all this. Would you like to add to that?\nBrad Rich: Jonathan, I don't have a lot to add other than to say, look, that's certainly a possibility that's been in our mind. It's been at the forefront of planning and that sort of thing and there's probably no better time operationally to continue just those preparations in the event that becomes an opportunity, we'll be ready.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thanks. Thanks for answering my questions, everyone.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you.\nMike Lotz: Yes. And, Mike, I just want to add one thing. I know Mike dropped off. This is Mike. So just, we did -- if you did run the ASM math, we're about 1.1% of the ASMs, which on a $25 billion loan program would be something around $275 million. Again, we don't know how much of that would be prorated out like 76% on the grant side. So I just wanted to collaborate on that. Thanks.\nOperator: And I do have a question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Just a few -- small ones here. Just on the CRJ-900 fleet or actually just the general what is your unencumbered assets? Do you have kind of asset value there? And then also just on the CRJ-900 fleet? Like what do you think -- if you do have aircraft that -- and you do already have some extra aircraft there what values do you think in this current market you could sell those for?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well again, I'd encourage Mike and Brad to speak up also. But I would suggest that in today's market a sale at any price would be difficult. I know that there are very few aircraft available and the production of regional aircraft is literally ground to a halt. So we're hoping that over time these aircraft will regain sort of the pre-COVID values. But I think that if you look at the pre-COVID appraisals which we don't put a lot of stock in for sure. But I mean we felt that we had in excess of $200 million worth of equity in the CRJ fleet. We do have 5 CRJ-700s that we own outright, with no -- that are completely unencumbered. And the rest as Mike mentioned have about $1.5 million of equity. So between those, even if you assume a value on those aircraft literally almost half of what it was pre-COVID, we still have a pretty significant amount of equity. Mike, Brad do you guys want to comment on that? Mike you're probably closer to the numbers if you want to correct me go right ahead.\nMike Lotz: No that's right. I mean look we look at it of course, and then in this environment and at $1.5 million for aircraft. If we weren't able to successfully do something with American with some portion of the fleet we just look at $1.5 million as something that we think we could almost scrap the aircraft at. So we look at that from more an exposure standpoint. And it's too hard right now to predict what values will be that could change -- in six months, it could be dramatically different.\nSavi Syth: Okay. Makes sense. And then just a clarification on the cash burn, I'm guessing for months April through kind of September you have the benefit of the grant in that cash spend calculation. And then as you get into kind of the rest of the -- to the fourth -- the calendar fourth quarter then you'll have to kind of figure out based on whatever the volume of flying to kind of maintain that cash breakeven? Is that -- am I thinking about that correctly?\nMike Lotz: Yes. You're thinking correctly. And we look at it not only as getting the benefits of getting that money, but also the obligation that we can't furlough our employees. So it's not like a lot of companies that would think we have all this grant money to spend and it's -- we also are obligated to keep all our employees. So it's -- but yes that's the correct assumption.\nJonathan Ornstein: Well and if I could add something Savi on that. Prior to the CARES program, we actually had come to an agreement with our pilots. And this is just to show you the level of cooperation that we have and the forward-thinking that I think our pilot group has always exhibited. Prior to that, we came to an agreement to actually reduce minimum hours in order to avoid a furlough. And the agreement being that, if we were able to do the CARES program and not have to furlough of course, we weren't going to hold them to those minimum hours. But they did that voluntarily in literally days. And so, I'm hopeful that depending on the level of flying that we're doing that rather than just say, we have to do a wholesale furlough across all our workgroups that people can continue to pull together and come up with strategies so that we could eliminate or potentially -- or certainly minimize the number of our people that would be furloughed because look our people work really hard they do a great job. They've been out there facing this head on. And the last thing that we want to do is to furlough anybody under these circumstances. So I'm hopeful that we will continue to come up with creative ideas to avoid that outcome.\nSavi Syth: That would be great. And then just one last question on the cargo business, as on the one side it seems a little riskier because it is something new., it's a new fleet type. But on the flip side cargo is doing well. Do you have any kind of thoughts on expanding that from what you are thinking? Are you still thinking maybe kind of two or three aircraft type size business to launch with?\nJonathan Ornstein: On the launch, we will be at two or three aircraft for sure and we will be very careful about how this is structured. I remember, we are not buying the aircraft, we're not leasing the aircraft. Those aircraft are being provided for us -- to us. Clearly with only two or three aircraft we would look to expand. And it's our belief that given our cost structure and our flexibility that we would be an ideal candidate to see that fleet expand which again will just give us another leg on a stool that we could fit more firmly. And the cargo business is in fact one of the few bright spots. We would not be doing the cargo business at adhoc. Any deal that we did in cargo would be done with an internationally recognized cargo operator where we entered into a contract with them very similar to what we do with United and American.\nSavi Syth: Thanks. I appreciate all the responses.\nOperator: There are no other questions at this time.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Well thank you everyone for taking time. I know it's really surreal for all of us. And something that we really hope we can work our way through this successfully. But more importantly, we really pray for the safety of all of you and the rest of our country. I want to thank all of our employees for doing just an outstanding job and we really appreciate all the work that's been done. And hopefully, we continue to do for our shareholders. So thank you very much. Have a great day. And we'll talk to you at the next quarterly call.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 1, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-02-10 22:02:34", "content": "Operator: Welcome and thank you for standing by. [Operator instructions] Today\u2019s call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn today\u2019s meeting over to your host, Jonathan Ornstein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, sir. First, thanks everyone for joining us on our call today. As the operator indicated, this is Jonathan Ornstein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. On the call with me today are Mike Lotz, our President and Chief Financial Officer; Brian Gillman, Executive VP and General Counsel; Brad Rich, our Chief Operating Officer; and Darren Zapfe, our Vice President of Finance. I would like to ask Brian to read the Safe Harbor statement.\nBrian Gillman: Thanks, Jonathan. Before the presentation and the comments begin, Mesa would like to remind you that some of the statements in response to your questions in this conference call may include forward-looking statements. As such, they are subject to future events and uncertainties that could also affect our actual results to differ materially from those statements. Also please note the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our press release, the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC, which Mesa encourages you to read. In addition, please refer to the press release in the Investors section of our website to find additional disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that will be used on today\u2019s call.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Thank you very much, Brian. Well, I am incredibly pleased to be able to begin our discussion regarding United with a discussion about the deal that in fact is done and we are moving forward. As you know, we are preparing for the delivery of the 20 Embraer 175s, the long-awaited 20 175, which will bring us to a total of 80 Embraer 175s. I believe that will make us the largest operators of that type for United Airlines. We have added 60 of the 175s over the past few years and we believe we are very well positioned and prepared to take on these 20 additional aircraft beginning in May. One thing to note, these aircraft are not incremental. Their introduction will coincide with the removal and the leasing of our CRJ-700 aircraft to another operator. With these 20 aircraft, as I mentioned before, we will be the largest operator of Embraer 175 which we believe is the aircraft of choice within United. We believe Mesa is exceptionally well-positioned given our industry leading cost structure, our outstanding operational performance to take advantage of the future opportunities with the United as they present themselves. We would like to thank the United management for their confidence and trust that has led to their continuing support of Mesa. It truly is greatly appreciated. On the American side, as we have noted in our press release, we have seen significant improvement in our American Eagle operations. We continue to have discussions regarding the extension of our capacity purchase agreement. Given our industry leading cost structure and our current operating performance, we believe our CRJ-900s are very attractive operationally and offer tremendous value in today\u2019s regional airline marketplace. We continue to build significant equity in the CRJ-900 fleet as the debt matures over the next couple of years and do the same in our owned engine that go on these aircraft. On the cargo side, we have talked about the fact that we are looking forward to entering the cargo business. We continue to develop our plan to enter these operations in 2020. We believe cargo represents an important long-term opportunity for the company and significant advancement opportunities for our pilots in particular. We continue to move forward with FAA certification and spent $600,000 this quarter. I would now like to turn the call over to Brad for a more in-depth operational review, which I think you will agree it\u2019s really quite outstanding. I want to appreciate the good work that he has done, along with his team in operations.\nBrad Rich: Thank you, Jonathan. As far as an update on American is concerned as we\u2019ve previously discussed, our operations were challenged over the summer primarily due to several aircraft unavailable as a result of multiple aircraft damage incidents as some extended heavy maintenance. Since regaining access to the additional aircraft, the controllable completion factor has significantly improved with November and December at 99.7%, January at 99.9%, and February month to-date is at 100%. I would also note that in January, we believe we achieved all of the performance criteria in the American operations. In addition to the available aircraft we have identified, we have identified and are implementing several operational improvement initiatives at American and we are confident that these initiatives will result in continued improved performance. On the United operation, as we pointed out in our press release, we operated at a 99.98% controllable completion factor in the quarter, taking only 6 cancellations out of approximately 34,000 scheduled flights. In the month of November, Mesa led the United Express portfolio in on-time performance both in arrival zero and departure zero, a bit of an update on our pilot situation. We are pleased to report an increase of 84 pilots net of attrition over the past 6 months. We remain confident in our ability to hire, retain and transition the required pilots in order to staff the 20 new E175s, which deliveries begin in May. We also have some good news relative to attrition, which remains lower than we projected for the last several months. We continue to reduce the training footprint and optimized training program by streamlining training processes and procedures as well as implementing additional automation. It\u2019s also worth noting I think that we do have access to the required simulator time to meet our forecasted training events both for new hires, upgrades, recurrent training, and as I mentioned, the transition to the new E175s that are on their way. We have also had success at hiring additional mechanics. However, industry conditions make mechanic hiring and retention more challenging and that is an area of our continued focus. Before I turn the time to Mike, I would like to just express appreciation to all of our employees, our pilots, our flight attendants, our mechanics as well as our headquarter staff and our leadership team. As we mentioned earlier, we have Brad Holt, who I worked with for, oh, gosh, a couple of decades at least has joined the team and we are happy to have him with us and he has been making a positive difference since he arrived. We are also grateful for all of the efforts for the commitment and engagement, dedication of our leadership team and I specifically want to call them out to thank them for their efforts: Cody Thomas, Doug Shockey, Amber Wansten, Kenley Brown, Kevin Wilson, Tyler Campbell, Mike Ferverda, Bob Hornberg and Darren Zapfe. We are just very appreciative for all of their efforts. We have had a lot going on in some realigned assignments and some continued leadership changes and I am grateful for their engagement. We are also grateful to have the addition of [indiscernible] Wilkinson who has joined the team full time. Again, Brad Holt and I work with [indiscernible] for many decades as expertise is in maintenance and sourcing and we are grateful to have him as a new member of the team. With that, I will turn the time to Mike to review our financial performance.\nJonathan Ornstein: I could just \u2013 I want to do that \u2013 add to Brad and thank him, because the turnaround that we have seen has really been outstanding. The operational people have done a great job as you know and it\u2019s not been a secret. There have been challenges in the past, particularly with our American operation. We have always felt that we needed some additional spares. Now that we have those spares, you can see the performance has truly skyrocketed up to the top of the heap and we feel very confident that we continue to perform at those levels. You can\u2019t get much better than 100%, but we are going to do everything we can to try, but I want to thank all the operational people for doing a great job. Thank you.\nMike Lotz: Okay. Thanks, Jon and thanks Brad. It\u2019s Mike. So for the financial update for Q1 2020, we reported pre-tax income of $14.3 million. This compares to pre-tax income of $25 million for the same quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter negative variance of 10.7% was all due to the timing of scheduled heavy engine and airframe maintenance. Additionally for the quarter, we reported $3.5 million of income tax expense for net income of $10.8 million or $0.31 per share. And as usual, a quick note on the income tax expense, although we reflect $3.5 million for accounting purposes, we will not pay any cash taxes as we still have in excess of $478 million in NOLs. I would like to touch on the scheduled airframe and engine maintenance for Q1 2020. Our heavy scheduled airframe maintenance came in just around $15 million, which although was higher than last year it was lower than we anticipated. Our guidance that we provided last quarter was around $18 million, some if not all of that expense obviously, will push into Q2 as it was all a result of timing. On pilot expenses, our pilot expense for block hour was down year-over-year by over 3% from a little over $463 a block hour to $451 or 31% to 30% of contract revenue. We are expecting the block hour rates to stay at this level. As we begin to transition from the 700 to the 175 by Q4, we hope to reduce by another 3% down to around a $440 per block hour range due to the increased pilot training efficiencies that we are seeing specifically those that have brought over by Brad Holt. Keep in mind, if we reduce this by 3% from $451 to $440 that equates to almost $5 million a year in reduced operating costs. During the quarter, we spent approximately $600,000 on our cargo operation development and are expected to spend another $2 million over the remainder of 2020. As disclosed in our press release earlier today, we have provided some additional forward-looking guidance for block hours. Our Q1 block hours came in right about where we thought at the midpoint of the guidance or the remainder of the year, our projection to remain the same from what we provided last quarter. On scheduled heavy maintenance, heavy engine and airframe maintenance as I mentioned, Q1 came in lower than previous guidance and we expect those expenses to move to Q2. So we have reflected that in our Q2 guidance. Full year engine and airframe is still under review. We have slightly raised the top end of each of the Q3 and Q4 quarters. On cash and liquidity, we ended the quarter at $57.8 million, total debt on the balance sheet, $807 million, down from $843 million as we paid down $36 million in principal payments during the quarter. For 2020, we do have total scheduled principal payments of slightly over $175 million. For CapEx for 2020 and 2021, as we mentioned on our last call, we will need to finance the new E-175, which will be approximately $450 million, split roughly 50-50 between fiscal year \u201820 and \u201821. We are planning to finance most, if not all, the purchase price of the E-175s. Additionally, for 2020 and 2021, we purchased and plan to take delivery of 22 engines to support the leased CRJ-700s and the CRJ-900 fleet at American. We expect to finance approximately $120 million again, split roughly 50-50 per year between fiscal year \u201820 and \u201821 and again, we are expecting to finance most if not all, of the purchase price. On the refinancing side, as a result of our new United CPA, we will lease 20 of our CRJ-700s to another operator for a seven-year term. This will allow us to potentially finance 5 unencumbered CRJ-700 and refinance the other 13 700s over an extended period of time at lower rates and we are still evaluating which alternative would be best for us. I would like to turn now back over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Mike. At this point, we would be happy to open up to any questions that anyone might have. There is a lot going on, a lot of moving pieces, but we will do the best we can to give you a good answer.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] My first question comes from Savi Syth. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon. Just congrats on moving the American performance in the right direction there. I know it\u2019s still early days, but just wondering, is this the right number of kind of spare whitetail aircraft for that or do you kind of expect to be able to do that with less as you kind of get a handle on that? And somewhat tied to that when do you start the discussions or when do you need to kind of complete the discussions with American on some of the 2020 aircraft that are coming off contract?\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. You know, it\u2019s interesting. I will let Brad answer the question regarding the number of spares, because I think for the first time in history, Brad, representing the operational piece and me the financial piece may have a different set of opinion which might surprise you, but Brad, why don\u2019t you start and what\u2019s your view on the spares at this point?\nBrad Rich: Well, first of all, answer that by saying the majority of the improvement that we have seen actually has occurred even though by I guess by agreement we should have eight spares operating right now. Through all of this improvement period, we have never had that many spare aircraft available. And then most of the time, it\u2019s been with four or maybe five or less of the airplanes. So look, honestly, I don\u2019t think we need a full complement of eight spares to run the operation. And in fact, we have achieved it without that many spares.\nJonathan Ornstein: Right. And the difference is that I think it\u2019s the first time where the operational person says we don\u2019t need that many spares and myself being on the other side say, now I\u2019ll keep all the spares we need, I don\u2019t care, but just make sure we hit 100% every month. So we will see where we come out, but I actually all kidding aside, agree with Brad that for a long time we had only three spares. And the problem with three spares when you have two hubs and 14-year-old aircraft, three was clearly not the right answer, and that was as you know a point of discussion for literally many years with American. I don\u2019t know if eight is the right number either, but somewhere in the middle, I think we will find a good number. And frankly, if we are going to make a mistake, I will tell you without a doubt, that we will make the mistake by being long, maybe an extra one, but not short one, because we don\u2019t want to be in a position like we were last summer and literally flying with no spares. So, I think that\u2019s the answer on the spares. In terms of the American contract, let me just say we are always in discussion with our partners on potential contract extension. I mean it\u2019s literally non-stop. We believe the aircraft remained very attractive from both an operational as you can tell. We are running north of 99.7% for the last few months, 100% this month. Operationally, the planes are great. And from a cost perspective, I think that we continue to believe that our CRJ-900s are the lowest cost regional jet, large regional jet in service today. However, that being said, as many of you are aware, it\u2019s particularly in light of for example our United conversations that lasted far longer than we anticipated. These discussions are often complicated and protracted. That being said, we think that these are good aircraft and they have a strong position within the regional jet marketplace. In addition as you know, Bombardier has exited the business. So supply right now continues to be tight across all the fronts on these large regional jets. I also would like to add which is something that a lot of folks may not put as much emphasis on, but I can tell you we do on a day-to-day basis we have a very highly motivated group of pilots, maintenance people, flight attendants, dispatchers. And these are people who have all become always \u2013 they have always been valuable, but now become even more valuable as supply has tightened across the industry for all of these folks and we are very pleased at Mesa that we are able to attract or retain people. We are delighted that to see our attrition levels decline and we think that in itself presents an incredibly valuable asset to our partners.\nSavi Syth: I appreciate all that color. Just before I kind of hop on the queue, just a clarification on the guidance. I know the kind of the block hour and maintenance is provided, but EPS was initially provided in this update, I was wondering if you were kind of reiterating what you provided last time or there is a change to that?\nMike Lotz: We don\u2019t have any changes to that and we are not putting anything out in the press release.\nSavi Syth: Alright. Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Helane Becker, Cowen. Your line is open.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you for the time. Just two questions. So, just so I understand this, Mike, on the maintenance costs, that year-over-year increase will be as great going forward. Is that $58 million the new run rate, or does it fall from there?\nMike Lotz: That\u2019s just for 2020. We have not put anything out for 2021. Again, our initial look at 2021, it looks more like 2019 than 2020. But we haven\u2019t put anything out yet until we kind of decide how much is going to hit this year and how much we could push into next year.\nHelane Becker: Okay, got it. Thank you. And then my other question is with respect to the attrition. I think that\u2019s great that people are coming and that you are retaining pilots. But how much do you think is that because the major airlines slowed some of their hiring because of the MAX being on the ground, and how much is just your ability to attract and retain?\nBrad Rich: So, Helane, look, I think you are spot on that a lot of this probably is to do with what is going on with the MAX. How long that continues, I mean I know we could have a good debate about that, but it looks like it will go on for at least some time here into the future. And as long as it does, we think it will probably lend itself to these similar type attrition rates. And if it does, we feel really good about our position.\nHelane Becker: Right. Got it, okay.\nMike Lotz: This is Mike. Also, if I could add, if and when it does come back, it looks like it is going to be a slow process to come back. It\u2019ll be something that will happen in three months.\nHelane Becker: Right. No, I don\u2019t necessarily disagree. I just want to make sure that your ability to retain pilots, I guess, continues even after the MAX comes back.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes, I think I would agree. We have to keep an eye on what goes on when the MAX comes back, but we really saw the drop in attrition when we instituted the flow-through agreement with United. That really had a big impact, and it really pulled attrition there.\nHelane Becker: Okay, alright. Well, thank you, guys. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg. Your line is open.\nKoosh Patel: Hey, guys. This is Koosh Patel on for Mike. Just one here, we saw the order for the SpaceJet last year, can you just walk us through the thinking and rationale behind that transaction?\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. I mean, on that order, I mean, basically, that was done just to give us a position in the book. We do think at some point in time, while we love the CRJs and we\u2019re the launch customer for the CRJ, they are 14 years old. And assuming this jet is available five, six, seven years out I think we felt it was a good hedge in terms of providing us with an opportunity to re-fleet. There is only one aircraft in the marketplace right now, which is the Embraer 175. And I think just on that basis, I think having one other supplier in the marketplace is probably not a bad thing.\nKoosh Patel: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes, thanks. Good evening. Mike, just on the fleet count guidance, is that just assuming kind of into next year, like assuming the status quo, or do you actually have those aircraft under contract? Just trying to reconcile, I think one of your competitors announced some additional aircraft with American. I want to make sure that those aren\u2019t coming from you when you would have maybe better visibility on what the fleet actually will be? Thanks.\nMike Lotz: Well, I mean, look, the fleet plan that we put out in the press release, I believe, just goes through Q4, and those aircraft are all under CPA. And as Jonathan mentioned, we are in discussions with American about potential extension.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Yes, I was just referring to the \u2013 you have a fleet forecast out through September of 2021. Does that just assume the status quo or some of those other aircraft actually under contract?\nMike Lotz: It is extended in the status quo.\nOperator: We do have a follow-up question from Savi Syth. Your line is open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, thanks. Just on the cargo side, I know you said you are kind of moving forward with that, but just curious if you have kind of an update on \u2013 if you still plan on starting early of the next fiscal year. And also, I saw that Sun Country did an agreement with Amazon is kind of seeing that \u2013 if that kind of changes your kind of view on the opportunity at all or you kind of view on your positioning?\nJonathan Ornstein: No. I mean, I think that our plan would be to implement this prior to the end of the fiscal year. The Sun Country announcement actually encourages us because we see and now feel even more confident that there is room for new entrants, and we believe that while we have tremendous respect for Sun Country, our good friend, Mr. Siegel is Chairman over there, we think that Mesa has a superior cost structure and as a result, we can offer those same services at a discount to other operators.\nSavi Syth: And is the aircraft something that you secure or the cargo operator or the cargo partner secures or just kind of curious with the MAX is a sufficient aircraft out there.\nJonathan Ornstein: The type of transaction that we are looking at is one where we would operate aircraft on behalf of cargo operation, and the aircraft would be provided to us.\nSavi Syth: Alright, appreciate the color. Thanks.\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure.\nOperator: And I am showing no further questions in queue at this time.\nJonathan Ornstein: Alright. Well, again, everyone, thank you very much for taking the time. We continue to plug away here. It is something we get up every day and constantly work on. Our operational people have done a terrific job. I know that Mike and Brian and Brad and I continue to look at other opportunities and, right now, focusing both on United and American, where we think there is a tremendous opportunity at both carriers. And again, we would like to leverage our cost structure and the type of aircraft we operate to continue to grow our business profitably. So, thank you very much for your interest and we look forward to talking to you on our next quarterly call. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. You may all disconnect at this time."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 4, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-12-11 19:34:09", "content": "Operator: Welcome, and thank you for standing by.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. Now, I will turn the meeting over to your host, Jonathan Ornstein. You may begin.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. After hours, we greatly appreciate your interest. As the operator indicated, this is Jonathan Ornstein. I'm the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mesa Airlines. On the call with me today will be Mike Lotz, our President and Chief Financial Officer; Brian Gillman, Executive VP and General Counsel; and Darren Zapfe, our Vice President of Finance. Unfortunately, Brad Rich, our Chief Operating Officer is unable to join us, as we had to behind a flight to attend his daughter's college graduation. Okay. With that, I'd like to ask Brian to open up with our forward-looking statements.\nBrian Gillman: Thanks, Jonathan. Before the presentation and the comments begin, Mesa would like to remind you that some of the statements and responses to your questions in the conference call may include forward-looking statements.

In addition, please refer to our press release in the Investor section of Mesa's website to find additional disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that will be used on today's call.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Thank you, Brian. Well, I think it's important that we start and giving you United update. We certainly are pleased to have our new capacity purchase we put into place. We know it took a lot longer than any of us anticipated. We would like to thank United. It was a complicated transaction, but we believe it was well worth the wait. I am delighted not to have to tell you it's going to be in two more weeks. We have 20 new Embraer 175 aircraft for a 12-year term. These aircraft will be owned by Mesa. In addition, we extended the term of 42 United owned 175. We believe the contract will give us improved profitability and reliability on the new Embraer 175. In addition, we agreed to lease our CRJ-700s for a period of seven years to another operator. We believe this is significantly lower risk and equal or potentially higher margin on leases versus actually operating the CRJ-700s in the CRJ-550 configuration. Mesa will be the largest operator of Embraer 175s for United at 80 aircraft. We greatly appreciate their confidence in us. We will be a single fleet type for our United operations, making us a more attractive growth vehicle. We believe the new contract is a strong vote of confidence from United. On American, as you know, there have been a lot of moving pieces on the American fleet spares, damaged aircraft, removed aircraft, et cetera. So first, I'd like to recap exactly where we are on the American fleet. We began with 64 aircraft in our CPA. On April 1, 2019, we voluntarily agreed to remove two aircraft splitting the costs with American. On November 2, 2019, two additional aircraft were removed under the terms of our amended CPA. On January 2020, one additional aircraft will be removed under the terms of the amended CPA. So in January 2020, we will have 59 aircraft under our CPA, of which three are operational spares and we will have five unassigned aircraft. One important item to note. Even after these fleet changes, our block hour estimates for 2020 are in line with 2019, slightly lowered American and slightly higher at United. Additionally, American has the right to remove up to a maximum of three more aircraft based on operational performance. I'm going to go further into operational performance in a minute. But we have seen significant operational improvements since November 2nd, coinciding with the access to additional aircraft. I'd like to take a moment now to update you on our efforts in cargo. We continue to remain optimistic on entering into the cargo business in 2020. We believe cargo represents a significant long-term growth opportunity. Given the nature of our current business and our cost structure make this particularly well suited to enter the ACMI or CMI's cargo business. We believe one of the benefits is that it's no conflict with our existing business. In fact, we believe the opportunity to fly an larger gauge aircraft will improve our ability to both recruit and retain pilots, which is of critical importance to our major airline partners. Other industry opportunities as we look into 2020 include the following. Scope relief at United, while this has been long discussed, we believe that United is probably best positioned to achieve scope relief. We also are looking at a potential opportunity to down gauge the American CRJ-900s to 65 seats, and to potentially provide some of the backfill with larger regional jets. We believe the CRJ-900s operated by Mesa are probably the best option for 65 seat aircraft. We have a very enthusiastic, energized and highly efficient workforce, ready to take on additional opportunities. Unfortunately, Brad is not here and he wants me to send his apologies. He obviously has an important personal issue matter with his daughter, which is a very good thing. So I'm going to touch on some of the operational issues as well. Most importantly, we can start with American update. While we have recently experienced significant improvement, as I mentioned, as we mentioned in the press release, our fourth quarter American performance still did not meet our expectations. The primary reason can be attributed to the continued lack of available spares through the quarter due to extended heavy checks and multiple aircraft ground damage events. On a positive note, however, since gaining access to additional aircraft, although, not our full complement, the November controllable completion factor was 99.7% and for the first 10 days of December, we have not had a single controllable cancel. Since joining MESA, Brad Rich and our new Senior VP of Operations, Brad Holt, has worked closely with American and have instituted number of initiatives that we believe will allow us to continue to see these improved results. United update. Since October 1, our United Express operation has produced an outstanding 99.99% controllable completion factor. And in the month of the member, Mesa led all United Express operators in on time performance. Again, I'd like to thank all of our people for doing a truly remarkable job on both the American and United side of our business. Other operational items of importance. We are pleased to report an increase of 119 line pilots year-over-year, and we remain confident in our ability to both hire, retain, acquire pilots in order to produce the utilization and reliability expected by our partners. We have significantly improved our pilot training footprint and substantially reduced our training backlog over the last 90 days. We've also had success hiring additional mechanics to support the operations, which has become more challenging. Our mechanic headcount has increased by 66 or almost 23% year-over-year. However, it's important to note that industry conditions make mechanic hire retention more challenging and an area of continued focus. In the area of maintenance, we had issues with heavy maintenance vendor, which we discussed on last quarter call, and we have subsequently replaced the vendor with alternative providers. I'd like to now turn it over to Mike Lotz to walk through our financial performance.\nMike Lotz: Thanks, Jonathan. For the fourth quarter, we reported pre-tax income of $17.1 million. This compares the pre-tax income of $26.6 million for the same quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter variance is due primarily to the timing of scheduled heavy maintenance and airframe maintenance of approximately $9 million. Additionally, for the quarter, we reported $4.8 million in income tax expense for net income of $12.2 million or $0.35 per share. Excluding special items, our adjusted net income was $12.7 million or $0.36 per share. I'd also like to point out, as Jonathan touched on cargos. During the quarter, we did invest and expensed about $1 million in the cargo operations. Excluding this cargo, expenses would have been at around $0.38 per share. Just a quick note also on our income tax expense. Although, we do reflect income tax expense of $4.8 million for accounting purposes, we will not pay any cash taxes as we still have a significant $475 million in NOLs. For 2019 overall, we showed significant improvement over 2018. Year-over-year, we saw improvements in virtually every area. Adjusted pre-tax income was up 78% from $43 million to $76 million. Adjusted EBITDA was up 27%. Adjusted EBITDAR was up 12%. Block hours were up 12% on essentially the same fleet by increasing the utilization of the aircraft. Contract revenue was up 7%, $43.5 million, up from $639 million last year. Pre-tax margins increased five points from 6% to 11%. Rent was reduced by $16 million, which was offset by depreciation of approximately $13 million as a result of buying 10 aircraft, which we had previously leased. Interest was down $4 million as we refinance high cost debt and repaid our secured credit facility. Pilot expenses were down per block hour, a little over 9% from $509 of block hour down to 462 and as a percentage of contract revenue, from 33% to 31%. We are expecting the block hour rate to stay at this level until Q4 2020, getting down to around the $440 range or another 5%, and that will be primarily driven by pilot training efficiencies. And as I previously pointed out, we invested approximately $1 million in potential cargo operations, which was expensed in Q4 and we will continue to see in 2020. So all-in-all, given some of the operational challenges that were clearly outside of our control, we believe we worked through these issues reasonably well and minimized the impact on profitability. As we disclosed in our press release earlier today, we have provided some additional forward looking guidance for earnings per share for 2020. We're looking at a range of $1.50 and $1.80 per share and in 2021, from $1.90 to $2.30. For block hours, we're expecting 2020 block hours to be about the same as 2019 and again, that's with less aircraft than we had in 2019. For Scheduled Heavy Engine and Airframe Maintenance, 2020 guidance that we provided will be $8 million to $10 million higher than 2019. We've also provided this information on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So overall, at a high level for 2020, it's going to be slightly better than 2019. In our 2020 estimates, we've included roughly $3 million of additional expenses related to the cargo operation and almost $5 million which we associated with transitioning pilots from the CRJ-700 to the E175. That number obviously will be dependent upon how many pilots transfer between the fleets. Combined, these investments represent almost $0.17 per share for 2020. On the cash and liquidity side, we ended the quarter with $16.8 million in cash. Total debt on the balance sheet at year-end was $843 million. That's primarily aircraft and engine debt, about $750 million in aircraft and around $90 million in engine. That's down $72 million for the $915 million as of September 2018. During the year, we paid $156 million in principal payments, which was offset by $70 million in debt that we added with the aircraft lease buyout and $11 million of spare engine financings. For 2020, we have scheduled principal payments of $175 million. CapEx for 2020 and 2022 will obviously include the 20 new E175s for United. That will be approximately $420 million to $470 million that will be split probably 50-50 between 2020 and 2021. And we were planning to finance most, if not all, of the purchase price. Additionally, for 2020 and 2021, we plan to purchase 20 to 25 engines to support the leased CRJ-700s and the CRJ-900s fleet at American. This will be approximately $100 million split roughly 50-50 per year between 2020 and 2021. On the engines, we are planning to finance 100% of the purchase price, which we have done in the past. On the financing -- refinancing side, as a result of our new United CPA, we will lease 20 CRJ-700s to another operator for seven years. This will allow us the potential to finance five unencumbered CRJ aircraft and refinance the other 13 CRJ-700 aircraft over an extended period of time at lower rates. Lastly, on cash, we still have our secured credit facility of $35 million, which was extended through 2022 and is currently untapped. I'd like to turn it now back over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay, Mike. Thank you for the financial round up. And at this point, operator, we'd be happy to field any questions that come from any of the listeners.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question came from the line of Michael. Michael, your line is now open. You may begin.\nKateLyness: This is Kate Lyness on for Linenberg. I was just wondering if you could maybe go into a little bit more detail please about like some of the drivers underlying your 2021 EPS guide, block hour growth, the new cargo business, any of that? Thank you.\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, let's start with cargo. To clarify, Mike talked a little bit about the fact that we have additional investment in the cargo business. These are pre-operating start up expenses and then some training expense as we begin to train more pilots to take on all of the aircraft. We expect that to be approximately $3 million for the year. So that's one potential driver. On the block hours, basically, we have an estimate based on past. And we've spoken with our partners about what our capabilities are, what their expectations are. And I think the block hour number I think, at this point, we're getting pretty good at being able to project going forward. In terms of some of the other numbers, again, the big variable always is maintenance for us. That's something, again, we have decent visibility. There has often some issues regarding timing. But we think this is one area where I guess, as I said, has the biggest impact on our quarterly earnings. Did you want to add anything, Mike?\nMike Lotz: No. And also for 2021, we are expecting that our transition will finish up in the early first quarter of 2021. Most of that will be behind us. So I think we will see a pretty big benefit from our flight operations expense as we kind of normalized for not having any growth, that's given us -- given the assumption we don't have any additional growth between now in 2021.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes, there's a fair amount of certainty that the newer aircraft will provide us with higher levels of profitability coming out of older aircraft and into new aircraft, which will be covered under warranty for at least the first four year period. So that is some of the reasons why we feel confident and in terms of how things continue to improve into 2020 and 2021.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next speaker is, came from the line of Savi. Savi, your line is now open. You may begin.\nUnidentified Analyst: Maybe that was for Savi. Can you hear me? This is Matt for Savi.\nJonathan Ornstein: Hey, Matt. Sure.\nUnidentified Analyst: First congrats on the United deal, that was great to see. Moving along now from that. Could you talk a little bit about the maintenance, your expectations moving into 2021? I know you guys laid out by quarter 2020. But maybe some other puts and takes beyond that?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes, I mean, right now, we don't have that much visibility into the 2021 timings, that's why we haven't provided any quarterly guidance. But we respect 2021 to be pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: And in regards to the, basically transitioning the CRJ-700 to E175, you all have maintained your pilot hiring and training at pretty higher levels for longer than previously anticipated based on prior calls. So how is that really helped with the transition of the CRJ-700 to the E175?\nJonathan Ornstein: So I think one of the things that we have found to be very important, and I'll go back in history little bit. When we began Embraer 175 program, we knew how important this was to United and we over-hired pretty significantly. Obviously, times have changed a little bit, so it's become more difficult. But we knew that when we moved the 700s over, some of the pilots will choose to stay, which will be helpful on the American side for sure, that we will have more CRJ qualified pilots. And in order to prepare for the backfill we begun hiring. And we do have, not a huge excess, but we do have a certain number of surplus E-Jet pilots to help when that backfill occurs. Because all those numbers, those planes are coming in pretty quickly, two and three a month, and so we just need to be prepared. The biggest piece of it is we really want to continue to demonstrate to United that we can operate at the levels that they expect, because we feel that there in fact will be future growth, whether that's coming from scope relief or contracts that come due. We think we are extremely well positioned moving forward. And you know, one of the points that I'd like to make and why we're well positioned. Mesa has a reputation for low cost. I think that it's important to note that a big reason why we have low costs is because we have been growing consistently over the last six or seven years. And our workforce, compared to other regional airlines, is in fact junior. Lot of our employees, are one, two and three year employees. And because you're in an industry where wages are based on seniority to a large degree, we have a built-in benefit that I think it will be difficult, if not impossible, for another carrier to catch us in terms of cost, given the level of, what we call, juniority at Mesa right now.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Certainly, I appreciate all the extra detail there. And if I can sneak another one and talk about on the American side, now you've certainly made a lot of good leadership hires this year. So could you talk about some of the changes you've made specifically, the results you've seen from those changes and how you feel about it going forward? And then in that regard, are there any key measurement dates around that American deal where we could you know see if, either the current strategy is succeeding, or just kind of when the benchmarks are for those periods?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, there's been a number of things that we've done, not the least of which has been to get our spare count to a level that we think we need, given the age of our fleet. I mean, our average aircraft in the American fleet is almost 14 years old right now. So when we signed the original contract, we had three spares. Three spares probably fine, one for every 20. But with this fleet getting older, I think, we both American ourselves, came to conclude that was best for us to have additional spares. We see the benefit of that. And again, we've never had the opportunity to operate with the full complement of spares since some of these aircraft came out, because of ground damage and these extended C-checks. But we can already see, what we think are pretty good results, in terms of completion rates. We're now focusing also on on-time performance, which will also be helped significantly as these spares come in. One of the big areas that we spent -- have done a lot on, have been in maintenance staffing, where we have, in fact, increased maintenance staffing as we mentioned in the call, almost 23%, a large part of that went into the American staffing. We also had the benefit now, which is something new to [indiscernible] having a hangar in Dallas, in our hub, which is something we had wanted literally since we started operating there. And we are very fortunate we were able to find a facility to do that. We think that will have a big benefit. We've been able to further staff and build up our other maintenance space in Texas and El Paso, which has been very successful. So all these things, I think, they're going to inure to our benefit overtime, and the greatest of which being the additional spare aircraft for sure. Another piece of that, as part of our agreement with American, they understood our requirements in terms of maintenance touch time and the number of aircraft that come into maintenance. So that doesn't fluctuate as much as it has in the past. All those things we think are beneficial. And the very fact when you're talking about over 300 departures a day that since this last month, I know it's only 11 day, but we haven't had a cancel. And last month, again, we ran 99 point, I think 7%. That's the best level in quite some time. So I think we're already beginning to see the benefit of some of those initiatives that we worked so hard and actually been very helpful as that American has been involved along the way. So I think all those things will start to -- you'll see this continued level of performance.\nOperator: Excuse me speakers, please allow me one moment to get the accurate name of the next participant. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Conor. Conor, you may begin.\nConor Cunningham: Hey everybody. This is Conor Cunningham from Cowen. How are you?\nJonathan Ornstein: Hey how are you?\nConor Cunningham: Good. Just on the on the leased aircraft. Could you just give a little color on economics? I know you talked about some, potentially being a little bit better. Just curious if you could give any color there? And also, is this like a line item where you would expect to have further growth over the next couple years? Like, could we potentially see you guys going out there and being a bigger dry lessor on the regional side? Thank you.\nJonathan Ornstein: On the 700s, which would in fact, you know for United's purposes, where they're down gauging those aircraft of 50 seats and being able to put first class. The 20 we have are the only 20 aircraft that would be suitable for that program. The CRJ-900s besides the fact they're in service with American, they're too heavy to be put into that program. In terms of the relative profitability, as you can imagine in order to fly the 550s is 50 seats, United needed to see some fairly significant reduction in the expense associated with those aircraft in terms of their operations. It was our view that the lease terms for the aircraft would be more attractive to us ultimately and significantly less risk in terms of operation, particularly given the 20 additional aircraft on the E-Jets on the pilot side, that we just were better off leasing the aircraft. As we mentioned, there are five aircraft that we currently have that are unencumbered, for example. And the number of the aircraft will in fact get paid off over time, making that transaction even more attractive. I think that in terms of the overall financials, a large part will depend on our ability to replace, to do engine overalls and how that works. But again, having been the first in the shoot in regards to these big engines on the larger regional jets, as the launch customer for the CRJ-900, I think we have a very good handle on what our expenses are going to be. And we feel confident that the leased transaction will in fact be a better transaction than operating the aircraft on our own in the 50 seat configuration.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, but it's not\u2026\nJonathan Ornstein: In terms of the other aircraft, we have withdrawn a number of aircraft out of the American system. At this point, our plan is to leave them as much spares. One of the things that this brings up to point out is we are paying down a significant amount of debt. We have -- some of those aircraft, by the time on the American transaction is completed, and this doesn't even assume an extension. But we're going to own, outright or nearly outright a big bulk of those aircraft, I believe 49.And the last CRJ-900s traded in the market place for pretty significant amount of money, anywhere from $6 million, $7 million, $8 million, some even traded higher than that. Some of those aircraft were just parted out. So we do think that we are creating a fairly significant amount of value in the aircraft overtime as we continue to pay down the debt associated with those aircraft.\nConor Cunningham: And then I think you've mentioned just the potential for deseeding the 900s for American. Just curious on how that conversation started? And then what a potential timeline might be for a decision to be made there? Is it just -- is it a potential like three year thing? Or is it more near-term than that? Thanks again.\nJonathan Ornstein: No, American has had a tremendous advantage. In that, they have the ability to fly 65 seat aircraft and not count against their larger aircraft count for scope purposes. It's just, at this point, is a discussion. We think that it's potentially something that makes sense for both parties. And, we'll just see how that goes as we move forward. And something certainly that we're cognizant of and I know American is. But as of now there's no, by any way, any stretch, any firm decisions, one way or the other.\nOperator: Thank you, Conor. Our next line is came from the line of Savi. Savi, you may begin.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, it's Matt again. Sorry, I figured I'd sneak one more in. Looking at again into 2021. Do you have any color on how the block operations or flight operations per block hour would perform moving into '21? It seems like the fleet count would be kind of steady. But just on how you think about right now?\nMike Lotz: Yes, this is Mike. So -- let me just take a quick look at it. Yes, so like I said in my outline, it's going to -- in 2020, we're looking at its going down to 420 range. So it's going to be 448, mid 440s in 2020. It'd go down another 5% in 2021.\nOperator: At this time speakers, we don't have any questions in queue. Thank you.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. All right. Well, again folks we certainly appreciate your interest in the Mesa. We're very pleased about the United deal, which finally has happened. We continue to be optimistic in terms of our operating performance at American, which has been a tremendous, tremendous focus at the Company. We do look forward to launching cargo operations in the second half of 2020, and we continue to look at various financial transactions that will help us lower interest expense, extend our maturities, help cash flow and just overall, benefit the Company. I'd like to take one second, as always, to thank all of our people. We have just a great group of employees who have just done a fabulous job. It's really, I think, the only reason why Mesa is where it is today is that we're all rolling in the same boat in the same direction. And I just want to thank, not only all our line employees but as well as our pilot -- union leadership, our flight attendant union leadership, they have been just very good to work with, and have made all this possible. So again, thank you for your support and your interest. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call us, we're available anytime. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Jonathan. There is still one participant who just dialed in. It's came from the line of Scott Buck.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay.\nOperator: Oh, I'm sorry, he got disconnected. Maybe he canceled his question.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay, no problem. All right, thank you, operator.\nOperator: You're welcome. Is there anything else that you want to say? That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-08-09 18:40:53", "content": "Operator: Welcome, and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. May I introduce your speaker for today, Jonathan Ornstein. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, operator. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Jonathan Ornstein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. On the call with me today will be Mike Lotz, our President and Chief Financial Officer; Brian Gillman, Executive VP and General Counsel; Brad Rich, our Chief Operating Officer; and Darren Zapfe, our Vice President of Finance. First, before we get started, I'd like to ask Darren to just please read the safe harbor statement.\nDarren Zapfe: Thanks, Jonathan. Before the presentation and comments begin, Mesa would like to remind you that some of the statements and responses to your questions in the conference call may include forward-looking statements. As such, they are subject to future events and uncertainties that could also affect our actual results to differ materially from those statements. Also, please note the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our press release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC, which Mesa encourages you to read. In addition, please refer to our press release in the Investor section of Mesa's website to find additional disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that will be used on today's call.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Thank you, Darren. Okay, let\u2019s get start. We obviously have a lot to cover. We had a very challenging quarter, operationally and financially is pretty evident. There are three main areas we'd like to cover; status of the United contract, operational performance and financial performance compared to prior quarters. First, let's talk about the status of the United contract. We continue to have productive discussions with the United, related to the 20 CRJ-700, which begin to expire on August 31 through December 31. I know this has been an ongoing topic for far longer than any of us anticipated, but we still remain confident on a CPA extension on the 20 CRJ-700s and the Embraer 175s. There have been a lot of numbers \u2013 a number of issues that have led to this delay, not the least of which has been the change in management in United Express program, United's interest in converting the CRJ-700 to CRJ-550, the 50-seat variant and the potential backfill of a 70-seat aircraft, which is also complicated with what was going on at Bombardier at the time. As many of you know, they have recently announced exiting the regional aircraft business. While nothing is done until it is done in this industry and obviously things can change rapidly. We remain confident that the good faith negotiations with the United will lead to a new contract. It's important to note that all of our aircraft are currently scheduled in all future United schedules. Again, we hope to have something announced in the next few weeks and I can assure you that it's been one of our highest priorities. On operational performance. We had a number of challenges in operational performance in the third quarter, which are driven by very specific identifiable issues that I'm going to ask Brad Rich to now walk you through. Brad?\nBradford Rich: Thank you, Jonathan. Jonathan has already mentioned we have experienced several operational challenges in the third quarter. First, I want to express my appreciation to all of the people of Mesa who are working hard every day and committed to producing the reliability and experience that our customers expect and deserve. I've been here at Mesa now just over four months and I think it's worth noting that in my many years of regional airline experience and most recently having mainline experience, I do understand, I think very clearly what our partners expect and require, and I do believe Mesa has the operational capability to meet those expectations. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we had a controllable completion factor of 99.4%, which compares to 99.4% for the same period in the prior year. Although the results are the same number, they were actually achieved very differently. The third quarter of fiscal 2019 controllable completion factor was accomplished while increasing our block hours by 10.8% over the same period last year, primarily due to higher utilization on our fleet. At the same time, we experienced several significant challenges during this year's third quarter, including unprecedented weather. Our total completion factor, which includes weather and other uncontrollable cancellations, was 95.9% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 98.2% for the same period in the prior year. The two point, three point difference is the impact of the weather primarily, which negatively impacts the flow and location of both our aircraft and our crews. And as we previously reported, we removed two CRJ-900 aircraft in the American CPA on April 2 to be used as additional spare aircraft to help support the American operation, which previously had only three operational spares. We also agreed the new performance criteria based on the additional spare aircraft supporting the operation. During the month of April, our first month with the additional spares, we operated at 99.6% controllable completion and we exceeded all of the new performance criteria in the American operation. Unfortunately, during the initial 60-day performance period that began May 1, we had an aircraft unavailable due to ground damage in Dallas by a ground handler and two additional aircraft were unavailable due to extended c-check turn times caused by labor shortages at our heavy maintenance provider Bombardier. As a result, rather than benefiting from the additional two spares, our spare aircraft count was reduced from three to two throughout the majority of the measurement period. When combining the impact of the damaged aircraft, the extended c-checks the unprecedented weather and widely reported GPS outage. We did not meet the performance criteria and American elected to remove two aircraft effective November 2, 2019.  Today, we continue to operate with only two of the five dedicated spare aircraft during the second 60-day performance period that began on June 30. Further impacting, negatively impacting the operation, on July 31, we had another aircraft incur significant ground damage in Dallas when it was struck by a fueling truck while parked at the gate. As a result, it's going to be very difficult to meet the performance criteria and that could result in the removal of additional aircraft by the end of the calendar year. Needless to say, we're disappointed to have lost the aircraft after our people have worked very hard to meet the new criteria only to be negatively impacted by events that were largely and primarily out of our control. That being said, we do remain very focused on our identified initiatives to improve our operational performance. And I would say by the end of August, we do believe that all five spare aircraft will be back and operational. On the United side of the operation, our controllable completion factor was also 99.4% for Q3. So I think it's important to note that we had 99.7% controllable completion factor on the E175 fleet, which we do consider to be the premier aircraft in the regional industry and where our potential growth that could come from. It's also worth noting that in July of 2019, Mesa did lead the United Express portfolio in on time performance and overall customer satisfaction, very positive points and I think indicative of improvements. In closing, I would again remind you that we remain very focused on hiring of flight crews and maintenance technicians and we had very positive net increases in both pilots and mechanics over the third quarter of last year. With that, I'll now turn the time over to Mike to walk through the financials?\nMichael Lotz: Thanks Brad. So for the third quarter, we reported pre-tax income of $3.9 million. This compares to a pre-tax loss of $14.6 million for the same quarter last year. Additionally, for the quarter, we reported $900,000 in income tax expense for net income of $3 million or $0.09 per share. Excluding special items, our adjusted net income was $10.4 million or $0.30 per share, and just a quick note on our income tax expense, although we reflect the income tax of $900,000 for accounting purposes. We will not pay any cash taxes as we still have an excess of $400 million in NOLs. For pre-tax income, excluding the lease termination adjustment associated with the GECAS lease buyout, adjusted pre-tax income was $13.4 million for the quarter. This compares to adjusted pre-tax income of $11.6 million for the same quarter last year, about a 15% improvement. If we look at adjusted pre-tax income for the first three quarters of fiscal year, we're at $59.4 million on $535 million of revenue about 11% pre-tax margin. This compares to the first three quarters of last year, we were at $16.4 million on about $504 million of revenue about a 3% margin. So we met significant improvement year-over-year on both revenue as a result of increasing our block hour production on the existing fleet and on our margin as well. Importantly though, when comparing this quarter to our previous quarter, we did have a decrease in adjusted pretax earnings of $7.6 million, down from $21 million in Q2 the $13.4 million in this quarter, to $7.6 million decrease is comprised primarily of the following $3.9 million was due to the timing of ending events which we had anticipated and had provided a guidance for last quarter. Again, Q2 Engine Expense was $5.6 million compared to this quarter of $9.5 million, which was slightly above our guidance. $2.8 million of the increase was due to increased flight operation expense per block hour. Again, as we noted on prior calls, this was primarily due to an increase in pilot wages and pilot training costs as a result of hiring more pilots than needed based on our anticipation that we will add additional block hours or achieve some incremental client going forward. The pilot training footprint also has not been reduced as quickly as anticipated. We had pilot premium pay that was higher. And lastly, as a result of lower total completion factor due to significant weather and ATC which Brad alluded to this quarter versus prior quarters, our crew costs both flight attendants and pilots per block hour cost increase due to having to pay for flights set, pay the crews for flights that we don't operate. And lastly, $1.2 million is due to an increase in line maintenance expense where we use temporary third-party contractors to supplement our in-house maintenance capabilities. On the revenue side, we reported contract or CPA revenue excluding past few items of $170.4 million and increase a 6.5% over the same quarter last year of $159.9 million. Our adjusted EBITDA was $45.9 million and adjusted EBITDAR was $58.8 million. This week compares to the same quarter last year where adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR were $41.7 and $59.7 million respectively. Block hours were $114,042 for Q3, as Brad alluded to 10.8% increase from the same quarter last year and slightly below our guidance of 115,203. We're also providing guidance for Q4 to be at 116,600, which is 3.7% increase from the same quarter last year in 2.2% higher than Q3. On the Engine Expense, I'd like to recap where we are. Our Engine Expense was $9.5 million for Q3. We have provided guidance in our earnings release that next quarter we expect Engine Expense to come down about 800,000 to $8.7 million. Although, Engine Expense expected to go down by 800,000 we expect our flight operations expense for black hour and our line maintenance expense per block hour to temporarily ran at these elevated levels through the fourth quarter and into next year. I'd also like to touch on the Aircraft, at American that are coming out as Brad pointed out, we will be reducing two aircraft from our American flying in November. We are currently evaluating alternative uses of the aircraft. Some of those alternatives are to use the aircraft to support the American operation to redeploy the aircraft at other operators to lease the aircraft or to sell the aircraft as we do have significant equity in the two aircraft that we removed. We're still evaluating each of these alternatives as each will have a different short- and long-term financial impact. On June 14, we finalize the purchase and financing of 10 CRJ-700s previously leads from GECAS and operating at United. By purchasing these aircraft previously leased, we have reduced the number of leased aircraft with third parties down into 18 for the entire company. We ended the quarter at $79 9 million in cash, total debt on the balance sheet for Q3 was $881 million down $41 million from the $915 million as of September 30 2018. The change is essentially $109 million of principal payments that were off by $70 million of additional debt for the aircraft that were purchased off lease and $3 million in engine financing. For the fourth quarter and remainder of 2019 other CapEx we expect to be in the $2 million to $5 million range, we don't have any other major transactions planned for the fourth quarter. We also have our revolving credit facility of $35 million, which has been extended through mid-September and we're finalizing long-term extension. I'd like to now turn it back over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Mike. Few other items I'd like to just touch on briefly. We talked about on previous calls. On the cargo side, we continue to make good progress in our efforts to diversify into the cargo business. We expect to see this potentially come to fruition in the summer of 2020. One of the main benefits we see from the cargo operation, which is important, we'll be small, but we'll be increased pilot recruiting and reduced attrition, which we believe is still the single biggest challenge in the regional industry. On that point, we continue to hire pilots above our current level of attrition and that's being done purposely to position ourselves for both increased utilization of our existing fleet and the potential opportunity to grow the number of aircraft that we operate in our CPA agreements with either American or United. Obviously, we're pretty disappointed with this quarter. We knew that we would have some challenges, unfortunately, those challenges were really exceptionally exacerbated over this summer. We had hoped and our thoughts had always been that we did not have spares aircraft to adequately operate the elevated levels of utilization. We worked very cooperatively with American to come up with a plan that we thought would be successful. Clearly as we entered April and saw how much the beat was, we did have a lot of confidence that followed through into the first week of May where again, the numbers all were very good. And then once these aircraft started to either get damaged or not come back at a c-check, obviously it had has very severe impact on the operation. We're going to just continue to push hard and do the right thing. Brad has been a huge help to us here and we continue to have a lot of confidence in his ability to help us get the operation to where it needs to be. I'd like to mention that we are very cognizant of the fact that we have an extension to work out with American and that contract does come due within a couple of years. We spent quite a bit of money over the last five or six months. I'm basically an open checkbook to get some of these things fixed and to do it rapidly. And frankly still convinced that we have done that and I think Brad has done a lot to help to make that happen. We have a new VP of maintenance who has done a marvelous job and has received kudos from both of our partners. We don't think that there is a systemic issue nearly as much as we just got caught in what was a confluence of issues that just hit us at precisely the wrong time. We invested a lot of money that is not a small part and why the numbers weren't where they were supposed to be. It would have been a lot easier for us maybe just to pull the plains out and maintain our own contractual requirements, which were far, far less onerous, but we felt in good faith that by going forward with American and showing them that we could do this and agreeing to some of these newer terms, it would put us on much stronger pudding for any discussions that we might have regarding the renewal. I don't think any of us feel differently about that and I think that in spite of the fact that we failed and in spite of the fact that they elected to pull the two aircraft out, I think we still created a lot of good faith by doing what we did. And I think we're going to build on that good faith going forward, particularly as the schedule start to come down. We see a significant drop in block hours coming in September and once these five spare aircraft are back, I don't think we're going to \u2013 I think that the proof will be in the putting obviously, but I feel very confident that between all of us here we're going to see these numbers improved very significantly going into the fall. So with that, I met \u2013 one other point that I touch on the pilot side. It has always been difficult, but I just want to remind people that unlike just about that I can think of any other regional in the industry, we've expanded very significantly over the last five years. We've been able to keep up that expansion. There are obviously pinch points, most notably in the summer where things are tight. But again, we continue to hire a very significant number of pilots and have exceeded our attrition levels every month, and we have seen a significant decline in attrition, mostly we think in regard to the fact that we have this agreement with the United on the flow through of our pilots, which has helped us considerably. So on the critical areas, we just continued to press forward. We stick to our business. I've always believe that if you do the right things, the right things happen. And while we have had obviously what is not an insignificant setback, we're going to continue to press forward and do whatever it takes to get the ship righted and do that and move forward. So with that, I'm happy to open up to any questions that you might have.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matt Fallon with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Fallon: Hey guys. How it\u2019s going? Two questions from me. Clearly during the June Q, you're sweating the assets, running a tight operation, and then of course you dealt with some operational disruptions at a field, do you think these \u2013 absent these operational disruptions, the kind of utilization you\u2019re pushing is still sustainable?\nJonathan Ornstein: Every month our pilot count has gone up, which is the only issue of significance. Our maintenance numbers have gone up significantly as well in terms of hiring of mechanics to cover this. We are in fact significantly above what our targeted maintenance number is just to be on the safe side. So yes, I think it's absolutely sustainable and in fact, in some of the conversations that we've had particularly on the 175, I think it's important to note that we've never turned back a 175 schedule in terms of hours, and we feel that at this point, we are well prepared to do that. And it just keeps getting better in terms of pilot count their maintenance count, but unfortunately it has been expensive to go above and beyond to make that happen. And hopefully that will get normalized. But going forward \u2013 but again, yes, I think that on the hour side it is sustainable and our partners are working closely with us. There's no doubt that they piled on a lot of hours this summer. We have preferred that maybe those numbers have been backed off a little bit, particularly in light of the fact that we did not have adequate spare coverage? Yes. That being said, I mean, we still ran in 99.4% completion rate. I mean, that's still not \u2013 it's not like the operations coming apart, it's just wasn't at the level it needed to be.\nMatthew Fallon: Got it. Just as a follow-up, I know you sort of talked about ways to monetize those extra airplanes, but just sort of absent that, what is the financial drag on annual basis of carrying these extra airplanes with all the associated costs and crews? How should we think about that?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well we're still evaluating the alternatives so it could vary significantly. We just don't use the aircraft for anything in support. The American operation that would be a much higher number than if we were to just sell the aircraft and take the cash in. So we're, still evaluating what the potential impact would be based on what we do with the aircraft.\nMatthew Fallon: Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen Incorporated. Your line is now open.\nConor Cunningham: Hey guys. It's actually Conor Cunningham on for Helane. I know that your negotiations between American neither [indiscernible]. But I have to ask like have the operational issues that you've seen at American starting to creep into your discussions with United. And also can you just talk about like how the tone of your conversations have changed with United since the new management started?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, first of all, I guess for better or worse, I mean Scott Kirby is the President at United, he was the President at American. He is well aware of our operational capabilities of both carriers. So I don't think that that's an issue. And again, I think it's important to note that while we did not make our goals as a result of what Brad had gone through, we still ran in 99.4% completion rate, I mean for the quarter. And so I think that has to be taken into context. And at United, when you're running a 99.7% completion rate and the Embraer 175, which is the aircraft obviously, that they're looking to grow and where the most on time carrier with the highest customer satisfaction, I think that those numbers also speak to Mesa's operational capabilities.  So I don't think that what's happening in American has done that and look, everyone in at both America and United are professionals and they've been around the business a long time. And I think it's fair to say that they also do appreciate the fact that a worldwide GPS outage. The issue regarding damaged airplanes, and the c-checks, they realize that. I do think though that American clearly felt that by pulling two airplanes down, it would potentially provide new additional spares into that system. The new management at United are as someone that we just most recently met, we have had very fruitful and positive conversations. I don't think that that is a issue \u2013 as an issue whatsoever. And remember Brad worked United and also had previous relationships with all these people as far as running the express program. And Brad, do you want to add anything to that?\nBradford Rich: Right. I just agree with what you just said. I don't think there's a negative impact or any spillover as you just described.\nJonathan Ornstein: Just a change. That position unfortunately seen a lot of turnover. Brad knows that and he used to be in that position. But the fact of the matter is, Tracey came in, who's a good friend of ours from back in the continental days. But we're very comfortable with [Sara] that we'll develop a strong relationship as we've always had back since 1990 at United.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then just on American specifically, I mean can you just talk to the actual plan of how you think you're going to improve the underlying performance side? Does it really just come down to having more crew and spare aircraft? And then just secondly on top of that, can you actually provide the financial impact from the operational issues in the quarter. It just seems like theoretically that could be one-time in nature if you fix everything. Thanks again for the time.\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, okay, sure. I'm going to let Brad talk to the spares and aircraft issue because \u2013 go ahead Brad.\nBradford Rich: Yes. Well, certainly from the highest level, yes and that's why we've made a big focus here on the call about our commitment to continually hiring crews and we are. We're focused on it. We're doing everything we can. We've got some interesting creative things that we're going to begin implementing to do that. So that's a big issue. And then fundamentally even as we described what's happened with the damaged aircraft, extended c-checks, that's reduced the spare count. When you look at how the airline actually operates and functions every day. There have been days here where we essentially have had no spares. So yes, that's why I made a point to say by August, by the end of August, we expect the spare count to come up to its expected level. And those two things will continue to make a positive difference. But on top of that, look, there are a lot of things that we're doing, initiatives that we're focusing on everywhere from continued focusing on the pilot, hiring footprint in the training department to the quality of the training, right into the curriculum to technology improvements that we need to make in the system. And we're focused on all of those things.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. And I would also want to point out too that. I think the issues bears as in fact critical. It's been one of my real issues. We looked at another care that's operated very \u2013 it had a very good operating track record at one of our partners. And they operate about the same number of embraces that we operate. We've operated with three spares since we operated and they operate with five spares. Maybe they negotiated a better contract, maybe times have changed. Maybe we were more hungry to take those airplanes on. But I'm convinced that I truly am convinced that for example, at American with the five spares, the numbers would have been significantly different. And now if they give us two more and we're at seven and we elect to keep them in, which we may well do in an effort to show good faith and continue to try to show them that as we've said, that money is not the issue right now. We really want to be able to demonstrate that we can do the job they want. If that's what it takes, so that's what we'll do. The fact is I don't see any operational [indiscernible] any other carrier that would not allow us to achieve those results. And I think Brad having come over from United and managing all the carriers would agree with me on that.\nBradford Rich: Yes, I do.\nJonathan Ornstein: And you can add \u2013 it did add some financial impact on the quarter, but again, we did run a 99.4% controllable completion factor. Overall, we did spend additional money at American on supplementing our maintenance staff. We talked about spending slightly over $1 million for that. But we still run at 99.4%, but the threshold that American was at such a level that we still didn't meet the criteria.\nConor Cunningham: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes. Good afternoon. Brad, can you just walk us through the process that American looks at in terms of evaluating whether to pull additional aircraft and what the risk is that they continue to do that. I mean, how many more could you potentially lose over the next several months?\nBradford Rich: Okay. Well, I'll first, just talked about \u2013 I'll just give my thoughts about whenever I'm doing this it's hard because I'm not American, right? So we have a contract in place and the contract has, I mean, specific provisions and look they're adhering to their rights within the contract. Now having said that look, there's one angle you could look at on this and say right up until some of these issues start happening with damaged aircraft and extended c-checks and those types of things. And again, every time we say that, it almost appears we're just making excuses. I mean, these are just facts that happened in the operation. I mean largely the issues that negatively impacted us were uncontrollable. And we were certainly hoping that as American looked at that that would come into play. And I think we've been doing a lot of things to demonstrate our willingness to do the things that Jonathan has outlined. And Jonathan has given us the green light to do the types of things and make the investments we need to improve the operations and we have been doing that. And I think American has seen that, but look at the end of the day, what are we hoping for some I'm guessing I'll use the term leniency given that lot of this was uncontrollable. Yes, at the end of the day they made a business decision and look honestly, I think from their perspective they thought doing what did removing the airplanes would give us some would actually be helpful to the operation to have additional spares. So look, it is what it is. I don't know what they're going to do going forward. Our objective is to do everything we can to run the operation in a way that meets their expectations and the expectations of the customers. And we've outlined a lot of things that we're doing and have identified that need to be done to create the reliability that's expected.\nMichael Lotz: This is Mike. I can just add to that. The other part of your question is, they did notice this on these two aircraft and the agreement that we have is on were maximum of six aircraft. So the maximum number of aircraft they could take beyond these two with an additional four and that wouldn't happen. And so if it were still get not until the end of 2019 into the first quarter 2020.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Well, I mean, is it your expectation that's what they're going to do?\nJonathan Ornstein: We do not \u2013 we don't know, honestly.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then Mike, it seems like just from on the expense side, the biggest variance, relative to what you guys maybe were expecting 12 months ago was on the flight ops side. And so should we continue to expect kind of through 2020 or through your FY 2020 for that to remain at 30%, 31% of revenue and for that not to come down for the foreseeable future?\nMichael Lotz: Yes, I think at least through the first half of 2020 maybe into the second half. And again, some of that will be dependent on if we get asked with why additional block hours or if we were to increase by any incremental aircraft because once that occurs and obviously you're going to either further build up backlog pilots to prepare for that type of growth and that generally accelerates your increased with your flight ops spent over a normal level and so the block hours come in, so but certainly at least through the first half of the year.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then Jonathan, I mean, it sounds like you guys are staffing up to prepare for growth or for higher utilization, but at the same time you're losing aircraft with American and the extension with United is kind of dragging on. So can you talk about when the opportunities to grow the fleet? Where they are? What are some of the key milestones you're looking at are? Thank you.\nJonathan Ornstein: So first of all, it's important to note, and again, Mike and Brad, we did fly with two fewer aircraft, but we flew more hours.\nMichael Lotz: That's correct.\nJonathan Ornstein: Right. So even though American pulled the two airplanes out to help us. And by the way, we've been talking about doing that for quite some time prior to that agreement. So it is not like that from our standpoint, we wanted the additional spares. Okay. But they did fly more hours even with the fewer aircraft and that will continue. And I would be surprised if that doesn't continue even now beyond the additional two airplanes coming out. On the United side, we continued to have some level of expectation that a) the block hour numbers will go up. The difference at United is, they had been constrained in terms of increasing block hours on the 175 fleet because we operate all out of one hub. So they've been talking to us about potentially moving aircraft and putting flow through to another hub.  And on the 700s, I mean we have a stage length of 380 miles, which is half of the stage length basically that we have on the 175. So it's hard to really press that utilization up a whole lot because the trips are so short. That being said, we still would like to add more CRJ crews in both the American and United just to give ourselves bigger buffers. I think in terms of growth, obviously the discussion has been around the CRJ-700. Those aircraft potentially being downgraded and then back filling those airplanes with 70-seat aircraft. Those discussions have been ongoing for quite some time. As I mentioned, disappointed. I have some very longstanding relationships at United that I still have that level of confidence. But at this point in time, I think it's fair to say the deal is not done until it's done and we're going to just have to wait and let that continue to go through what has been a very long process. But we continue to hire crews. We continue to hire crews in anticipation of flying more block hours one way or the other.\nJoseph DeNardi: Is it your expectation that in FY2020 that you can grow contract revenue assuming you get an extension with United?\nJonathan Ornstein: In 2020, particularly, I would think that every projection that we've seen includes more block hours going forward without any incremental aircraft. And I think it's fair to say that with any incremental aircraft, yes, the answer would be we'll be flying more hours for sure.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSavanthi Syth: Thank you. Good afternoon. I just wonder, I guess you can \u2013 clearly the E175 operation is doing well and the CRJ operation is not, is it just a matter of aircraft age and stage length or I was hoping you can kind of walk me through what the differences there are and if there are any learnings that you can kind of bring over from the E175 side to the CRJ side?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. I mean, I\u2019ll let Brad also to talk about this, but I will just tell you my feeling. Yes. The planes are older, there's no doubt about it, but there's still frontline good airplanes. They're not unreliable. But when you're trying to run a fleet of 64 airplanes with two spares, and as Brad says on many days, no spares, it's just very difficult. Are the 175 is more reliable? Yes. There's no doubt that the aircraft are more reliable. At 175 fly average stage lengths in excess of 720 miles, which clearly helps us on the utilization side. And on the American side, our average stage length on the 900 is 520 miles. So again, if you would adjust for stage length, I mean we fly a lot. I mean we actually have an average generally one more departure than most other large regional jet operators on our CRJ fleet, one more departure per day than other operators because we have a shorter stage length. So those are all things that come into play. But I don't think there's any fundamental difference on the CRJ other than the fact that it's an older aircraft, it's going to be a bit more maintenance intensive, but they still operate with the same engines. I mean, no, I think that we just have to focus a little bit and already, I mean the idea was that we were going to operate American with five spares as whereas at United, we've achieved excellent results with only three spares. But do we think that those two spares would make the difference? I certainly do. And I let Brad continue that, I mean it's your right.\nBradford Rich: Yes. I agree completely. I mean the questions are very valid question. But the issues that would \u2013 that come into play on a CRJ and older CRJ, we're addressing. We've hired 54 new mechanics since the third quarter of last year and we've added additional spares with the expectation that they would really be spares to deal with some of those issues. Unfortunately, we just haven't had the spares. So once we're properly spared, we've add the mechanics to deal with some of the more intensive maintenance issues and we should be able to operate the fleet very reliably and meet their expectations. And look, the one thing that that we're trying to do to accommodate our partner is on both sides, the aircraft utilization is going up and the schedules are being tweaked and each major, I mean across our system, we've got increased utilization. So all of this is happening at the same time, the schedules have become \u2013 I'll just say as they tweaked the schedules. They become more difficult to fly. But we're addressing that by staffing up, on both crews and mechanics and we've added this additional spares.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. And I think it's fair to note that our partners have their own pressures too. And we're cognitive those and sympathetic. You look at American. American has had the Max problem. They want us operate reliably. And so I think that in the Max issue, certainly something out of their control. They were able to take two airplanes out, give us more spares, which we all thought was a good thing. We also included. I think they expected better performance from us as did we, but the spares were not available. But you can see it's not as if they said, hey, let's fly the planes less. They flew the planes more, 10% more with two fewer airplanes. So obviously the planes are being pushed a lot harder than they were even last summer. And we achieve results that were \u2013 in our view pretty good, but unfortunately not at the level that we needed to be for that test bird. We had a very good April. We felt very confident in that. Unfortunately, May, June became tougher as the airplanes became unavailable to us.\nSavanthi Syth: Okay. And maybe I don't understand this, but if the spares are being funded by the American fleets and American still takes the kind of the baseline utilization and keeps pushing it up. Do you not need to kind of find spares outside of the fleet to try and meet the increase utilization?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, no, I mean the fact is that the five \u2013 we had three spares historically with American. There was literally years of discussions in regard to what was the adequate spare count versus for example, other operators, okay. I was a very strong advocate that basal was being \u2013 what's the right word? Disadvantage, because we did not have adequate spare count. We put the two spares in. We all anticipated that that was going to solve the problem with all the initiatives that Brad as discussed and initiatives that we implemented along with American. The fact that matter is, now if in fact we now are looking at seven spares going into the fall, the idea we had looked at getting additional spares and did not \u2013 at this point, I don't think any of us think it's necessary to go beyond the seven spares, operating for literally over a decade with three spares. On the other point too is that, clearly Mesa has been in an expansion mode for a long time. Having gone from 58 aircraft to 143, where some of the other big operators have actually shrunk their fleet and had a pool of pilots to call upon. The environment for pilots has been tough. We had a seven-month period before we got our pilot contract put in place, where we actually were net down almost 150 pilots and we'd been crawling \u2013 slowly crawling or either that hole at the same time while we've been expanding the fleet. So we've had some headwinds and clearly this quarter, we've seen sort of a confluence of issues that have really put us in a difficult position. But I don't have any lack of confidence in the model and what we're doing and with the people who we have here, including Brad and our new VP of Maintenance, Doug Shockey. I mean, these are all good quality people who I'm convinced. We're going to get this thing to where it needs to be.\nSavanthi Syth: I appreciate that and just a couple of clarification, just first on the American contract. I thought they were only able to pull two aircraft every six months. I'm kind of curious why, if one is coming out in November, why the other one would come out end of year and into 1Q?\nMichael Lotz: Yes, there was not \u2013 it was not to every six months, it was six total, two every maximum of two in any given month.\nSavanthi Syth: Okay. Got it. And then just on the follow-up on comments \u2013 your response to Conor on the financial impact, Mike in the last quarter you guys made close to about $0.46 and in this quarter was $0.30. I'm just kind a curious if the $0.30 versus the $0.46 is a function of these issues and therefore this is kind of a I think that's what Conor was trying to get at and that's what I'm trying to understand is? What would have been kind of the earnings this quarter if you hadn't had some of these kind of expanding as the second chances?\nMichael Lotz: Yes. I mean, like I pointed out that the three biggest drivers for the change in the earnings quarter-over-quarter were almost $4 million more in just heavy maintenance on the engines, which is a timing issues. I was going to hit this quarter, irrespective of what happened in the \u2013 with the American fleet. The other piece was $2.5 million to $3 million in additional flight operations costs. And again, that was when we talked about this, better preparing ourselves for potential increased block hours or even better, obviously increased fleet growth. As well as our training footprint is not as efficient as it needs to be and with some overtime that we paid for the quarter. But again, that wasn't necessarily related to the American completion factor issues. And the third one was there was about a $1 million, $1.5 million in additional maintenance expense where we brought in some outside maintenance contractors to ironically improve the fleet, so that we would hit some of these targets. And that expense is not going to be ongoing that was more related to the challenge to try to pre-empt challenges that could have represented this quarter and that will start going down as early as next quarter.\nJonathan Ornstein: But I will say, Savi \u2013 this is Jonathan. I mean, we threw money at this issue. There's no doubt. Like Mike said, the temporary maintenance people. We wanted to ensure that we could fly the block hours in terms of that overtime for the pilots, which was running I think what about $600,000 or $700,000 a month. That's not a small expense. We did that specifically to do that. Our pilots had been super productive. And I will say, I'm very cooperative and helpful in this whole process. And I think that those things may have been different. And I think we'd be having a much different call if we hadn't missed the numbers with all these investments. And in spite of the fact we might have missed our numbers if it hadn't been for the fact that we had some really tough luck in terms of the spare count going from what should have been three to five actually down to one or two and these investments would have looked really smart right now. I mean, obviously I think there are people questioning that. I personally think that in the long-run, we\u2019re still best suited by doing everything we can to demonstrate that we can operate these levels and that the money we spent was the right decision at the time. And continue to be the right decision. And we're going to continue to do it. I mean, people should know that we are doing what we have to, to make sure that our partners are satisfied with our operational results. And I'm hopeful that in spite of the fact that American did pull these two planes down, which I think they felt in the end, it would be helpful to us again that we can look back and say these were the right decisions.\nSavanthi Syth: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Speakers, we show no further questions in queue at this time.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Mike, why don\u2019t you add something.\nMichael Lotz: Yes. I just want to address on the American operation that we do. We do have the three spares and we did get these two additional aircraft, we call them white tails. They are not necessarily spares. Their intent is to use those aircraft when other aircraft already maintenance run available to us. For this time period, we had that need all the time, but just a nuance there I just wanted to clarify.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay, so we appreciate everyone's time this morning. To say that we're disappointed would be an understatement. We had very strong hopes that our new agreement with American was going to strengthen our relationship and would allow us to continue to operate all the aircraft. Unfortunately, as we mentioned, due to a lot of different events, at least two aircraft are going to come out. At United, we continue to have confidence that the extension which is only days away and I think it's important to point out that those aircraft are scheduled as far out as United schedules ago. I don't think that there is a risk on the 700s, but I understand that people have grown concern given the fact that it's taken this long. All I can tell you is that we continue to press forward on all these fronts. We're going to do the best job possible. We continue to feel that the model works and we just have to fine tune that model and get us to where we need to be. But with that, I want to thank everyone for taking their time. We're always available if you want to call us afterwards if you have any other additional questions. And I think that one of the things at Mesa we've always tried to do is align the interests of both the shareholders and management. I mean I still continue to be one of the largest individual shareholders and I\u2019m disappointed from that regard as well as I know most of you are. But we've been here for a long time. We intend to do everything we can to get everything fixed and move forward in a positive way. So with that, I want to thank everyone for taking the time today and we look forward to talking to you on our next call. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 2, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-05-10 15:45:09", "content": "Operator: Welcome, and thank you all for standing by. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. And now I will turn the meeting over to your host, Jonathan Ornstein, You may begin.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Kirby. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Jonathan Ornstein. I'm the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mesa Airlines. On the call with me today is Mike Lotz, President and Chief Financial Officer; Brian Gillman, Executive VP and General Counsel; a new addition to our call, Brad Rich, Chief Operating Officer; and Darren Zapfe, Vice President of Finance. I'd like to ask Brian to read the safe harbor statement please.\nBrian Gillman: Thanks, Jonathan. Before the presentation comments begin, Mesa would like to remind you that some of the statements and responses to your questions in the conference call today may include forward-looking statements. As such, they are subject to future events and uncertainties that could also affect our actual results to differ materially from those statements. Also, please note the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our press release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC, which Mesa encourages you to read. In addition, please refer to our press release in the Investor section of Mesa's website to find additional disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that will be used on today's call.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Thank you, Brian. Okay. We had a pretty nice quarter. We continue to execute our plan to increase block hour production on our existing fleet. As a result, block hours were 112,030 for Q2 fiscal '19, which represented a 14.5% increase from the same quarter last year. We're also providing guidance for third quarter. We believe the block hours will be about a 115,203, which is an 11.9% increase from the same quarter last year. Given our partner's desire of increased block hour production and to position ourselves for future growth opportunities, we have continued to overstaff, hiring more pilots than we are losing. We continue to see excellent results on our pilot recruiting front and attrition has been stable to slightly lower than anticipated.  Our quarter two fiscal '19 adjusted earnings before taxes, were $21 million, which compares to $3 million for the same quarter last year. However, earnings before taxes were $4 million lower than our previous quarter, primarily due to the timing of heavy maintenance events, engine, C-checks and landing gear. As you know, our earnings are very sensitive to the timing of these major heavy maintenance events since we expense these costs in the period they occur.  On March 6, we finalized our purchase agreement with GECAS for 10 CRJ-700 aircraft, current leased from them and operating at United. Upon completion of the transaction and financing closing, we will have reduced the number of leased aircraft with third parties to 18 out of our total fleet. For United, we continue to have productive discussions in United related to the 20 CRJ-700 standard, which we just purchased. That agreement is scheduled to expire later this year. I know this has been an ongoing topic for longer than any of us anticipated, but we remain highly confident on a CPA extension on the 20 CRJ-700s. As noted above, the CRJ-700s that we are purchasing off lease from GECAS are currently flying at United. We hope to have something to announce in the next few weeks.  Beyond our existing business, we continue to explore potential expansion that includes CPA flying increases and other opportunities as previously discussed, including new partnerships and cargo. On the cargo front, we believe we have made some progress towards that goal. All in all, we continue to focus on operational excellence and believe as the low-cost regional airline operator, we're well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. Brad Rich, who many of you will know from his days at SkyWest and later at United, will now walk through some of our operational performance.\nBradford Rich: Thank you, Jonathan. First of all, having been here less than two months, my comments will be very brief today. But let me start by saying, first of all, how impressed I am with the talent and the capabilities of the Mesa operational team. Having recently come from United, I'm familiar with the regional carriers, and I believe Mesa is very well positioned in the industry. I've been working very closely with both America and United. I may know many of their senior leaders personally from my time both at SkyWest and United. And I'm confident that Mesa can and will do everything possible to meet and exceed their expectations. As an example, during the second quarter of fiscal '19, we had a controllable completion factor of 99.6% compared to 98.8% for the same period in the prior year. That's a significant improvement. So far, for Q3 in fiscal '19 to date, we're at 99.6%. Our total completion factor, which includes weather and other uncontrollable cancellations was 97.4% in Q2 compared to 96.4% for the same period in the prior year. I mentioned just a few of those metrics has an indication of the improvements that were making. And again, I'm confident that we can be successful in the future. Let me now turn the time over to Mike Lotz, who will now walk through some of the financial details.\nMichael Lotz: Thanks, Brad. So for the second quarter, we reported pretax income of $17.3 million, excluding a onetime adjustment for the loss on the extinguishes -- extinguishment of debt, the adjusted pretax income was $21 million for the quarter. This is a significant increase over the same quarter last year where we reported pretax earnings of $3 million. Our earnings are down from our pretax income of $25 million from the first quarter, and as Jonathan had pointed out, this is primarily due to the timing of our heavy maintenance events.  Additionally, we reported $4.1 million of income tax expense for net income of $13.2 million or $0.38 per share. Excluding the onetime adjustment, our adjusted net income was $16 million or $0.46 per share. Also, from an income tax perspective, although we reflect the income tax expense of $4.1 million for accounting purposes, we do not pay any cash taxes, and we still have approximately $415 million in NOLs; this is up from last year's NOL of about $300 million. And we believe based on our current projections, that we will not be a cash taxpayer until 2024 or 2025. Our adjusted EBITDA was $53.7 million and adjusted EBITDAR was $67.8 million. Again, these are significant increases from the same quarter last year when adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR were $32 million and $50.3 million, respectively. On the revenue side, we reported contract or CPA revenue excluding pass-through items of $169.8 million, which is an 8.5% increase over the same quarter last year of $156.5 million. Also included in revenue is pass-through revenue, which is reimbursement of certain expenses on a dollar-for-dollar basis, which have no P&L impacts. For quarter two, we reported pass-through revenue of $7.4 million compared to $11.1 million for the same quarter last year.  On the expense side, as Jonathan pointed out to position Mesa better to take advantage of potential growth and our partner's desire for increased block hours, we continue to hire more pilots than the associated attrition levels would require. To put this into context, during the quarter, we averaged approximately 188 pilots in training each month, which is down from the same quarter last year where we were at about 268. But still, we're about 100 pilots more than required if we were just to offset for attrition. As a result, we believe pilot training expense will decline over time, but we do not believe they will decline as rapidly as we had previously anticipated. That being said, we believe this is a strategic investment in our long-term future. The added expense of increased pilots and training is approximately $3.5 million to $5 million per quarter. Our engine expense was $5.6 million for the quarter compared to $10.8 million for the same quarter last year. As we have said, our engine expense, although predictable, can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. We did provide guidance for Q3 with engine expense projected at $8.7 million. Also, as we talked about on our last call, we have retimed some of our C-check events based on revised C-check time limits and also to accommodate our partner's request for having maximum number of aircrafts available during the summer. As a result, the C-check expense for Q2 was $3 million higher than in Q1. We expect this to continue for Q2 -- for Q3 rather, and then drop off in Q4, which is actually our summer quarter. Again, like engines, this is more of a timing issue and not a structural cost issue. Also, Jonathan mentioned the purchase of 10 CRJ-700s from GECAS. This will have a positive impact on earnings as we transition from lease accounting to ownership accounting. And we expect about $3 million to $4 million per year over the next few years and increased earnings as a result of that transaction. From cash and liquidity standpoint, we ended the quarter at $77.7 million in cash, which is down $45.5 million from $123.2 million that we reported at the end of September 2018. This reduction of cash was primarily driven by executing on two of the key IPO initiatives that totals $51 million. One of them was for $26 million that we paid down in connection with refinancing our spare engine facility at lower interest rates and $25 million to pay down our full line of credit. Total debt on the balance sheets for the quarter was $844 million, down $71 million from the $915 million as of September 2018. As to other CapEx for the remainder of fiscal 2019, we will have the 10 purchased CRJ-700s, which will be $70 million. We have one additional engine that we're purchasing for roughly $5 million, and then we're looking at roughly about $10 million to $12 million in additional CapEx on maintenance-related items. Lastly, on cash, we do still have our full revolver available to us of $35 million, and we anticipate extending and expanding that over the next few months. I'd like to now turn it back over to Jonathan who can open it up for questions.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thanks, Mike, that was a good review. Before we open up for questions, I would like to update you on the conferences that Mesa will be attending. We are going to be at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2019 Transportation and Industrials Conference, which is actually next week in Boston on May 14, and we will be -- I believe, we are presenting there. Is that correct, Mike?\nMichael Lotz: Yes.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. All right. So with that, we'd like to open up the floor to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Brad, welcome aboard. Welcome back. Anyway, Jonathan, can you just give us your thoughts on how you think about -- I know you made without recently with this CRJ-550 concept. Thoughts on it? I think there's a view out there that taking a 70-seater and putting 50 seats on it that -- it undermines the economics of the aspect. And maybe we have to think a little bit harder about how it's being utilized, and maybe it's going to be in markets that are premium heavy -- premium -- revenue-premium heavy. Thoughts on it? And whether or not something like that would potentially make sense for you guys?\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yes. I'm actually very excited about the concept. As these aircraft get older and they become depreciated, there are some cost benefits obviously that accrue to us as a result of that. From United's perspective, as you know, they are somewhat scope-restrained in the larger regional jets, which has put them at a strategic disadvantage in regard to total first class seats available. And the revenue impact is not insignificant. If you want to fly from Wichita to London and you're going to buy a ticket on business or first, you can't do it on United Airlines. I don't think Wichita is an example, but these other carriers would have more. Large regional jets can offer first class ticket, and in fact, connecting long-haul traffic where United is being penalized. I think that it obviously will take a special cost structure. I'm very pleased that I think Mesa is one of just a couple of carriers that could potentially do that. And I think it opens up the door for us for a significant amount of opportunity, not the least of which is why I've been as confident as I have been and we've been in regarding to our 700s to either be operated in the 70-seat configuration or in a 50-seat configuration. So I'm very excited about it. I think it will certainly be very well received from the passenger's standpoint. I've looked at the LOPA, the seat arrangements on the aircraft. It's going to be incredible airplane. I mean it's probably as close as you can fly to a private aircraft in the commercial world. And I think that Mesa's cost structure will allow us to operate that plane profitably for United as well as for ourselves.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Very good. And then just a second question on cargo. You mentioned, I think, it was a sentence or so on cargo, and you indicated that there was progress toward a goal but that you still had a few more steps. Can you elaborate on that? I mean the opportunity -- and is that a 2019 opportunity? Or is this putting in something structurally for an opportunity in 2020, 2021? Any detail on that would be great.\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. I mean, we've -- since I've served on the Board at southern, cargo is kind of interesting to us because it's so similar to our business. There are some nuances to it regarding how the contracts are structured, but there's advantages and disadvantages. We think it's very interesting. Again, given our cost structure, we think we are very well positioned. It's a simple operation in terms of -- you don't have this sort of complex networks and utilization that you have in the current major airline partner relationships. You just have to operate reliably. And I think that this is something that we'd be looking out. Clearly, it would be more of a 2020-type opportunity. It's not a game-changer by any stretch. We actually would start very small.  We think it's helpful, not only from the standpoint that it diversifies our business and gives us a new revenue stream and opportunity on the net income side, but more importantly, probably is the fact that it helps us in terms of attraction and retention of pilots. You can come to Mesa and start by flying a regional jet and end up flying a narrowbody or bigger, I think that is a really big, big benefit, and I think that helps our partners as well. So we're excited about it. We think that there's some real opportunities. Most of you on this call certainly follow what's going on in the cargo world. And I think there's definitely room for a low-cost operator, like ourselves, to enter the cargo business in a way that is beneficial to all parties.\nMichael Linenberg: So Jonathan, just reading between the lines, if I heard you right, it would sound like that you would be flying, in the cargo business, bigger airplanes than regional jets. Is that the right interpretation?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, I think that we are looking at regional jets for sure. I mean everybody is trying to figure out what to do with these 50 seaters that are out there. And there's a lot that are out there part, but we're looking across the whole spectrum. It's just that can you make the 50 seaters work, and if not, obviously, then we would be looking at larger aircraft.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: And actually, if I might -- Brad, it's nice to have you back. And just kind of wondering, leaving United, coming to Mesa, what attracted to you? And what you see is kind of key important things to get done in the first 18 months?\nBradford Rich: Well, thank you, Savi. First of all, look, the positioning of Mesa is one of the primary reasons I'm here. I've known Mike and Jonathan, of course, for many years. In fact, Jonathan and I joke about the fact most of those years we've been competitors and then partners for United. And so I've known the team for a long time. And look, I see a lot of opportunity, both in the positioning of the cost structure, which obviously can't be -- I don't think we get overemphasized how important that is as well as the operational capability when we consistently produce high reliability, which is my highest priority right now then, of course, we think there are a lot of opportunities with our major partners. And so that's the primary reason I'm here and my priority is consistent reliability.\nSavanthi Syth: Got it. And if I might ask on the American contract, I think starting April, you're under the kind of the new performance metrics, and just wondering if you can provide an update on how that's progressing with kind of that extra spares now?\nJonathan Ornstein: Brad, do you want to take a shot at that? Or would you like me to talk about it?\nBradford Rich: Well, I, first of all, ask you to repeat the question, please?\nSavanthi Syth: Sure. Just wondering about the American contracts that was kind of revised with new performance metrics? And I think part of the contract allowed you to have a couple of more spares as well as kind of made some changes to help kind of improve operations. I was wondering how you're executing kind of to the new targets?\nBradford Rich: Okay. Well, so first of all, I think we should just say, I mean, the contract amendment is an interesting amendment. I mean it's one that certainly motivates us to produce at a higher level, and it's also certainly in the best interest of American. And -- but by the way, I'm perfectly fine with that because our relationship with American is going to do nothing but improve and get better and stronger as we adhere to and comply with the amendment. So -- and I'm confident that we can achieve the metrics. Yes, there are some things that we're looking at and restructuring and looking at different ways of doing some things everywhere from a schedule to just fundamental operating procedures. And I think all of that will be -- that's when things really work in strength and relationships is when things work both for the regional partner and the major airline. And so, look, I'm confident that we can be successful with the new amendment. And look, there are other things that we're doing, I mean, some strategic investments that we are willing to and need to make in the operation to just create this really high sustainable reliability that our partners expect. So I'm confident we can do that.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes, and if I could add, I mean, I think that the proof is in the pudding. We knew that in the last year, 18 months, I mean, we were hamstrung by the fact that we had expanded a lot, we needed more pilots, we got hung up a little bit in pilot training, maintenance became more difficult in terms of qualified maintenance people. And we're just sort of finally putting all that together. And as I mentioned, the proof is in the pudding. We ran a completion rate, almost a full point, higher than we did last year. That is not an insignificant number. So we think we've made the improvements necessary. We have more to go. But that being said, I think when you look at the standpoint of how we operate, where we operate and at the cost at which we operate, it's a pretty compelling product. And that's what we just continue to focus on providing the best product at the best cost.\nSavanthi Syth: And Jonathan, just a follow-up on that. So I'm guessing then the increment came on the American side because I think that's where -- because United, you're already performing at a high level. Is that fair?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. I would say, for sure, that the bulk of that came on the American side, and you know, American has been very helpful, too. They have given us some focus. Some of their real high quality people have been involved with us that we enjoy interacting with, particularly some of the people on the maintenance side have been incredibly helpful. And so I think that we have seen some very significant improvement there. And again, we continue to do things like our maintenance space in Dallas, which we're really pleased that we now have the maintenance capability, overnight capability in Dallas, for example. I think it will all make really big difference. And I think you're seeing it in those numbers because we're seeing improvement across the board in our operational performance at American, in particular.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen.\nHelane Becker: And Brad, I'll add my welcome back comments to you as well, nice to hear you again. So here's my two questions. One is, we noticed that G&A was higher and I was wondering if you can talk about that or is that just spread salary? And the other question is your -- some thoughts on profitability for the rest of the year, given the higher pilots, more than you were thinking. So two questions with respect to that one. Greater number of pilots than you were thinking and then maintenance moving around a little bit. Obviously, you're heading into the peak, so you would normally want to have your maintenance done before the peak. So how should we think about that? And then finally, maybe I don't know, Jonathan or Mike, you can answer this question, with respect to -- I mean, I know Jonathan you mentioned this cargo potential operation in response to Mike's question about when it would start out, which would be next year, and possibly larger aircraft. What would you do for training these pilots? Like, I assume you would take existing Mesa pilots who are more senior and offer them that opportunity, especially if it's a bigger jet. How should we think about the potential for training costs? And where you would get some time to do that? Sorry, I think that was more than two, but it was all bundled in one.\nJonathan Ornstein: No problem. It's fine Helane. Mike, why don't you go over the G&A issue first?\nMichael Lotz: Yes, I can hit a couple of them, the G&A issues. Brad's employment agreement is confidential. So I can't discuss any of those details. However, I can assure you, it's not the variance in G&A.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Just joking.\nMichael Lotz: So on the G&A, it's just one of the nuances of our SEC reporting and our capacity purchase agreement. So included in our G&A are property taxes on the aircraft and hull and liability insurance. And those two costs combined and it's primarily the property -- increase in property tax rates based on where we fly. That's what's driving the majority of the increase in G&A. And so it will be offset in the pass-through revenue as well. So there's not been a structural cost change on the G&A side. It's really related to those two items, the property taxes and the hull and liability -- passenger liability and hull insurance that's included in those items. As for the -- having the additional pilots, we talked about that. That's just something we think is a good investment. Again, it's going to run $4 million to $5 million more per quarter than we had originally anticipated, where we did some of our earlier modeling. So it's going to be consistent going forward with what it was last quarter. I think this quarter was a little bit lower because we had lower block hours, but that's -- it's not going to come down until probably the fourth quarter. In terms of our maintenance, we will have a big maintenance quarter. We had a big maintenance quarter. Q2 and Q3 will also be for us because that's our June quarter, so April, May and June, but then we'd be doing a lot of maintenance ahead of time to free up the aircraft for the July, August peak summer schedules.  As for cargo and training pilots, we're not close to that yet, but we would -- depending upon which aircraft flight it would be, if it was an aircraft that we don't not operate today, we would outsource that pilot training to FlightSafety or CAE-type company down the road. But it would likely be done by some of our pilots. Some of our senior pilots would upgrade into that aircraft if it was a bigger aircraft, and we would get new hire FOs off the street. And as Jonathan alluded to, that is part of the benefit we see of a cargo operation, whether it's the front end of cargo with turboprops using our existing regional jets, or on the other end, getting bigger jets. Across the board, we look at it as a way to attract pilots and retain them as well. And I think that it should be -- we should note to that, we're talking about a very, very small number to start. I mean, you're talking about a very low utilization out and back trip. And that -- even the size operation that we're contemplating would require probably somewhere around, call it, 20 to 25 pilots. So not a big number. And that's why we continue -- because we think of this growth opportunity plus other growth opportunities that we feel are in hand that we have made this investment in hiring what is now -- we have literally over 100 pilots more than we need in training all the time to be able to accommodate the growth opportunities. As well as to give our partners the opportunity to fly the aircraft more. I mean, both of our partners want to fly aircraft more, and we just keep hiring pilots so that we can do that, because not only do you want to be able to fly the planes more but you want to be able to fly them more and be able to react to irregular operations and all those kinds of situations where having few pilots on the bench can be very helpful. And that's the goal that we're looking to when we spend this money to hire more pilots and what we would need to actually operate the schedule.\nOperator: The last question is from the line of Joseph DeNardi of Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Just to start, Mike, just to make sure on the same page in terms of your expectations around the flight ops expense line. I mean, it's been running 10% higher than maybe you guys had expected. Should we assume 2020 is kind of back in line with expectations? Or is it just higher but not as high as it's been?\nMichael Lotz: Yes. No. I think, by 2020, we'll be back to our previous run rates, maybe a point or two higher. We did put a new pilot contract inquiry if you're looking back at fiscal year '17 or '18. But yes, by 2020 -- again, it's -- if we were to get some additional growth and had to start prehiring for that. Whenever we have growth, like we've had it over the last five years, is that buildup of expenses prior to the aircraft coming online and getting position for them, but if we were to get no growth and just keep the same fleet size by 2020, we would be back.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And then Jonathan, you talked about the United aircraft, obviously. Can you just remind us how many aircrafts are on contract kind of coming up for expiration out of this year or next? And what your expectation would be in terms of, I guess, the contract?\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. I mean, the key is the 700s, so we have 20 700s that start coming out, I believe, in August according to the plan. I think most of you would probably be familiar with airline scheduling and know that as this close in, those are aircraft already scheduled. So again, we have confidence that those planes will remain in the fleet. And I think that those are the ones that -- obviously, I think people are -- have their concerns about. We do have some of 175 contracts that technically come off just because they were five year deals and they get renewals. But again, I think that we've been assured by United that all those -- the Embraers are going to be renewed as well. So we feel very confident about that.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Mike, just in terms of free cash flow for the year, you walked us through the CapEx. It still seems like you guys will generate pretty, pretty strong free cash. What are your priorities in terms of deploying that. Is it kind of just deleveraging?\nMichael Lotz: Yes. I think our primary focus on our cash is to use it for growing the company. We really are out talking to various partners about increasing our business, and if we were to get just say 20 aircraft, you're talking about $50 million to $60 million in down payments that we would have to make and that probably would be the best use of our cash.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. And then Jonathan, just going through the proxy and kind of your compensation and what drives it, it seems like, based on the most recent one, it's a little bit subjective between you and the Board. As you mature as a public company, should we expect that the metrics that drive executive comp will be a little bit more formalized? And what metrics do you think are most relevant in determining kind of your incentive compensation?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. I mean we do reviews all the time. And just -- I mean, it's sort of a joke in the company. I've never been to a compensation committee meeting in my history. I just -- I'm not one that lobbies for pay. And I think that when you look at the most recent one, I mean, a lot of that had to do with the stock that was granted and you know the IPO. Because I wondered, like, where do all my money go, and I realized that it's all paid. Half of it went out in taxes just because the stock is all vested, but we're going to continue...\nMichael Lotz: Jonathan, I can add a little bit to it, also, that when we were private, it was less structured in terms of -- there was little bit more subjectivity to it. But since we've been public and since we've had our last compensation committee meeting with the Board, one of our objectives is to put a little bit more structure into what types of things we would measure and a little bit more structure into what those payouts would look like. And we're obviously looking at companies like SkyWest and how they would do it, and we plan on putting that in place if not during this year, certainly, for next year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions].\nJonathan Ornstein: There's one other point that I forgot to make. I'd like to make that the reason why we are so excited about this concept of 50-seat 700s is, it really opens up the door for 700s at United to be downguaged into 50-seat aircraft, and what that creates is opportunities for more 70-seat aircrafts to replace those 70 seaters that are now going to 50 seats. And we believe that if it wasn't for the constraint of pilots, that literally every 700 could be downguaged into 50 seaters creating more backfill opportunities. And that Mesa is, by far, best position in terms of cost and operation capability to fulfill those requirements. The other thing that it has done, it did sort of opened up the eyes. The whole industry has looked at what other opportunities exist, whether it's taking 76-seat aircraft and putting them into 70-seat configuration; or American, for example, has the opportunity to take a 70 or 76-seat aircraft and convert it into a 65-seat airplane, not a 50-seat, but a 65-seat airplane, which only gets counted as if it was a 50-seat airplane. So this whole downgauge movement has been, I think, for us, could open up a real big opportunity going forward. So we are going to do everything we can if we've given the opportunity to prove that, that thesis works in real life. It's a really big opportunity for Mesa.\nOperator: We don't have questions on queue. [Operator Instructions]. No questions on queue. Speakers, you may continue.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Well, everyone, if there is no further questions, we'd like to thank you for taking time out of I know your busy day to talk to us and hear about Mesa in our earnings for this quarter. We continue to do everything we can to enhance shareholder value, work as hard as we can to provide the best performance for our partners, and again, do everything we can to provide best work environment for our people. So thank you very much. We look forward to talking to you for the next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "MESA", "quarter": 1, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-02-05 16:58:08", "content": "Operator: Welcome, and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. During the discussion, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] this call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. Now I'll turn the meeting over to Mr. Jonathan Ornstein. You may begin.\nJonathan Ornstein: Hi, operator, thank you, and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. As the operator indicated, this is Jonathan Ornstein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. On the call with me today are Mike Lotz, our President and Chief Financial Officer; Brian Gillman, our Executive VP, General Counsel; and Darren Zapfe, our Vice President of Finance. I'd like to ask Brian to read the Safe Harbor statements, please.\nBrian Gillman: Thanks, Jonathan.

In addition, please refer to our press release in the Investors section of the Mesa's website to find additional disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that will be used on today's call.\nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you, Brian. Okay. I'd like to go over sort of the highlights of the quarter, talk to you a little bit about our financial results and some of the things we've able to achieve and those things that we are looking forward to achieving. We are pleased with the financial results. They are certainly, we think, in line with where we thought we'd be and we feel that, more importantly, some of the key operational issues we've been able to move forward quite nicely, in particular in the area of pilot hiring which has been a big challenge for the industry and our reduced attrition resulting from our -- which resulted in our continuing ability to increase block hour production. As a result, block hours were 115,000 for this quarter, a 17.7% increase from the same quarter last year and a 2.2% increase from the prior quarter. We're also providing guidance for next quarter block hours to be 112,105, which although lower than the current quarter, it is about flat when adjusting for the February has only 28 days. Although we don't expect the government shutdown to affect us, we do have a simulator that has been delayed due to a FA sign off. This has been rescheduled for February 12, but again we're not immune to the -- in the event of a shutdown. As you know, we recently announced that we closed on a $91 million debt refinancing at significantly lower rates, one of the key items we had going forward, and we are pleased that this was completed. Also, very importantly, we signed a term sheet subject to final approvals and documentation with GECAS for the purchase of 10 of our CRJ-700 aircraft currently operating at United. Upon completion of the transaction, we have reduced the number of leased aircraft to third parties to 18. And I think it's important to note that we did acquire these 10 aircraft in anticipation for their further use within our fleet. On the United side, to that point, we continue to have very productive discussions with United. I know this has been an ongoing topic for longer than any of us anticipated, but we remain highly confident on the CPA extension on the 20 CRJ-700s, which of course gave us the confidence to buy 10 of those aircraft. Beyond our existing business, we continue to explore potential expansions that includes increased CPA flying and other opportunities previously discussed, including new partnerships and cargo. We believe as a low-cost regional operator, we are well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. On the operational side -- on operational performance, we had a controllable completion factor of 99.5% in the quarter, up nicely from 99.1% in fourth quarter 2018 and for quarter two fiscal '19 to-date, we are at 99.7%, another improvement over the previous quarter. I'm going to let Mike walk through some financial highlights and I'll get back to you on the couple other strategic issues we'd like to discuss with you.\nMike Lotz: Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. So for the fourth quarter -- for the first quarter we reported earnings before taxes of $25 million, this is a significant increase compared to the same quarter last year where we reported earnings before taxes of just $800,000. Additionally, we reported $5.9 million of income tax expense for net income of $19.1 million or $0.55 per share. Also from an income tax perspective, although we reflect income tax expense of $5.9 million for accounting purposes, we will not pay any cash taxes as we still have a significant NOL of approximately $415 million. This is up from previous year's NOL of roughly $300 million. Most of that increase is due to our purchase of leased aircraft last year. We believe, based on our current projections, that we will not be a cash taxpayer until 2024, 2025. Our EBITDA was $58.2 million and EBITDAR was $72.3 million, again these are significant increases from the same quarter last year where EBITDA and EBITDAR were $30.9 million and $49.2 million, respectively. On the revenue side, we've reported contract, where CPA revenue excluding pass through items of $175 million, an increase of 10.4% over the same quarter last year of $154.5 million. Also included in revenue is pass through revenue, which is repay dollar for dollar and has no P&L impact, but for the first quarter, we reported $7.7 million compared to $10.3 million for the same quarter last year. On the expense side, again in order to be well situated to take advantage of potential growth and increased demand for even more block hours from both of our partners. We continue to hire more partners than the associated attrition levels would require. As a result, while new training -- pilot training expense will decline over time, we do not believe that it will decline as rapidly as we had previously anticipated. That being said, we believe this is a strategic investment in our long-term future and we estimate the added expense to be between $4 million and $5 million. Our engine expense for the quarter was only $2.4 million, compared to $17.2 million for the same quarter last year, when we were still in our heavy maintenance cycle. As we have said, our engine expenses, although predictable, can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year as we are on the direct expense method for engine accounting. With Q1 at $2.4 million, our guidance for Q2 is $8.9 million, which will be more in line with our expected run rate going forward. Also, we have retimed our heavy C-check expenses going forward based on our recent Bombardier C-check escalation program and changes to accommodate our partner request. We are looking at C-check expenses to increase roughly $4 million to $5 million for the remainder of the year. Again, similar with the engines, this is a timing issue. I'd like to add that the purchase of the 10 CRJ-700 aircraft will have a positive impact on earnings, similar to the previous lease buyout we did of roughly $4.5 million per year over the next few years. On cash and liquidity, we ended the quarter with $103.6 million in cash. Total debt on the balance sheet for Q1 was $878 million, down $37 million from the $915 million from the previous quarter. During the quarter we did pay $21 million for six engines we purchased. These engines were included in the collateral pool of the new debt financing we recently announced, which allowed the LTV to be significantly reduced and achieve the lower interest rates. We also identified two additional engines at significant discounts, which we will purchase in Q2. Other CapEx for the remainder of fiscal 2019, again we'll have the 10 aircraft for $70 million, the two engines for roughly $10 million and then we're looking for the remainder of the Company roughly $10 million to $12 million primarily in maintenance CapEx. Lastly, on cash, we still have a revolving credit facility of $35 million, which remains available to us and we anticipate both extending and expanding that over the next few months. I'd like to turn it back over to Jonathan now for further information.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes, hi. Thank you, Mike. One of the things I want to emphasize that Mike pointed out was our investment, and truly we view it as investment in pilots. We are currently attributing out generally between 20 pilots and 25 pilots a month. We continue to hire upwards to 50. We believe that there will be future opportunities for us to put those pilots to work and given our success, which I think is probably industry leading, we will continue to hire people above and beyond our current requirements. We have moved -- as lot of people know, we had an issue in the past, taken quite a bit of time to get people through training as a result of lack of sim availability worldwide. That has been alleviated pretty significantly, and to give you an example in our Embraer 175 fleet, where, at one point, the training footprint was over 200 days. I believe that number is now down closer to 75 days and we think we can bring that down even further. But we are making a pretty significant investment and we do that in anticipation of potential opportunities down the road that we would like to be prepared for. I'd also like to take a moment to talk about the 8-K we filed with American. Just to walk through that, about a year ago, American talked about -- us about raising our performance levels. As many of you know, that contract was negotiated initially almost 17 years ago. It's been through some modifications, but the performance levels were certainly far below that, which the industry is currently operating. All the levels were, as I said, significantly below that. We went back to American and said, look, we're willing to sort of, I guess, for lack of better term, put our money where our mouth is, we know we can operate with the best carriers, but we do need some issues addressed that were important to us and they were willing to do that in return for the ability for us to operate at a higher level. For example, some of those issues that were addressed were the number of spares we operated, we increased that by two. Requirement for a certain amount of, what we call, touch time, which is time in the hangar and additional block time and hangar time. And we did that primarily by pulling two aircraft out. There is no obligation for us to put those aircraft into that system, but we did have the ability to do that and we will use those airplanes strategically going forward to maximize performance throughout our system. We traded that increased performance requirements. One of the things that we did was, American made it clear, they didn't quite frankly want our money, they want the performance and felt that as long as we can perform, that'll be great. But we actually got some nice incentives if we were able to perform at the levels that we believe and I can tell you that in the first month that we started tracking the levels, we actually would have earned incentives and passed all of the tests that -- the new tests and the new levels of performance that we needed and that's prior to any changes in the fleet that may give us the opportunity to have a couple more spares available. In return for that, we did give them the right to pull down a few aircraft, six aircraft over time. The first one that could come out would be in September. But again, given where we are operating today, we do not view that as a likelihood. We feel confident that we can move forward very productively with our partners in Dallas. I think a large part of that also had to do with the fact that, as many of you know, we have a contract that expires in a couple of years and I think this is effectively a test for us to see, can we perform at that sort of new industry levels that are out there and do so consistently. We remain confident that we can do that and we feel that this was in fact while something that we did in cooperation with American, we understand their requirements, and we've now dedicated ourselves to meeting or exceeding all of those requirements going forward. I just wanted to also mention that even with the two aircraft out, we have a net addition of block hours year-over-year and that we think that the impact is less than a $1 million, but again, those -- we think that given the guarantees that we now have in the system regarding scheduling and the additional aircraft availability, that will be a trade-off frankly that we would have made regardless. In 2020, we don't believe there -- given the block hour projections and where we'll be, we don't think there'll be any impact at all. So I just thought we'd go through that a little bit and let people know. I think it really gives us an opportunity to show our friends in Dallas with whom we've had a relationship since Mesa's investment back in America West that we can perform like I said at any level given the proper resources. With that, I'd like to open that up for questions. Before I do that, I want to mention one more thing, I apologize. I will be at the Cowen Aerospace Defense Industrial Conference in New York City. I'm actually leaving later today. If anyone would like to talk to me when I'm in New York -- Capri, New York. I think you could call over there and maybe happy to set up a one-on-one appointment. I will also be at the Stifel 2019 Transportation & Logistic Conference in Miami, February 12 and 13, same goes for that, and then at the Raymond James 40th Annual Institutional Investors Conference in Orlando, March 3 through March 6. So if you have any interest in getting together with Mike and I, please feel free to call any of those firms and set up an appointment to see us. We'd like to take one moment at the end. Of course, we'd like to thank all of our employees who truly are just doing an outstanding job every day. I tell them that I believe that we are in a noble industry. We carry literally -- industry, almost 1 billion people a year safely. We've done that for now over a decade and I'm really pleased with the job that our people are doing and the effort they put. They are all working very hard and performing at the highest level and I'd like to thank each and everyone for what they've done. With that, I'd like to open it up for any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. Just a question on the block hour side, if I can get some clarity. I appreciate the kind of 28 days in February. Historically, the 1Q and 2Q have been somewhat similar in block hour production. Is that a function of the fact that you're now at kind of very high level utilization? And then just on that same topic, I was wondering if you could talk about kind of the rest of the year, what level of kind of block hour production we might expect, especially kind of given -- in light of the adjustments with American?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, yes, Mike, I mean you want to go through that.\nMike Lotz: Yes, I don't think there is anything -- I think in previous years, if there was any change in the second quarter with increase which is probably more a function of the fact that we were growing during that period as opposed to being stable where, if we were flat, that quarter generally would have slightly lower block hours because of the number of days in February. And going forward, we are still saying, we're going to be at this 8.7 number even taking the aircraft -- the two aircrafts out. We still think we're going to hit that same level and potentially slightly higher, because American as part of this has asked us to increase some of our block hour productions.\nSavi Syth: Got it. And if I might, I had a quick follow-up on the off-lease purchases. Mike, is that -- are you still thinking maybe a $4.5 million pre-tax benefit and when do you think that might close?\nMike Lotz: Yes, we do think it's about $4.5 million and we think it will close certainly by June. We're trying to get it done sooner than that.\nSavi Syth: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good morning, everyone. Mike, maybe to ask the block hour production question differently. I think on the last call you talked about the 114,000 to 115,000 quarterly run rate. Is that still on the table or should we be thinking about, I mean, a little bit of a haircut to that number in the back half of '19?\nMike Lotz: No, that we shouldn't be thinking of a haircut in the back half.\nAndrew Didora: Okay. I'll keep that sort of going forward after the March quarter. And then just from a flight ops cost perspective, I know you touched upon it in your prepared remarks. It was down year-on-year, it's not as much as we thought. Right now, when you look out, when do you think you can kind of maybe get back to the run rate you had before some of these pilot issues crept in, say, like -- I think it was like 18 or -- 18 plus months ago?\nJonathan Ornstein: Let me tell my overall view and then Mike could maybe fill you on the financial piece. Right now, with the pilots that we have remaining in training and given our current attrition rates, we will end up, if we just didn't hire another pilot right now, in three months we'd be long pilots. But our view is that stockpiling and having additional pilots is a good investment, because we do feel that there are growth opportunities available to us that the biggest issue our partners will have will be, can you stack those aircraft. We see other carriers that garner business only because they have pilots and not necessarily based on the fact that, from a financial perspective, they may be the best decision. So we've decided to spend a little extra money in order to put ourselves in a position where we can talk to United American and say, hey, not only are we properly staffed, which we think today we are, I mean, for example, last month we had a total of three crew cancels out of almost 10,000 flights and that was -- you're going to have people call out sick in an outstation. But we want to be in a position where we're long, so we had initially had anticipated bringing that number down beginning in the year. We continue to leave that number closer to 50 rather than we could be down closer to 20 or less. And I think that we're going to continue to monitor attrition closely. We feel that these opportunities will be there for us. But we can dial that back quickly if in fact we feel things will change. But we do anticipate that even with the opportunities that we see, even with the block hour production that we feel confident we can do, and with the additional hours that we think our partners would like us to fly that the current level of hiring probably would decline. Mike, when do you think we'd probably pull it down again?\nMike Lotz: Probably, maybe in Q3, Q4.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes.\nMike Lotz: Where we initially thought maybe Q1, but we just really want to position ourselves for opportunities and one of the key factors in positioning ourselves is not just to have enough pilots, to have a good cushion to take on additional aircraft and we don't want to -- we want to make sure we were in that position.\nAndrew Didora: That's helpful, guys. And then just lastly on the model, like G&A did step up pretty meaningfully sequentially, a couple of million dollars and close to 20%. Is the $12 million you reported in the most recent quarter now a good run rate versus I think there was the $10 million you had in the September quarter?\nMike Lotz: Yes, this should not have been -- there should have been no significant increase for this quarter that would have driven G&A to a higher level on a run rate basis. So I wouldn't use this quarter as the run rate, but we can go back and look and see what was the driver this quarter to reinforce that.\nAndrew Didora: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. You may now ask your question.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes. Hey, good morning, Jonathan, thanks for the conference plug. Can you just kind of provide some updated thoughts? I know you mentioned it briefly in your prepared remarks just on the United contract. Like why you think it's taking so long to get it done and can you just connect the dots on your decision to buy the aircraft and how that relates to the confidence you have in that partnership and in the contract?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. Okay, couple of things. First off, buying the aircraft was a good economic decision regardless. GE and -- we have bought quite a few aircraft off of GE recently. There is some -- it makes a lot of sense for us, particularly if we think that those aircraft will stay deployed with us rather than let the leases expire. We feel confident that those aircraft will be continued to be deployed and as such, we're willing to make the purchase price and buy the aircraft off of the leases. The 700s in particular, it's interesting how that aircraft has evolved. At one point, it was sort of a little bit of an odd duck being almost 76 seats. But now that aircraft has proven to be really multipurpose, in terms of its flexibility, it has great performance. It can perform in any environment in terms of hot and high, and I think that we are seeing prices on those aircraft actually go up over the last year and it's a dual class aircraft. So we think it's a really good airplane, it's below the scope in a lot of carriers. We think that there is really some opportunities with that aircraft going forward. And again, I think you can connect the dots. Obviously, we remain highly confident in terms of our United contract and relationship or I would say it's probably fair to say we probably would not have purchased those aircraft. So we think that the aircraft has a lot of life left in it. There's a lot of opportunity for it. As I said, they're becoming more scarce. There is only slightly over 200 built and we are in fact out looking for additional aircraft. So, there's a lot of reasons to buy the aircraft, just the economics of purchase them of lease and in addition to our confidence that the aircraft will have homes at one of our partners. So I think that's sort of where we are in terms of that. And going forward, again the economics on those aircraft keep getting better for us. As you know, we are in a position where a lot of our debt is getting paid down to very low levels. We can either pay them off or extend them out at significantly lower cost and that again gives us just increased flexibility. And I've mentioned too that, we also have that flexibility on the 900 fleet, as we go forward, as the debt level on those -- that hopefully continue to decline rather precipitously as we reach the end of the debt cycle. Does that -- I hope that helps gives a little more clarity into our view on the 700s.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes, it does. I mean, do you have any kind of thoughts or insight into timing on when the United contract could get resolved or not really because it's not --\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes, well, United had a lot of things to work on lately, not the least of which has been the ExpressJet deal, which took longer than anticipated and they started -- are in a position where even as a big company, they have only so many resources to do this, working with people at United who we've known forever, people we've known since Continental age. Mike and I working back at Continental in the '90's, the fellow that runs the United Express operation was a close friend of ours from back in 1995. So maybe part of the issue is, we know they have a lot to do. We feel confident, so we don't maybe pressure them -- other carriers might get something done, because again we feel confident that we may be at the end of the line, but we're in line and the right thing will happen when it does. So particularly, also given that Scott Kirby is over there now, also is a close friend of Mesa's. Again, we feel confident that the aircraft will find a home and we think that there will be future opportunities with United if we can continue to do the job that we've been able to do and continue to keep our costs in line where they've been. Again, we believe we're the lowest cost operator and that's not such a bad place to be when you're looking at additional business.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, that's helpful. And then, Mike, you mentioned the added expense for the kind of investing in your pilots and maintaining a bench there $4 million to $5 million, not really a small number for you guys. So what sort of growth in aircraft do you consider in order to justify making that investment? I mean, I think in the prior plan that you guys have, you didn't really assume any aircraft growth through 2020, it was pretty flat. So has something changed that kind of gives you guys more confidence that you can pick up additional aircraft or is that always kind of upside to the plan?\nJonathan Ornstein: The only thing is that we have seen business go to other carriers given the fact that they can make the statement, a true statement that they have significantly more pilots than they currently need to operate. We want to be in that same position. We're not doing it, though, just to totally speculate. Obviously, we believe that there are opportunities that are potentially available to us that we'd like to be prepared for and be able to take advantage of. So, yes, there's been a change in that. We think that there could be some opportunities and that we want to be prepared to take advantage of those. And we're willing to make, what -- it's somewhat of a bet, but remember we're always going to have attrition. So, even if we are completely wrong, if we over-buy, call it, a 100 pilots, which would be enough pilots to stack 10 aircraft, I think that we would look at it like, OK, we made a bet, but we could burn that number off in four or five months. And so that -- it's not the initial expense, which like Mike talked to is $4 million or $5 million. Again, in a funny way it's sort of like timing because if in fact we find out we're wrong and for some reason some of the opportunities we feel do not come to fruition, we have pilots that we can then, for example, slowdown training or maybe stop training for some period of time because of that staffing. And I also mentioned too that -- we've talked about United. But I also think that we've had the opportunity to effectively reset with American, and I think there could be additional opportunities with American particularly just in terms of flying even more hours as their confidence grows that we have the staffing and we're working very closely with the folks there. They've been very helpful over the last 90 days, helping us to achieve these goals, and we continue to work closely with them. It is in fact our longest relationship and one that we value and one that we're going to do everything we can to see that not only does our fleet continue to operate them, but maybe there'll be some potential opportunity down the road once we've demonstrated our ability to do the things that they've asked us to do going forward.\nMike Lotz: Yes. And just add to that, in addition to just potential growth is also potential additional block hours that our partners continue to come to us. We want to be in a position to be able to say, yes, we can take on whatever block hours you're able to schedule us at and those additional pilots will give us that flexibility as well.\nJonathan Ornstein: The other thing I want to mention too, which I think is important, given our cost structure and given the fact that these aircraft we think will be highly flexible given that, for example, in our CRJ-900 fleet, there is a point in time, not too distant future where we will own 49 out of the 64 aircraft outright. The cost structure on an aircraft that's owned outright is pretty low and as a result, we think that there are other opportunities with maybe sort of non-traditional, non-op carriers to provide service potentially in a different configuration where we could be extremely cost effective in the low yield environment. So we are looking at all kinds of options. We think it's very exciting that we've even had those kind of conversations and we think that when we put pencil to paper and look at the numbers, we feel really good about where the cost structure will be on the aircraft as we go forward. We've also, I think, been one of the first carriers to sort of figure out the engine riddle. We only did it, mother is -- necessity is the mother of invention. We were the first carrier out of the shoot on the CRJ-900s. We were -- had to deal with significant engine issue. We've been able to work our way through it. We've sort of figured it out where we need to be going forward. And as Mike discussed, a lot of our CapEx is purchasing basically every engine that we come across, whether it's new or used and we think that also bodes well for the future that we're buying these engines that are brand new on five-year paper, we will own the engine outright in five years, have no expense, and that aircraft engine can fly for another seven or eight years before it needs the big significant LLP overall and again we've already paid for it.\nMike Lotz: We will have our large people own the aircraft.\nJonathan Ornstein: Right. And along with the aircraft that we will own outright. So we're looking forward, we feel that there's a lot of good things in the industry for us. Clearly, the best thing that could happen would be a relief of the scope. But as most of you know, scope is a difficult issue, understandably, but we have high level of confidence that over time even with the existing scope language, there will be opportunities for us to grow both with our partners and with potentially new partners.\nJoseph DeNardi: That's helpful, Jonathan. Thank you for the thorough response. Just lastly from me and then I'll get back in the queue. You mentioned kind of the need to improve performance with American and that this is kind of a test run. What metrics can we monitor to assess how you're doing relative to that?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, the major metrics that all folks are looking at, right, are things like controllable completion factor, departures within zero, things like that. You can see that we've put a lot of effort in that already going from 99.1%, 99.5% to 99.7%. But there's no doubt and I think American made a very good argument that the performance levels that were in the contracts that were over a decade old have just changed. I mean, to give you an example a 99.1% completion rate back when we signed this contract would have put us into incentive. I mean it was a -- it'd be a great completion rate. Now 99.1% is sort of not barely acceptable and the performance levels at both American and United have just been raised significantly and we just need to perform at that level if we're going to be competitive. Costs are obviously important, but no one is going to buy you because you're the lowest cost if you can't operate at the levels that they expect in today's environment. So we have a obviously two-pronged attack. One, it's been on the performance side to show American that we're able to do that and I think, like I said, if you look back on the last 30 days, as we started monitoring this, we were above all those -- all their requirements, and in fact at this new incentive level and at United we continue -- we are blessed with a new fleet of E-Jets, which helps a lot. And also, United's scheduling policies that allow us to do maintenance in our hubs, which really has helped us in -- our performance levels there have been historically have been good.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is now open.\nHelane Becker: And thanks very much, operator. Hi, guys. Thank you for the time. Just two questions. Jonathan, the first one is, with the change in the CPA agreement with American, is that impactful at all to profits?\nJonathan Ornstein: Mike, do you want to --\nMike Lotz: Is what?\nJonathan Ornstein: The change in the CPA with American, how is that going to impact profitability?\nMike Lotz: Yes, Jonathan touched on it little bit earlier. But in addition to the two aircraft that are being removed, American has also indicated their desire to increase the block hours on the remaining aircraft. So for this year -- for fiscal '19, we expect that to have a minimal impact on our profitability, less than $1 million and in fact, when we look into 2020 at the projected block hour production at American, it's actually higher than what we had looked at a few months ago and that's with two less aircrafts. So again next year will be no impact.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then just to clarify, is that two spares in or four spares?\nMike Lotz: Yes, well, it's actually just the CPA has 64 aircraft and we're going to remove two aircraft in the CPA to go from 64 to 62. And those two aircraft that come out of the CPA, they'll be available to us anywhere in the system we want to use them, whether it's at American, United, whatever our initial plan is certainly to use them to support the American operation.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then just on that -- final question on American, promise. Is it their problem or your problem, because I feel like they had really poor operational performance last summer for sure and they're trying to figure out what's going on there, and I know they don't do a very good job in the mornings of getting the first flight out of the gate on time. So I'm just wondering how much is really your issue versus their issue or is it all their issue?\nJonathan Ornstein: American had to integrate two big operations. If you look at their numbers actually, over time, I think they've done a incredibly good job in terms of integrating those operations and their performance. Remember, they're operating in some difficult hubs. JFK is not the easiest hub, Chicago is not a easy hub, and even Dallas can be impacted by weather pretty significantly. So I think that it was much more an issue of us in terms of just meeting the appropriate resources in terms of, for example, being able to do maintenance in the hub, which we recently were granted. We just opened up our hangar there in October in Dallas, that was very important, having the adequate touch time. But on the other side too, I mean, I don't want make it appear that -- we also had to do some things internally and make some changes just because frankly the performance levels have changed since that contract was signed over a decade ago. So, no, I don't think it's American at all. I think that in fact their involvement with us and the people we speak to, we find to be -- have been incredibly helpful, incredibly knowledgeable, and very constructive and productive for us. So as much as I'd like to be able to do that, I would tell you that, no, I don't think so. I think the biggest issue that we had, which we were -- we had consultants come in a year ago and look at it, our fleet is getting a little bit older. We are the first operator of CRJ-900s and the argument that we made was, look, we really like to do that, but we look at our newer aircraft that we operate, both at American newer 900s and also obviously the ERJs, the E-Jet, they perform at a higher level. It's not dissimilar to American's operation of MD-80s. They're not the same as a brand new 737 MAX. I mean, it's just not the same aircraft and so that was why we felt we just needed some additional touch time in maintenance and the opportunity to have a few more spares available to us. I think with those things and sort of coming to grips with the reality of the situation and there are things that we did too. I mean, I don't want to make it appear like we did not make some changes, we most certainly did. But I think that -- no, I -- the answer to your question is, our future is in our hands, we just need to do the right thing. Our partner American in fact have been very helpful. And it's a long relationship, all the people who were there, making those decisions are people we've known for a long time, from Doug Parker on down and I think that this whole process has been in fact very productive and we've set the table nicely for the future for both companies.\nHelane Becker: Okay, great. And then my last question is just, can these aircraft be used in Europe if there are opportunities there? And do you think there are maybe some opportunities in that market?\nJonathan Ornstein: The fact of the matter is, there are lots of -- there are a fair number of regional jets put in Europe. Europe is a little bit different just because -- smaller and the aircraft need a little bit longer legs than for example the big turboprops that are there, but we have looked at European opportunities, one of the areas that we have taken a look at and we do think that there could potentially be opportunities there in terms of potential on the CRJ's, particularly given where their cost will be as these aircraft, the debt gets paid off. So the answer to your question is, yes, we think there are definitely opportunities in Europe and we've begun to take a look at that.\nHelane Becker: Great.\nJonathan Ornstein: Mike and I operated over there for almost half a decade with Virgin Express and so we're familiar with the environment.\nHelane Becker: Great. Thanks, Jonathan and Mike, and thanks for your support of our conference and we'll see you tomorrow.\nJonathan Ornstein: Great. Thanks. Look forward to seeing you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James. You may now ask your question.\nSavi Syth: Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Just a high-level question, Jonathan. The share performance has been a bit disappointing, partly due to I think markets and not necessarily anything in your control. But I was just kind curious what your thoughts are that investors need to hear that is really going to build back that confidence and what you think is really going to boost the shares?\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. I think it's a number of issues. One, while our numbers have been good, I mean, clearly the uncertainty around the extension on the 700s has been problematic. I know that talking to investors, some people were spooked a little bit by the ExpressJet announcement. We were not concerned to the extent that other parties might have been. And I think that we need to get that resolved and hopefully, again, I know we have some degrees now like a broken record, but we feel confident that we will get that done and hopefully in the near future. I think that the other issue, which clearly is an issue and it's sort of the elephant in the room, we do have 25 million shares that get unlocked. I believe that occurs tomorrow. While the stock price is down, it's still a lot of the initial -- the shareholders that own the stock from the days that we were basically private, a lot of them bought the stock at very low prices and so there could be some pressure there. And I think that's a concern. We had hoped that the stock price is a little bit higher, we could have done something on a more organized basis with them. Everyone seemed anxious to work toward constructively to do that, but at this point, I think we just have to sit back and just continue to deliver on the numbers and over time work our way through it. But I do think that between the United deal being delayed beyond what we anticipated for sure and the fact that there is that overhang are the two biggest issues that are probably going to affect our stock price going forward. Again, that's just my own thoughts and speculation. But I think that once we work through that, we do feel that our numbers are pretty decent and we can continue to perform at levels where the stock can offer an interesting opportunity. I'll also say that one of the areas that we have discussed, we have not taken any action, but it was brought up the at the last Board meeting is that, if we feel that the valuation of the Company remains at below what we think the true value is, in spite of the fact that we just recently raised money at about $12 a share, if in fact, for example, if there is any kind of increased pressure due to the lockup release, we would contemplate some type of buyback arrangement to further support what we feel is the long-term value in the Company.\nSavi Syth: Very helpful. Thank you, Jonathan.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kevin Starke from Owl Creek Asset Management. You may now ask your question.\nKevin Starke: Hey. Further to the last question, has the Board given any thought of simply paying a dividend?\nJonathan Ornstein: I think that we just sort of began the analysis. There's a lot of mixed feelings regarding stock buybacks. I saw there was a big article I think in the New York Times today about its impact. But sometimes I think that the stock buyback is probably the best dividend that you can offer. But again there is nothing that we wouldn't consider, but I think, again, we also have to be judicious. We do think that there are real opportunities out there and if we were to make acquisition of additional aircraft, for example, given that our appetite is only toward purchase, that would require a fairly significant amount of cash to make down-payments on new aircraft, for example. So at this point in time, we are just sort of contemplating various ideas and -- but again we think that we'd let this play out a little bit further and see where we were and see if we in fact can put together the United deal, which again we are highly confident we will, where that leads us.\nKevin Starke: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. You may now ask your question.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes, thanks. Mike, just given some of the moving pieces here with the American contract amendment, the financing, and I guess the investments you guys are making in the pilots, what's kind of the net effect of all these different moving pieces relative to earnings? Is it neutral or kind of positive?\nMike Lotz: Yes, it's probably neutral to slightly in the less than neutral. I mean, we have $5 million in pilot costs. I mentioned the C-checks for $4 million or $5 million. The engine seems to be coming in below where we had initially projected, the GECAS buyout will have a positive benefit again if we don't get it done until June, then it'll only have a few months impact to this fiscal year. So it's neutral to slightly below that.\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes, and I think it's -- I think to add further to that question, it really is dependent upon how -- every time we acquire a pilot, we estimate the expense to be about $100,000. So between bonus and training and not productive online right away, I mean that's a big acquisition cost. We're not going to do that for very long if we don't think there is some place that we're going to put these folks to work. So again we can shut that down very quickly and burn off any excess. So that is probably the biggest teeter-totter in our go-forward plan in terms of expenses. But again, it's sort of like purchasing engines. I view them more as an investment than an expense and I think particularly on the pilot side, given the current environment, I think the strategy that we've chosen to extend out the number of pilots we are hiring, because, we totally anticipated having 15 people in a class, 15 to 20 a month and we -- like I said, I think in January, we had 62, right, because again we think there are opportunities out there and we want to be prepared to be able to look our partners right in the eye and say, we've got the pilots, no problem.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Yes, that makes sense. And maybe just going back to Savi's question here. The market is valuing the stock as if there is pretty significant risk that you can retain the United work, let alone kind of grow the business. You sound confident that you can keep the United contract and grow the fleet. So, should that be the expectation that 12 months from now or 18 months from now, the number of aircraft you have under contract is greater than it is now?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, I would say this, when I say that there are opportunities, those opportunities exist throughout the industry, not just in particular to any one carrier. I think that the opportunity to extend the existing 700s, again, we remain confident that we can achieve that. And also, I think it's fair to say that we wouldn't be making a bet like we have with pilots. We didn't think there are other opportunities with our partners or with potentially new partners that we want to be prepared for. So our view is, we feel little bit more positive going forward that those opportunities exist and if we make a $5 million or $10 million bet, for the potential of a long-term contract or partnership with another carrier, we think that that's a sound bet given our current financial situation and where we stand within the industry.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. And just lastly, Jonathan, with the lockup expiring, can you just, I guess, provide us with your philosophy on how much stock you and some of the other named executives should own going forward?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes, I mean, look, my view is that -- I mean, just my personal view is, I would -- you can lock me up for sometime at this point because I don't have any interest in selling at $9 a share and I actually have spoken to a number of the large shareholders, who probably share that view that the Company's valuation is below what they anticipated or believe that it should be. That's not to say that if you have a basis of $100, you might want to sell or sell some and some of the hedge funds that had purchased the stock, they have a limited lifespan. So we're just cognizant of that and just preparing ourselves that if we did see some opportunities long-term to make some strategic buyback, for example, that we would obviously consider that and look to do that potentially. As someone pointed out, at this current earnings level we're trading, I read in -- I didn't even know, but I mean I read in a report this morning that we're trading little over 4 times earnings. I mean, obviously that's by industry standards pretty low and we just have to look to be cognizant of that. That being said, if we're right on the other piece that there may be some growth opportunities that require us to go out and acquire aircraft, I think that that may be a better investment for us to buy new aircraft that go into a long-term contract that can be very profitable for us going forward.\nJoseph DeNardi: It's very helpful. Thank you for the time.\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, we don't have any questions over the phone. One moment please for anymore questions.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. If there aren't any more questions, again, I'd like to thank everyone. I know that the investment community is little anxious as are we. We remain confident that our business plan is the right one. We think that the structure that we've put in place at Mesa is a good one. We have some really I think excellent strategic options available to a fleet that is now or close to being owned. You look at our workforce, we have a very flexible workforce. Almost half of our employees have less than two years' seniority, which will give us, we believe, a significant cost advantage for quite some time going forward. Our labor contracts are -- we signed a year ago our relationship with labor, I think, has been the key to our success frankly. We've never had a moment of dissent with our unionized workforce. In fact it's quite the opposite, we always look for them to help us and be supportive as we are of them. And we just feel that going forward, all those things come together to make for the ability for us to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. So with that, again, I'd like to thank all of you for taking the time. We continue to work very hard. Mike and I and Brian are all significant shareholders too and we'd like to see better performance as we go forward as well. So thank you all. We look forward to talking to you on our next call or at one of the conferences we discussed. Have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining.

All materials distributed by the Company prior to this call and all materials discussed during this call will be covered herein. Thank you.\nJonathan Ornstein: Hi, everybody. This is our second quarter reporting as a public company. We are pleased with both our financial results and the success we\u2019ve achieved in pilot hiring and reduced attrition, resulting in our ability to increase block hour production. Our Career Path Program, which allows our pilots to move to United has been very helpful. I would like to thank United for their support. We\u2019re also pleased with the increase in pilots completing training and the more efficient pilot training timeline primarily results from the increased simulator availability. With low attrition and increased training production, we\u2019ve actually reduced our class size in November, reflecting the fact that we believe we have an adequate number of pilots in training coming forward. With applicant pool, we believe we are very well positioned as opportunities present themselves. As a result, block hours were 112,475 for fourth quarter fiscal \u201818, a 9.3% increase from third quarter and almost 15% over the second quarter. I will note, this is all done with the same fleet of 144 aircraft. The 112,475 is the highest block hour production we\u2019ve achieved with the current fleet. Our forecast for quarter one is a slight increase of 2% at 114,650, which is where we had previously anticipated to be steady state without additional growth. That being said, both United and American have requested us to further increase block hour production beyond what we have previously anticipated. Based on our improved pilot staffing capability, we are focused on meeting their targets, which we believe are achievable given sufficient lead time. Given our existing network, route structure and stage length, we are uncertain, however, as to how much additional production is possible. Beyond our existing business, we continue to explore potential expansions that include increased CPA flying and other opportunities previously discussed including new partnerships and cargo. We believe as a low cost regional operator, we are well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. For our United CPA update, we continue to have productive discussions with United and remain confident on a CPA extension on the 20 CRJ-700s. Operationally, on operations performance, we have controllable completion factor of 99.1 in the fourth quarter, that was down slightly from 99.4 in Q3, and for Q1 fiscal year \u201819, to-date, we\u2019re at 99.4, a slight increase. Although there\u2019s always room for improvement, we are well above our contractual requirements. That being said, our partner\u2019s expectations in regard to operation performance have increased. We are working hard to meet and exceed those new expectations as well. Mike Lotz will now walk through some of the financial details. \nMike Lotz: Thanks, Jonathan. So, for the fourth quarter, we reported earnings before taxes of $26.6 million, this is a significant increase from our previous quarter where we reported adjusted earnings before taxes of $11.6 million. Additionally, we reported $7.3 million of income tax expense for net income of $19.4 million or $0.65 per share. I\u2019d like to point out that our EPS calculation of $0.65 per share is based on the average weighted shares outstanding for the quarter of 29.7 million. And since our IPO was done mid-quarter, the average weight is much lower than what we had at quarter end, which would be our run rate, which was 34.5 million shares. If we use the quarter end shares of 34.5 million, earnings per share would be $0.56 per share. Also from an income tax perspective, although we reflect income tax expense of $7.3 million for accounting purposes, we will not pay any cash taxes as we still have approximately $415 million in NOLs. We believe based on our current projections that we\u2019ll not be a cash tax payer in 2024 or 2025. Our EBITDA was $59.3 million and EBITDAR was $73.6 million. And again, these are significant increases from our previous quarter where adjusted EBITDA and EBITDAR were $41.7 million and $59.7 million, respectively. For revenue, we reported contract revenue or CPA revenue of $168.4 million, an increase of 5% versus the last quarter at $159.9. We also included revenue pass-through revenue, this is pass-through directly to our partners and reimbursed, it has no P&L impact. And for the fourth quarter, we reported $9.1 million, down from $11.8 million last quarter, all related to the timing of these pass-through maintenance expenses. On the expense side, our flight operations, we continue to see higher than normal expense as a result of elevated number of pilots and training, the increased training timeline and pilot incentive pay. While we are certainly seeing a reduction versus prior quarter, our expenses are still higher than our normalized rates. With the increased number of pilots coming out of training, we expect to see continued reduced cost in flight operations expense relative to our block hours. Our engine expense was only $2.5 million for the quarter, down $6 million from Q3. Again, this is a predictable expense, which varies significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. On guidance and forecast, similar to last quarter, we\u2019re providing guidance on next quarter, Q1 \u201819 block hours and engine expense. As Jonathan has mentioned, our block hour forecast for Q1 is 114,650. I\u2019d like add our forecast for non-engine -- non-pass-through engine expense is $8.5 million. In cash and liquidity, we ended the year at $123.2 million in cash; total debt for Q4 \u201818 was $915 million, down $62 million from Q3. During the quarter we did pay down a full outstanding balance of $25.6 million of our revolving credit facility with CIT, reducing our interest expense by about $1.2 million per year. The revolving credit facility of $35 million is still available. And in fact, we are in negotiations with CIT to extend the term of that facility at more favorable rates. We\u2019re also finalizing negotiations to refinance our higher cost debt, primarily associated with spare engines purchase -- spare engine purchases, and we expect to close that by the end of this calendar year. This is expected to result in further reductions of interest expense going forward. And I believe that\u2019s in the range of $4 million to $5 million per year. Recently, we also purchased 6 engines, which were in our plan for $29.2 million, we paid cash for these engines and we expect -- we will be including those in our refinance package. Also going forward, we expect to close on the purchase of 10 aircraft currently on lease for approximately $70 million. This will have a positive impact on earnings, similar to the previous lease buyout we did of about $4.5 million per year, over the next two years. It will require roughly $10 million in cash and have $60 million in debt. And again, we expect this to be completed by Q2 fiscal \u201819 or about March of \u201819. Other CapEx for fiscal \u201819 in addition to the 10 aircraft and 6 engine purchases, we\u2019re looking at roughly $12 million to $14 million in maintenance related CapEx. I\u2019d now like to turn it back over to Jonathan, and open up to questions and answers.\nJonathan Ornstein: Hi, everybody. If you have any questions, we\u2019d be happy to take them to the best we can to answer them.\nOperator: Participants over the phone, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Raymond James. You have an open line.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you and good morning. Just on the -- follow-up to your comments on the United contract. I know there\u2019s a little bit of anxiety on getting that secret out from the investor side. Could you kind of talk about your confidence there? And maybe if United were to not extend that, at what point you would need to know, just to handle the kind of logistics of returning those aircraft?\nJonathan Ornstein: Yes. Hi. I can certainly appreciate the consternation that maybe out there regarding the fact that this is taking longer than we anticipated. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are remaining highly confident that these will be extended. And the only thing at this point in my mind that\u2019s delaying things is that we are looking -- we are talking to United about other potential transactions that might be tied to this. And we\u2019re waiting to see how all those pieces could potentially fit together. So, in terms of just the 20 700s, I remain very confident. Again, we\u2019re hoping to potentially build on that transaction that may lead to yet other transactions at this point.\nUnidentified Analyst: And just on the pilot recovery, Mike, that you mentioned. Any additional thoughts on how that cost might trend down over the next year or two, based on the latest position [ph] to your pilot training class?\nMike Lotz: It\u2019s come down the last two quarters. And look, with the reduced size of the class in November, and again, as we start getting most of these pilots out of the training combined with our reduction in the amount of premium pay, that will have to be paying to the pilots. We\u2019re expecting like again get back to that normal run rate, which I think is 4%, 5% below where we are today as a percentage of ours CPA revenue, probably over the next 2 to 3 quarters.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Helane Becker. You have an open line.\nHelane Becker: Yes. Thanks very much, operator. Hi, guys. Thank you so much for the time. So, just a couple of questions, Jonathan and Mike. As you kind of think about December quarter and then March quarter, how should we think about your ability to grow block hours without actually adding additional aircraft? I mean, you were able to grow pretty significantly in the September quarter, and then so, how should we think about it for December and March?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, let me say, this is something obviously we think about and talk to our partners. We have Midcontinent hubs, which have some level of restriction in terms of additional capacity, in other words, growth of block hours, just because stage lengths. Our stage length in Dallas has declined almost 100 miles over the last couple years. I know that at United we\u2019re looking at potentially restructuring the route network a little bit to pump-up additional utilization. We have the crews at this point. In fact, as I mentioned that we actually -- normally we\u2019re having 50 to 60 pilots in our new hire classes; we\u2019ve reduced that to 36 in November, because we\u2019ve had a lot of success getting people through training. And we don\u2019t mind to being overstaffed. We don\u2019t want to be carrying 200 extra pilots. But, I think the real issue is just being able to come up with schedules that can be flown, that can allow us great utilization. Like I said, for example, what\u2019s happened in Dallas, a lot of the -- as American took Embraer 175s, they moved those into the longer haul routes and the CRJ-900 to shorter haul routes so that our average block time went down about 20 to 24 minutes of flight. So, that\u2019s going to hurt utilization, because you have to still return the aircraft and you still take that hour on the ground to turn it. So, I think they\u2019re going to be creative. I know you\u2019re United is talking about maybe flying the aircraft on somewhat different routings, that would give us longer haul and be able to pump up utilization. Again, it\u2019s really just a function at this point of how much flying we can do based on the schedule. We don\u2019t think that we have any real restrictions, particularly as we get further out. I know that -- I heard and Mike, maybe you can confirm. Is it March going to be the highest summer block hours we\u2019ve ever flown under the American system?\nMike Lotz: Yes, it will be. \nJonathan Ornstein: So, we are setting new records. And the biggest thing we need is just some lead time. If we have lead time and we need to do something, we can do it. we just need that lead time, because as you know, it now takes -- it used to be about 60-70 days to get pilots through training, it\u2019s not probably closer to 100. The failure rates among new hire pilots continue to be significantly above what they have done in the past.\nMike Lotz: And Helane, this is Mike, just on closing -- for the December and the March quarter, the December quarter is two months into it already. So, again, our forecast that we put here is 114,650. So, I mean that\u2019s not going to change obviously at this point. And even the March quarter, where we\u2019ve got schedules filed with our partners for almost through March already. And so, we should be about the same level, maybe a 1,000, 1,500 hours higher.\nHelane Becker: Okay. Does that allow for like weather in March?\nMike Lotz: Yes.\nHelane Becker: Okay. And then the other question I have, and I probably should know this and I apologize that I don\u2019t. But, as you think about American and the opportunities that you talked about, right, I mean, Dallas, they talk about that\u2019s a big opportunity with adding all these gates and a lot of -- 15 gates and a lot of that\u2019s going to regional flying. And then, they\u2019re talking about when the new airport opens at TCA, that\u2019s going to allow for a larger regional jets? I mean, have you -- is there -- are there more opportunities for you? I imagine Dallas maybe more so than TCA, but are they both opportunities?\nJonathan Ornstein: Well, I think to the extent that American has to fly more, they will continue to look at different options that they have. I think it\u2019s fair to say that American has continued to move aircraft into their wholly owned regionals, and we\u2019re cognizant of that. And I think for us in order to do that, we have to continue to operate at the highest possible level at the lowest possible costs. And I think if we can do that, then maybe those opportunities would exist. But, it\u2019s a little different situation at the United, who is using all outside operators. We feel in that environment, we are the most competitive carrier by pretty good margin.\nHelane Becker: Okay, great. All right. Thanks, guys. I appreciate your time.\nMike Lotz: Thank you. Helane. \nJonathan Ornstein: Thank you.\nOperator: As of this time, we don\u2019t have any questions on the queue. [Operator Instructions] We have a question coming from Bert Zubeen [ph]. Your line is open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Just wondering, if you could talk to sort of the rationale behind the acquisition of these 10 aircraft, sort of maybe anything around the timing and why you decided to do this now?\nMike Lotz: Sure. So, we did -- this is similar to what we\u2019ve done in the June quarter where we purchased 9 aircraft off of lease. And given the financing market, interest rates that are available to us, the fact that we would we would much prefer to own these aircraft as opposed to leasing. The fact that we avoid any lease return conditions and costs that we would have to pay, the economics of owning the aircraft and the depreciation and interest that gets charged to the P&L as compared to the full lease rate, all those economics play into pretty easy to see decision to go forward and buy out these aircraft from lease. So, from a timing standpoint, we expect to get it done, I\u2019m saying by March of 2019, I think, it would probably more likely to be done in the January or February timeframe.\nUnidentified Analyst: And just maybe one more question. Just wondering if slowing ULCC capacity growth is having any near-term impact on regional contracts to market or if it\u2019s really just a matter of scope still? \nJonathan Ornstein: No. I think, it\u2019s really has to do with scope. I mean, the fact of the matter is, the ULCCs and the majors, the interaction is really on the larger capacity routes, not so much our routes. We\u2019re flying to the cities that most of these ULCC don\u2019t go just because traffic is smaller. So, I don\u2019t see a real correlation there, at least from my perspective. The issue on the ULCCs is to what degree how they continue to expand. And there has been some, I\u2019ve heard and we\u2019ve been contacted by a couple of the ULCCs looking to say, they might want to expand their regional flying and get into the regional business. So, I mean that would change things, the dynamic certainly. But at this point, I don\u2019t see any anything -- any direct correlation.\nOperator: Our next question will come from [indiscernible]. Your line is open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Just curious, Jonathan, do you have any kind of updated thoughts on the cargo opportunity. And given all that\u2019s up in the air on the kind of the regular CPA side, if you still have the same level of appetite or any additional color on that?\nJonathan Ornstein: Sure. We continue to have conversations, both with small aircraft operators and larger aircraft. The smaller aircraft operators, we feel like we could move forward on a couple transactions. Obviously we -- at this point, just as we have so much going on, on the financing side and with our partners, we basically put those on hold temporarily. When I say temporarily, we\u2019re talking maybe 60 to 90 days, and it\u2019s also a very busy time of year for them as well. So, everybody felt that we should just maybe take a step back for a minute. On the larger aircraft. The lead time on that is 18 to 24 months. And so, on that process, we\u2019ve already begun to enter that process and start to put work together. So, we still have a very significant interest on the larger jet aircraft opportunity and in fact have started that process in terms of putting together the required RFP. I wanted to mention to go back to -- about the additional utilization. And just to point out that, you just -- you have a situation where stage length really plays a major role in terms of utilization. And Mesa stage length for example on the American side is 532 miles, that compares to the other carriers that are some -- two of them are over 600, one is actually over 650. And frankly to pick up 8% or 9% greater utilization is pretty easy to do when you have that additional [long haul flying]. So, we\u2019re going to be talking at a number of different ways that we can improve utilization; and sometimes somewhat better mix of flying will help us do that. You can basically often times fly more utilization, but if you have fewer departures and longer hauls, you can actually do with less pilots. So, those are the all things that we\u2019re going to be exploring, because obviously we\u2019d like to put as many hours as we possibly can on the aircraft and be as good partners as possible. And just a question of how they get put into the mix. And I think that again -- we\u2019ve been working cooperatively with our partners to do that. Certainly those things that we need to do and we\u2019re going to do whatever -- what it takes and make sure that we\u2019re providing as much support at the best possible price, at the best possible performance levels. So, there are ways that we can add to those block hours. It\u2019s just going to take work with our partners and certainly work internally here to continue to have adequate numbers, staffing and pilots that we need to make that happen.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Eric Soderlund. [Ph] You have an open line. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. I just wanted to get some clarification on some of the numbers. I think, Mike was the one kind of laying them out, in terms of new savings. The debt pay down, I believe you said $1.2 million, and then you had spare engine refi $4 million to $5 million, and then the lease buyout of $4.5 million. I just want to confirm, so we\u2019re basically talking about over $10 million of savings, and then you have an addition -- you have the normalized pilot kind of helping you as well as utilization. But I just want to confirm those three numbers, is that right?\nMike Lotz: Yes. Those are right.\nUnidentified Analyst: And these are kind of new numbers that you\u2019re kind of throwing out at us?\nMike Lotz: Well, they\u2019re new in terms of -- we\u2019ve spoken about all of these, certainly in the S-1 and even in our previous quarter. So, they certainly are not new in terms of things we haven\u2019t discussed before. But again, the current numbers don\u2019t -- actuals today don\u2019t reflect those type of savings.\nOperator: As of this time, speakers, we don\u2019t have any questions on the queue. [Operator Instructions] Speakers as of this time, we don\u2019t have any questions on the queue. You may proceed.\nJonathan Ornstein: Okay. Thank you very much operating and thank you very much to everyone for joining us. I\u2019d like to wrap up and say I\u2019m very pleased with the results for the quarter. It was nice to see us meet or exceed our targets in terms of financial performance. I will tell you there continue to always be challenges in this business, it is a tough business. The requirements from our partners continue to move higher, contracts that were signed 10 years ago had performance levels in it, but now, folks look back, and those -- all that has shifted. A completion rate of 99% back in the day was -- considered a great month and now it\u2019s considered bad month. So, we just have to continue to work hard to move that up and do the best we can. And again, it\u2019s just one of those things where you just have to have the continuous improvement process and always be working and making sure that you\u2019re doing the best job possible. We\u2019re very thankful for the cooperation that we\u2019ve gotten from our people. They have really worked hard to meet all these new expectations. And I\u2019d like to thank all the vendors that we work with, the folks that all around the system that have done a great job helping us really turn Mesa around and become what we think is the low cost and leading regional airline in the country right now. So, again, thank you very much. We should have some more news out shortly in terms of personnel and hopefully some new business and all the kinds of things that people like to see from us. But right now, we\u2019re just sort of sticking to our knitting and putting our operation where it needs to be and continue to do the right thing by our partners. So, thank you very much, and have a great week.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."}]
